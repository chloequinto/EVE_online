21	english	 	 MERGING INVENTION WITH REVERSE ENGINEERING	When Phoebe is deployed, Reverse Engineering will no longer exist as a separate activity, with Ancient Relics now falling under the purview of invention.	Experimental Laboratories and Caldari Outposts will still be the only places where Ancient Relics can be invented	As mentioned in the last Dev Blog, the invention formula is going to be tweaked to compensate for the merge. However, we have changed its values since then to account for player feedback regarding science field and invention skills not having enough repercussions in the success output.	The new invention formula thus is:	Where Racial Encryption Method is Amarr, Caldari, Gallente and Minmatar Encryption Methods for regular invention, and Sleeper Encryption Methods for Ancient Relics.	Meta items will no longer have an effect for Invention jobs	In addition, base invention chance for all items is going to be modified to compensate for the formula tweaks above:	All modules, rigs , ammo and all intact Ancient Relics: from 40% to 34%	All Frigates, Destroyers and all malfunctioning Ancient Relics: from 35% to 30%	Cruisers, Battlecruisers, Mining Barges, Industrials: from 30% to 26%	All Battleships and all wrecked Ancient Relics: from 25% to 22%
