The Rattlesnake Victory Edition has some technical issues with the underlying model, but once those are sorted it will be converted to a SKIN.	The Capsule - Genolution 'Auroral' 197-variant is currently created from an implant (Genolution 'Auroral' AU-79) in a very specific and roundabout way. This will be removed in the future in favor of standardizing it with the rest of the ships as a capsule SKIN.
