37	english	 	 THE END PART	That’s what I have for you for now. Even though there is so much more to do (hello bombers, supers, ECM and missiles!), we believe ship and module balance in EVE is in one of the best positions we’ve seen in a long time. We hope to keep improving based on these great guiding principles that my colleague and dance partner, CCP Fozzie, outlined some time ago:	We rebalance to improve the variety of ships and modules that are viable for our players to both fly and produce.	We rebalance to shake up the combat meta and give smart players opportunities to show off their abilities by becoming the first to find new powerful tactics.	We rebalance to keep different tactics and systems in check and prevent overpowered mechanics from ruining enjoyment for everyone.	Thanks for reading, see you in space o/	@CCP_Rise
