SCIENTIFIC EVE COMMUNITY!
We are here to tell you about the next milestone for Project Discovery which is arriving on the test server Singularity. Those of you who‘ve followed news about this feature may have seen our presentations on it at EVE Fanfest and EVE Vegas last year. If you haven‘t but are interested in the design philosophy behind it, we recommend you watch them.
