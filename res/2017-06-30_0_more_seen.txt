CAN I TRY OUT PHASE TWO NOW?
You sure can! Phase two of Project Discovery is currently in testing on Singularity, the EVE Online public test server.

You can find more about testing phase two in this forum thread, and you can find out more about how to connect to Singularity for public testing here!

As always, we welcome your comments, suggestions and feedback. Feel free to chat in the comments thread for this dev blog and let us know what you think!
