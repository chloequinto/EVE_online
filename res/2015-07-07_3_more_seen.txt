ALLIANCE VULNERABILITY TIMER SETTINGS
As many of you already know, the ability to set your Alliance default vulnerability timer has been available in game since the Carnyx release on June 2nd. So far this setting has only pre-loaded the value in the database in preparation for the next Sov release, but on July 14th it will begin applying to all Sovereignty structures belonging to your alliance. This means it is very important for every sov-holding alliance to choose an appropriate vulnerability timer before the 14th to ensure that their structures match their alliance’s primary time zone.

The setting can be found on Tranquility right now within the Corporation window, Alliances tab, and Home subtab. Characters with director roles in the Alliance executor corporation can edit the vulnerability timer by clicking on the cogwheel on the right. The image below displays where this setting can be accessed.



Sovereignty structures belonging to Alliances that have not chosen a default vulnerability timer will have their vulnerability windows automatically centered on 11:00 EVE Time (downtime).
