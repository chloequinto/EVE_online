CREST DOCUMENTATION
If you would like to work with the CREST fittings you will need to understand how our SSO works along with the CREST fittings resource.

The SSO documentation can be found here: //eveonline-third-party-documentation.readthedocs.org/en/latest/sso/intro/

While the CREST documentation isn't perfect, we have started trying to gather the documentation here: //eveonline-third-party-documentation.readthedocs.org/en/latest/crest/characters_fittings/

The documentation is hosted on a GitHub repo and we encourage everyone to help contribute to it.

Conclusion
This has been a fairly long time coming but it is finally here and already we are seeing amazing things created with it. A huge thank you to all of the third-party developers out there creating these awesome applications. We cannot wait to see what you do next.
