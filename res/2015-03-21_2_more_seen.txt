7.     MANAGEMENT
Proper management is a priority as well, and we have given some thought on improving corporation assets and how to interact with them.

Players with sufficient roles would no longer need to travel to individual structures to configure them
Preset configuration profiles could be applied to multiple structures at once
Various assets would show proper states, location and conditions at first glance
Roles could be applied in a mail recipient fashion, where the manager only has to type names of players or groups he wishes to configure instead of scrolling through a raw table of entries.
