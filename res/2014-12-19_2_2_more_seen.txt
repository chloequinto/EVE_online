THE PROTEUS THEME
Proteus comes with more music from EVE composer CCP RealX. In fact it’s already available right here. The EVE Online SoundCloud page also has dozens of release themes, EVE trailer music, sound effects, CCP dev rap music, and the rest of EVE’s soundtrack. All free to stream and download.

A few more things may make it into the release, keep an eye out for the Patch Notes in January for the full set of changes. Events will also continue to unfold in New Eden, so do pay attention to game news and events.

For those of you waiting for the Minmatar Tactical Destroyer, I can report that Honorary Fleet Architect Lotrec Emetin is seeing the last details come into place and the ship is scheduled for the Tiamat release on February 17th.
