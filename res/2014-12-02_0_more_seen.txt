... BUT DEATH IS JUST THE BEGINNING
These medical clone changes are just the beginning of a larger project revolving around clones and their purpose in EVE. While we are still in the early stages of design, the Rhea changes are our first step towards the future possibilities of clones. We will maintain the meaningful nature of death and we are going to give you ways to interact with that death which will affect the whole EVE universe.

Addendum
As some people have been asking, clone grade purchases made before Rhea cannot be reimbursed.
