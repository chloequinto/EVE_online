PHASE ONE
The first phase involves a major clean up. We are going to remove the giant EVE Gate header and move most of the EVE Gate links, such as the link to your EVE Gate Profile, to a new drop-down menu in the navigation bar. The new drop-down menu will also display all of your characters, where you can easily switch character without having to go to EVE Gate.

The new drop-down menu. 

The quick search has been moved to its own drop-down menu. 

All forum related settings have been moved from EVE Gate to a single settings page on the forums. 

The signature editor has also changed, it's now using Markdown editor which gives you more control to format the signature with live preview.
