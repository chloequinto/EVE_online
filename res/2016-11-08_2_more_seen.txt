WHAT ABOUT XML API AND CREST?
This is the part where you don't panic. We're not here to announce that we're killing all your applications and you need to rewrite things immediately, but we do need to talk about sanity and fragmentation. Supporting three API's with similar but non-overlapping functionality increases the technical difficulty of making an EVE API enabled application, and it pulls the engineering time of Tech Co away from features and towards maintenance. It reduces agility and increases uncertainty, and it's not a good long term plan.

Once we replicate all current CREST and XML API functionality in ESI, we will be shutting down both services. We are targeting 18 months from the release of this blog to achieve functional equivalence and work with application developers to upgrade their applications. Removing the need to use the XML API will be our first priority. We will be monitoring use of the XML API and CREST to both identify and assist third party developers in their migration efforts.

This is going to be an orderly and measured winding down of operations. As the first step of that, developers should know that as of the release of this blog, CREST and the XML API are officially in maintenance only mode. We will continue to deploy security updates and critical bug fixes to them, but any new feature requests will be implemented in the ESI API.
