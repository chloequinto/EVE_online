THE OLD ANSWER
In the past we determined pixel color using a formula named the “Phong Reflection Model,” which was so popular that it was built into the hardware of the first generation 3D-acceleration cards. Phong was part of the hard-wired pre-shader implementation known as the Fixed Function Pipeline. Have a look and guess why:







This model, despite being from 1973, still produces very good results. Countless games and movies have been made with it, including EVE Online.
