WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THE OLD SYSTEM?
In short, the old system is going to be removed when we are happy with the new implementation, but we are committed to this being as soon as possible.

For the initial release we will keep the “old” system in place and replace the current system with a “brand new” system that’s the default for all new players.

Thanks for reading and we look forward to seeing your feedback once we get this in your hands.

Go forth and explore or hunt or both,
