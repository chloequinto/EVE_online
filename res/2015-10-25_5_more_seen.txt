GOALS
Before we started looking at details, we wanted to firmly fix the goal of the design for capitals

Provide interactive, meaningful, gameplay.
Obtaining and mastering capital ships, as well as fighting and destroying them, should be a compelling aspirational goal for players.
Capital ships are the premier weapon for killing structures.
Capital ships should be effective in most combat situations without completely dominating the battlefield and without invalidating other ship types.
