MODULES AFFECTED THIS ROUND
There will be 10 modules types affected this round, which fall in to 4 basic types: Harvest Equipment, Hull Upgrades, Propulsion Upgrades, and Engineering Equipment.

Harvest Equipment
Mining Lasers

Mining Lasers have had the number of modules reduced significantly. In addition, some ease-of-use balancing has been done, for instance on the mining laser range, to make them easier and more intuitive to use for newer players.

Name	Meta	Powergrid Usage	CPU Usage	Activation Cost (GJ)	Optimal Range (km)	Duration (s)	Mining Amount (m3)
Civilian Miner	0	2	65	20	10	60	30
Miner I	0	2	60	20	10	60	40
EP-S Gaussian Scoped Mining Laser	1	3	65	20	16	60	50
Particle Bore Compact Mining Laser	1	2	55	20	11	60	50
Miner II	5	4	80	70	12	60	60
Single Diode Basic Mining Laser	6	2	45	10	11	60	25
ORE Miner	8	4	80	70	16	60	65
Gallente Mining Laser	8	3	60	10	10	60	45
Mining Laser Upgrades

Mining Laser Upgrades (MLU) for both ore and ice have received the same treatment. Lower tier MLUs have been consolidated into one type. The two higher tier modules have been given storyline status to illustrate their rarity and strength, and given a 1% boost to their mining bonus. Drop rates and locations for the storyline modules have not changed.

MLUs - Ore

Name	Meta	Powergrid Usage	CPU Usage	CPU Penalty (%)	Mining Amount Bonus (%)
Mining Laser Upgrade I	0	1	30	10	5
Elara Restrained Mining Laser Upgrade	1	1	35	8	8
Mining Laser Upgrade II	5	1	40	12.5	9
'Carpo' Mining Laser Upgrade	6	1	35	6	9
'Aoede' Mining Laser Upgrade	6	1	40	8	10
MLUs - Ice

Name	Meta	Powergrid Usage	CPU Usage	CPU Penalty (%)	Cycle Time Bonus (%)
Ice Harvester Upgrade I	0	1	30	10	-5
Frigoris Restrained Ice Harvester Upgrade	1	1	35	8	-8
Ice Harvester Upgrade II	5	1	40	12.5	-9
'Anguis' Ice Harvester Upgrade	6	1	35	6	-9
'Ingenii' Ice Harvester Upgrade	6	1	40	8	-10
Hull Upgrades

Expanded Cargoholds

All Meta 0 Expanded Cargoholds (Alpha Hull Mod, Marked Modified SS, Partial Hull Conversion, Type-E Altered SS) will be consolidated into the 'Basic' Expanded Cargohold. Given the 'Basic' Expanded Cargohold has a lower Cargo Capacity bonus than all other Meta 0 Cargoholds (with the exception of the Marked Modified SS) of 17.5%, it is advised that you do not have a full cargohold with these modules fitted while in space on Proteus’ release.

In addition to the module tiericide, a new faction module has been added to the Expanded Cargohold lineup. This module will be available from the ORE LP store and/or as a drop.

Name	Meta	Structure Hitpoint Bonus (%)	Cargo Capacity Bonus (%)	Velocity Modifier (%)
Civilian Expanded Cargohold	0	-30	10	-20
Expanded Cargohold I	0	-25	17.50	-15
Type-D Restrained Expanded Cargo	1	-15	22.50	-13
Expanded Cargohold II	5	-20	27.50	-10
'Basic' Expanded Cargohold	6	-10	17.50	-20
Limited Expanded 'Archiver' Cargo I	6	-15	27.50	-10
ORE Expanded Cargohold	8	-20	29.00	-10
Nanofiber Internal Structures

In addition to the module tiericide, 'Basic' Nanofiber Internal Structures will be losing the Hull Upgrades I requirement. This keeps them in line with other 'Basic' modules by having low overall power, with low fitting and skill requirements.

Name	Meta	Skill Requirements	Structure Hitpoint Bonus (%)	Velocity Modifier (%)	Inertia Modifier (%)
Nanofiber Internal Structure I	0	Mechanics I Hull Upgrades I	-15	7.75	-13
Type-D Restrained Nanofiber Structure	1	Mechanics I Hull Upgrades I	-10	8.50	-14.5
Nanofiber Internal Structure II	5	Mechanics I Hull Upgrades II	-20	9.50	-15.75
'Basic' Nanofiber Internal Structure	6	Mechanics I	-5	5.25	-10.25
Synthetic Hull Conversion Nanofiber Structure	8	Mechanics I Hull Upgrades I	-10	8.75	-15.5
Domination Nanofiber Structure	8	Mechanics I Hull Upgrades I	-15	9.50	-16
Republic Fleet Nanofiber Structure	8	Mechanics I Hull Upgrades I	-15	9.50	-16
Reinforced Bulkheads

The most significant changes to Reinforced Bulkhead balance will be the slight increase in the Inertial Modifier. This penalty will be increasing slightly in order to add more significance to the stat and allow for greater variance. All modules still fall between the 1% and 5% Inertial Modifier increase. Reinforced Bulkheads II gain the largest penalty from this, keeping with the theme of Tech II modules having the most power outside of faction and storyline modules, but with the largest drawbacks. In addition to the rebalancing, two new faction modules have been added to the Reinforced Bulkhead lineup. These module will be available from their appropriate LP Store and/or as drops.

Name	Meta	Powergrid Usage	CPU Usage	Structure Hitpoint Bonus (%)	Cargo Capacity Bonus (%)	Inertia Modifier (%)
Reinforced Bulkheads I	0	1	35	15	-10	3
Mark I Compact Reinforced Bulkheads	1	1	25	18	-7	3
Type-D Restrained Reinforced Bulkheads	1	1	35	18	-5	1
Reinforced Bulkheads II	5	1	40	25	-11	5
'Basic' Reinforced Bulkheads	6	1	15	10	-5	1
Synthetic Hull Conversion Reinforced Bulkheads	6	1	20	20	-5	3
ORE Reinforced Bulkheads	8	1	35	27	-6	4
Syndicate Reinforced Bulkheads	8	1	35	27	-10	2
Propulsion Upgrades
Inertial Stabilizers

In addition to the module tiericide, two new faction modules have been added to the Inertial Stabilizers lineup. These module will be available from their appropriate LP Store and/or as drops.

Name	Meta	Signature Radius Bonus (%)	Inertia Modifier (%)

We will be taking feedback into account for all modules and there may be some further changes between now and the release of Proteus based on this feedback. As always, we hope you’ve enjoyed running through these changes with us, and we look forward to hearing what you have to say in the comments.
