WHAT ARE THESE TITAN EFFECT GENERATORS AND PULSE ACTIVATED NEXUS INVULNERABILITY CORES?
These are some special new modules that share a few gameplay similarities with the Command Bursts.

Effect Generators are the replacement for the old passive bonuses from Titans. Titans will be able to fit these new modules (one per race) that warp the fabric of reality across a very large area of effect. Unlike Command Bursts, Effect Generators impact ALL ships within their defined area (friend or foe).

Effect Generators will have both beneficial and harmful effects that shape the battlefield and force fleets to change their tactics. In a lot of ways, they are similar to Wormhole effects localized in a specific area. We are still preparing some details and we’ll be going into more details about these modules in a later blog. To help give you an idea of what kind of effects these modules might provide, here’s some example prototypes we are working on:

Amarr Effect Generator: +Capacitor, -Speed, -EM Resistances, +Kinetic Resistances
Minmatar Effect Generator: -Signature Radius, -Turret Optimal Range, -Explosive Resistances, +Thermal Resistances
The Pulse Activated Nexus Invulnerability Core is a new module that represents one of the many optional tools available to Rorqual pilots after the November Rorqual changes. This module can be used to make yourself and your industrial allies invulnerable for a limited time if needed for any reason.


This is just one of the many enhancements that the Rorqual will be getting in November and we’ll be going into more detail about it in the upcoming dev blog.
