TRIAL ACCOUNT UPGRADE IMPROVEMENTS
Messaging around limitations on trial accounts and the path to subscription are being improved in Phoebe. A number of limitations for trial accounts are also being removed, such as the ability to fly battleships and participate in incursions and factional warfare. More information in an upcoming dev blog.

That’s it for now, hope to have you all join us on the stream from EVE Vegas, and please bring us your feedback on the forums.
