THE BASICS
The Organic Mass Granulator is designed as the big brother counterpart to the Mobile Tractor Unit, a deployable loved by capsuleers across the cluster for making the collection of loot significantly faster.

However, after listening to the community for a number of years, we’ve come to realize that all that glitters is not gold. After a major engagement, there are far more valuable things in space to collect than salvage and modules.

We’re talking about these:

With the introduction of the Organic Mass Granulator, for the first time capsuleers will be able to recoup the cost of their cloning contracts, along with the cloning contracts of those unfortunate enough to be located on the business end of their weapons.

After a battle, you’ll be able to deploy an Organic Mass Granulator on the battlefield alongside your Regular Mobile Tractor Unit, and it will tractor in and collect all the unfortunate souls who were unlucky enough to be pod killed during the melee.

In addition to this, we realize that biomass collection can be quite the hobby for some capsuleers. If you already have a significant collection of unfortunate pilots, you can simply deploy an Organic Mass Granulator in space, jettison your collection on grid with it, and it will collect old biomass in the same manner as the fresh stuff (so long as they’re within 100km of the unit).
