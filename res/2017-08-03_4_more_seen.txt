IMPROVED UI FEEDBACK FOR STRUCTURE DEPLOYMENT
EVE Online’s August release will also include the next improvement to the UI for structure deployment. Earlier this year we had feedback pass along to us through the CSM that more and more players were encountering issues with determining the direction of the undock points on structures when choosing their location and orientation during deployment. We included the idea of adding undock direction indicators in our Upwell structure feedback survey and it received quite a bit of support from the participants in the survey.

So, starting this month the hologram projection of each structure that is used for choosing orientation and location during deployment will include some of the traffic path lights that connect to the undock points of the structure. These clearly show which side of the structure players will undock from so that players can avoid mistakes during deployment.
