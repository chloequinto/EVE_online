MODULE NAMING
We’ve looked at the feedback from the renaming we did in the first module pass, and we agree we may have gone too far in stripping out the lore and history from modules. However, we still value the information given by the new module names, and as such we will be creating a hybrid naming structure incorporating the two.

Each name will now consist of three parts: flavour name type name

For example, the Type-D Altered SS Overdrive Injector and other meta 1-4 Overdrive Injectors will be combined and renamed the Type-D Restrained Overdrive Injector. This keeps some of the flavor name, while adding in the specialization name informing you of its focus.

In addition, All flavor names will be consistent if paired with a specialization name meaning all Type-D modules will be Restrained. This adds further consistency to the naming system and prevents knowledge of one naming section from conflicting with another.

These changes will be retroactively applied to modules which have gone through the tiericide process in the past to keep everything consistent.
