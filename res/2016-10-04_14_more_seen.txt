THE INDUSTRIAL CORE MODULE

(Click image for a larger, animated version)

The Industrial Core module will continue to be the most important unique module for the Rorqual, and in November it is gaining powerful new bonuses in addition to those it already possesses.

The Industrial Core deploys the Rorqual into a temporarily immobile mining support platform and magnifies all three of the mining foreman pillars.

In addition to the new bonuses provided by the industrial core, a new Tech 2 version of the core will be added in November, bringing it up to par with the similar Siege and Triage modules.

The stats and bonuses of these modules are:

Industrial Core I:
Requires Industrial Reconfiguration skill level 1
Duration: 5 minutes
Consumption: 1000 units of Heavy Water
Enables Ore and Ice Compression
Movement Effects:

-100% Rorqual velocity
+900% Rorqual mass
Prevents warping, docking, jumping, cloaking, tethering
Assistance and Electronic warfare:

100% remote repair impedance (prevents other ships from repairing the Rorqual)
80% remote assistance impedance (reduces the effect of remote assistance modules like remote sensor boosters)
75% sensor dampener resistance
Full ECM immunity
+100% Scan resolution
Mining Foreman Burst Bonuses:

+25% Mining foreman burst strength
+150% Command burst range
Tanking and Remote Repair Bonuses:

+120% Local shield booster repair amount
-60% Local shield booster duration
-75% Remote shield booster duration and cap use
+100% Remote shield booster optimal and falloff range
Drone Damage and Mining Bonuses:

+80% Drone damage and hitpoints
+25% Drone MWD speed
+400% Drone mining yield
-75% Drone ice harvesting duration
Industrial Core II:
Requires Industrial Reconfiguration skill level 5
Duration: 5 minutes
Consumption: 1500 units of Heavy Water
Enables Ore and Ice Compression
Movement Effects:

-100% Rorqual velocity
+900% Rorqual mass
Prevents warping, docking, jumping, cloaking, tethering
Assistance and Electronic warfare:

100% remote repair impedance (prevents other ships from repairing the Rorqual)
80% remote assistance impedance (reduces the effect of remote assistance modules like remote sensor boosters)
80% sensor dampener resistance
Full ECM immunity
+120% Scan resolution
Mining Foreman Burst Bonuses:

+30% Mining foreman burst strength
+200% Command burst range
Tanking and Remote Repair Bonuses:

+140% Local shield booster repair amount
-60% Local shield booster duration
-75% Remote shield booster duration and cap use
+120% Remote shield booster optimal and falloff range
Drone Damage and Mining Bonuses:

+100% Drone damage and hitpoints
+30% Drone MWD speed
+500% Drone mining yield
-80% Drone ice harvesting duration
As you can see, the Industrial Core is now gaining a huge number of bonuses covering all three mining foreman pillars. It is receiving local tanking bonuses even more powerful than triage modules, and remote repair bonuses that are second only to triage. It is gaining ECM immunity and increased lock speed to help it support its allies. It is also gaining massive bonuses to drones that turn it into a combat powerhouse and a mining operation all on its own when used alongside Excavator Drones.

We expect that individual Rorqual pilots will make decisions about when to use their Industrial Core modules based on the danger in their local environment and the amount of support they can receive from allies. Due to the massive benefits of the Industrial Core on one hand and the increased risk of locking yourself in place for 5 minutes on the other, there won’t be one universal “right answer” for when the Industrial Core should be used.
