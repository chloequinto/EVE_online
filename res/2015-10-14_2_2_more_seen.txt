NETWORK UPGRADE
At this stage, we have talked a lot about fast servers with a ton of fast storage. But something needs to connect that all together and then to the place with all the funny cat pictures (the Internet). Otherwise EVE Online is not so much... online.

Over to our Network Team for more info.

At the network edge, our trusty Cisco 7606 routers have served us well since 2009. We peer with over 20 providers and get full BGP tables from five of them, making for a total of over two million path attribute entries that get compiled into the half-million global BGP best-path route table on each edge router. These venerable beasts of the routing world have been handling all of that without breaking a sweat.

Still, technology has moved forward in leaps and bounds during the last six years, and it's time to retire those old routers and replace them with a new generation. In order to best serve you, the glorious pilots of New Eden, we are once again investing in the best and the greatest. TQ deserves nothing less!

The new boxes are a whole order of magnitude more powerful, offering throughput of 120Gbps and more than double the memory, allowing us to peer with more providers. The extra RAM also allows them to keep pre-calculated backup BGP routes in memory for every active route, so that a failed path may be switched to a secondary path in a matter of few milliseconds. That means that if a directly-connected provider fails, most players routed via that provider get switched to a new provider without being disconnected. The new routers will allow us to provide better connectivity while opening a whole new universe of possibilities with their new features, doing so with expanded memory and processing power.

Other fundamental part of TQ’s current edge network are Cisco ACE 30 load-balancers. As quirky as those boxes have been to configure, they have a special place on our technology-loving hearts here at CCP as they have allowed us to rapidly deploy major changes to TQ and have proved to be rock-solid.

However, a couple of years ago Cisco pulled out of the load-balancing market and left the ACE as a moribund platform dying a slow death. Since then we have been testing different platforms and are excited to have found a great replacement that brings improved performance as well as a whole new bag of tricks.

In performance terms alone, with New TQ we are increasing throughput from 16Gbps to 30Gbps and maximum concurrent connections from 4 million to 24 million. The new load-balancers have gotten all of us, not only in OPS but also in EVE Development, rubbing our hands with glee like a capsuleer who just got their hands on their first Titan.
