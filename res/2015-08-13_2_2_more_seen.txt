VISIBILITY
Just like for capture and protection mechanics, we also want this feature to have proper visualization in the game.

As such:

A notification will be sent for each destroyed structure the player (or corporation) had items in.
A notification will be sent if the player was podded for being in a structure that has been destroyed.
A proper tab will be added to personal / corporation asset window when items are impounded and available for delivery.
Impounded items can also be displayed on the Star Map under the “my asset” filter.
