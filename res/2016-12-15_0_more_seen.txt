THE SIEGE OF M-0EE8
The final timer for the Keepstar saw the assembled attackers once again assail the Keepstar, though this time, it seems that the defending force had surrendered the field, choosing to instead evacuate what they could and leave the Keepstar to draw as much blood as it could in its final hours. With the attackers using battleship fleets en masse, and additional pilots from all over New Eden flying in to try and leave a mark on the kill report of the first battle-ready Keepstar, the system saw a staggering peak concurrent pilot count of 5337. This new record bested the previous record of 4920 set in Nisuwa on 2014-09-05 during an event to kill a rare Revenant-class Supercarrier. A total of 4078 pilots were registered on the kill report, a copy of which can be seen here.


The Keepstar itself finally fell just before midnight at 23:49 UTC, with pilot Vlulvik Hrapruk claiming the final blow. The defenders didn’t walk away empty handed though, as they successfully ambushed an incoming fleet in the solar system of Obe on the star gate to Hakonen in addition to racking up close to 250 billion ISK in damage with the Keepstar during the campaign.
