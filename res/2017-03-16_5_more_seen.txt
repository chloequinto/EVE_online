THE PLEX VAULT
We also want PLEX to be easier to find and understand. To make it easier for players to find out what PLEX is and what it can do, we are introducing the PLEX Vault. The Vault is an inventory location, shared across all characters on an account, that stores PLEX and shows common actions you can take with it, as well as how you can get it.

Like any other inventory location, the Vault will appear in the list of locations to the left and you can drag PLEX in and out of the Vault to any other inventory you have access to. PLEX is the only item that can be kept in the Vault. When you purchase PLEX from CCP, it will go straight to your PLEX Vault instead of the Redeem queue.

It will look something like this (work in progress):



The PLEX Vault will allow you to move PLEX safely throughout the universe rather than having to move it in a ship. It will still be possible to carry it in a ship like any other item if you want, so if you have an urge to fill a shuttle full of PLEX and tour low sec just drag PLEX out of the vault and into your cargo and you’re good to go.

We know how much you love it when ships blow up with piles of PLEX inside, we even might understand why, but, we also don’t want new PLEX users to be losing their PLEX before they can trade it because they didn’t know how to get to market safely.
