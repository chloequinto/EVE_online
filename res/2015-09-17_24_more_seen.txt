FINAL WORDS
We do hope this new attack system will fulfill player needs more closely than the last version, while bringing more interesting fights and interactions around the new structures. Keep in mind this is still subject to change based on relevant feedback.

Our next blog will deal on how to build those new structures and which consequences this will have for your average industrialist or market trader out there.

Until then, may the odds be in your favor.
