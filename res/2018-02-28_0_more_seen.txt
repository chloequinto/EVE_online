WILL RETIRED SKINS EVER RETURN TO THE STORE?
While most SKINs will be gone for good once they have been retired, we will look for opportunities to bring back popular and thematic SKINs for limited sales in future.

So that’s everything for now, and we hope these changes will improve your store experience. We want to thank you for making it this far through the blog by offering a small reveal: To celebrate 15 years of EVE Online, we have some special sale events planned, so stay tuned for further updates and thanks to each of you for 15 great years!

If you'd like to discuss this dev blog, you can do so over on the EVE Online forums in the comments thread.

Fly safe & enjoy some retail therapy!
