“ENOUGH WITH THE PREAMBLE, GET TO THE NEW SYSTEM!”
All right, let’s start discussing what we’ve been working on.

We’ll cover five key design features of the new system, then introduce some of the new work-in-progress UI elements and end with a walkthrough of a hypothetical battle over a star system to demonstrate how the elements all come together.

A new Entosis Link mechanic will replace structure shooting in all parts of the Sovereignty system
Each Sovereignty structure will be able to operate independently from other Sov structures
Alliances will each designate a “prime time” that determines the timezone of their structure vulnerability and reinforcement exits across every Sovereignty structure they own
When Sovereignty structures exit their reinforcement period, a new capture event will begin that consists of fighting over Command Nodes spread randomly across the constellation
Stations will enter a new Freeport Mode if their owners lose the first reinforcement timer
Occupancy defense bonuses will make structures in an active system harder to capture
