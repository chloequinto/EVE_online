EMAIL VERIFICATION
With the release of EVE Online: Ascension, all EVE Online accounts now need to be attached to a valid and verified email address for account security purposes.

When creating a new account, pilots are guided through steps to verify their email address as part of the process of creating their account and downloading the EVE Online client. Similarly, if a pilot returns to the game and does not have a verified email address attached to their account, as of the deployment of Ascension they will be prompted to verify their email address when they log into the EVE Online launcher before they can continue through into character selection.

Please bear in mind that there are certain combinations of email address that are not considered valid for verification. These include mails with prefixes such as “info@” “admin@” and “mail@” and other generic inboxes, as well as some privately hosted email servers that pilots may have set up themselves.

It is also recommended that pilots add eveonline@service.ccpgames.com to their address book, trusted senders list, or safe contacts list to prevent email delivery issues with some services.

Emails sent to complete email verification will have the subject line “EVE Online Email Verification For USERNAME” so that they can easily be identified.

For more information on verifying email addresses, pilots can take a look at this help center article on e-mail verification and this help center article on creating and validating a new account.

Once an email address has been verified with CCP, the account it is attached to will be able to log in from the location that the email address was verified from without further security challenges in the future, as the location will be marked safe.

Please note that while a pilot can verify one email address with multiple accounts, each account must have the email address verified against it individually.
