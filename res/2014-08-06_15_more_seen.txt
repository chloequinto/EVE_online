**HYPERION APPROACHES**
The main overarching goals of our proposed changes are:

Create some variety and excitement in wormhole mechanics since most haven’t changed in many years
Provide ways for players to engage more fully with the random and mysterious elements of wormhole life and a ease back on attempts to ‘tame’ and control wormhole mechanics
Address some of the imbalance between wormhole environment effects
Address some of the imbalance between wormhole classes
To reach that goal we are proposing the most significant package of improvements to wormhole space since the release of the Apocrypha expansion in 2009.

These changes consist of:

Wormhole effect rebalance
A second static for Class 4 wormholes
More randomly spawning wormholes
Mass-based spawn distance after wormhole jumps
K162 appearance only on first jump
Loosening of bookmark copying restrictions
Ensuring that scan signatures stay consistent over downtime
Taken as a whole, these changes are intended to preserve the best parts of wormhole space and provide a new level of excitement as creative players rush to adapt their tactics.
