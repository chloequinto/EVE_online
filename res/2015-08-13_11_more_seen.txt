VULNERABLE 2 AND 3
This type of vulnerability window does not appear in a regular operation state, and is a reactionary state appearing once the structure has been set into reinforcement at least once.

Those windows automatically appear after the structure comes out of a reinforcement period.
This vulnerability window lasts indefinitely, until an attacker or defender wins the contest by using entosis links (see “entosis link contest” further below).
Except for their duration, they work exactly the same than the vulnerable 1 phase.
