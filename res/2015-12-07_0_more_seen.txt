SO, WHAT ELSE IS ON OFFER?!
Over the course of the holidays we’ll have various offers on PLEX and Aurum, as well as sales in game through the New Eden Store.

You should be sure to check out the offers on PLEX and the additional SKINs available with some of the PLEX packages by heading over to account management.

Please be aware however that these offers are time exclusive, and these SKINs will be available through other means in future if you wish to get hold of them without purchasing PLEX.



There will also be a number of deals on Aurum that include Serpentis skins for the Catalyst and Brutix. You can check out the packages by hitting the Aurum Store.

Please be aware that you can also get hold of these SKINs in-game as part of the loot drops from Operation Frostline.

Finally, for those capsuleers who are on a hiatus from flight, we have a couple of seasonal reactivation offers in the works too, so be sure to pay attention to the news for Operation Frostline reactivation offers over the course of the next few days!



As well as all these offers and events, there’ll be the usual host of Festival Launchers, fireworks, snowballs and festive trinkets appearing in the redeeming systems of all capsuleers over the course of the holidays. Be sure to watch out for news for more information on when these will be added.

If you do need assistance with how to redeem items to your characters, then you can check out this knowledgebase article from our friendly GM Team.

We hope you all have as much fun with both the December release and Operation Frostline as we’ve had putting it together, and from everyone here at CCP Games, we’d like to wish all our capsuleers Happy Holidays and best wishes for 2016!
