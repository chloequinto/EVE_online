UPDATE:
Based on feedback and further tweaking, we've made the following changes to some modules. These changes are listed below, and take precedence over the statistics above.

Capacitor Power Relays

Name	CPU	Shield Boost Bonus (%)	Capacitor Recharge Rate Bonus (%)
Type-D Restrained Capacitor Power Relay	4	-8	22
Mark I Compact Capacitor Power Relay	2	-10	22
Type-D Restrained Capacitor Power Relay – Shield Boost penalty decreased from -10% to -8%
Mark I Compact Capacitor Power Relay – Shield Boost penalty decreased from -8% to -10%
The Shield Boost Bonus error has been fixed. Type-D and Mark I modules had the value reversed.

Expanded Cargoholds

Name	Structure Hitpoint Bonus (%)	Cargo Capacity Bonus (%)	Velocity Modifier (%)
Civilian Expanded Cargohold	-30	10	-20
Expanded Cargohold I	-20	17.50	-15
Type-D Restrained Expanded Cargo	-15	22.50	-13
Expanded Cargohold II	-23	27.50	-18
'Basic' Expanded Cargohold	-5	17.50	-20
Expanded Cargohold I – Structure Hitpoint penalty reduced from -25% to -20%
Expanded Cargohold II – Structure Hitpoint penalty increased from 20% to -23%, Velocity modifier increased from -10% to -18%
These three changes should bring the T1 and T2 Expanded Cargoholds better in line with other module types, with the T2 version of a module giving the best performance but with higher drawbacks than T1.
'Basic' Expanded Cargohold – Structure Hitpoint penalty reduced from -10% to -5%. This should allow players who care more about keeping as much structure hitpoint as possible an attractive option, at the cost of cargo capacity.

Inertial Stabilizers

Inertial Stabilizers are now consistently named Inertial Stabilizers instead of some being Inertia Stabilizers and some Inertial Stabilizers.

Name	Signature Radius Bonus (%)	Inertia Modifier (%)
Type-D Restrained Inertial Stabilizers	8	-18.50
Type-D Restrained Inertial Stabilizers – Signature Radius penalty decreased from 9% to 8%

Mining Laser Upgrades

Mining Laser Upgrades (MLU) for both ore and ice have received the same treatment. Lower tier MLUs have been consolidated into one type. The two higher tier modules have been given storyline status to illustrate their rarity and strength, and given a 1% boost to their mining bonus. Drop rates and locations for the storyline modules have not changed.

Hull Upgrades

Expanded Cargoholds

All Meta 0 Expanded Cargoholds (Alpha Hull Mod, Marked Modified SS, Partial Hull Conversion, Type-E Altered SS) will be consolidated into the 'Basic' Expanded Cargohold. Given the 'Basic' Expanded Cargohold has a lower Cargo Capacity bonus than all other Meta 0 Cargoholds (with the exception of the Marked Modified SS) of 17.5%, it is advised that you do not have a full cargohold with these modules fitted while in space on Proteus’ release.

In addition to the module tiericide, a new faction module has been added to the Expanded Cargohold lineup. This module will be available from the ORE LP store and/or as a drop.

Nanofiber Internal Structures

In addition to the module tiericide, 'Basic' Nanofiber Internal Structures will be losing the Hull Upgrades I requirement. This keeps them in line with other 'Basic' modules by having low overall power, with low fitting and skill requirements.

Reinforced Bulkheads

The most significant changes to Reinforced Bulkhead balance will be the slight increase in the Inertial Modifier. This penalty will be increasing slightly in order to add more significance to the stat and allow for greater variance. All modules still fall between the 1% and 5% Inertial Modifier increase. Reinforced Bulkheads II gain the largest penalty from this, keeping with the theme of Tech II modules having the most power outside of faction and storyline modules, but with the largest drawbacks. In addition to the rebalancing, two new faction modules have been added to the Reinforced Bulkhead lineup. These module will be available from their appropriate LP Store and/or as drops.

We will be taking feedback into account for all modules and there may be some further changes between now and the release of Proteus based on this feedback. As always, we hope you’ve enjoyed running through these changes with us, and we look forward to hearing what you have to say in the comments.
