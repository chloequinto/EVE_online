THE MORDU'S LEGION GARMUR FRIGATE
Mordu's Legion ships are focused on three main themes: exceptional speed and agility, high missile range and damage, and longer warp scrambler/disruptor range. The Garmur frigate will be available in the Mordu's Legion Loyalty Point (LP) Store in the Pure Blind region, but it can also be attained by hunting down rare Mordu's Legion ships in asteroid belts in low security space.

For the full range of ship properties, see this forum thread from CCP Rise. For full details, keep your eyes open for a dev blog coming out soon, showing all the new Mordu's Legion ships in their full glory.
