INTRODUCING REACTION FORMULAS
When a Reaction Service Module is fitted and onlined in a Refinery, it will make the service available in the Industry window. Reactions will use Reaction Formulas, similar to other Industrial activities which use blueprints. These will act the same way as Blueprint Originals (BPOs) in that they have infinite runs but they cannot be researched or copied.

After the Winter release date, Reactions will work like other Industrial activities: X amount of resources, processed alongside a Reaction Formula, provide Y amount of product.

In this new system, Reaction jobs will need to be set up and started like other Industry jobs. Although Reaction Formulas have an infinite number of runs (like BPOs), they will need to be set for a limited amount of runs, based on the Input resources available. As with other Upwell Services, the job will be paused if the Service Module is offlined either through loss of fuel or going into an Armor Reinforced state, but the job will resume when the module is onlined again. Unfitting or destroying the Service Module will cancel all Reaction jobs that are running.
