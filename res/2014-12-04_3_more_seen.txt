WINDOWED MODE

The new map can be made into a window that is completely resizable and retains 100% of the functionality and interactability of the full screen view. All you need to do to take advantage of this is head to the map control panel at the top and click the box icon. You will notice that in addition to the ‘floating’ mode there are also ‘dock right’ and ‘dock left’ modes, both of which will lock the map to either side of your screen while pushing the main scene over to fill the rest of your screen space.


These modes can also be resized and makes it very easy to run the map on a second monitor full time. AMAZING.
