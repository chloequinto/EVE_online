ENTOSIS LINK MODULE MECHANICS
While the basic mechanics and gameplay goals for the Entosis Link were clear in our original dev blog, we were intentionally vague about many details in that document. We then asked the EVE Community to participate in helping us design the ideal Entosis Link details, primarily in the Features and Ideas forum. We received a lot of great feedback in that thread, and together with the EVE community we have put together a much more detailed set of information about the Entosis Link module itself.

So that we’re all on the same page, I’ll spend a little time going over some of the key goals that we are working towards with the Entosis Link module design:

**As much as possible, the Entosis Link capture progress should reflect which group has effective military control of the grid.**
At its core, the Entosis Link mechanic is a way for the server to tell who won (or is winning) a fight in a specific location. The best way to win a structure or command node with the Entosis Link should be to gain effective control of the grid by simultaneously keeping your forces alive and eliminating your opponents. It’s expected that many fights over structures or nodes should go through a potentially extended period where the grid is effectively contested between multiple sides, and where the capture progress remains paused until one side or another has taken critical losses.

This goal would be broken if certain types of forces could somehow just ignore enemies (for instance, through overwhelming remote repair or through evasion) or if mechanics pushed fights towards indefinite deathless stalemates. This goal is the reason for most of the special restrictions and limitations on the Entosis Link, such as the “no remote reps” rule.

**The Entosis Link itself should have the minimum possible effect on what ships and tactics players can choose.**
Entosis Links will always have some effect on the types of ships and tactics people find viable for Sov warfare, but we should strive to keep those effects to a minimum. As much as possible, we should work towards a prevailing metagame where whatever fleet concept would win the fight and control the grid would also be viable for using the Entosis Links. 

This also means that we don't want to be using the Entosis Links to intentionally manipulate ship use. We've seen some people suggesting that we restrict Entosis Links to battleships, command ships or capital ships in order to buff those classes. Using the Entosis Link mechanics to artificially skew the metagame in that way is not something we are interested in doing.

This goal is why we intend to use the lightest touch possible when working towards the first two goals. It would be easy to overreact to potentially unwanted uses of the Entosis Link by placing extremely harsh restrictions on the module, but we believe that by looking at the situation in a calm and measured manner we can find a good balance.

**The restrictions and penalties on the Entosis Link should be as simple and understandable as possible.**
This is a fairly obvious goal but I do think it's worth stating explicitly. If we can achieve similar results with two different sets of restrictions and penalties, we'll generally prefer to use the simpler and more understandable set. This also means that we'd generally prefer to use pre-existing mechanics that players will already be familiar with, rather than using completely new mechanics.

We announced this information in a forum thread in the Features and Ideas section, and we’re reprinting it here for visibility.

The most current design details for the Entosis Link Module are:

High Slot module with a limit of one per ship
Requires a target lock on the structure to have any impact
While the module is active, your ship is unable to cloak, warp, dock, jump or receive remote assistance. There is no way to get rid of the module penalties early except for losing your ship
The first cycle of the module is always a "warmup cycle" and has no impact. If you lose lock or the module is disabled for any reason, you'll need to go through that warmup cycle again before you can continue exerting any influence over the structure
Other than that warmup cycle, the cycle time of the module does not impact how long it takes to capture a structure. Once you're past the warmup cycle all that matters is that your module stays active
Capital ships have a role penalty that increases the module cycle time by 5x
Consumes Strontium Clathrates as fuel for each cycle
The Entosis Link comes in two distinct variations: Tech 1 and Tech 2.

**T1 Entosis Link:**

Requires Infomorph Psychology 1
+250,000kg mass when online
5 Minute Cycle Time
25km range
Fitting requirements: 10 PWG, 1 CPU
Capacitor use: 50 Capacitor per cycle (0.1666 cap/s)
Consumes 1 unit of Strontium Clathrates per cycle
**T2 Entosis Link:**

Requires Infomorph Psychology 4
+1,000,000kg mass when online
2 Minute Cycle Time
250km range
Fitting requirements: 100 PWG, 10 CPU
500 Capacitor per cycle (4.166 cap/s)
Consumes 1 unit of Strontium Clathrates per cycle
