OTHER ORE SHIP CHANGES: OUTER RING EXCAVATIONS HAS BEEN BUSY
In addition to all these new ships, drones, and functionality, ORE has a few other announcements to make for the rest of their ship lines.

As a follow-up from their recent revamp of the Mining Barge and Exhumer lines, ORE is happy to announce that in November the unpackaged volume of Hulks and Covetors will be dropping by 25% to make them easier to haul and store.
The Bowhead ORE Freighter is also receiving some improvements in November:
Slightly improved hitpoints and agility
37.5% reduced mass to match ORE’s commitment to improved wormhole utility
23% more capacity for the Bowhead’s Ship Maintenance Bay
