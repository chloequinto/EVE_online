OTHER CHANGES
Within certain circles, such as the Incursion community, fleet tags are frequently used. A common suggestion has been to have the tags displayed on the target in the target bar, so we will be adding them there. Additionally, we are changing it so now they will be able to untag targets, in case a mistake was made, or tactics have changed since the tagging.

I find the Compare tool pretty useful but to be honest, it can be a bit difficult to find what differs between the items you are comparing because there are so many attributes and many of them have exactly the same values for the compared items.

We are adding an option in the 'Compare tool' that will allow you to filter the Attributes list so it only displays those attributes whose values are not the same for all the items you are comparing. Hopefully it will make it will make it easier for you to drill down to what are the real differences between the items and what are the trade-offs.

Structures have been making their mark in the landscape of New Eden, and it therefore seems appropriate that they get their own tab in the solar systems' 'Show Info' windows, rather than being lumped in with Orbital Bodies, which they technically are not. Please note that just as before, the show info window will only show you those structures you have access too.

Many pilots out there, yours truly included, find it hard to figure out which solar systems they can enter without the Faction police hunting them down. To make that easier, we have now included a tooltip on your security status in the 'Character sheet', informing you in which solar systems you should watch out for the police.

Other changes we have in the March release:
The results from ship scans are now organized by slots
The HQ listed in Show Info windows for corporation will now be a link
A tooltip has been added to the standing icon in the show info window to show what that icon is based on (player to player, player to corp, alliance to corp etc).
The height of the 'Duration' drop down in market orders have been increased, so all entries fit without scrolling
The Salvage option for salvage drones has been moved to the top of the right click menu
Volume information has been added to the 'Material input' and 'Output' tooltips in the Industry window
The right click options that have been categorized as potentially especially destructive will now have a red ! in front of them. Among other things, we hope this helps to make it easier to differentiate between 'Reprocess' and 'Repackage'.
The contents of the 'My Structures' tab in the 'Structure browser' can now be fitered by typing a structure type or region in the filter field.
Shuttles and pods now have 90% reduction to effective distance traveled for jump fatigue.
Past Changes:
In EVE Online: Lifeblood, we released a small change to help you quickly see the magnitude of numbers you enter in buy or sell orders, contracts and any other input boxes. If a number higher than 10k has been entered in any input box, it now has a tooltip writing out the amount, for example:

45343 => ˜ 45.3 thousand
25000 => 25.0 thousand
9999000 => ˜ 10.0 million
15545640000 => ˜ 15.5 billion
In addition to this, we added this tooltip to a few handpicked numbers, such as the total in the Sell Item window and the total in the Buy window. If you know of other places where this tooltip would be useful, please let us know ??

In Lifeblood, we also added a new type of radial menu, the fleet broadcasting radial menu. To use it, you need to assign a shortcut through the ESC window, and when that key is held down and a radial menu is activated, you get the broadcasting options rather than the normal options.

To help you better distinguish it from the normal radial menu, this one is tinted in the fleet color (usually purple). This radial menu will allow FCs to broadcast their commands, such as target, warp to and align to. In addition, it allows normal squad members to broadcast for reps, either by activating the menu on themselves or their ship, or by activating it in empty space.

During the EVE Vegas livestream where Community fittings were being discussed, one of you suggested in the twitch chat that we add filter in the Fitting window to filter out ships and fits you didn't have skills for. I thought that was such a good idea that I might even have confirmed there and then that it would be added, and shortly after it was deployed to TQ.

And finally, here is a list of some of the other changes we've made together over the last year or so:

When a pilot invites you to fleet, the message you get will include a link to that character's info.
