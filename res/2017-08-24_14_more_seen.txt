NEW REACTIONS SERVICE MODULES 
Three types of Service Modules for Reactions will be introduced, substituting five modules from Starbases (POSes)

Standup Composite Reactor I performs both Simple and Advanced Reactions (Tech 2)
Standup Biochemical Reactor I performs both Biochemical and Medium Biochemical Reactions (Boosters)
Standup Hybrid Reactor I performs Hybrid Reactions (Tech 3)
Service Modules require fuel to online and to run (like any other Structure Service Module)
