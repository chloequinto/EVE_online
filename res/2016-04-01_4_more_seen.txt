Comments:

CCP Bartender: I'm a big fan of how practical this tool is. It's a tool I can see myself having open whenever I go wandering through lowsec, and I think it will do a fantastic job of lowering the barrier of entry for new PvPers that choose to use it.
CCP FoxFour: I am terrible at remembering weapon ranges with different ammo and so to me one of the best things about this is being able to quickly get an idea as to the different ranges a target is likely to be able to engage me effectively.
