PHASE TWO
Phase two is the final phase where we have fully implemented responsive design. Once preparations have completed, we want to launch a beta forum in parallel with the current forum in order to get feedback. We will talk about phase two in more detail later.

We would love to get your feedback on the forums. If everything goes as planned then phase one will be launched within the next two weeks.

Thanks!
