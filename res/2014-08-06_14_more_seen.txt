**WORMHOLE EFFECT REBALANCE**
Feedback Thread

One of the many unique aspects of wormhole life is the variety of special wormhole effects that can be found in many W-space systems. These effects can significantly change the balance of power within any given wormhole system by providing system-wide buffs and debuffs and they provide a great variety of combat environments for players to encounter. We are extremely happy with how wormhole effects have worked out overall, and will be taking steps in the Hyperion release to make them even better.

We have had a good understanding for quite some time about which wormhole effects are in need of significant changes, both from the experience of CCPers in wormholes and from reviewing feedback from our very vocal wormhole community. However metrics can also often be useful for evaluating the state of existing features and in this case metrics can be especially instructive.

The following chart shows the relative activity level in systems that contain each of the six wormhole effects, normalized for the number of systems available with each effect.

It is obvious that the Black Hole effect is in need of some help, and indeed one of the most commonly requested changes to wormhole space is a reworking of Black Holes. This effect increases ship speed greatly, but also applies penalties to agility and damage projection. The result is a set of systems that players consider frustrating and tend to avoid. In Hyperion we are completely reimagining the Black Hole wormhole effect into an environment that makes proper use of the speed bonus and provides exciting high-velocity gameplay.

We are also making a set of changes to the other wormhole effects that will help focus their strengths and keep them balanced relative to the other choices.

Finally, we are also streamlining the progression of wormhole effect strengths across different classes of wormholes. This means that the increase in effect strength from one class to another will be more predictable and that the bonuses in lower class wormholes will be more noticeable than before.

Black Hole

(click to enlarge)

This is the big one. Black Holes are generally unfun and uninteresting in their current form, a shame since living in a system with a black hole should be awesome in a sci-fi game. The major penalties to inertia (which affects agility) and damage projection currently prevent players from truly taking advantage of the speed bonus.

Our solution is to keep the core concept of a “speedy” wormhole but make it truly useful by cutting the inertia penalty in half and rebuilding the other bonuses around high speed missile skirmishing. With bonuses to missile velocity, missile explosion velocity, targeting range and a new penalty to stasis webifier strength this wormhole should provide a new and exciting environment that is unlike anything else in EVE.

Magnetar

(click to enlarge)

These are the most popular wormholes by far for PVE, for good reason. The big bonus to all damage provides a very compelling environment. Our goal here is to preserve their current uniqueness and feel while making it a bit easier to take advantage of the tracking penalty to avoid damage in PVP, as well as keeping the effect more balanced for PVE. We will accomplish this goal through a reduction in the effectiveness of target painting modules. Switching the missile penalty to explosion radius helps focus the Magnetar effects towards the signature radius side of the tracking system, as opposed to the Black Holes which mostly interact with the speed side.

Red Giant

(click to enlarge)

We’re quite happy with Red Giants overall, but we see an opportunity to push the theme even further through a new bonus to bomb damage. Bombs are less heavily used in wormhole space thanks to the prevalence of lower signature ships, but this bonus should help those players who wish to experiment with stealth bomber tactics in wormholes.

Pulsar

This is another fairly healthy effect. However we are a bit concerned with the strength of capital shield tanks in Pulsars, primarily due to the cap recharge bonus. Our planned solution is to strengthen the counters and provide more interesting variety in gameplay by adding a bonus to capacitor warfare.

Wolf Rayet

(click to enlarge)

The small weapon bonus in Wolf Rayet wormholes is currently underused and overshadowed by the far more applicable Magnetar bonus. We also have some concerns about the power of the armor resist bonus in this effect, especially when combined with capital ships. The solution is to swap the resist bonus into a flat HP bonus like the one found in Pulsars and push the small weapon bonus far enough to create a truly unique combat environment. This huge bonus to frigate weapons will create one of the most distinct combat environments in EVE, which should nonetheless remain quite accessible to all players since keeping a small ship doctrine for your corp requires relatively little in skillpoints, isk and SMA volume.

Cataclysmic Variable

(click to enlarge)

For Cataclysmic Variables we are interested in buffing the smaller scale uses of the effect as well as preventing balance problems with spider-tanking carriers. The change here cuts the cap recharge time penalty in half (so that ships receive higher cap per second rates in Cataclysmic Variable wormholes) and add a new penalty to remote capacitor transmitters. Due to the nature of capacitor transfer bonuses on logistics cruisers and capital ships, this penalty is much more significant for carriers than for smaller ships.

Overall we feel that these changes to the various wormhole effects will prove to be a significant improvement to the balance and gameplay depth in wormhole combat. We’re also interested in what you think about these changes, and we will be closely monitoring feedback on effect changes in this thread.
