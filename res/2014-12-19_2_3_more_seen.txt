A NEW VOICE FOR AURA IN GERMAN AND RUSSIAN
A few recordings for Aura were missing from the German and Russian clients, so we decided to redo all of them. For Russian Aura we have used a voice actress, but for the German version several players suggested we contact EVE player Naburi NasNaburi, a popular pirate amongst German-speaking capsuleers. She is well known for her parody songs "EVE. Oh EVE" and "My guns were made for shooting" and is the co-host of DJ Raserball on EVE-Radio. She agreed to record the new version of Aura's lines in German, and with Proteus, this will be the new voice of Aura for clients with German as the language setting.
