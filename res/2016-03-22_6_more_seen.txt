CONCORD PROTECTION

CONCORD (the NPC police force in New Eden) are there for your protection, but are a reactive rather than a proactive force. They respond to incidents within high security space (0.5 - 1.0 security), taking punitive action against players who attack others.

Please be aware, however, that in the world of New Eden there are very few rules on player interaction and there may be some people out there who are looking to take advantage of others. Always be careful of who you trust, espcially when striking up deals with other players in chat channels or in space.
