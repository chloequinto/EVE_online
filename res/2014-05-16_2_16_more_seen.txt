THE MORDU’S LEGION ORTHRUS CRUISER
As Mordu's Legion raises its profile in low security space as an elite mercenary and security force, they have also developed the deadly Orthrus cruiser, coming in Kronos. Like the other Mordu's Legion ships, this cruiser has big bonuses to missiles as well as warp scrambler and disruption range. The Orthrus is at the core of the Legion’s new strike formations and provides the mercenary pilots a ship for executing rapid attack maneuvers.
