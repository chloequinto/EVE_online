TRIAGE CARRIER TO FORCE AUXILIARY TRANSITION
Force Auxiliaries are going to completely take over the old Triage role from Carriers, leaving Carriers to focus on their new offensive capabilities. As a result, we want to make sure that our transition plan accommodates all Carrier pilots. Here’s how we’re planning to handle it:

February Release
We seeded Light Fighter and Support Fighter skills. You can begin training them immediately in preparation for the expansion!

EVE: Citadel Expansion
Any carrier with a triage module fitted (T1 or T2) in station, contract or ship maintenance array will be changed to a Force Auxiliary of the same faction.
Any carrier with a triage module fitted (T1 or T2) in space will be changed to a Force Auxiliary of same faction. Its drones and fighters will be moved to its owner’s home station.
Force Auxiliary blueprint originals will be available on the market.
You will only require the Fighters skill to use Light, Support and Heavy Fighters.
The Fighter-Bombers skill will be renamed to Heavy Fighters, and give bonuses to heavy fighter squadrons. Heavy Fighter squadrons will only be launch-able by Supercarriers.
The Light Fighter and Support Fighter skills will give bonus to Light Fighters and Support Fighters respectively. More details about the fighter transition plan will come in a later blog.
No More Force Auxiliary Skills

Our original plan was to introduce a new dedicated Force Auxiliary skill. After player feedback we've decided to go another direction. Force Auxiliaries will instead use a renamed Carrier Skill. If you've already purchased a Force Auxiliary skillbook, the purchase price and any skillpoints trained will be refunded.
