CAREER AGENTS
Lastly, we’ve been working on the Career Agent missions within the new player experience.

In the spirit of these changes I’ll keep this short and simple as no one enjoys a wall of text.
(Unless of course you have a wall of text fetish. But that’s none of my business).

Basically, we’ve cut a lot of unnecessary text from all Career Agent missions to sharpen the focus on the objectives.

The new revised text on the left, the old ‘wall of text’ on the right.
All of these changes (unless specified) are currently on our test server Singularity for your perusal.

As usual, please share your thoughts, concerns and your feedback in the comments section which we will be monitoring closely.

Until then, fly wild.
