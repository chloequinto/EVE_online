TACTICAL CAMERA
The Tactical camera (ALT+1) is designed to be purely practical and works in a similar manner to Real Time Strategy cameras by allowing panning. Objects can be attached to by performing the “Look At” command, and detached from by panning away with the right mouse button. In this mode, we don’t have any of the cinematic effects of the orbit camera present.

Features:

Field of view is fixed at a wide angle and none of the cinematic shenanigans of the orbit camera is present.
Panning is done by dragging with the right mouse button.
Camera is attached to an object by Performing “Look At” and detached by panning
The Look at command preserves zoom distance, so we essentially just pan the camera. This way battlefield overview and awareness is preserved as well.
Tactical overlay is turned on by default, but can still be toggled on or off.
While detached, the camera zooms toward the cursor instead of the center of the screen making it possible to traverse the field easily using zooming only. While attached, zooming works the same way as for the orbit camera.
