PLAYER WARS IN PUBLIC CREST
Wars are a fun thing and we like to show a corporations war history in the client. That is all fine and dandy. However we think you pilots can do some cool stuff with war information, especially some cool over time charts. With this in mind and the fact that wars are public information in the EVE client, we have added a new endpoint to public CREST. The endpoint will be /wars/ and will list all wars in the history of EVE Online, right back to warID 1. You can then go /wars// and get detailed information on the specific war. Please keep in mind some information, such as ISK and ships killed, only started getting tracked with the wars revamp. The final resource you can expect is /wars//killmails/all/ which will list all killmails associated with the specified war. Again, this is all information available in the EVE client and we are just making it available via public CREST.
