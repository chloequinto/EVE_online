STATIC DATA EXPORT
We have rebuilt the static data export for Crius with the latest numbers ready for your consumption. You can download an early release version here:

//cdn1.eveonline.com/data/Crius_1.0_beta3.zip

However keep in mind these numbers may change up until the release on the 22nd. We will do our best to keep the SDE updated and shared with everyone on the forums. The big changes to the SDE in Crius are that we have moved all of the blueprint-related data from BSD (Branched Static Data, stored in database tables) into what we call FSD (File Static Data, stored in plain text YAML files).

Removed table invBlueprintTypes
Removed table ramTypeRequirements
Removed table ramAssemblyLines
Added YAML file blueprints.yaml
Tables which are existing, have been modified and will still be relevant to industry are:

Column baseCostMultiplier added to ramAssemblyLineTypes
Column costMultiplier added to ramAssemblyLineTypeDetailPerCategory
Column costMultiplier added to ramAssemblyLineTypeDetailPerGroup
Despite assembly lines themselves being removed, we are still using the existing definitions of what bonuses apply for NPC stations, POS structures and outposts upgrades. Wherever there is a scenario that multiple assembly line types would apply to the same facility, we pick the best value for cost, material and time independently.
