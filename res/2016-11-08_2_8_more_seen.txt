The required materials for building a Raitaru are:

Structure Construction Parts1
Structure Hangar Array1
Structure Storage Bay1
Structure Laboratory1
Structure Factory1
Structure Repair Facility1
Structure Reprocessing Bay1
Structure Docking Bay1
Structure Office Center1
At current market prices this represents a build cost of approximately 700 million ISK (price is subject to capsuleer market fluctuations).

We believe that the Raitaru will represent an extremely popular form of structure for all kinds of activities. It will be the cheapest Upwell structure ever released up to this point and can therefore be used as a starter structure for relatively new corporations looking for a home of their own. It also matches the best structures in New Eden for targeted ME and cost bonuses thanks to the structure engineering rigs so a savvy corporation that picks its niche carefully can use these structures to break into many profitable markets.
