HEPHAESTUS INDUSTRIAL OUTFITS
Ship designers and nanocoating engineers aren’t the only ones dabbling with aesthetic changes, as a veritable artistic renaissance is sweeping across the fashion industry as well. Refinement has finally come to the hard-working backbone of New Eden, with new Industrial-themed apparel arriving in the New Eden Store. The unique fashion line is named Hephaestus, in honor of the space-faring spiritual descendants of the blacksmiths and artisans that existed well before the EVE Gate collapsed. These stylish new outfits are perfect for those capsuleers who wish to revel in the utilitarian, but with a modern twist.

Soon after the Galatea release you will be able to acquire a complete outfit, offered in various colors which also match the new Designer SKIN lines and are available for both males and females.
