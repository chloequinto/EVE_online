LOADING HULLS
There are several ways to load a simulated hull in the fitting window:

Click on the 'Simulation mode' button
Right click on your real hull in the fitting window and select the 'Simulate my ' option.
Drag the hull from the simulation mode button to the center of the window. 
Drag any hull or structure from the 'Hulls & Fits' browser to the center of the fitting window or click on the little 'Simulate' icon on the entry. This will start simulation on an empty hull
Click on a saved fitting in the 'Hulls & Fits' browser
Click on the 'Simulate' button in Fitting Management window of a fit you were linked
Drag any assembled ship you own, whether it's from ship hangar, contracts or asset window, into the center of the fitting window to simulate that ship and its fit. Please note that if you drag any ship you do not own, only the empty hull will be simulated
