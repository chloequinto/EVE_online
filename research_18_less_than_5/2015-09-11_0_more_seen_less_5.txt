Downtime will abort any pending self-destructs, just like it does with ships.
There's also another couple sov changes that we are currently working on but that aren't far enough along to start talking about quite yet.
The Parallax release will also contain a significant iteration to the Jump Fatigue mechanic.
This change is designed to reduce the damage that a character can inflict by overjumping, reducing the maximum possible fatigue from 30 days to 5 days. In general, this means that a player who is mostly active on the weekend will have fully recovered from one weekend by the next. We will be closely watching how this change impacts behavior and we hope that it will make the fatigue mechanic less punishing without losing the key benefits of curtailing power projection. We are also investigating and working on tweaks to the formula itself, but those changes aren't quite far enough along to talk about yet.
A reminder as always that we are committed to continuing to iterate on the sovereignty capture system in the long term, and these changes will not be the last. We are very interested in your feedback on these proposals and we hope that you'll join in a productive and civil discussion in this blog's forum feedback thread.
Thanks and good hunting!
