MIGHTY CITADELS
The new Citadel structures will be at the heart of the next expansion. You already know a lot about them from the dev blogs we have been publishing in the last months, but in addition to three sizes of Citadels and all new service modules, the expansion will bring big news and a big role for capital ships. We are hard at work on finalizing all of our plans, and you can expect the full reveal of what the expansion will be at EVE Vegas.
SUPPORT THE FUTURE OF EVE ONLINE
If you want to support us in taking EVE to the next level of one-of-a-kind sandbox gameplay, here's what you can do to help:
Play EVE! Find a new challenge in the game, make new friends, and try something new or old. As they say: “A ship in harbor is safe, but that is not what ships are built for.”
Mentor someone who is new or looking to join EVE Online
Brew a plan to mess with someone who deserves it
Give us feedback and work alongside us to improve EVE.
We will be working with the Council of Stellar Management to do more town halls, sounding boards and dedicated feedback sessions for areas of upcoming change – we are dedicated to working with the EVE community on the next steps for EVE, while doing our part to bring you amazing new things. The CSM has seen some of what we have in the works at the ongoing CSM summit, and we’re really excited to show it to you all in full style at EVE Vegas.
On behalf of the whole EVE team, it's an honor to bring you EVE Online. Together, we are creating the world's largest living work of science fiction.
Fly safe, and see you around more often from now on – I’ll be blogging more regularly as we move ahead on all these changes.
