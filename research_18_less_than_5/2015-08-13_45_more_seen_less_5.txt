The Citadel XL structure will thus enter its second vulnerability window at 20 GMT, next Tuesday after the initial attack. When the structure goes into reinforcement, the timer will display that date for everyone instead of doing complex math with vulnerability hours.
VULNERABLE 2 AND 3
This type of vulnerability window does not appear in a regular operation state, and is a reactionary state appearing once the structure has been set into reinforcement at least once.
Those windows automatically appear after the structure comes out of a reinforcement period.
This vulnerability window lasts indefinitely, until an attacker or defender wins the contest by using entosis links (see “entosis link contest” further below).
Except for their duration, they work exactly the same than the vulnerable 1 phase.
ENTOSIS LINK CONTEST
Entosis links are needed to be able to attack (or defend) a structure during its deployment or vulnerability window.
