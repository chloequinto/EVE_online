The universe of EVE depends upon spaceships. In spaceships, players run missions, claim territory, ferry goods, and engage with the other residents of New Eden who make this game what it is. There are hundreds of thousands of capsuleers in New Eden, and every one of them has the potential to fly any number of the hundreds of types of ships that exist in the game. There are millions of spaceships across the galaxy, ranging from newly assembled hulls to ancient vessels which have cruised between the stars for the entire past 12 years. Some ships have never seen a battle, and some have been instrumental in the demise of countless miners, criminals, and mission runners. Despite their ubiquity, like snowflakes or sandwiches, each hull is precious. Each hull holds meaning to its owner.  
Each hull has a history.
