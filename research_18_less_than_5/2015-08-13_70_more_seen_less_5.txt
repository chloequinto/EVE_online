Please note those do not require downtime to proceed, unlike existing outposts. It is also important to remember that scooping a structure will cause an immediate and full vulnerability window to begin. If a vulnerability window was already underway, it will refresh the duration to its maximum value. A structure going through a reinforcement timer cannot be scooped until it comes out of it.
