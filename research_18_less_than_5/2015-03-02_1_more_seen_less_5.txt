Of course, The Drifters do not react well to player interference and they have killed 1,093 capsuleers in total.  The first capsuleer to hunt down a Drifter and face the mighty superweapon was Dontshoot Him, who lost a Stiletto in their efforts closely followed by uhnboy ghost in a Cerberus and PschoStarSkanner in a Buzzard.  So far a rather impressive 129,593,602,454 ISK has been lost to The Drifters!
