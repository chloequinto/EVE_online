Capital Armor Plates & Shield Extenders
This forms a large part of the HP balance. While traditionally a large part of a sub-capitals EHP came from plates or extenders, there are no capital equivalents. No longer! The choice on what to fit (plates, the most powerful guns, capital neutralizers, etc) will be a very important decision post Citadel expansion.
Capital Warp Disruptors & Scramblers
The new capital scramblers and disruptors will offer higher scramble strength with no bonuses to range. Existing officer disruptors and scramblers (which are capital modules) will keep their current roles as longer range capital tackle.
