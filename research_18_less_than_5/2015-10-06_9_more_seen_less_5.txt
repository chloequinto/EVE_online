It checks the status periodically
You can leave it running past TQ downtime and it will refresh automatically - not just on startup.
It supports launching against test servers
No more separate installs to run against Sisi or Duality. The binaries are downloaded in a very similar way to how the resources are downloaded on demand in the client, using the same sort of CDN setup and the same shared cache. A lot of the binaries and resources are the same between different servers so there is very little overhead in keeping binaries around for multiple servers.
