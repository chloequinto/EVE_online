New Sensor Overlay Menu
While we are on the subject of filtering, we were also aware that for someone with a truck load of locations to manage, simply toggling them all on or off might not be granular enough, so for locations we're implementing the ability to filter individual location folders (Whether Personal or Corporate). This will be done from the Places tab in the People & Places window by clicking the little eye symbol on each folder. Corporate location filtering is unique for each character, and all filtering is stored on the server, so will be remembered no matter where you log in.
