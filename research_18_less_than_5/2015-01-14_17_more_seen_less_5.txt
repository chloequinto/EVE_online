On starting the CSM I wanted to look at the income in lower class wormholes.
The problem was it just wasn’t accurate enough and while it did give some very useful numbers like, how much the income was from salvage, and now much of the site was from melted nanoribbons. It wasn’t accurate enough for me. Second results can be found here.
