ACCOUNT SECURITY IMPROVEMENTS
Before the release of EVE Online: Ascension, pilots would face a character name request after successful log in from a new location or browser, in order to verify that they were the owner of the account that they were trying to access. 
This presented a number of issues that included returning pilots not remembering which characters were located on which account, or not being able to recall their character name after having not logged in for some time. In order to smooth out the process of logging into an account, we have made some changes to this process.
As of EVE Online: Ascension, a verification code sent to the email address attached to the account has replaced this request for a character name, and the system has been refined to only request a code when an account is logged into from a new geographical location for the first time.
This means that any pilots who have an internet service that provides them with a dynamic IP address will not need to enter a verification code every time their IP address is updated by their service provider.
Emails for this type of code will have the subject line “Your Verification Code For USERNAME” so that they can easily be identified.
Once this verification code has been entered once from the new location, it will be marked safe and there will be no further requests for verification.
