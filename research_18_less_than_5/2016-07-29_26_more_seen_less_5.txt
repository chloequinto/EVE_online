Ever since the 7th Alliance Tournament, the main prizes each year have been a set of special edition frigates and cruisers, with unmatched combat prowess. Only 50 of each type of frigate or cruiser are given each tournament.
As with Alliance Tournament XII, this year we will be distributing the special edition prize ships to the top 4 teams, with each team receiving an equal number of cruisers and frigates.
1st place: 25 Cruisers and 25 Frigates
2nd place: 15 Cruisers and 15 Frigates
3rd place: 7 Cruisers and 7 Frigates
4th place: 3 Cruisers and 3 Frigates
This year, the ships on offer from the Independent Gaming Commission (IGC) are based on Blood Raider ships. Skilled pilots are sure to be able to use the strengths of these ships to drain and defile their enemies. The preliminary ship stats are as follows (and may be subject to change):
