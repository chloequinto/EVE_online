We all know that capsuleers love doing science, however we also know that they are also dirty capitalists. With this in mind, CONCORD is offering various rewards for your efforts in assisting with their research.
Rather than using Analysis Kredits (AK) in the same way as the first phase of Project Discovery, CONCORD will be awarding points for each analysis of a light curve that’s completed with the added bonus that the more accurate your analysis is, the more points you’ll receive.
These points will let you level you up in Project Discovery. At each level you’ll receive a container that holds an exclusive Project Discovery SKIN for a randomly selected hull from one of the four main empires.
As you reach specific milestones of level 10, level 25, then every 25th level up to 200, you’ll receive tiered rewards which contain character apparel exclusive to Project Discovery, as well as BPCs and stunning new SKINs for the CONCORD Pacifier class frigate and Enforcer class cruiser.
All these rewards will be placed directly into your redeeming system.
Here’s a sneak peek at some of the ships, SKINs, and apparel that will be a part of the rewards.

WAIT? NO MORE ANALYSIS KREDITS?
