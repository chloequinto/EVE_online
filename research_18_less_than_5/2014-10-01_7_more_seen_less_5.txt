What's being special-cased?
Jump Freighters and Rorquals will gain a role bonus: 90% reduction to effective range jumped for the purposes of all these calculations, but will otherwise get all the described changes. This means that, for all the math we’re doing on this feature, whenever we use the range jumped as a variable we first multiply it by 0.1. We will still likely want to revisit the logistical power of these ships in future, but for now we want to bring them into the new system without nerfing them too hard.
Black Ops ships will have their range unchanged, but will otherwise get all the described changes.  This also keeps the range of their jump portals unchanged. We don’t feel that Black Ops range needs adjustment right now.
