CCP Punkturis:
Meeting chillbros from EVE Online is absolutely my favorite part of being an EVE Online developer. I was lucky enough this year to attend EVE Nottingham, EVE Fanfest and EVE Vegas where I got to meet so many people from different places and live their enthusiasm and love for our game. Words cannot describe how rewarding this is for me and how much it encourages me to work harder on the game. I very much look forward to meet everyone again in 2016 <3
