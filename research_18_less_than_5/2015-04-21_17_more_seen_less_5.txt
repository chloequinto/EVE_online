You can now buy SKINs (with Aurum) from the New Eden Store, in the Fitting screen, or the 3D Preview screen.
Before activation, each SKIN is an item which can be bought and sold in the market (for ISK), can drop if it's in your cargo and your ship explodes, etc.
SKINs are used by activating them for a character, giving that character access to SKIN variations that the item covers.
Once activated, SKINs cannot be removed, but also cannot be destroyed (including loss of ship or pod)
