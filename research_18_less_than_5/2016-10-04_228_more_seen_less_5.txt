Max DPS: ~400 dps
Despite its low cost, the Porpoise is a powerhouse in mining support and fulfills all three of the pillars of mining foreman gameplay:
Help fleetmates mine more effectively:
With the ability to fit two command bursts and a 2% per level bonus to Mining Foreman Burst strength, the Porpoise makes a great choice for boosting fleetmates using foreman bursts
Improved survey scanner range allows the Porpoise to help coordinate its mining operation and optimize the decisions of individual miners
Bonuses to tractor beam range and velocity combine with a large ore hold and fleet hangar (the Porpoise’s ore hold is equal in size to that of the pre-patch Orca) allow the Porpoise to collect, store and haul ore for an entire fleet
Defend the mining operation:
With a full flight of medium drones and a full-strength drone damage bonus, the Porpoise has the damage potential of a combat cruiser. This can be used to help clear NPC pirates from the belt, or in conjunction with Procurers and Skiffs to form a deadly drone swarm and surprise overconfident capsuleer attackers
A 400% bonus to Remote Shield Booster optimal range allows the Porpoise to effectively aid in the defense of its allies using medium remote shield boosters.
