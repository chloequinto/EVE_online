Applications cannot be edited after you submit them so make sure your information is correct.
The applicant must provide a copy of a valid, internationally recognized identity document to CCP (passport preferred, driver’s license generally accepted). This is required to confirm the identity of the candidate and to prove the ability to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement. A copy must be of a high quality and should be sent to csm-contact@ccpgames.com immediately after the application has been submitted through our website. Include your running Character’s name in the subject line. CCP will reply once they have received your documents to confirm delivery.
If you fail to submit a copy of your ID, your application will be rejected.
Once your application has been submitted, you are encouraged to create a campaign thread in this forum section.
