For being the owners of the structure and defending it, the Daring Tartiflette Expedition™’s members will only need 10 minutes of entosis linking to defend it, or to fully remove its contested status.
Please note that if the Daring Tartiflette Expedition™ was to attack a structure belonging to another corporation in their wormhole, they would have to go through a 30 minutes entosis link timer themselves.
VISIBILITY
We also want to make sure all the previous states and phases are properly represented in the game.
As such:
Corporation members with enough roles to do so will have full information on vulnerability, reinforcement, capture timers. Notifications will be sent for those particular states to make sure people can respond and defend their structures in a timely manner.
