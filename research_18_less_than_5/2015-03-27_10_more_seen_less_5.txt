Results
We had a record 100 applications this year, from which (also a record) 75 candidates were approved for the final ballot. Almost all rejected candidates did not submit their identification documents.
Eligible voters cast 36,984 votes, meaning that we have 15% increase since the last year’s election. We have also noticed a 3% turnout increase since last year and it’s a nice trend that we hope to keep for the next election as well.
The average age of users who have voted was 34 years, and the average age of an account was 3.8 years, a 0.2 year increase from the last election. 96.31% of voters are male and 3.69% are female.
