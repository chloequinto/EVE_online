This year we will be using the Single Transferable Vote (STV) system again.
The minimum account age for voters is 30 days.
Only active accounts are eligible to vote.
Each account can vote only once. Submitted votes cannot be revoked or edited.
Each voter can pick up to 14 candidates. To vote you simply need to drag-and-drop your preferred candidates and submit your vote as show in the images below.
So you’re asking yourself “Why should I care?”...
The CSM is a key part of the interaction between players of EVE Online and the EVE development team.
The delegates that YOU choose in this election will be attending two multiple day summits here at CCP headquarters in Reykjavík, Iceland, and will have open and direct access to the developers and work to improve and expand EVE Online throughout the year alongside the EVE Development team.
This means that your votes count and can be the deciding factor in which feature proposals, concerns, ideas and feedback items are brought to the development team for action.
Voting in the CSM elections allows you to select the candidate that best suits your playstyle and helps ensure that you get the best representation possible during communications with CCP.
Like any good political election, the candidates are varied and represent the wide spectrum of interests that EVE players have, so you should be able to find several that mirror your own EVE experiences.
Now, surprise!
