Pos research
The next project was the POS research I sorted a questionnaire and had CCP Nullabor check it out made a couple alterations on his suggestion. I then sent this out to around 100 people in W-space who said they would help.
This included a spread sheet and a word doc with the information I had gathered. I was also lucky enough to interview a few people, some of which had documents prepared for me in the way of either, blog posts or word docs.
