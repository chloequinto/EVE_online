These changes are compatible with all current Overview profiles, which are simply treated as having no state with the "Always Show" setting.
It‘s worth mentioning that although we talk about "Always Show", nothing will override the settings in the Group tab. That is, if you have chosen to not see Battleships in your Overview, your fleet mate in the Raven will not be in the Overview, no matter how your state display settings are.
With this change, we've had to change the interface where you control the display settings of the entity states. The states are back to being in one list, but now you have 3 radio buttons ("Always show", "Filter out", "Show by default") to choose from for each of the states.
You can click each of them individually, or select many states in the list and set them all at once by clicking on the header icons.

SCANNERS
Many have asked for the ability to have both the Probe Scanner and the Directional Scanner open at the same time, but none have pleaded more than the wormholers among us who are not only constantly scanning with probes but also need to be on the lookout for someone sneaking up on them. These two very useful scanning tools have lived together as tabs in the same window, along with a lesser used tool, the Moon Analyses tab. In Phoebe we will be splitting them apart, giving each its own window, and these can of course be stacked just like any other windows.
