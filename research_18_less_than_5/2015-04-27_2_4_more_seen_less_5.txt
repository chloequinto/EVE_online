We originally announced a set of balance changes to these two ships on the o7 show earlier this month, and while those changes achieved our main goals we heard more feedback from the EVE community letting us know some of the areas in which these changes could be improved. So we’ve gone back to the design and released a new and improved version of the proposal.
Under the new design, the Confessor and Svipul will move to 4 turret slots, and gain a new +50% damage role bonus. This allows us to more effectively balance the fitting requirements of long range and short range weapons. All the details of these changes can be found in this forum thread, and we want to thank everyone who helped us improve the design with your excellent feedback so far.
