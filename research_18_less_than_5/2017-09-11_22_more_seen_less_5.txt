The Dragoon is a bit of a cap warfare specialist, so we don't expect huge usage, but it's still be lower than we want. We are proposing to keep the theme and overall feel of the Dragoon but move one of its high slots to a mid so it has more flexible control and capacitor options to go along with its slower fighting style. A little extra fitting room will help as well.
