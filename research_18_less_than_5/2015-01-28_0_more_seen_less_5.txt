In the weeks leading up to EVE Fanfest you’ll see more communication from the EVE team about features coming to EVE in 2015, such as upcoming steps on improving sovereignty mechanics. The EVE Keynote at Fanfest will give the next big update on the big picture roadmap for EVE. It’s best viewed in person so grab your tickets and I’ll see you there!
Enjoy the Tiamat changes, you can check out many of the features on Singularity already.
