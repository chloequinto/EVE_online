UI Scaling at 90%
Releasing the thin wireframe icons accentuated the fact that the UI scaler does a suboptimal job of reducing 1-pixel strokes to less than a pixel. This resulted in a worse experience for a certain segment of players playing at 90% UI scaling, who ended up having a markedly worse experience with the new icons.
EVE UI has always been designed with pixel-perfect accuracy at its core. And when we decided to introduce a UI scaling option for accessibility reasons, we did it for the sake of giving people options to customize their UI, yet with the known tradeoff of knowing the texture scaling would create less than ideal-looking experiences in certain situations. It was by sheer luck that up until now most of the other issues created at 90% happened to be manageable, but the new bracket icons were so gameplay-critical that it made for a step back in usability for those playing at 90% scale.
Mea culpa to those affected. Making the icons at least usable at 90% scaling is one of our top priorities for improvement, along with others outlined below.
