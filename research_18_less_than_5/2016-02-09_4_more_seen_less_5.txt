While detached, the camera zooms toward the cursor instead of the center of the screen making it possible to traverse the field easily using zooming only. While attached, zooming works the same way as for the orbit camera.
FIRST PERSON CAMERA
The First Person camera (ALT+3) is probably the least practical (at least for now), yet most jaw dropping of the three. It is highly recommended that you try it out with the not-so-long-ago-introduced manual flight feature that is mapped to the keyboard arrow keys by default.
Features:
Fixed first person view with wide field of view
Military jet style roll and pitch indicators overlay for orientation
3 level stepped zoom
