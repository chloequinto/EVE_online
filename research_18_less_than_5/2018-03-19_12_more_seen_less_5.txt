FLEET CHANGES
In the March release, we have a few changes that have been widely requested by logistics pilots.
First of all, we’re adding the ability to color code the fleet 'Watchlist'.
This one should be handy for all pilots, especially those flying logistics ships, so they can clearly see in their watchlist who their FCs are, anchors, other logistics pilots, cap buddies, special space snowflakes or whoever you want to mark specially. To assign a color to a fleet mate in the Watchlist, you enter a special 'Color mode' through the option menu in the Watchlist window and little color pickers are added to the entries in the window.
