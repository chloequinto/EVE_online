This gives high staging value to building outposts since they can never be removed.
As time passes space becomes more and more saturated with outposts, decreasing logistics risks in null-security space, and reducing the need to build more outposts in the first place.
So, we quickly decided that our new structures would need to be destructible, especially since they are going to be available everywhere from high-security to wormhole space. However, this introduces another problem: we want our structures to be used, but one of the deterrents against that goal is the fact they compete against existing NPC stations and player outposts (before we nuke them that is). As such, we have to accept the fact no one will want to store items or minions (if you are an alliance leader) in one of the new structures if they can be destroyed and lost on a whim.
And that is how asset safety was born.
