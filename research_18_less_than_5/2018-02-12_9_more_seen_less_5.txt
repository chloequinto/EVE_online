Bans in January.
A little over 1800 accounts were banned for botting/automation in January. Mining bots were the largest group represented, with ratting bots coming in a close second.
About one third of the affected accounts received permanent bans as repeat offenders, while the rest was temporarily banned on first offense.
CCP is committed to keeping EVE clean and your assistance is greatly appreciated - please keep those bot reports coming!
