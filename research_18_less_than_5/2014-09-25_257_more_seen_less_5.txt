Co-Processors
Co-Processors represent the simplest possible set of named modules, since there is nothing but basic power level to differentiate modules within this group. This means that the only named version will get the title “Upgraded” and all of the current named co-processors will be converted into Upgraded Co-Processors.
Beyond the changes to the named versions, we’ve also consolidated all five “Basic” versions into one single “Basic” type. The “Basic” type will get the CPU bonus of the old T1 version, and both the T1 and Upgraded versions will be getting a boost to bring them closer to T2 in power.
Finally, we’ve also gone ahead and cleaned up the progression among the faction officer versions of the Co-Processors. This mainly takes the form of bringing the Gallente/Serpentis variants up to par with the Caldari/Guristas ones. The Federation Navy, Khanid Navy and Shadow Serpentis variants will now give an equal bonus to the other faction Co-Pros and we’ve fixed up the progression among the officer variants to bring Serpentis and Guristas to parity.
