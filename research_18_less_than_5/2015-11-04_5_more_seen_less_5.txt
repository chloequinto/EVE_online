Hi scanning fans,
Team Psycho Sisters here to let you know about some of the improvements we’ve made to the Probe Scanner interface, the Solar System map, and the Directional Scanner.  Firstly, let’s go over these features and their purpose.
The Probe Scanner interface, coupled with the Solar System map, is the primary way explorers in EVE discover their content.  The Probe Scanner allows them oversight of their probes, as well as a display of all Cosmic Signatures in a system and any Cosmic Anomalies (the ones you don’t need to scan down).  This window will also show any combat probe-using scanners the ships, structures and drones that may be in a system.  The Solar System Map visualizes both your probes and the signatures themselves, and is the primary place where explorers will actually work with their probes – moving them across the map and resizing them to get more precise locks on Signatures.  Finally, the Directional Scanner informs you, at the click of a button, what is in space within a certain range and from a certain angle of your ship’s position and camera’s alignment in space. 
In developing this feature, we tried to gather as much player feedback as possible.  Assisted by the CSM, we put out forum threads, several) reddit posts (due to the temporal nature of reddit), and even a survey.  We took this approach because, maybe more so than any other system in EVE outside of combat, scanning has an incredible variety of use cases and styles. It’s impossible to intuitively know them all, so we went to the experts – you!
We were incredibly happy with the results that came out of the extended feedback threads, chats with the CSM, and the survey.  The interaction gave us plenty of things to work on, showed us when we were headed down a bad path, and even inspired a few awesome little things that we were able to implement along with the primary changes. Let’s take a look at the new features now.
