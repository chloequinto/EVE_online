EVE Online Atlas: Atlas uses a really cool technique based on chatlog scraping to allow users to control a browser based information dashboard using chat commands inside the EVE client. This one generated a lot of buzz around the office, and definitely takes the prize for "most awesome hack"!
pizza-auth-3: This stood out as one of the entries which implemented a planned feature ahead of time, out of client. In this case, the contact groups system. By itself that wouldn't be all too impressive, but it also combines this with the location API to provide location+group aware notifications, as well as providing a LDAP authentication layer for use with other alliance services. It is a highly technical entry, the scope of which would only be useful to a select few who run their alliance IT infrastructure. But if you happen to be one of those people, this app could really tie your alliance services together.
