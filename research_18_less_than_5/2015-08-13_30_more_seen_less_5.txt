On top of the points above, all structures, no matter their size or role, will have warpable signatures like cosmic combat anomalies. None of them will need to be probed to be warped to, even if the user doesn’t have direct access to them. This will ensure pilots can quickly see what’s happening in their surroundings without having to use probes, and thus not having to give their position away to the inhabitants.
DEATH IS ONLY THE BEGINNING
And that’s it on how to attack and defend structures. Please remember most of this is subject to change based on feedback and time, even if we’re are starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel. We would also like to thank the CSM for their time reviewing this particular feature with us. As mentioned at the beginning, our next blog is going to focus on asset safety, or what’s happening to your stuff when a structure blows up.
In the meantime, happy hunting and may the odds be in your favor.
