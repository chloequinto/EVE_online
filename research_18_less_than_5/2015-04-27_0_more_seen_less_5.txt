Filtering improvements
We have a lot of nice changes to the presentation and usability of color filters in the map. My personal favorite is extremely simple but brings a huge improvement: we are adding a section at the top of the filters selection box for recently used filters. No more having to scroll all the way to the bottom every time you want to switch from pilots in space to pilots currently docked and active!
Second, as you might have noticed in the picture above, we’ve rearranged the grouping of filters. At first this might be a little disorienting but we feel this arrangement makes a lot more sense. We’ve also added color filters for faction warfare and sovereignty, which had been missing until now.
Lastly, we’ve adjusted the way filter visualization is normalized. This should make it easier to figure out where that blob is!
Thanks for reading. As always, let us know what you think in the comments.
