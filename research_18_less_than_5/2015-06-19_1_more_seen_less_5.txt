A New Art Director
In other news, as of next month I will take on the role of Art Director for EVE Online. 
I´ve been concepting for EVE Online now going on 8 years.  In that time I´ve tackled various projects along the way—Tech III ships, various ship designs and redesigns, most the turrets and missile launchers when we redid them, all sorts of background work, illustrations,  icons, and  last but not least the Caracal/Cerberus and the Hecate.
Our Art Director CCP Huskarl is leaving us to embark on a new journey after more than 15 years of devoted service to New Eden. He leaves behind countless designs and the tremendous legacy of the style of New Eden.  We owe him much appreciation.  Thank you for everything and good luck in your adventures.
Filling the shoes of Art Director for EVE Online is quite a challenge to say the least, and very exciting!  I´m up for the task and will do my best to work with the artists and hopefully find new ways to interact and collaborate more with, you, the awesome EVE community.
