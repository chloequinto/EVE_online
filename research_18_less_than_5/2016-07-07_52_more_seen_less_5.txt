Signups are open as of this dev blog, and prospective teams can have their alliance executor fill out this form. Signups are open until the 22nd of July at 23:59UTC. We will be offering positions in a similar way to last year: the top 14 teams will be offered an option to buy into the tournament directly, 42 positions will be available in the random draw, and the remaining 8 will be offered in a secret auction. This gives a total of 64 teams. Entry fee for teams buying in directly and the random draw is 5 PLEX, and the secret auction will again only be open to teams that have already entered the random draw. Any positions allocated for the Top 14 buy-in that are not used will be added to the andom draw. The draw will take place on the 26th of July with the results announced the same day, and the auction will take place between the 27th and the 29th of July.
