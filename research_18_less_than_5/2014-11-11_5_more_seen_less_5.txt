Search and ye shall find
So what are these new sites? The backstory of them is that they’re storage sites created by Sleepers. The Sleepers have always been interested in collecting items of curiosity and have done so in secret throughout known space for years. But they haven’t always been able or willing to cart the items they collect back to their wormhole enclaves and have instead deposited them in storage sites. To keep their collections hidden from the prying eyes of enterprising pilots, the Sleepers used highly advanced cloaking technology to obscure the sites.
Recently the cloaking mechanisms have started to malfunction and the sites are becoming visible. Why this is happening is unknown at the moment, but seems caused by heavy-handed scavenging by someone or something.
Despite the faulty cloaking mechanisms, these sites are still very hard to track down.
We will be delivering three sites in total. The first of these, called Limited Sleeper Caches were introduced with Phoebe 1.3 on November 11th, while the other two, (Standard Sleeper Caches and Superior Sleeper Caches), are coming in the Rhea release on December 9th. The Limited version is the smallest of the lot, and easiest to find, though it is still harder to scan down than any existing hidden site. The Superior version will require a very dedicated, well equipped and highly skilled explorer to find.
All the sites will be distributed throughout known space, in all security bandwidths. In high-sec, you are more likely to find the Limited version than the larger versions, while in Null-Sec it is vice versa. All these sites are very rare though, so finding one is not common place.
The Sleepers placed their storage sites as much out of the way as they could to minimize the chance of accidental discovery. This means the sites are most often found on the outskirts of solar systems.
