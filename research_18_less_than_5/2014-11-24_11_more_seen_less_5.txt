Welcome to EVE Online!
When you take your first steps into the world of New Eden, things may seem a little complex. If you ever feel lost or confused, fret not! The purpose of this Dev Blog is to arm you with the basic knowledge that you'll need to thrive in EVE Online, so take a look at the following links and see if the answers to your questions are here!
We'd like to give you all a helping hand and try to ensure that you hit the ground running in what is considered by some to be one of the most rich, deep and complex virtual worlds in existence. It's good to know where valuable information is readily available to you, so below are some very good sources of information, quite a few of them provided by communities of other players who specialize in helping new pilots.
_As a rookie pilot, you'll be provided with one of the four basic ships shown above depending on the race of your character.
(Clockwise from top left: Amarr - Imparior, Caldari - Ibis, Gallente - Velator, Minmatar - Reaper)
If you lose this ship, don't worry! Simply dock your capsule at a station and the friendly insurance company will provide  you with a new one!
While you'll want to upgrade pretty soon, you can find more information on your rookie ship and how to fit it for your first few hours of play here!_
