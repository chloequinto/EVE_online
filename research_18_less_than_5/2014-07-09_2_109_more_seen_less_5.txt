Support Team
We’ve continued to help out Game of Drones with their mammoth task of overhauling the whole industry process, to make sure we deliver a stellar industry feature.
We made a few small changes to starbases:
We removed the standing restrictions for deploying starbases in hi-sec.
We added a minimum corp age of 7 days for deploying starbases.
We continued to polish the reprocessing UI. We also adjusted the reprocessing stats of Outposts a bit. You can read more about reprocessing changes here.
We moved the Planetary Interaction (PI) window out of the old Science and Industries  window. It is now under the EVE menu in the Neocom, under Business.
