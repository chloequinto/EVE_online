We will show you the potential asteroids that can appear Asteroid Belts, Ore Sites, and Ice Belts.
The hostiles that may appear in the sites. We are also looking at including NPC damage types in future iterations of The Agency so that should free up some space in all your bios.
If any content requires special modules to participate, we would like to let you know this in advance
This is just the first iteration of The (new) Agency, so we look forward to hearing your feedback on what other filters, content or information you would like to see included.
The Agency will be released with the Lifeblood expansion on October 24th.
Fly safe,
Team Psycho Sisters
