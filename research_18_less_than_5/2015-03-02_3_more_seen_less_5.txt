Greetings Capsuleers,
This is CCP Affinity on behalf of Team Space Glitter and we would like to show you some week one stats on The Drifters that we released with Tiamat.
One of our goals with The Drifters was to further iterate on the new NPC AI we released with the Circadian Seekers.  It has been awesome to see how you all adapt to new challenges and we hope to continue reprogramming the NPCs of New Eden.
Since the release of Tiamat, 247 Drifters have died at the hands of capsuleers.  It was very impressive to see how quickly you all adapted and on day one you managed to take down 43 drifters.  Huge congratulations to Vo3blka who was the first capsuleer to defeat a Drifter with his Chimera!
