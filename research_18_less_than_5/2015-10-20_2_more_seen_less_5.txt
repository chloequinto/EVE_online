Blood Raider Gauntlets will be appear throughout New Eden during The Crimson Harvest, inviting you to test your piloting skills against some of the best of the Blood Raider ranks. These Gauntlets will appear on your overview as long as you have "Celestial Beacons" enabled, and should you successfully complete a gauntlet, you will be rewarded with a Blood Raider Abaddon SKIN in addition to a chance of receiving a special Blood Raider Cerebral Accelerator.
Blood Raider Cerebral Accelerator (will increase all attributes by 10 points for 24 hours)
Advanced Blood Raider Cerebral Accelerator (will increase all attributes by 12 points for 24 hours)
The accelerators are plugged in through the same method as a standard implant, and will last 24 hours before they are depleted. Be aware however, that you should use them with haste, as come November 2nd, they will cease to provide any training bonus.  
As a reminder, the Blood Raider Gauntlet and the rewards found within will only be available during the Crimson Harvest and the Blood Raiders will make sure you cannot use the accelerator after the harvest ends... so you better be quick!
