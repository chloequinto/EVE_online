Agent Finder
In addition to all these changes, we are removing the Agent Finder as it is currently known.
With the introduction of The Agency, we effectively introduced a new Agent Finder and we felt this was an opportunity to encourage people to use The Agency, while simplifying the process of finding an Agent to work with.
If you filter the Agency to "Specify" for "Agents" you will basically get all the filters that were in the Agent Finder.
