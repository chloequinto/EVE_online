        Sleeper &s = sleepers[i];
        if (PyChannel_GetBalance(s.channel)) {
            int res = PyChannel_Send(s.channel, Py_None);
            if (res)
                PyOS->PyError();
        }
        Py_DECREF(s.channel);
    }
}
This all looks correct - the channel could not pulled out from under the tasklet until after the Send call. What happens when a tasklet is killed?
