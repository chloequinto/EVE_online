CCP Manifest:
Some of my favorite memories of the past year have been seeing a big rise in player-made EVE videos and their complexity, storytelling, and artistry—whether corp commercials, propaganda pieces, battle recordings, solo pvp vids or any of the other hundreds of awesome vids. 
I definitely had one of those wow moments with one in particular:  Scott Manley’s “EVE Online VR Video – The Ships and Factions of New Eden”. It captures the majesty of the factions on an epic scale and shows the ingenuity of EVE players and what they can do with even the barest of tools – in this case EVE Probe. Plus it’s a great overview of the New Eden landscape, very well written and produced, and a FREAKING 360 VIDEO, which is super cool to show people on your phone when they ask about internet spaceships.
