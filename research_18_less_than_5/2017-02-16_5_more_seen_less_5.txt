Greetings Spacefriends,
We hope you have had a wonderful start to 2017!  Here in the Reykjavik office, Team Genesis have been hard at work reading through the amazing feedback we receive and implementing further updates to the new player experience (NPE), released during EVE Online's November 15th expansion, Ascension. If you missed our first round of updates you can read about them here.
The NPE released in Ascension gives new players the opportunity to fight alongside their character’s Empire in a story-driven experience with the guidance of a revamped Aura and the newly created Empire mentors.  Our goal was to introduce players to New Eden via an immersive narrative arc, while also lessening the steep learning curve of EVE gameplay. 
During the first iteration of this experience, we have received so much great feedback from the community! We thank you all for the effort put into specific, reasoned suggestions; it has been wonderful to see how much you care about your fellow newbros! With that in mind, we’ve been working hard to improve the experience based on all your feedback as well as internal metrics.  
Increased assistance from Aura for new players that die during the NPE
There are no guarantees of safety during the NPE and it's our job to make sure new players understand how to get back to a station and board another ship. During the initial release we had the same instructions for all deaths, regardless of location or how far along the experience. We have changed this to tailored instructions dependent on where you are in the NPE when you die and also to replace the items you need to continue.
This means that a new player who dies right at the beginning of the NPE, during the Research Facility site, will receive tailored instructions about returning to station and receive a new Corvette whereas a new player that dies during the final site, the Drifter Zenith, will be guided back to station and given the modules they may have lost.
