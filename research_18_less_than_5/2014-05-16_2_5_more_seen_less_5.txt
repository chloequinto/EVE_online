THE MORDU’S LEGION BARGHEST BATTLESHIP
The flagship of the new Mordu’s Legion fleet is the mighty Barghest. This Battleship was developed in response to emerging threats from the Guristas. It is designed as a fast battleship with high-speed missile delivery systems along with increased range for warp scramblers and disruptors, making it fully capable of contesting the field with more traditional heavy skirmishers.
MORDU’S LEGION ADVANCES IN LOW-SECURITY SPACE
After developing their new line of ships, the Mordu's Legion command decided to start scouting low security space to test out the capabilities of their new machines of war. They will be making infrequent scouting missions and while their exact objectives are unknown, it has been reported that they are carrying valuable cargo with them.
NEW CAPABILITIES FOR PIRATE FACTION SHIPS
In Kronos, all the high end ships from Guristas, Angel Cartel, Blood Raiders, Serpentis and Sansha's Nation get their roles and bonuses updated and refined.
Serpentis ships will combine brutal hybrid damage with great speed and the strongest stasis webifiers in the game. Angel Cartel ships keep their extreme speed, combined with projectile mastery and enhanced warp drives. Sansha's Nation ships are receiving velocity bonuses from afterburners, making them just that much more deadly, especially their smaller ships. Blood Raiders will gain increased functionality for energy vampires as well as getting a bonus to webbing range on all ships. The Guristas will get reduced drone bays and bandwidth, but at the same time they will receive a large boost to the damage and hitpoints of drones, creating a unique fighting style.
