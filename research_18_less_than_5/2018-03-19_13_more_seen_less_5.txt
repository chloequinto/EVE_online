Hi Spacefriends,
CCP karkur here to tell you about a few little things we’re bringing you in the March release and also about a few other that have been deployed in the past few months.
It's been quite a while since I wrote one of these blogs, so after discussing the newest changes, I want to cover some of the past changes that have happened based on your suggestions, comments and requests.
For a while now we’ve all been working together on a lot of little changes and quality of life improvements. Through various channels, the community has been very active in suggesting all sorts of improvements you'd like to see to the game, and we have been collecting and implementing some of them as time and priorities have allowed.
The newest suggestion thread is here, and if you have further suggestions, we encourage you to post them there.
(PLEASE use the correct format or you'll risk your suggestion becoming lost!)
