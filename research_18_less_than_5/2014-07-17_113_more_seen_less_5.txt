Headline changes
PE (Production Efficiency) is now called TE (Time Efficiency) because it's more obvious what it means. ME (Material Efficiency) keeps the same name. In both cases we are now displaying both values in the UI as negative numbers, as they are reductions; this is possible because of the invention changes mentioned later on!
Wastage as a concept is gone. All material-affecting bonuses simply reduce from the "full price" input materials. Material needs for T1 items have all been adjusted upwards by 1/0.9 to balance this out. We no longer need to guard so vigilantly against "material printing" from ME bonuses as reprocessing-built items now only return 50% of the materials.
ME and TE research now operates on a 10-step scale. Each step of ME reduces materials by 1% (always rounded up). Each step of TE reduces build time by 2%. These are expressed as simple percentage values, so a blueprint might be ME-3%, TE-12%.
