New Player Training Sessions
Last year the Community Team ran a series of New Player Training Sessions (NPTS) specifically targeted at players that would like to know as much about specific features as possible. If you wish to know more, they are available on the EVElopedia. The EVElopedia is also an excellent source of information for other matters. If you want, you can also join the New Player Training Sessions chat channel in-game, by clicking the chat bubble and typing in the name of the channel.
