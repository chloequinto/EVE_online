October 8-9- EVE TV Broadcast
October 15-16 - EVE TV Broadcast
In order to fly with an alliance in the Alliance Tournament XIV you will need to have be a member of that alliance by July 6, 11:00 UTC. As we are giving a window for players to move themselves to their “home” alliance, we will not be making any exceptions for anyone that has not joined their alliance after this date. If you are unable to move alliances before the deadline, please file a support ticket before the deadline under CCP Community Team. Each alliance may only field one team.
There will be future Dev Blogs in the coming weeks which cover the rules, broadcast schedule and sign up details, so stay tuned! For those who missed the previous ones - the matches from Alliance Tournaments IX, X, XI, XII, and XIII are available on the EVE Online YouTube channel.
