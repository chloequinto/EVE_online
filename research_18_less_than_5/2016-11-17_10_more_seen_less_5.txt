The Hulls & Fits browser will allow you to browse all the ships and structures available to you. It also includes all your fittings for each of the hulls, and by activating the personal and corporation fittings filter at the top of the list, you can choose to view only those hulls you have saved fittings for.
The Hardware browsers helps players find and discover modules available on the market and easily preview how they impact the hull by simply hovering the mouse over them. When a module is previewed, the stats in the fitting window are updated and colored green or red, depending on whether the change is positive or negative.
At the top of the browser there are several filters that will help you narrow down your options when searching for equipment for your hull. Some of them are rather self-explanatory, but other could do with bit of explanation
