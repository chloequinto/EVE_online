Hello Ship Balance Fans!
The February release has just landed and hopefully many of you are busy working out new Assault Frigate fits and Assault Damage Control doctrines, but we are already looking forward to March where we have another package of ship balance updates coming your way. This set of changes is heavily inspired by the CSM Winter Summit where balance was a big focus of conversation. There were two major takeaways from the CSM feedback during the summit:
More change is better, even if it’s small
The meta is feeling stagnant, particularly around Feroxes and the Marchariel
With that in mind, we are planning to adjust those two big boys, as well as the Orthrus, which should create space for other ships to shine. Alongside those changes we will also be giving some long-requested upgrades to Tech I Battleships (rest in pieces Mr Hyde113), allowing Attack Battlecruisers to fit Micro Jump Drives, and making improvements to some less popular hulls.
We are also introducing an entirely new ship in the March release: an extremely specialized defensive ship that can help fleet commanders avoid “headshotting” tactics in large battles.
