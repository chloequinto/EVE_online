This blog!
Final blog summarizing the new capture system in one place.
Unlike yesterday’s blog which covered quite a few disparate topics, today’s blog will be focused on changes to PVE and system upgrades. We’ll discuss the changes made earlier this year, the changes planned for the big deployment on July 14th, and begin some discussions on changes we’re working on for later this year.
