Hello again adaptable capsuleers!
Today we are happy to bring you another dev blog covering the imminent revamp of the Strategic Cruiser (also known as T3 Cruiser) class coming on July 11th.
When we last released a dev blog on this topic a little over a month ago, we covered the high level goals, some of the design direction and the start of our community Strategic Cruiser focus group. Since then we’ve been hard at work preparing these ships for the big day on Tuesday. If you’ve been watching the forums and the focus group logs religiously then you’ll already be up to date on everything coming on Tuesday. For everyone else this blog will get you up to speed.
These changes coming on Tuesday will be one of the most extensive and largest rebalances EVE Online has ever seen, and will come with a major upgrade script to bring every existing T3 Cruiser into the new system.
We highly encourage all players who will be flying T3 Cruisers at the time of downtime on July 11th get themselves into a safe location such as a friendly starbase or docked within a station/structure before the downtime begins.
Strategic Cruisers have been one of the most anticipated rebalance passes in recent EVE history. We have been discussing these ships and potential changes with EVE players for a long time now. It has always been informative and encouraging to hear what the community had to say about them on the forums, through blog and podcasts, and especially at in-person events such as Fanfest and EVE Vegas. After these discussions, we have settled on a number of goals for the revamp:
**Emphasize the aspects of T3 Cruisers that make them unique, distinct, and exciting**
To reach this goal we are adding new features that allow players to make better use of T3 cruiser customizability. These include allowing unfitting and refitting of rigs so that T3 hulls can viably switch roles day to day and the addition of a new subsystem bay so that players don’t need to use their normal cargo space to carry an alternate role along with them on their adventures.
We are also using new bonuses to highlight existing T3 themes such as module overheating gameplay and probing support.
**Shift the Strategic Cruiser class into a set of strengths and weaknesses that has less overlap with other ship classes**
A longstanding issue with T3 Cruisers has been their close overlap with other cruiser classes, especially with Heavy Assault Cruisers. This goal involves shifting the positioning of the Strategic Cruiser class relative to other classes to allow those other classes room to shine in the future.
The biggest way we are working towards this goal is by increasing the mass and signature radius and decreasing the agility of T3 cruisers, placing them into the gap in gameplay “ship size” between HACs and Battlecruisers
We are also decreasing the resistances of T3 cruisers while continuing their tradition of having quite a bit of raw hitpoints. This helps distinguish them from higher-resistance T2 ships.
**Ensure that all the subsystem choices have strong value**
Ever since they were first released, balance between the different subsystems available for the Strategic Cruisers has been an area with significant room for improvement. At the moment, quite a few of the subsystems are fully dominant in their categories, and others see almost no use. In fact, eight of the current subsystem options are currently seeing less than 3% usage for their given ship hull.
To solve this problem, we are combining and rearranging the subsystems to ensure that all of them have distinct and useful niches and provide valuable options to players. The least popular bonuses are being turned into secondary benefits for more popular subsystems, and previously underpowered roles such as missile Loki, drone Proteus, and remote repair Strategic Cruiser are being recreated from the ground up as truly viable options.
**Simplify and clarify Strategic Cruiser subsystems**
Having over 1000 subsystem combinations with many of the stat impacts unclear and unintuitive left much to be desired for the understandability of the Strategic Cruiser class. In addition, this massive number of subsystem combinations has also been causing an unsustainable amount of maintenance load for the CCP art and graphics team.
It has also been difficult in the past to gather all the proper information about what the stat impacts of any given subsystem might be. With some of the subsystem effects listed as skill bonuses in the description tab and others spread throughout the attributes tab, it has been difficult to figure out what subsystems will actually get you the results you’re looking for.
To solve these problems, we have prioritized clarity in the revamped T3 subsystems and bonuses. Whenever possible we have moved the basic ship stats to the Strategic Cruiser hull itself to keep the number of effects from each subsystem reasonable. The new subsystems also display all their stats clearly in a new traits tab, whether those stats come from skill bonuses, role bonuses or raw changes to the ship’s base stats:
We are also reducing the total number of subsystem combinations through the aforementioned merging and shifting of subsystem roles. After the revamp, each T3 Cruiser will have four subsystem slots (Core, Defensive, Offensive, Propulsion) and each slot will have three options available.
