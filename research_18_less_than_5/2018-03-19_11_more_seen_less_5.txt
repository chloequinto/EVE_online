Getting targeted is commonly known as "being yellow boxed", given the yellow bracket that appears around the ship of the attacker. As many of you probably know, once you see a lot of yellow boxes suddenly appear in space, you are likely to be the enemies' next target. However, logistics pilots, FCs and other key people in the fleet are frequently targeted by their own fleet, as they are pre-locked by the logistics wing to give a better chance of keeping them alive. (To be honest, I always get a bit nervous seeing that yellow box, even though I know it's in my best interest, and it makes it harder to see when I'm actually being targeted by the enemy.)
In order to help you see when you are truly "yellow boxed" in the "incoming-attack-sense", we are changing it so when a fleet member targets you, the bracket around their ship will be in the fleet color rather than yellow. By default, it will therefore be purple, but if you have changed the color of the fleet flag to be anything else, the targeting bracket will be of that color. Yes, I do know you can change the fleet color to be yellow, but if you do, that´s kind of on you, isn´t it?
If for any reason, your fleet mate attacks you, the bracket will change color and become red, just as before.

Another small change we are making to help out logistics pilots, is to include the ship type name in the broadcast for reps. This has been frequently asked for by logistics pilots all over, who would like to know the type of the ships that are in trouble, so they can prioritize the broadcasts and evaluate if they even have a chance to save the ship at all.
