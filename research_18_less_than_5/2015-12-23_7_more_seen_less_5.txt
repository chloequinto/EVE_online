Greetings Capsuleers!
It’s that wonderful time of the year again! The holidays are firmly upon us and as we head full steam toward 2016, we would like to reflect on what a wonderful year 2015 has been in New Eden.
Starting 2015 releases early with Proteus, and ending with Operation Frostline, there have been a lot of big changes in EVE over the last year including a brand new Sovereignty system, new NPC AI and the Drifters, a lot of new ships and updates from our art team Trilambda who always strive to keep EVE beautiful. We also had the first rounds of the Amarr Championships and we cannot wait for the finals at Fanfest 2016.
With so many incredible moments this year like the amazing efforts of broadcast for reps, Kelon’s amazing performance in the Amarr Championships, the ever reliable Hydrostatic Podcast, the wonderful cosplay at Fanfest and the amazing Euro Tour we decided to ask a few Devs for their favourite memories of 2015.
