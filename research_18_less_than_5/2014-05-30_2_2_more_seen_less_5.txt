You don´t really see the fun stuff until you start moving the camera around.  There´s a lot of subtle stuff going on like color changes, elements growing larger and fading out etc. that you might not notice right away. I feel it gives them more life than not.
These will be coming in the future releases. I hope they turn you on as much as they do me.
