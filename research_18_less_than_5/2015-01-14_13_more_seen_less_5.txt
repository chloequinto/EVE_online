Communication with the playerbase
I’ve organised 4 Wormhole townhalls and 9 sounding board meetings. This has focused mainly on PvE and has been a huge success. CCP Affinity has been to the last few and asked if this could branch out and also do a general PvE one as well, which I take as a very good sign.
This has also helped with the players getting to interact with CCP as well. This has also lead to the PvE little things thread. I've also sorted one on clothing and pos's (with the help of sugar) With us being asked if we'd do another pos (structures) one in the future.
I’ve also been along to all of Sugar Kyles CSM Q&A sessions (12 so far).
