The next step up from the Raitaru, the Azbel class Engineering Complex will perform the same functions as the Raitaru on a much larger scale, and even offers the option of being able to construct capital vessels.
Named after Li Azbel, a Gallente scientist who pioneered the first breakthroughs in faster than light communications, this massive structure would make a worthy home for a large industrial corporation or alliance.
The Azbel is larger and better defended than the Raitaru, offering more sustainability and flexibility. Typically designed to be used a large scale manufacturing center for research, copying, invention and manufacturing, it gains the generalization benefits of large sized engineering rigs to allow individual structures to provide a greater variety of bonuses.
