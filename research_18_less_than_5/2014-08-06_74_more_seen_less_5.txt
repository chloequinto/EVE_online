A proof of concept version of this change appeared on our Singularity test server over the weekend, which caused some consternation among parts of the wormhole community. I want to remind people that unannounced changes appearing on test servers are not a reliable guide for what might reach Tranquility. The version on SISI had distance values that are very different than the ones we had been discussing with the CSM most recently.
