Seriously. This book is canon. Anything that´s stated or implied in there is a fact. We went to great pains to ensure that ship descriptions, their development history, and even the details of the gruesome fates of some prototype work crews were accurately sourced. The same applies for photographic evidence of Gallentean debauchery or intensely thorough Amarr rituals of cleansing.
