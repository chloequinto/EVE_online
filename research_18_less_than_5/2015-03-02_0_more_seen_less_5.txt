If we compare the ISK destroyed by all NPCs in EVE, Capsuleers and Drifters, it looks a bit like this:
The most expensive ships lost so far to The Drifters are a Machariel at 3,792,142,502ISK and a Tengu at 3,618,369,204ISK (not including insurance). 
Here is a breakdown of Drifter kills by Ship Class:
It also appears The Drifters are not a jubilant bunch!  My favorite kill mail to date is one from capsuleer, Jelly Fat, who tried to welcome the new residents of New Eden with a firework celebration.
It seems The Drifters don’t care much for fireworks….
We are really enjoying watching all the creative ways you have come up with to interact with the new NPC AI and we look forward to seeing how you tackle the next phase!
