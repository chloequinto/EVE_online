THERA AND THE SHATTERED WORMHOLES
Rough transition through wormhole conduit to seventh candidate location. Shields and nanoplating held with minimal erosion. Deployed camera drones and was immediately impressed by the vivid blue glare of the central star. Even brighter than typical blue A0 types. Analysis showed it to be subtype A0IV and qualifying as a blue subgiant. Extremely turbulent with many signs of instability in star and the background radiation of the system. Briefly turned forward plating transparent with polarizing filters in place, and was struck by the dire beauty of the star.
Sensors indicate several outer planets of various types and an inner zone of numerous terrestrials. The innermost pair of planets show signs of shattering similar to that seen in previous candidate locations. This system stands out as extremely capacious and probes are returning multiple wormhole signatures. Could it be lucky seven?
