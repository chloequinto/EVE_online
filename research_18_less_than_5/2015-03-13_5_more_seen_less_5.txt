The Uber-Limited edition
Now this Limited Edition is quite something. It comes in 2001 units, which is not a lot. EVE: Source’s Limited Edition came out in 1400 units and sold out in less than 7 hours and it didn’t have as many pretty pictures as this one.  Come to think of it, we should have done more than 2001 units. But then it wouldn’t have been limited. Ah, the dilemmas of our age!
