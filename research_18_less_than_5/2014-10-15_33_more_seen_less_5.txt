So for starters we have something for all you intrepid explorers out there.
The general consensus right now is that Relic sites are worth more than their Data site counterparts when it comes to the basic ISK per hour and this is something that we’ve had on our radar for a while.
So for Phoebe, we’ve made the following exploration changes to help alleviate this:
Lowered the volume of the most commonly dropped items (Electric Conduits for example) in exploration Data Sites from 1.0 (and above) to 0.5.
The drop frequency of faction POS blueprints in all Data and Relic sites has been increased.
The drop frequency of 'Optimized' items in all Data sites has been increased.
Faction Materials have been added to the all the exploration Data site loot tables.
These can be found in the Manufacture & Research > Materials > Faction Materials section of the Market.
