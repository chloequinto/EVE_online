For The Agency to be able to distinguish between the many different types of sites in New Eden, we have revamped and surfaced an old back end system that organizes them, but had fallen into disarray and neglect. Instead of most sites having the same archetype, each site now has an archetype that distinguishes its content type, Incursion sites in the Incursion archetype, Relic sites in the Relic Site archetype, and so on.
Surfacing this system allows the EVE client to distinguish these sites from each other. For example, this means that Factional Warfare sites and Incursion Sites will no longer just be listed under "Combat Sites", but their own category. For now, this functionality will only be available in The Agency, but the possibilities for this separation to expand over to all systems in EVE are there.
