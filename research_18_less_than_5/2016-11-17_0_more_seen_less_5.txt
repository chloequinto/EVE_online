For years now, more experienced players have enjoyed awesome 3rd party tools such as PYFA, EFT, Osmium and EVEHQ to help them with their fits. Those fitting tools not only have great and advanced features, but can also been used while at work or when without access to EVE Online. We hope our fitting simulation mode will be nice addition to the options players have when it comes to planning and tinkering with fits, and will help introduce players to how much fun it can be!
Happy fitting!
