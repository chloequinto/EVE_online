We pride ourselves on the strength and dedication of our community, and hope that you'll have an awesome time getting to know fellow EVE players as you take your first steps into New Eden. We're extremely humbled and proud of our community after watching the huge level of support our amazing players have shown rookie players over the years.
Go join them, forge your own destiny in EVE and make your mark on the universe; but most importantly of all, have fun doing so!
Good luck, pilots!
