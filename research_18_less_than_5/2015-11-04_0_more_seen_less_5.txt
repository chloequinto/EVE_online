Visual D-Scan
In the same style as the Analyze hotkey, there is now a mappable hotkey for Directional scanning.  It retains the same time gate as hitting the button.  This might seem like a powerful balance change, but players were already able to do this as long as the Directional scanner was their active window, so we thought we’d made it easily accessible for all. 
There is one very important change to be aware of, and we mentioned it above but will do so again.  Players may now choose to have the camera permanently align to the Directional scanner.  This means that when you move your camera, your map and correspondingly your Directional scanner will move with you.  Similarly, when you use the radial menu to snap your camera to a celestial, your map and in-space view will both track to that celestial, as long as the “Align Directional scanner with camera” option is selected.  This option is accessible in the Directional scanner. 
That about wraps up our changes!  The feature went live on Tranquility in the Parallax release on the 3rd November as an opt-out beta package to give people time to adjust, although the old system will be phased out entirely in an upcoming release.
The opt-out can be toggled in the System menu, under the General tab.  We will be releasing a Flight Academy video to provide additional guidance on scanning and assist new players.  We hope you will begin using the new system though and keep giving us the feedback to make it as great as it can possibly be.
