When scoping out the book, we had to find a delicate balance between something worth owning, and something we were capable of producing in a year and a half or so. EVE has so many ships. Great as that is, it´s annoying when you want to make a compendium. We also didn´t want the work rushed. We wanted quality pictures, with rich detail and interesting written material to go along with it. It made sense for us to start at the beginning. With the Frigates. But we struggled with keeping it at the base 28 racial frigates. However, we would love to do more of these books, but that decision is made solely based on how many books we sell. It´s as simple as that. If you want us to do more of these books, show us your love by purchasing this one. For you, for your friends and for your frenemies.
