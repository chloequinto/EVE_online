Very large fatigue values will take a loooong time to decay, is this too much?
Possibly yes, we'll have a look at this.
Does a titan providing a bridge gain fatigue when people jump through it?
No. Only if the titan itself jumps.
Is the ability to push your fatigue up to really high numbers a good idea?
Probably not, no. We're looking at just capping fatigue at 1 month.
