Proper notifications will be sent whenever a structure state needs attention
As mentioned in the previous blog, all structures will have warpable signatures like combat anomalies. They will also show up in space / overview whenever the player can dock inside them
Timers related to the current state, or next available state will always be visible on the structure icon, in a manner very similar with the existing deployables. Of course, players not belonging to the corporation owning the structure need to be on grid to see them
