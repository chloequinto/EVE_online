Ability to self-destruct sov structures
This is a simple change to allow corps to willingly drop their sov structures. This will be especially useful for alliances that are willingly dropping control of some space to allow another alliance to take it. It takes the form of a new right click option on sov structures that's only available to Directors in the owning corp, and it will work much like ship self destruct. We currently have it set to a 20 minute delay, and as soon as the countdown starts a notification would be sent to the whole alliance. If this self-destruct is due to nefarious rogue director sabotage, any director in that corp would then be able to fly over and stop the destruct within the time delay. Delay duration is easy enough for us to change if we see the need, and we are very interested in your opinions on how to find the proper balance.
