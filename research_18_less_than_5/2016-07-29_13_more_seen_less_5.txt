Alliance Tournament Edition Blood Raider SKIN
As with Alliance Tournament XIII, we will be offering a ship SKIN that can be applied to any of the Blood Raider ships to give them a unique visual style. We will be awarding 10 copies of this SKIN for each series won by a team. This includes the single match series that make up the bulk of the tournament. This should provide an additional incentive to try and win every match you can. Again like last year, these skins will be handed out later than the rest of the prizes at a yet to be determined date.
THE DRAW DECIDED
This year a total of 92 valid entries were received. Of those, 12 were from teams in the previous year buying in directly, and 80 were entries into the random draw.
Congratulations to those that were drawn, and good luck in the secret auction to those that were not. If you wish to see the video of the draw being performed, you can find it here.
SECRETS AND AUCTIONS
As the draw has now concluded, we move on to the Secret Auction. Beginning tomorrow, 27th of July after downtime, the remaining teams that were not selected in the draw may have either their Alliance Executor or Team Captain EVEmail CCP Logibro a PLEX bid. The minimum bid is 5 PLEX. The same character that mailed the bid must also place the same number of PLEX in the redeeming system. All bids must be submitted before downtime on the 29th of July. Any bid without the respective number of PLEX in the redeeming system at the close of the auction will be considered invalid.
