For the eve trailer I made sure people in W-space knew about this and to send in videos. I also linked various wormhole groups videos to CCP Prawn along with a link to the W-space video thread. I also sorted out getting them some footage of wormhole PvE.
Recently when CCP Mimic was after groups of people who were helping new player, I managed to put her in contact with various people who were organising and sorting things for new players.
This is potentially one thing I do think CCP could make more use of us, The CSM in general know alot of people so can often help CCP get in contact with people for various things, be that video makers, groups helping others, people for interviews, etc.
