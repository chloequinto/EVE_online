Reset: For those that fly on NPSI roams this would be a really useful tool. It fetches a list of corporation and alliance contacts and then sets them all to neutral for your character and since character contacts override corporation and alliance you can now go on an NPSI roam without fear of shooting blues! When you're done the website resets your contacts back to how they were before and you get to hope your alliance and corporation diplomats agree that shooting blues is how New Eden life is meant to be!
