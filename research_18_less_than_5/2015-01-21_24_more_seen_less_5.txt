Wielding six turret slots bonused for projectile weaponry, the Svipul is deadly with artillery and autocannons alike. It also makes excellent use of the trademark Minmatar versatility, gaining bonuses to both armor and shield resistances while Defensive Mode is active. Although its lower mass makes it a bit less suited to oversized afterburners compared to its Amarr contemporary, the Svipul is the fastest of all the Tactical Destroyers and can use that speed to pick apart unwary enemy fleets.
