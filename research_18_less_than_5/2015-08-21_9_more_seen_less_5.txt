Greetings capsuleers!
Various designers across the universe have secured contracts to create new SKIN lines, meaning licensed Designer SKINs are soon heading out to hangars all around New Eden. Their bold new looks, inspired by the sunsets on Caldari Prime, the mythology of the brave Matari warriors and more, isn't the only unique thing about them. Each line is created by independent designers that are not shackled to the traditional palettes of each of the four major Empires. Hence some of these designs will have SKINs that are available across multiple factions regardless of hull composition, such as the Blue Tiger line seen below.
The first of the below Designer SKINs, The Raata Sunset line, will arrive with Galatea on 25th August and the rest will follow shortly after.
