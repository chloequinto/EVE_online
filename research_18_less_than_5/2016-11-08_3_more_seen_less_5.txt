ESI is a solution to a problem that CCP has had for several years: the inability to quickly and easily update the API for 3rd parties. Over the last few weeks the devs I have worked with have demonstrated that ESI is adaptable and have demonstrated the ability to implement new features quickly. I know many 3rd party developers will not be happy about having to rewrite many of their tools, I am one of them, but this is the price for the technical debt we have incurred. CCP is looking to move past technical debt and bring us a modern approach. EveWho.com is already utilizing ESI and I’m quite happy with the results so far.
