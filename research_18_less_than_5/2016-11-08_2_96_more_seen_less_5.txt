Standup XL-Set Reprocessing Monitor II
This rig setup provides the maximum ME and Time Efficiency (TE) bonuses to all ship manufacturing, as well as improving cost and duration for all research, copying and invention jobs and enabling maximum reprocessing yield all in the same giant structure.
Thanks to the greater generalization of larger rigs, there will be a total of 64 available M-Set Engineering Rigs, 34 L-Set Engineering rigs, and 8 XL-Set rigs to choose from (including both T1 and T2 variations).
If you’re itching to see all the granular details, we have a chart with the current draft of stats for all of these Engineering Rigs at the end of the blog.
