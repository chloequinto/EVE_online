Hi Internet Space People,
We announced on The o7 Show we are planning to make some changes to the way fleets work. Since then we’ve had lots of amazing player feedback, and based on that feedback we’re making some tweaks. Unfortunately this means we’ve had to push back the release of these changes to the August 25 release.
