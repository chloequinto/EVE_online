For those of you wanting to see the votes themselves, they can be found here, alongside the code (in Python) used to run the election. The election is run using the same system as last year, the Wright STV system. One thing to note is that one of the candidates withdrew before the results were announced, and as such was withdrawn using the built in mechanic within the vote tally script. (More details on the formatting of the .blt file can be found here in section 3.1). A copy of the audit log with the candidate not withdrawn is also included with the above package.
