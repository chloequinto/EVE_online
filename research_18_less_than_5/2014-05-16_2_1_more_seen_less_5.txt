NEW VISUAL EFFECTS IN SPACE
Before Kronos, the solar flare effect was one of the oldest effects in EVE. Now they have been completely redone using new underlying technology and completely new graphics.  
THE NEW EDEN STORE - CUSTOMIZATION FOR SHIPS AND CHARACTERS
In Kronos, the in-game NEX store will be replaced with the New Eden Store in order to make new ship skins, clothing and apparel available to you.  All the AUR currency on different characters of the same account will be moved to a new account-wide AUR wallet that can be used from any character on the account. Read more about the New Eden Store in an upcoming devblog.
INCREASED SIGHTINGS OF WORMHOLES IN LOW-SECURITY SPACE
In Kronos we will be increasing the amount of wormholes within low security space which lead to other low and null security systems. You will be able to further explore New Eden by finding shortcuts between systems. For more details check out this forum post by CCP Greyscale: //forums.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=posts&t=344290
