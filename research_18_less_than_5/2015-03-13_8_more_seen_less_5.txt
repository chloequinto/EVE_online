Rides of the Valkyries
We were able to secure work in progress concept art from CCP’s upcoming VR dogfighting shooter EVE: Valkyrie, fresh from our development team in sunny Newcastle. Valkyrie adds yet another dimension to New Eden, the world's largest living work of science fiction, and we are excited to share glimpses of it with you.
