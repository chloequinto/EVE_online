This is the big one. Black Holes are generally unfun and uninteresting in their current form, a shame since living in a system with a black hole should be awesome in a sci-fi game. The major penalties to inertia (which affects agility) and damage projection currently prevent players from truly taking advantage of the speed bonus.
