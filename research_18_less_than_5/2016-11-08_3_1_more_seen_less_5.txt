EVE Portal also allows you to purchase additional PLEX or Aurum for the account of the currently selected character if you have saved your payment details in account management. This is handy for topping up quickly from your phone.
We hope you enjoy using EVE Portal, which can be downloaded now on both the Google Play Store and iOS App Store. If you encounter any issues while using EVE Portal, you can feel free to contact our Customer Support team for further assistance. While this initial release already contains some useful features, we will be continuing to add more functionality over time to enable you to do more, even when away from your computer. If you have particular ideas, you should let us know in the comments section.
