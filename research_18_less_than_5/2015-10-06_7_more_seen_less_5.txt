It supports launching multiple instances
You can set up logins to multiple accounts, and then launch multiple clients with one button click. The logins can be remembered between sessions if you want.
The launcher also keeps track of clients it has launched so you won't accidentally launch on an account that is already logged. You can switch focus to any running client from the launcher, or close it down.
It has functionality to maintain the shared resource cache
Verifying, purging extra files and downloading the full resource cache are all handled by the launcher. You can also move the cache to a different location.
