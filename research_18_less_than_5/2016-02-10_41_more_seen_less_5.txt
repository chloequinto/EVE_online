STRUCTURE BONUSES AND SKILLS
In the same fashion that a Caldari Raven battleship doesn’t have the same role than a Scorpion, not all structures are going to be alike. Structures will focus on different themes, each having specific strengths and weaknesses. Citadels focus on defense, logistics, and office capabilities, which make them naturally good as staging points. Other structures we will introduce with time will tackle other fields like industry, resource harvesting, propaganda, intelligence or even long distance movement.
What that means in practice is that, while most of the various structure rigs and modules that are going to be available can be fitted into any type of hull, some will be better suited than others at a specific task. For instance, while a Fortizar (large Citadel) could be fitted with manufacturing service module and rigs, it will not offer as good Material Efficiency and Time Efficiency rates as a dedicated Assembly Array structure fitted on the same fashion.
This specialization will be achieved through the use of specific bonuses available on each of the new hulls.
