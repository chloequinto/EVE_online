Recalling your probes. We are keeping this away from the Analyze btton so there are no accidental recalls
The middle section has not changed too much, but we have added the icons in a new column and the new color states.
The bottom section now has the controls for altering the formation of probes, the size of the probes, and the Analyze button. We think this flows better for scanning. Launch formation, change size, analyze, change size, and analyze!
We have hidden the ignored section until you actually ignore a signature.
There will now be some more informative text in the Probe and Directional Scanner windows when there are no results. The probe scanner will tell you if there are no signatures or anomalies in the system, it will also tell you if there are no results being shown because you have filtered or ignored all of them.
Exposed Scan Strength, Deviation, Duration
As part of the effort to improve the scanning user experience we have added the players Scan Strength, Scan Deviation and Scan Duration to the probe scanner window. These can be seen here
