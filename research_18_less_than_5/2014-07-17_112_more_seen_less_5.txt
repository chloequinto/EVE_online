Two specific notes: firstly, we are now rounding materials per-job rather than per-run, so savings of less than one unit can often be realized with a long enough production run. Secondly, to prevent weirdness with T2 builds in particular (for example building 10 Paladins from 9 Apocalypses), every run requires a minimum of one unit of every listed material.
In order to keep a non-linear progression, each subsequent level takes longer to research than the previously one.
Here is the time for a T1 ammo blueprint:
