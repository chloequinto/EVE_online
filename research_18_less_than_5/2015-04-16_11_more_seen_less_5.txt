Simple flat and abstract designs fit best in the EVE setting and have a higher chance of approval. They are also more recognizable, easier to read from the distance and work better when scaled down.
Try to use classic, modern or futuristic fonts. Fonts like Papyrus, Lucida Handwriting and Brush Script don't fit in the EVE universe.
Use of Comic Sans will result in liberal application of spaceship violence.
Avoid using Photoshop filters like Lens Flare, Emboss, Blur and other such filters.
Textures should be avoided in your logo submissions.
Colors:
Colors should be chosen within the color range used in the EVE universe. That means colors should generally not be too saturated or bright or they will look like they belong in a different color space than the ship and its surroundings.
Try to keep color harmony in mind. Try to use analogous colors and not too many complimentary colors together.
