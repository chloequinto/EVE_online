Check it out:
Bound in white, non-animal-suffering-faux-leather, it comes in a custom sleeve and is loaded with beautiful lithographs. The lithos are signed if you are one of the lucky first 1000 who makes an order. It also contains an anodized aluminum commemorative plaque featuring our home away from home, Jita 4-4. The plaque has a code that redeems for special in-game items to wear, in the same theme as the book itself. And it’s nice. It comes in a solid white protective case . It also is exactly the same size as the EVE: Source limited edition, so if you have that one, this one fits right in next to it!
