Hello ship posting space friends,
I'm CCP Pointy Bits and in this blog, I’m going to go through the design process behind the new Rupture-class cruiser and talk about our general thoughts on redesigns and graphics renovation in the art department on EVE.
First, we’re going to go on a bit of a preamble about how redesigns are important to the artists here.
