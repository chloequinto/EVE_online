How to apply
There are two steps to applying:
Fill in the application form between 12:00 AM on March 19 and 12:00 AM on March 23. The form will return a confirmation if the application goes through. Beware session time-outs and make sure to save your text in a document. If you don‘t get a confirmation, re-enter the information and try again. If your application already went through, the website will inform you of that.
Submit your document scans/pictures to csm-contact@ccpgames.com in high-quality with the subject „ CSM 13 application“ Both these steps need to be completed within the submission window. Applications filed outside this window or without valid documents will be rejected.
Extra tips: •	Applications cannot be edited after you submit them so make sure your information is correct! •	Once your application has been submitted, you are encouraged to create a campaign thread in this forum section.
We look forward to receiving your applications and following all campaigns. We here at CCP feel we are stronger and do a better job at developing and maintaining EVE with the CSM by our side. Big thanks to everyone who supports the CSM project and vote for their favorite candidates every year!
