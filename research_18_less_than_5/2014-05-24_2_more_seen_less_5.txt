Of course, this open door policy has its pitfalls. “We accept the risk that the guy who joins us might just be a spy, awoxer, or just a jackass in general.” Luckily, Bren describes these problems as “pretty self correcting.” Because of their openness, infiltrators wouldn't really have much to gain and students who are jerks will quickly be kicked.
Students do pay a price, however. 0UCH has rules and if one is broken, the offender is kicked from the program. On the PvP side, students are restricted in what they can fly, where, and with whom until they have completed most of their training regimen. “We don't hand out Rifters and tell our students to go out and lose ships anymore,” Bren explains. “We tell them, 'If you are properly trained, you will be hard to kill. If you use teamwork, you will kill more and die less.' It's contrary to everything every EVE PvP veteran tells the new player, but it's what every EVE veteran has learned over time.”
Some students may have difficulty grasping a subject, dragging out classes longer, but this is expected. It's the main reason they do not teach via the forum, recordings, or videos. It might make for more work up front, but they see the benefits when they bring them out to their fleets. “More often than not, at the end of a typical class, an EVE veteran will thank their 6-month old 0UCH instructor for teaching them something they did not know,” says Bren. “That's rewarding in itself.”
The Staff
The majority of 0UCH instructors are home grown, though they have more than a few big fleet, high SP, experienced combat pilots as a core of knowledge. When a student graduates, they have 30 days to decide what they want to do next.
“Many of our students come to 0UCH with plans in place. They know they are going back to a corp and take what they've learned to go do what they want,” says Bren. Others, however, are not so sure, and use the time to figure out what they want to do.
