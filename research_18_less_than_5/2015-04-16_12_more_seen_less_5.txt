Logos with themes like warfare, corporations, science and space have a higher chance of approval.
Reference to historical themes or imagery should be subtle. A well designed and modified version of a historical object that is designed to fit in the EVE Universe will in most case have a higher chance of approval than the definite interpretation of it.
Many concept and ideas from earth have evolved or been forgotten in the EVE Universe. Remember this when designing your logo.
Common everyday motives/objects like mobile phones, modern guns, modern vehicles that fit poorly within the genre should be avoided.
Art Style:
Cartoon images have a lower chance of approval, but if they are well produced and follow all the other requirements, then they will more likely be approved.
