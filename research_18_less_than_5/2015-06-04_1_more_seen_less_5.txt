Another concern of allowing any SKIN on any ship is making Tech 1 ships resemble Tech 2 ships which would have visual gameplay implications. While deciding what SKINs to offer in the release of this feature we carefully selected SKINs for ships by making sure that if we offered a SKIN for that ship the same look was not used by its Tech 2 counterpart. This is the reason why for example there is no Sarum SKIN for the Apocalypse, as it would too closely resemble the Paladin.
CONCLUSION
The final thing we would like to clarify is that lore is not something that is stopping us from using the existing SKINs we have on other ships. The two biggest factors are quality and performance as demonstrated above. Hopefully this gives you a bit of insight into where things are going and why. Our goal is to continuously be adding SKINs to the game over time. We want to offer a wide range of options for SKINs that appeal to lots of people. We aim to accomplish that using the SKINs from existing factions or corporations along with this new designer SKINs system we are working on.
