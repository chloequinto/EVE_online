Hello Space Shoppers!
Team Size Matters here to tell you about some changes we have lined up for PLEX, Aurum and the New Eden Store. These changes don’t have a set release date yet but will be coming to EVE Online this spring or early summer.
With Ascension behind us, and a wave of Alphas now living as permanent residents in New Eden, our team has been looking for ways to improve the PLEX experience for Alphas and Omegas both. PLEX (Pilot’s License Extension) has been an important part of the EVE ecosystem for many years now. It’s been great for EVE because it allows players to trade their time and money in whatever way they like without hurting the integrity of our shared universe. Over those many years, and especially now due to Clone States, we’ve learned a lot about PLEX and think we can make improvements without disrupting the core design. Let me tell you how!
