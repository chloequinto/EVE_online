THE RAITARU-CLASS MEDIUM ENGINEERING COMPLEX
The namesake of former Ishukone weapons researcher Tyma Raitaru, who pioneered the invention of modern day missile, the Raitaru is the smallest of the three Engineering Complexes and is comparable to the Astrahus in size and scale, offering facilities to manufacture anything except for capital and supercapital class hulls.
Similar to the Astrahus, the Raitaru will be able to accept all sub capital ships into dock, along with the Orca, Bowhead and freighter class hulls. Anything larger (capital or supercapital) however, will not be able to dock. This medium sized engineering facility provides an inexpensive way for corporations to build their own base of industrial activities.
