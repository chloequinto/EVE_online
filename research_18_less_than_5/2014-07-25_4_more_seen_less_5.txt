Four more releases in 2014
Now that Crius is live, we have 4 more releases to go this year - Hyperion on August 26th, Oceanus on September 30th, Phoebe on November 4th and Rhea on December 9th. We will use these releases to the fullest to make EVE an exciting place. We will make changes to nullsec, add new ships, balance and revamp ships, modules and structures, add new missions and new kinds of dynamic content, add new invention gameplay and continue to improve industry. We will take the next steps towards our vision of player built stargates and, behind the scenes, we will start work on next generation structures and big changes to corporations and alliances.
You'll of course hear more about all of these things as we start making forum feedback threads, posting dev blogs, and announcing features when we know they are greenlit for development and release. I promise you even earlier dialogue about many of them as well, since our work with the CSM and your feedback has been an invaluable part of our development process.
