Dear voters,
The Winter Summit for the 12th democratically elected Council of Stellar Management took place at CCP HQ in Reykjavík from Jan 15 -18, covering a wide range of EVE topics chosen by both the CSM and CCP.
The meeting minutes for the summit have been released and you can get them HERE. Some details have been held back for operational or marketing reasons but most of what was discussed is in the minutes to give you, the voters, better insight into the process and better equip you to have discussions with your CSM and with CCP about the CSM process, and the continous development of EVE.
The Summit was attended in person by 8 out of 10 CSM members, with two joining remotely as work and studies allowed.
Please leave your feedback in the comments thread for this blog, we'll monitor and respond to feedback there.
