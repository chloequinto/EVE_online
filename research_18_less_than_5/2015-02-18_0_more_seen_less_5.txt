We’ve prepared a couple of gifts to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the CSM elections!
Firstly, meet the Council Diplomatic Shuttle, a decommissioned, disarmed Pacifier-class CONCORD frigate this is now used as armored diplomatic transport. Every active account in EVE will be able to claim this, providing that it is active on the day that voting starts, which is February 25th.
Those who claim this gift will receive 10 run BPC (blue print copy) for this ship in their Redeeming system, so that they can build 10 of the hulls in celebration of the election of the 10th CSM.
For those who are interested, here are the shuttle’s statistics:
And what devblog would be complete without some shiny pictures?
Every account that votes in CSM X election will also receive 10 collectible trinkets – one for each council – which will contain a list of all council members who served during that term.  Just a little keepsake for your fond memories of every single CSM member who has served on the council over the years. These will be delivered at a later release.
Lastly, I would like to wish good luck to all CSM X candidates, and would like to thank every council member who has served over the last 9 terms for their hard work and dedication.
