Let’s start with moving your probes. Have you ever had this issue where you want to pick the cube, but a bracket is in the way?
That should no longer be an issue, as the cube should always get the mouse click sent down to it, even through other brackets
What about this one? You want to pick the front of the cube but instead you grab the front arrow.
Problem Solved! We are removing the arrow pointing towards the camera when you reach a certain angle.
Ever wondered why we let the arrows go flat to a point you could not actually select them? So did we.
For resizing the probes, we are going to remove the way you click from the edge of the probe spheres and replace it with a slider in the Probe Scanner window. We found the current implementation to not be accurate enough and with other brackets enabled it caused too much opportunity for unintentional item selection.
This means for resizing probes there are 4 available methods:
New Slider in the Probe Scanner window
Alt + Mouse wheel
Dedicated shortcuts set through the Shortcuts tab in the Settings window
