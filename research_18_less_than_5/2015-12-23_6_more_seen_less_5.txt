CCP Seagull:
My favorite thing this year has been all the passion people put in arguing with us over what EVE should be. I find it’s an enormous privilege to get to co-create this science fiction universe with people who care so much about it. To all of you who have chimed this year and given us your opinion, thank you for playing and thank you for making EVE with us. Happy holidays and see you all in 2016!
