Hello capsuleers,
CCP FoxFour here on behalf of Team Size Matters to show you some of the stuff we have coming for ship SKINs this summer. As the ship SKINs feature is fairly visual I am going to get straight to the point and show some pictures. First up, along with the Carnyx release we released four SKINs for the Marauders: the Police SKIN for the Kronos, the Blood Raider SKIN for the Paladin, the Thukker Tribe SKIN for the Vargur, and the Kaalakiota SKIN for the Golem.
