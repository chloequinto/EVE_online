Hello space ladies and gentlemen.
While you are all enjoying the new content available in Kronos, we would like to draw your attention to what’s coming up in Crius, our next release. This blog is specifically about tweaks and changes related to player-owned starbases, and while some of the information you’ll see here may previously have been available in various other blogs and forum threads, we figured you could use a central place to read it.
