Rattlesnake: cb2_t1:guristas:caldari
For every standard ship in EVE we can boil it down to the hull name (“gdn1_t1”, “gf4_t1”, …), the faction (“gallentebase”, “guristas”, …) and the race (“gallente”, “caldari”, …). Each name points to unique set of data for hull, faction and race and combines those results into a spaceship that is loaded into the client.
In theory any combination is possible and supported by the SOF, but how much sense does a ship with a Moros hull with Guristas material and Sansha boosters really make? That question is rhetorical.  Please do not ask for a Sanistaros.  Please.
What does this new system change for players?
Visually? Nothing right now actually. The ships generated by the SOF are visually identical to the ships generated by manually edited red file system.  Loading these new ship name strings, though, is a bit faster due to the more efficient storage of data. There should be less delay between when the client calls for a ship and when it appears in space.
That said, we have taken the opportunity to retweak some of the red files that have gradually evolved over the years of manual faction and race adjustments.  We finally tended to the Gallente CreoDron ships, for one. They are now back to the greenish look they used to have when New Eden was young.
What is going to change for tool developers?
Potentially? A lot. If your tool relies on individual ship files in the stuff package, then you have a problem. We will keep those files around initially, but the next step in the process is removing unused red files altogether. You can refactor your tools to use the single SOF database file here:
