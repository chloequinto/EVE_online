Compression Arrays
Firstly we want to mention that we have further simplified how compression is generally going to work:
Instead of requiring various amounts of ore to compress as expressed here, compression now requires 100 units of the base ore to deliver one unit of compressed variation.
Volumes on compressed ores have been tweaked to preserve the same ratios as mentioned in our “reprocess all the things” blog, so the ratios shouldn’t change.
Compression blueprints are being removed and properly reimbursed.
Example: I have 100 units of Veldspar in the Compression Array with a total volume of 10m3. After compressing them I will receive 1 unit of Compressed Veldspar with a volume of 0.15m3 (this may displayed as 0.2 in the client due to how rounding works).
Secondly, we are introducing a Starbase Compression Array. With perfect reprocessing rates being no longer achievable, this structure becomes quite important to faciliting the movement of ore. Here are the attributes.
Compression works in a similar way to reprocessing:
