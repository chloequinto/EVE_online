Greeting Capsuleers,
CCP Affinity and CCP RedDawn from Team Space Glitter to give you a little more detail on the past, present and future of those mysterious space entities, the Drifters.
With the Carnyx release, the previously inaccessible Unidentified Wormholes popping up over New Eden opened, allowing you to traverse them for the first time.
These wormholes only appear in systems that contain the ominous Jove Observatories, which the Drifters and Seekers have been guarding in a rather aggressive manner. 
Braving these Unidentified Wormholes grants access to new wormhole systems that include system-wide effects commonly found in other wormhole systems, shattered planets, and various sites that build upon the existing Drifter mysteries and tell some tales of old.
Capsuleers have also been encountering larger, named Drifter sites which encourage group cooperation and timing to unlock their deepest secrets.
It’s no surprise that the Drifter and Circadian Seeker presence in these systems is high and reports of a new, previously un-encountered Drifter called the Hikanta Tyrannos have been surfacing.
Whatever secrets the Drifter sites hold, it appears to be worth defending. And worth assaulting, as since the Antikythera Element was first discovered, Capsuleer abilities have been enhanced with the appearance of the Entosis Link.
