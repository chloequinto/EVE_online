As a player, you may only compete for a single alliance, regardless of how many player-accounts you own.
All competing pilots must be members of the alliance for which they are competing, and have been a member of that alliance by 2016-07-06.
All alliance members are eligible to compete in any match in which their alliance is taking part, subject to all applicable rules; teams do not have to remain the same between games.
Please note that both the format and match rules are subject to change. It is strongly advised that participants watch the tournament forum regularly for announcements.
Match rules
Teams can field up to ten pilots on the battlefield.
