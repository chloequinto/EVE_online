When it comes to SKINs we have two general types of SKINs
Here is a standard Raven battleship.
Here is the same Raven with the Lai Dai SKIN.
Here is the Raven with the Kaalakiota SKIN which includes what we refer to as a custom mask map. That is a whole other texture as part of the material that changes where the colors on the ship goes.
We have concerns about the performance impact of having lots of different ships with different custom mask maps on them. We are pushing this a little with the new Marauders with the thought that they very rarely are seen in large fleet battles.
