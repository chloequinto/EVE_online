Decreased complexity during station visits
There is a lot of information to teach players during the initial experience. We discovered some areas of improvement from the feedback we received and also from watching playtests.  We guided new players through a lot of new windows during their station visits, but not always in an order that linked them together and helped new players remember what each window was for.
An example of this was when the task to open the wallet initially came as soon as the player docked in the station. This task was introduced to show new players they earned ISK while in the site and to explain that ISK is the currency of New Eden. This was then followed by introducing skill training to the new player and then by purchasing an item from the market.  That is a lot of information to teach players within a short time and because of the flow we created, it felt like 3 different learning points.
We have now moved the “Open the Wallet” task to happen directly before the tasks to purchase from the market, directly linking the wallet and your ISK balance to purchases you can make.
