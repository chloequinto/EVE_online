The Reactor Control Unit II is receiving a small increase in CPU use, to help balance out the value of the different Reactor Controls.
Reactor Controls are another class where we are cleaning “Basic” variants up into one type, placing it in the Cosmos category just as we did with Co-Processors.
We are also fixing the Shadow Serpentis RCU to match the other faction variants in effectiveness.

Micro Auxiliary Power Cores
Micro Auxiliary Power Cores (MAPCs) will also only need one named specialization, but in this case we are making special consideration for owners of the currently Meta 4 Micro 'Vigor' Core Augmentation. The current metas 1-3 named MAPCs will be converted into the new Compact Compact Micro Auxiliary Power Core but the Vigors will be turned into Navy MAPCs over downtime.

Light Missile Launchers
For the Light Missile Launcher group of modules, we have room for two distinct named specializations. The Compact Light Missile Launcher will specialize in reduced fitting requirements, while the Ample Light Missile Launcher will specialize in extra missile capacity.
The current ‘Limos’ and TE-2100 light missile launchers will become Ample Launchers, and the current ‘Malkuth’ and ‘Arbalest’ launchers will become Compact Launchers.
We are also making some general balance changes to the Light Missile Launchers as a whole. The time between module activations of LMLs will increase by ~6.66%, resulting in a slight decrease in total DPS. This change is being made to help balance the Light Missile weapon system, which received buffs that were a bit too strong back in the Retribution expansion.

Cargo Scanners
For Cargo Scanners, Duration and Scan Range are both important stats, while there’s not a lot of option for a fitting variation. So we’re going for two variations. One that has reduced duration, called Enduring Cargo Scanner. It has reduced cycle time and reduced cap need (3 instead of 4). The other has better range and is called Scoped Cargo Scanner.
To align the new modules better, we’re also reducing the CPU of the tech I Cargo Scanner from 5 to 4.
Surface Cargo Scanner I and Prototype Freight Sensors will become Enduring Cargo Scanners while Interior Type-E Cargo Identifier and PL-0 Shipment Probe will become Scoped Cargo Scanners.

Ship Scanners
For Ship Scanners, duration and range are also important, but the difference between Tech I and Tech II is less pronounced than for Cargo Scanners so making variations on those stats doesn’t make sense. However, fitting variation is much more viable due to higher CPU requirements. So we’re going for one named module, called Compact Ship Scanner, focused on reduced fitting requirements.
Ship Scanners also have scan falloff, as ship scanning results are not binary as they are for Cargo Scanners. The named variation goes for a scan falloff in between Tech I and Tech II.
No changes are being made to the Tech I and Tech II versions.

For Survey Scanners, the only thing that really matters there is the range. So we’re going for one named variation, focused on range and called Scoped Survey Scanner.

Capacitor Flux Coils
Capacitor Flux coils needed a pretty significant power boost across the board, so we are starting with that by bumping the net cap recharge boost by quite a bit and lowering CPU requirements for all variations.  We are lowering the number of named variations to two, one fitting variation and a second that has a reduced capacitor capacity drawback amount (but similar overall cap recharge).  Again, we are cleaning up the “basic” variants and collapsing them into one type.

As you can see, the changes arriving in Oceanus represent the tip of the iceberg for the module work that is coming your way over the coming months. This Module Tiericide project involves input from five development teams within CCP and we have high hopes that it will be just as beneficial as the Ship Tiericide initiative has been. Of course this also doesn’t mean that we’re going to stop our ongoing work on ship balance and on introducing new ships. You’ll be seeing a mix of module balance, ship balance and new items from release to release as we continue to charge forward with our 5-6 week release schedule.
Thanks for joining us for this dev blog, and I hope you’re looking forward to Oceanus as much as we are!
