For anyone who isn’t familiar with the Tactical Destroyers, they are new advanced ships created by the four great Empires of New Eden with the help of capsuleers like you! Last October we ran an event that encouraged players to participate in new research on the mysterious Sleepers of Anoikis. Players could choose whether they wanted to support one or more of the empires (or if they’d prefer to work towards their own ends) and the relative amount of support each empire received determined how quickly they would be able to release their new ships.
