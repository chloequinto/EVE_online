This filter is on by default, helping narrow down the options for the hull you are working on
Resources
Filters out modules based on their CPU, powergrid and calibration requirements. This filter relies on simulating each of the modules to get accurate values, and is therefore only available while in simulation mode. The first time it runs, it may take a few seconds to complete, but after that it should be near instant until hull, rigs or skills change.
This filter has 2 modes: Total resources and remaining resources, and you can switch between the modes through a right click option.
