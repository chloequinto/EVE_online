Greetings capsuleers!
Times have been very busy at CCP since Fanfest, and today I have updates for you on what's coming next to EVE, in our April 28thupdate that we are codenaming Mosaic.
Our new ship SKIN feature that lets you change the look of your ship from the fitting window and get a permanent license to fly iconic faction looks is a big part of it, but Mosaic also brings a slew of other changes. An extended version of our Opportunities system introducing new players to EVE will go live for everyone, along with the new Star Map that comes out of Beta and becomes the default map. Tactical Destroyers get a balance pass, warp speed rigs get a buff, there's new Blood Raiders and Serpentis Burner missions for Cruiser size ships, a new corporation role management UI, new force field and starbase construction visual effects, and some big changes to the mining prospects in 0.0 space. And then those Circadian Seekers and their Drifter friends always seem to be up to something new.
Take a look at all of these features on EVE Updates - our new website that shows what's coming to EVE Online: //updates.eveonline.com
