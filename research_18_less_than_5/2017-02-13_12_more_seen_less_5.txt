We are also going to show the progress of the scan in the actual scene when you are scanning specific signatures. When you select a signature in the probe scan window, a circle will appear in the solar system map to show which signature is selected and the progress of the scan. Your selection in the probe scanner window will be maintained in the solar system map.
When a scan completes, the site icons in the scene will animate to their new estimated location, instead of just popping there. We hope this makes it much easier to realize what happened.
We have also added a new colored state to the scan progress to address some defects we had about a signature showing green 100% but still not being warpable.
The color range will now be as follows:
0% to 24.9% - Red
25% to 74.9% - Orange
