Why Teams & Why Now?
One common question that has been raised is “Why remove Teams and not feature X?” Over the past few releases we have become bolder in removing legacy features such as Clone Grades and the Skill Queue Limit to name a few high profile ones that we believe are not positively impacting the overall gameplay experience in EVE. Following much internal discussion and analysis the development team felt it was not right for us to leave the Industry Teams in their current state. In the case of Industry Teams we want to react more immediately before the system becomes difficult to address—which becomes much easier with the new release cadence we adopted this year. Low use is one of many contributing factors, but certainly not the only or most important one. As the EVE development team begins refocusing its efforts on other areas of the game, we want to make sure we are leaving industry in a good state, technically, for the health of the game and for you as players. 
That being said, we want your input and feedback on what is ultimately a very rare course of action for us. While we feel we have done our due diligence in assessing the current implementation of Teams, additional context from you is always appreciated.
