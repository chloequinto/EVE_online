Flagships must still follow all non-metalevel based fitting restrictions, including any restrictions that ban module types or limit the number of a certain module that can be fitted.
A flagship costs the same points value as for a normal ship of its type.
You are under no obligation to field your flagship in any given match.
If your flagship is destroyed, it may not be fielded again during the tournament.
Victory Conditions
During a match, a team scores points for each enemy ship it kills, equal to the tournament points value of that ship. The team that has scored the most points at the conclusion of the match, or that destroys the entire opposing team, is the winner.
If a team chooses to field less than 100 points, non-fielded points count towards the opponent's score.
If a fight is tied after 10 minutes, time dilation will be used to progressively speed up the tournament solar system and encourage a prompt end to the match.
In the very unlikely case that a fight is tied after 15 minutes, the victory will be awarded to the team that had more collective potential team DPS at the beginning of the match, as measured by the tournament automated “attack bar”.
