Once they leave, this site will quickly despawn and they will have to look elsewhere for their mining and shooting needs, which leads me to…
NEW PLAYER LANDMARK SITES
We have also introduced a new landmark site in each starter system. This site is available to all players and has some asteroids as well as a few NPCs which will respawn quickly. These NPCs (along with the ones in the starter site) drop some civilian modules and civilian module blueprints, allowing new players to easily check out ship fitting and industry.
We hope to follow up with more changes to starter systems and starting characters to make sure new players have access to a wide range of experiences and tools from the very start.
