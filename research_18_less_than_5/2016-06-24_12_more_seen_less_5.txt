In addition to a significant number of capital components, building the new Serpentis capital ships will require a special component unique to the Serpentis corporation designs. The Serpentis Modified Capital Microprocessors will initially drop from special Serpentis Shipyard and Research Facility during Shadow of the Serpent, and will begin dropping from Serpentis capital ship NPCs in Nullsec space in the future.
