The four stations in Thera will each have a full set of services, including cloning, office slots, and manufacturing. You will be able to set these stations as your medical clone location, and install Jump Clones if you wish.
Thera has multiple static connections highsec, lowsec and nullsec space as well as access to wandering wormholes and K162 connections that can connect it to W-space. The result is a system that is much more connected to K-space than to W-space.
None of the connections to Thera will admit capital ships (freighters will be able to squeeze in), none of the stations in Thera will allow capitals to be built, and there are no moons for starbase anchoring. This means the system will only ever contain sub-capital vessels.
Thera is the largest system we have ever had in EVE. The stations are spread between three different planets at the edges of the system and warps between them can be up to 342 AU. The vast distances and huge number of wormholes ensures that keeping a lockdown on all of the stations and wormholes in the system will be exceedingly difficult, although we expect it to be an extremely dangerous place.
Anchored warp disruption bubbles will not be usable within Thera, although interdictor and heavy interdictor bubbles work normally.
Thera does not have a system bonus effect.
Thera contains wormhole signature and anomaly sites appropriate for class 3 and class 4 wormholes, as well as all the different types of wormhole gas mining sites on par with a class 6 wormhole system.
Thera does have distinct visuals including new unique station skins for the Sisters of EVE, a new nebula and a new sun effect.

The Thera system is colonized by a research expedition organized by The Sanctuary corporation, and more information about their presence in Thera will be revealed bit by bit in the future.
As always, we know that our players will take EVE’s new features in creative directions that we at CCP can never fully foresee, however we do have predictions for at least a few of the ways these systems will add to the diversity of experiences in EVE.
The shattered wormhole systems should represent an excellent “neutral ground” for wormhole entities that might be hesitant to engage in a system containing hostile starbases. They will also be an excellent reward for pilots bold enough to mine ice or run anomalies outside the security of their home wormhole. And although it will be more difficult to live in a shattered wormhole system without the use of starbases, we know that some of our players will find a way like they always do.
