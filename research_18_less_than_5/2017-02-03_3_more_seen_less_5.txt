Day 4 recap
That‘s it for now. We look forward to receiving and reviewing applications for CSM 12 and to opening the voting page on March 6. February and March will no doubt be marked by extensive campaigning and for those of you who’ve never been through a CSM campaign period before, it should prove exciting, informative and entertaining. Please use the time to study the candidates and their platforms and think about what you want for EVE’s future. Your vote counts.
