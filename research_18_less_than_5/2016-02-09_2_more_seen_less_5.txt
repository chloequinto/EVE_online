To accompany the new camera modes, we’ve cleaned up the camera settings section in the System Menu (ESC). We’ve unified all camera related settings under the one “Display & Graphics / Camera Settings” section, added settings for “Camera speed”, “Invert Y-axis” as well as options to disable the new Orbit Camera “Ship Speed Offset” and “Dynamic Field of View” as we recognize that the more dynamic behavior simply isn’t for everyone.
For those of you that don’t agree with us that the old camera needed a bit of work can simply turn off those two options, crank the camera speed up a bit and stick with the Orbit Camera, making the experience pretty much identical to the old setup.
NOW WHAT?
