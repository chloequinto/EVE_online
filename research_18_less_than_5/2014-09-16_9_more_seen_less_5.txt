Hello my space snowflakes!
I’m CCP Rise and I’m here on behalf of Team Pirate Unicorns (AKA Team EFT Copy Paste, Team Tool Typpi and Team Ishtar4life) with news about something we’ve got coming for you in Oceanus on September 30th – Notifications! Notifications will give you feedback and information about all the deadly, creative, regretful and/or awesome things your characters are doing in New Eden!
