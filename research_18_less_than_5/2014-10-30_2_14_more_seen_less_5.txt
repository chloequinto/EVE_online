**MEDICAL CLONE MOVEMENT CHANGES**
You can normally only move your medical clone to the station you are currently docked in.
You can always set your medical clone to your starter corporation’s HQ station.
This removes the method of moving your clone and then podkilling yourself to quickly teleport at will.
Once per year, characters can move their medical clone to either their corp HQ, or any station in which their corporation has an office. This option does not accumulate if it is unused.
For characters less than 30 days old, every time they change corp this counter will reset and they will be able to move their clone again.
This makes it easier for new players to move to where their new corp is based, now that they can no longer podjump there. Older players are assumed to be capable of relocating themselves without assistance.
