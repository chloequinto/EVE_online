Wealth of Unseen Art
This book contains a plethora of unseen material, along with some classics. We discovered that much of the original concept art from EVE was sitting in dark, musky drawers, deep in the bowels of the art department. Those were rescued, scanned and filed. For digital art, servers and backups were scoured. Every nook and cranny of the internal CCP network was crawled in a relentless art preservation and data gathering effort that would have made national museums and intelligence agencies proud. The art must be unearthed.
