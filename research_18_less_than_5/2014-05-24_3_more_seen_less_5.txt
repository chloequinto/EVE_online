The class rotation is set up such that if a student could only take classes on a single day, they should be able to complete the classes in 4-6 weeks, depending on where they enter the rotation. However, if they have more flexibility, they should be able to complete everything in about 2 weeks. Instructors also often volunteer to hold unscheduled training to help students who are unable to make regularly scheduled classes.
Students have 90 days to complete the program, though extensions are made on a case-by-case basis.
Advanced training is available to instructors, though it is usually held on Singularity as private lessons or in seminar format.
Challenges
Being a university in EVE isn't easy. “First and foremost, the bar for entry … is pretty low,” says Bren. “We don't charge anything. We figure it actually costs us money to train a student. We provide this service because we find enjoyment in developing other players.”
Many students join 0UCH to give EVE one last chance to excite them. “If we keep that guy playing, then we've done our job,” Bren proclaims. “So long as we've got people who think it is fun to teach newbies and get killmails, we will keep doing it.”
