As you can see, the changes arriving in Oceanus represent the tip of the iceberg for the module work that is coming your way over the coming months. This Module Tiericide project involves input from five development teams within CCP and we have high hopes that it will be just as beneficial as the Ship Tiericide initiative has been. Of course this also doesn’t mean that we’re going to stop our ongoing work on ship balance and on introducing new ships. You’ll be seeing a mix of module balance, ship balance and new items from release to release as we continue to charge forward with our 5-6 week release schedule.
