There are several reasons why we want to do this:
We want to break up the EVE game server into more manageable parts and this is one of the steps that gets us closer to a Microservices Architecture.
Text chat accounts for a significant portion of CPU use on the game server's proxy nodes.
Running text chat as a standalone service with an industry standard protocol opens up new future of possibilities.
Easier access to text chat logs for Customer Support.
In the short term, this change should not affect you at all - if we did it right then you will hardly notice a change.
In the long term, this a step towards keeping EVE alive forever, and future proofing New Eden for decades to come.
As always, we'd love to hear feedback, so please be sure to head on over to the feedback thread for this dev blog on the official EVE Online forums.
There'll be a more detailed blog in the coming weeks once the March release has been deployed that explains this change in more detail.
Until then, fly safe!
