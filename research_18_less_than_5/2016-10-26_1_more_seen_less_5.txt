NOVEMBER HERE WE COME!
We’re really glad that we’re finally able to enter this next phase of community discussion and feedback about Command Bursts, and we’re especially excited that we’re finally this close to releasing the revamp of fleet boosting roles that have been in the works for so long. We have talked to many of you on the forums, twitter, Fanfest, EVE Vegas and other events about these systems and we know how important this rework is to many of you in the community. We know that many of you have opinions and insight to contribute on this topic, and we encourage you to pass your feedback to us through the official forums, in person at upcoming events like EVE Vegas and with the help of the CSM. All of us here at CCP are going to be working very hard over the next few months to iterate on these designs with help from your feedback, and we can’t wait to get them into your hands on the test server as soon as possible.
