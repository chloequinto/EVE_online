We want to give a great loud shout out to all of you who have been helping us test and stress these features on the Singularity test server. Your time spent contributing to help us get these structures and all of the supporting features we have planned into a releasable state has been invaluable. We want you to know that we appreciate your help.
Thank you from all of us, not just on Team Five-0, but throughout the Eve Development team.
