Does this make it too difficult for new pilots to get out into 0.0?
Yes, it probably does. Following further discussion after publishing this dev blog, we have come up with the following additional feature:
For players less than thirty days old, once per player corporation joined, or
For all players greater than thirty days old, once per year:
You may push a button in your corp interface (while a member of a player corp and docked) that:
Moves your medical clone to a station designated by your corporation, and
Then moves you to the (new) station containing your medical clone
The exact method of corporations designating the target station is still being ironed out, but it will involve at the very least being able to designate a default station for all corp members and will likely be allowed for any station with a corp office, regardless of system sec status. This seems to us like it solves the "I want to recruit people to Nullsec" concern, and also gives non-Nullsec recruiters an easier way to get genuinely new players to the right location quickly and easily.
Is the balance for Black Ops final?
No. Please give feedback!
