0UCH was originally founded by an EVE blogger named Black Claw in 2009. He believed the best way to learn how to survive in null sec was to go out there any lose some ships. “He founded 0UCH as a school of hard knocks,” explains Bren Genzan, the school's Director of Operations. It followed in the footsteps that EVE Uni had laid down, but focused its attentions on null sec.
“Many larger alliances and organizations scoffed at the idea,” says Bren. However, their skepticism proved unfounded, as about 200 people joined up to PvP and PvE in null sec space. Despite this early success, the university went through growing pains. There were “political infighting, war decs, and leadership turnovers common to all corporations and alliances” according to Bren.
After that first year, however, they moved the majority of its operations into Curse. The hostile, high-traffic region of NPC null sec proved to be a perfect place for them. They refocused their training entirely on null sec survival and basic combat.

Much like a real university, 0UCH runs a formal program. Their training consists of live lectures, broken into nine modules in four classes. They place an emphasis on hands-on training and direct interaction with the teachers.Much like a real university, 0UCH runs a formal program.
