Unlike previous years, we will not be providing support for teams practicing on Singularity or Duality. Instead, we now have a dedicated events server called Thunderdome that will be made available only to participating teams for practice usage. This server is hosted on dedicated hardware rather than Virtual Machines, and will allow teams to practice at their own leisure using the same tournament tool the tournament is run under. More details about server and how practices will work will be coming at a later date, so make sure you keep watching the EVE Alliance Tournament Discussion section
