CORPORATION INSURANCE IN UPWELL STRUCTURES
Corporation insurance is a feature that allows a corporation to insure a ship before distributing it to one of their members, which then sends the insurance payout to the corporation if the ship is destroyed.
This is a longstanding feature of the insurance system in normal stations and outposts, but we were initially unable to add it to Upwell structures due to some technical differences between corporation hangar systems in different structure types. Recent improvements we have made behind the scenes have had the additional benefit of allowing us to add corp insurance to Upwell structures in August. This is another step towards full feature parity between stations/outposts and Upwell structures and will be especially useful to large corporations.
PHASING OUT OF LEGACY STARBASE INDUSTRY BONUSES
As a quick reminder, there are also a few other previously announced changes coming in the August release that bring us closer to the release of Refineries and complete replacement of Starbases with Upwell structures.
As we announced in this dev blog and this forum post, we will be phasing out industry bonuses in starbase structures.
This means that starting in the August release, Starbase Reprocessing Arrays will only provide a 50% refining yield, Starbase Assembly Arrays will not provide any material or time bonuses to manufacturing jobs, and Starbase Labs will not provide any time bonuses to research, copy, or invention jobs.
These structures will continue to work for the near future, but without their previous advantages over stations.
Any jobs started in one of these structures before August 15th will complete with the bonuses intact.
These structures have been impossible to build since May, and their usage is now very low since more convenient and powerful alternatives exist. This step will continue our progress towards replacing the legacy starbases with easier to use Upwell structures.
