In the Rhea and Tiamat releases we introduced two of the most exciting new ships EVE has seen in a very long time. The Amarr Confessor and Minmatar Svipul are the first two members in the new Tactical Destroyer class, and have the ability to change between three different tactical modes on the fly. We’ve been very happy to see players embracing this new gameplay and enjoying the ships, but we’ve also been hearing the legitimate feedback that these ships are a bit too powerful relative to their competition.
