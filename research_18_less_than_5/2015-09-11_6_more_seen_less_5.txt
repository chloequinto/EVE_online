Hello spacefriends!
Team Five 0 is hard at work on our next set of iterations to sovereignty (as well as some changes to Jump Fatigue) and we're ready to get your feedback on some of the changes scheduled for the next two releases. These are the second set of major iterations to the Sov capture system since Aegis, with the first set having been released in our earlier Galatea release.
The first of these changes is scheduled for the Vanguard release on September 29th, and the rest will be coming in the Parallax release on November 3rd.
As always, we want to express our thanks to everyone who has been providing valuable feedback on these areas of the game, as well as all the players who are engaging with the new sov capture system on Tranquility. We've been watching and listening very closely and we couldn't do all of this without you.
