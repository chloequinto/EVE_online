The Pulse Activated Nexus Invulnerability Core is a new module that represents one of the many optional tools available to Rorqual pilots after the November Rorqual changes. This module can be used to make yourself and your industrial allies invulnerable for a limited time if needed for any reason.
This is just one of the many enhancements that the Rorqual will be getting in November and we’ll be going into more detail about it in the upcoming dev blog.
