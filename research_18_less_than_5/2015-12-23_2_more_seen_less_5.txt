CCP Affinity:
This has been a great year! I had so much fun at Fanfest, Vegas and the LA player meet I had the opportunity to attend.  I got to meet so many awesome players and chat about where we should take PvE in the future.  My favourite part of 2015 has been involving players so much more in storyline.  Storyline in EVE has taken a crazy, awesome turn this year and that is thanks to each and every one of you!  From participating in events, coming up with crazy theories on who the Drifters are, creating podcasts and blogs, participating in the Amarr Championships. I am so thankful for each and every one of you and the enthusiasm you put in to the lore and your help in taking storyline to the next level.
