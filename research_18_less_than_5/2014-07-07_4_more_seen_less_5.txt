Skillless module fitting
As you know there are wonderful people out there that add massive hangarsfull of fun to the game for the rest of us by spending their time fitting ships for their corp members. To make things easier for those people (because we all love them unconditionally) Team Super Friends has made it so you can now fit modules and rigs you don‘t have skills for.
This means the modules cannot be onlined and if you try to undock in a ship that has modules offlined because of that, you will see a giant warning telling you why  and asking you to confirm whether to undock or not. That warning will be suppressible if you really don‘t want to see it again.
Rigs will also be fittable without skills because you can already fly ships with rigs fitted by your skilled friend. We know this means some people will be angry because they trained rig skills and feel like they‘ve spent valuable skill training time on something that now doesn‘t matter, and we get your point. But some of the rigs have drawbacks when you don‘t have the skills for them and in the future we‘re thinking about adding drawbacks to more rigs.
This is what we have for Crius but we also wanted to highlight a few little things we already added to EVE in Kronos.
