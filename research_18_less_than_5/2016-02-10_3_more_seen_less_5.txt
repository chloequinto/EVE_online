As such we are going to allow the four existing fuel blocks to work with the Citadels for greater flexibility. Since Citadels don’t use Strontium Clathrates for their reinforcement mode, we will add this particular material into the composition of the four existing fuel blocks to maintain its demand. The current number we have in mind is 400 units of Strontium Clathrates for a batch of 40 fuel blocks.
