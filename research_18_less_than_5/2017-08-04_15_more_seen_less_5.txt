Persisting Cosmic Signature scan results
Adding the signature ID to the front of bookmarks when using the save location option in the Probe Scanner
From the August release onwards, scanning progress will be stored until you restart your client. The results will no longer be cleared when docking, jumping wormholes, or doing basically anything else that would have previously caused a session change and cleared the list.
This will only be for Cosmic Signatures. Anything located with combat scans will not persist, such as ships, citadels etc
Another quality of life improvement we have seen players ask for is the addition of signature id when saving locations from the probe scanner. This will not change any behavior of bookmarking, so you will still have to warp to a wormhole to bookmark the actual wormhole if you want to warp at 0. In this situation, you would have to manually add the signature ID.
