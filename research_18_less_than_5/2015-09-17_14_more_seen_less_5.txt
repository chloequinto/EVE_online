As mentioned in the previous blog, all structures will have warpable signatures like combat anomalies. They will also show up in space / overview whenever the player can dock inside them
Timers related to the current state, or next available state will always be visible on the structure icon, in a manner very similar with the existing deployables. Of course, players not belonging to the corporation owning the structure need to be on grid to see them
Some examples:
If the structure is invulnerable, a timer will be shown counting how much time left before it is vulnerable again
If the structure is vulnerable, it will display for how long it is going to be before becoming invulnerable again
If the structure is being repaired, a timer also will be shown before it fully regenerates – if the timer is paused due to incoming damage this particular condition will also be displayed
VARIATIONS, GENERAL NOTES AND YOU
There is a certain number of special cases we wish to tackle specifically in this blog, to avoid the recurring questions we’ve had in the past.
The current plan is for those structures not to have auto-defenses. This is still left to be debated, but we do believe existing auto-defenses on Starbases are nothing but a false promise to safety, since they are so easily abused and bypassed by attacking parties. They just give the owner a feeling of safety where none actually exists, like having a completely out-of-date firewall and anti-virus on your computer.
