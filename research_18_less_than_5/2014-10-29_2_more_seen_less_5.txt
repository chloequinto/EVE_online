CSM9 Winter Summit
So, since we just visited the past, it's time now to talk about the future! Tune in for the CSM9 Winter Summit that will be held from 20th to 23rd of January 2015. Yes, you are seeing it correctly – we have increased the duration of the CSM Summit by 1 day. We feel that cramming the summit into three days sometimes leads to burnout for CSM members and can result in the last or first few session of the day dragging out a little. We want to make sure that both the CSM and CCP get the most possible benefit out of each summit, as it's something we take incredibly seriously. This extra day means that the CSM will be even more involved in our work than ever before, and have further access to development.
