Single system Alliance Capitals
The one exception to the 7 day waiting period for Capital systems is that anytime an Alliance only has Sovereignty over one star system (as determined by TCUs) that one system will automatically become the Alliance capital. This means that Alliances taking their first system will not need to wait a week to gain the benefits of the Capital system defensive bonuses. It also ensures that when an Alliance is pushed to a final stand in its last system, that system will always gain the capital defensive benefits.
Any other changes to Capital systems will always require 7 days in order to take effect. This includes cases where an Alliance that controls multiple systems has lost its previous capital and is setting a new one.
