A few of them decide to stick around. “We teach and mentor those last few to become part of our fraternity,” Bren explains.
They've also had guest lecturers in the past, such as Azual Skoll of Agony Unleashed, who taught a course on interdictors, or BullMastiff of Appetite 4 Destruction, who helped them learn how to fight in multi-ship engagements.
An interesting thing they do for training is watch various PvP streams together. “For instance, we'll sit and watch Sard Caid, pick up tips from what he is doing, analyze it, and explain it to our students in a live commentary.”
Final Thoughts
0UCH provides a service that is essentially “boot camp”. Unlike other training organizations, they are interested in getting players trained quickly and efficiently in the basics, then sending them out into their own live-fire operations. Bren compares 0UCH to service organizations like the Rotary Club or Lions Club; providing services to the community for no remuneration, but rather simply because they like it.
“0UCH is doing that in EVE Online and no one really knows that we do,” says Bren.
