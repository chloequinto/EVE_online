Reprocessing Arrays
As mentioned in our “reprocess all the things” blog, we are revamping Starbase Reprocessing Arrays for Crius. Those will now provide much better reprocessing abilities. Below are their exact attributes.
Let’s go into a little more detail on how they are going to work:
Player reprocessing skills will be taken into account
Reprocessing time is instant. No more waiting one hour or even 10 seconds for the outcome minerals
Ore, ices and gas clouds may now be mixed together at the same time inside the structures – but modules cannot be moved inside the Reprocessing Arrays.
Reprocessing is done via a simple right-click > reprocess option, which of course can be used on multiple ores at once.
The Intensive Reprocessing Array may only be used in low-security solar systems and below. The standard Reprocessing Array, meanwhile, may be used everywhere, including 1.0 security systems.
