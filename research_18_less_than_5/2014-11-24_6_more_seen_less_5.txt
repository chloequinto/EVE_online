Searching for wingmen
There are many corporations in New Eden who are more than happy to recruit and train rookie players, and joining a corporation is one of the best ways to get a solid head start in EVE. As well as a list of educational corporations in EVE Online, we also have an in game corporation search tool that can help you find the right match for your playstyle.
There is no better source of experience and help than the existing players. Remember that this is a single-shard server, which means everyone plays on the same server. Notable places to check are the EVE subreddit, the New Citizens Q&A forum on the EVE Online forums, the EVE University Wiki and EVE101.com. If you have a Twitter account, you can see what clever things the other players are saying by watching #eveonline and #tweetfleet.
