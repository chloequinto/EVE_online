CCP Bartender: I was impressed by how focused and complete this project was. Valtyr has clearly resisted the temptation for feature creep and the result is a tool which does one thing and does it extremely well with no fuss.
CCP SnowedIn: Absolutely love the integrations in this app. Very clean and intuitive, does one thing well... great job.
