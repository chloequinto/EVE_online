The mission objective of The Agency is to bring content to you, the Capsuleer. To do that, we need to know what types of content there are, and one system was holding us back, the sites. As you know, there are many types of sites (Relic, Data, Combat, Ghost, FW, Incursion, etc....), and the old way of distinguishing these sites from each other was to look at their scan attribute, which, when more types of sites are introduced, becomes very limited.
