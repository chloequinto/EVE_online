Successful invention without decryptors now creates an ME-2%/TE-4% blueprint; material requirements for T2 items have been increased by 50% to balance this out as it means we’re no longer adding +50% materials due to negative ME, so that decryptor-less invention now requires 2% less materials than previously.
Decryptors have been adjusted to the new system with the TE bonuses doubling to reflect the fact that TE goes up to 20%. This leaves them in a somewhat unbalanced state, which will be addressed with the aforementioned upcoming Invention/Reverse Engineering changes coming after Crius.
To transition old blueprints, we'll be adding 6 to ME and TE for all T2 BPCs, and then converting them according to the above scheme. Thus an un-decrypted blueprint at ME-4, PE-4 will first become ME2, PE2 and then be converted to ME-7%, PE-14%. This is a one-time windfall to make the DB scripts for the transition simpler and more robust, so enjoy it while it lasts!
BASIC PRICING
Slots are gone. There is no longer any limit on how much work you can do in a given facility. Anywhere you can start an industry job of any sort, both stations and starbases, is a facility).
Instead, we have dynamic pricing to give an incentive to not just build everything in Jita 4-4. This is explained as the cost to hire necessary workforce in a given system.
