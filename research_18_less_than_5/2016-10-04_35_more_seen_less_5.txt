As you can see, the Industrial Core is now gaining a huge number of bonuses covering all three mining foreman pillars. It is receiving local tanking bonuses even more powerful than triage modules, and remote repair bonuses that are second only to triage. It is gaining ECM immunity and increased lock speed to help it support its allies. It is also gaining massive bonuses to drones that turn it into a combat powerhouse and a mining operation all on its own when used alongside Excavator Drones.
