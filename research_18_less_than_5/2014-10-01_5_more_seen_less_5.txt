What's next?
We will be actively participating in the comments thread of this blog and listening elsewhere around the internet.
These changes will be appearing on the Singularity test server in the next couple of weeks.
We anticipate shipping them in Phoebe, which comes out in November.
We are expecting to make follow-up adjustments in Rhea, in December.
The medium-term shake-out of these changes will be very impactful on sovereignty-system changes we are anticipating making next year, so we are expecting to revisit all this again as the work on those changes progresses.

**Update:** As mentioned above, we're taking feedback and responding in the thread, so look for those blue bars. Greyscale has also created a short FAQ that will be updated as needed as the first reply to the thread.
