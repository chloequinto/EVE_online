Build times are generally rank * 300 seconds.
T2 ammo is multiplied by a further x10, keeping their current batch sizes
T1 capital ships are multiplied by a further x25
T2 capital ships are multiplied by a further x4 (not cumulative with the x25 multiplier above)
Components have not had their build times changed at all, as they're balanced around specific build chains
