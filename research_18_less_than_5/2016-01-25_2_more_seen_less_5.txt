Greetings Capsuleers,
Would you like the chance to help build the world of tomorrow?
Your friends at Upwell would like to help make your dreams a reality.  
This is a very exciting time to be a citizen of New Eden! The Upwell Consortium has completed the design phase of the Astrahus Citadel and is ready to construct prototypes to test run their staggering new technologies before releasing construction and control of them to the capsuleer market. To accelerate their plans of allowing the establishment of citadels across the cluster, Upwell is seeking capsuleer assistance in securing research components.  
Upwell have been able to obtain enough research components to start the construction of the initial Astrahus, however, many of these components have found their way in to the hands of pirate contraband dealers and must be retrieved from Serpentis Exploration Sites and Ghost Sites.
From January 26th, Intaki Bank’s special accounts manager Lee Brinalle, will accept contracts (//wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Contracts_guide) from capsuleers for the item ‘Research Component’ to help build the citadels in 5 locations in New Eden. To reward you for your efforts, each Research Component contracted to Lee Brinalle, will entitle you to one entry in to an Upwell sponsored prize draw. The lucky winner of the draw will receive a unique token that can be exchanged for 1, fully researched, Astrahus citadel BPC.  
But wait there’s more! Upwell would like to create 5 prototypes in different locations, so as capsuleers manage to provide the Research Component quota  needed for the first citadel, Upwell will increase the rewards for each additional prototype citadel:
Citadel 2: One additional Astrahus BPC
Citadel 3: Two more Astrahus BPC’s
Citadel 4: One more Astrahus BPC and Upwell Branded Apparel for every capsuleer who contracts a Research Component
