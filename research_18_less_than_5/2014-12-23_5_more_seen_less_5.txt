Expanded Cargohold II – Structure Hitpoint penalty increased from 20% to -23%, Velocity modifier increased from -10% to -18%
These three changes should bring the T1 and T2 Expanded Cargoholds better in line with other module types, with the T2 version of a module giving the best performance but with higher drawbacks than T1.
