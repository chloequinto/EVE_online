We aim to have TQ Tech III up and running in very early 2016.
Then we will relocate what is soon-to-be-known-as “Old TQ” back home to Iceland to another data center with Verne Global (which is powered by mysterious geothermal volcano power).There we will host all the test servers like Singularity (Sisi), Multiplicity, etc with the best bits from Old TQ, plus some upgrades.
Starting then, we will begin replicating New TQ’s database from London to Iceland so we have a secondary site capable of taking over in case Ragnarök happens and is centered in England. 
You can expect another blog in beginning of November with pictures of the hardware being installed in Reykjavík and a progress report. 
 We in the Operations department are truly excited and proud of the TQ Tech III and what it means for EVE Online and its players.
That's enough writing it for now. Time to get back to the project!
