We believe that these new random wormholes will provide new opportunities for players interested in flying lighter ships than are common in the current wormhole meta, and roaming into nullsec with fast wolfpacks. They should also make it more difficult for players to completely close off their systems from external connections, ensuring that emergent player interaction remains a constant influence in W-space. We are taking feedback on both of these changes to randomly spawning wormholes in this feedback thread.
