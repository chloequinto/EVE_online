We’re quite happy with Red Giants overall, but we see an opportunity to push the theme even further through a new bonus to bomb damage. Bombs are less heavily used in wormhole space thanks to the prevalence of lower signature ships, but this bonus should help those players who wish to experiment with stealth bomber tactics in wormholes.
