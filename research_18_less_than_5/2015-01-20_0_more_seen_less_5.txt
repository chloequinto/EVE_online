THAT'S ALL FOR NOW FOLKS
You may have noticed we didn't include a release date in this dev blog or on the o7 show. The point of this announcement is to begin gathering your feedback on the feature while we work on it. We are not yet ready to announce a release date for feature. When we get closer to release we will have another dev blog that goes over the feature in its more complete state along with information about how we will handle the transition from the current paint system over to the new Super Kerr-Induced Nanocoating system. I hope you people are all as excited as we are for this.
Thank you for taking the time to read and fly safe.

p.s. Hyasyoda Automatic Transformation System was the runner up for what to call the new system.  ;)
p.p.s Kerr effect is a real term, no we didn't make it up. See: //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerr_effect
