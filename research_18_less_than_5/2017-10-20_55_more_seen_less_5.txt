Once a chunk is ready, the structure controllers will fire the Moon Drill laser at the chunk to explode it into an asteroid field of mine-able asteroids comprising the moon ores. Miners in the vicinity can then mine these asteroids as normal to receive the riches within them. All asteroids mined from this field will be logged in the Corporation Mining Ledger of the Refinery owning corporation and details about the ledger can be found here.
Please note that if no one detonates the moon chunk once it is ready, it will automatically explode into a field after 3 hours (or longer if the appropriate rig is fitted). This could happen if no one fires the laser, or the Moon Drill runs out of fuel after the extraction has finished, or if the structure has been reinforced.
Once a chunk has been shattered into asteroids, the Moon Drill can be used to start another extraction. A new extraction can be started before all of the asteroids have been mined out. The moon ore asteroids are also not perpetual and will decay approximately two days after the chunk is fractured. Miners are free to mine the choicest of rocks, leaving those less suitable to their needs to the ravages of the harsh vacuum of space. This decay lifetime can be extended up to four days with rigs, but asteroids will always expire before the next chunk can be fractured.
BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE! JACKPOT ASTEROIDS
On rare occasions the Moon Drill can penetrate a particularly rich vein of ore on the moon's surface and the resulting chunk will yield far richer treasures. Although the composition of the chunk will still correspond to the moon, the moongoo ore that is brought up in the chunk and blasted into the asteroid field has a yield of 100% more materials when reprocessed.
More details about the new ores that can be found in moons and how they will be distributed across New Eden can be found here.
