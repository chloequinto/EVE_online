Greetings Capsuleers!
Due to various important changes EVE Online has undergone in the last couple of years, there are new challenges to contend with in many areas. Unrestricted Alpha access and Skill Trading have led to an increase in account hijacking issues and lowered the barrier of entry for botting.
In this blog we will discuss some challenges we're facing today, what we're doing about them, and what you can do to keep your EVE Online account, characters and your stuff safe from thieves.
Please give us your feedback in the comment thread.
