On Friday December 4th @ 15:00 GMT a test server called Solace which is running on the TQ Tech III hardware will be available through the new launcher, so if you have not already downloaded the Beta version you should do so. 
We'd like you all to come and try out the new hardware with us so that we can gather some information on how smoothly it's running. All we need you guys to do, is be yourselves! Fly around, shoot eachother in the middle of the face, have some fun and enjoy some spaceship violence. We'll do the rest.
As part of the fun, when we bring Solace online for testing, we've decided that we're going to seed the market in a similar way we do with Singularity, and give you all maxed out skillpoints to play with during the test. We hope to see as many of you there as possible for some fun!
We think a massive fleet fight would be a pretty good test for this, so get your ships ready! We hope you'll join for a massive fight on Friday so that we can see how the new hardware runs!
Please bear in mind, however, that any characters or accounts created after 09:30 UTC on November 30th will not be accessible on Solace, as this is when the mirror from Tranquility was taken. We will not be reactivating any accounts that were inactive on Tranquility at the time the mirror was taken. Additionally, if you changed your password on Tranquility since that date, please use your old password.
Oh, and what's better than closing this Dev Blog with a picture of the new Tranquility Tech III hardware in our testing racks here in Reykjavik?
On a final note, the next blog in this series will be when we are setup and ready in London.
Expect that blog to be published late January 2016. Thanks for all the comments on the first blog! Reading the threads on the forums and on Reddit thread warmed our hearts and I can safely say this hardware is equally arousing to us:
Fly safe guys, we hope to see you shooting at eachother on Friday!
