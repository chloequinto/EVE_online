Greetings capsuleers!
CCP Seagull here. Today I am humbled and excited to tell you that I am taking on the job of Executive Producer for EVE Online. This means that my responsibilities have extended from navigating CCP’s development efforts to encompass the whole EVE project - the full overall direction.
For you as a player, that means that our vision and long term plans for EVE will continue to have full support and that we will develop EVE Online with both new ambition and respect for the core philosophy and designs of the game. If you want to understand some of the foundations of how we will do that, I recommend to go back to the dev blog I wrote when becoming Senior Producer. Apart from the change in how we create releases, the direction outlined there is what we are still working from. I also recommend a look at my presentation from EVE Fanfest this year if you want to recap our direction and plans!
