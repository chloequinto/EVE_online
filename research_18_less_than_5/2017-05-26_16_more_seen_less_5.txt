Hello adaptable capsuleers!
In this dev blog, we’ll be discussing some early information you need to know in preparation for the big Strategic Cruiser rebalance coming this summer.
We’ll recap the high-level plan, give you the first of many notices about how the patch day transition will affect you, and highlight the start of our new Strategic Cruiser Focus Group.
At the Ship and Module Balance presentation during Fanfest 2017 we discussed the plans for a major rebalance of Tech 3 Cruisers later in the year. This segment is available for viewing on our YouTube channel if you missed it.
The short version of the plan is that we want to address a few key issues with the current Strategic Cruiser design:
Rigs in their current state lock T3 hulls into a specific set of bonuses and prevent T3 Cruisers from achieving the goal of a “strategic” ship that you can adjust from day to day to meet your needs by changing subsystems
T3 Cruisers overlap too much with other ships (especially Heavy Assault Cruisers and Recon Ships) and their dominance can reduce ship variety
Many of the subsystems and subsystem combinations are underpowered and rarely used
The current state of T3 Cruisers is unsustainable from a technical graphics perspective
To solve some of these issues we are currently working in the following directions:
Condense the available subsystems into a smaller number of more powerful and useful choices.
The current plan is to have four subsystem slots with three choices in each slot
A general rebalance of the T3 Cruiser class which would include (among other things):
New faction-specific build components sourced from WH space
Dual tank bonuses for the Loki
Some power reductions to long range combat alongside the nullification subsystem
An increase in signature radius and mass
Allowing rigs to be freely removed from Strategic Cruisers without destroying them
