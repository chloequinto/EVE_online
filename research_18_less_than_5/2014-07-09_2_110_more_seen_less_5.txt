Window Polish
We’ve polished the team view in the industry window quite a bit, based on testing and feedback. For example, here’s some that came from players trying things out on Singularity, our test server:
When a blueprint is selected, the team list is automatically filtered based on the blueprint, showing the correct filtering settings.
Once a blueprint has been selected, it is possible to filter teams based on job type on that blueprint, for example copying teams or manufacturing teams.
Filtering team Specialties is now better, with better sorting and an improvement to comparing between teams.
We added an option to limit the view to active teams in the system the selected blueprint is in, to support setting up jobs remotely better.
