I hope you are all as excited about these changes as we have been imagining and coding them. We will have more devblogs over the coming months, going into specifics about each of these topics. Tell us what you think, including suggestions and concerns. Over the coming weeks we'll be posting how you can apply to be a part of the capital focus group. Keep an eye out for that!
