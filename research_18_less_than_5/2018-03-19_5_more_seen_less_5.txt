The Salvage option for salvage drones has been moved to the top of the right click menu
Volume information has been added to the 'Material input' and 'Output' tooltips in the Industry window
The right click options that have been categorized as potentially especially destructive will now have a red ! in front of them. Among other things, we hope this helps to make it easier to differentiate between 'Reprocess' and 'Repackage'.
The contents of the 'My Structures' tab in the 'Structure browser' can now be fitered by typing a structure type or region in the filter field.
Shuttles and pods now have 90% reduction to effective distance traveled for jump fatigue.
Past Changes:
In EVE Online: Lifeblood, we released a small change to help you quickly see the magnitude of numbers you enter in buy or sell orders, contracts and any other input boxes. If a number higher than 10k has been entered in any input box, it now has a tooltip writing out the amount, for example:
45343 => ˜ 45.3 thousand
25000 => 25.0 thousand
9999000 => ˜ 10.0 million
15545640000 => ˜ 15.5 billion
