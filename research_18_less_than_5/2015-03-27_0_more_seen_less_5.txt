Comparing to the last year’s election we saw two spikes on the first and last two days of the election.

Despite a higher turnout, we noticed a drop in the amount of votes from our localized communities, which we consider a result of a lack of CSM delegates from said communities for the past few years and thus a drop in interest.
We are hoping to make the information about CSM more accessible to our localized communities.

As usual, raw data is available for downloading.
On behalf of CCP I would like to thank the delegates of CSM9 for their hard work over the last term and congratulate the newly elected delegates of CSM10 on their new roles.
We would also like to thank everyone who participated in voting this year. Please feel free to contact us if you have any suggestions or feedback about the Council.
