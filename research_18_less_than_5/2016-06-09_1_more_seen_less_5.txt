WHY CHANGE THE EVENTS?
We received a lot of positive feedback about the past year's events at Fanfest 2016 and at the CSM Summit, but this was tempered by concerns about event visibility. We've been relying on social media, web pages, emails, SCOPE videos, and word of mouth for the events so far, but that has still left some pilots frustrated by missing the call to arms. We want to fix that for Shadow of the Serpent!
Previously, if you wanted to take part in one of these larger events you would have to check EVE social media pages or find a link to the event page (e.g. //www.eveonline.com/thehunt/). After this you'd need to roam between systems hoping to find the event content. We think this put too high a barrier on participation for the new content and was particularly troublesome for getting your friends or new players involved!  We also want to ensure we can keep the events feeling fresh and exciting.  For the past few events we have released 1-2 new sites but we wanted to create a framework for supporting more playstyles and also experimenting with new types of PvE through events.  This new UI gives us a great opportunity to do that; we will be able to experiment with new types of content and release them through the Scope Network in events for eager capsuleers.;
Good luck capsuleers! We are looking forward to hearing your thoughts on the Shadow of the Serpent event coming to New Eden on June 28th and your ideas for future events!
