Starbase structures: Sized 20/30/40 for S/M/L turrets, 100/200/300 for towers, 40/60/80 for other structures based on CPU usage (40 is below 200, 60 is below 750, 80 is above that)
Rigs: sized 5/10/15/20, multiplied by 10 for T2
Everything else: assigned on a case-by-case basis
With a few exceptions outlined below, the combination of rank, classification and tech level determine a blueprint's stats.
Build times are generally rank * 300 seconds.
T2 ammo is multiplied by a further x10, keeping their current batch sizes
T1 capital ships are multiplied by a further x25
T2 capital ships are multiplied by a further x4 (not cumulative with the x25 multiplier above)
Components have not had their build times changed at all, as they're balanced around specific build chains
Special edition ships (including all the skins) have their build time set to 10 seconds
