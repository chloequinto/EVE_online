Over the past month or so, we've been working closely with several active members of the third party developer community, including:
Steve Ronuken, CSM member and creator of fuzzwork.co.uk
Lucia Denniard, prolific #devfleet poster and pizza-auth/timerboard.net developer
Squizz Caphinator, creator of zkillboard.com and evewho.com
We coordinated with this team, similar as with a focus group, to gain feedback on the early development cycles and some initial design decisions. Here's what they have to say about their experiences so far:
The introduction of ESI, while a new API, is similar enough to how CREST works, that conversion should be relatively simple. It also solves one of the huge bugbears of EVE API development. A lack of documentation and examples. The use of Swagger makes this a lot easier to work with, and some inconsistencies are being cleaned up as development happens. Finally opening up the ability to send EVEMail, as well as receive it, is a major deal, allowing for some automated services which couldn't otherwise be done.
