We are adding an option in the 'Compare tool' that will allow you to filter the Attributes list so it only displays those attributes whose values are not the same for all the items you are comparing. Hopefully it will make it will make it easier for you to drill down to what are the real differences between the items and what are the trade-offs.

Structures have been making their mark in the landscape of New Eden, and it therefore seems appropriate that they get their own tab in the solar systems' 'Show Info' windows, rather than being lumped in with Orbital Bodies, which they technically are not. Please note that just as before, the show info window will only show you those structures you have access too.
