At present I have 379 eve players on skype (mainly wormhole people) making it very easy for people to get hold of me.
I’ve managed to make all the CCP meetings except one and have written up a good amount of minutes for them.
Issues
Some CCP teams/groups make great use of the CSM, but I feel some groups don’t, be it they don’t think we would be interested, They maybe don’t see how we could of helped. I’m not suggesting we can help in every team/department, but if we don’t know about stuff we sure as hell can’t help.

What I've been up to!
One project that I am quite proud of has been my “From the Players to CCP” document. I created a document of questions and ideas collected from the player base over the months leading to the September Summit. I organized them into the session topics and printed it out. It was my go-to checklist during the Summer Summit and I attempted to get every question answered. I’m currently composing one for the Winter Summit.
