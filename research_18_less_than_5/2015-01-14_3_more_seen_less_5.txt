The same was very much true during the issues we experienced right after Fanfest relating to malicious damage made to the newly erected EVE sculpture in Reykjavik, with members of the council assisting behind the scenes to bring the issue to a timely and direct resolution.
As a player, before coming to CCP, I was never fully sold on the value or the validity of the CSM as an institution, and was often openly critical of it. After seeing the terms of CSM 8 and CSM 9 from “behind the scenes” during my time at CCP so far, that opinion has changed drastically and I’m looking forward to working with the tenth council in 2015 in order to further expand their role and their interactions with CCP.

2014 has been a year full of some really big changes to how we develop EVE Online. Almost every process for EVE development is touched by the change in how we release updates to EVE Online, and the structure and working processes for the CSM are no exception.
The 9th Council of Stellar Management have made great contributions to EVE Online during this year, giving us feedback on both designs for EVE and tricky community issues such as input multiplexing.
My goal for 2015 and how we work with the next CSM is twofold: To make it easy for EVE development teams to work with the CSM, and to find ways to give CSM more empowerment and direct access to information about development and plans so that they can keep bringing the player perspective into the heart of development of EVE Online.
