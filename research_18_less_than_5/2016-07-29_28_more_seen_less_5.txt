Alliance Tournament Medals
In previous tournaments, we have given ingame Alliance Tournament Medal inventory items for the teams that places first, second and third in the tournament. The number of medals granted was the same number as the maximum pilots that could be fielded in that tournament. We will be continuing to do this for Alliance Tournament XIV.
However, like Alliance Tournament XII and XIII, we will also be giving out medals to every character that was a member of the participating alliances on the first day of the tournament. These will appear on the character sheet, exactly like a medal awarded by a corporation. There will be medals for Tournament Competitor, Top 32, Top 16, Top 8, 4th, 3rd, 2nd, and 1st. Each character will receive only the highest medal that their alliance earned.
Remember, the medals will only be granted to characters in a participating alliance on the first day of the tournament (October 1st).
