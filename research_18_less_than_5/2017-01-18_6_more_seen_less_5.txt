Greetings citizens of EVE,
The CSM 11 term is in its second half and we’re fast approaching the elections for CSM 12! In this blog you should find everything you need to know about the upcoming elections for CSM 12, whether you’re running or voting.
If you’re new to EVE or to space politics, CSM refers to the Council of Stellar Management, a player advocacy group democratically elected by the players to advise and assist CCP in the continuous development of EVE. The CSM brings focused, structured feedback from the community to CCP and represents its views and interests. More information on the CSM can be found here.
