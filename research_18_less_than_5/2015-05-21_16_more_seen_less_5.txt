New Material
The p1 and p2 maps were once independently responsible for differentiating material surfaces on ship hulls. The initial PBR pass left this system in place, but in V5++, these maps have been combined into the material map mentioned above. All material information is now handled by this single map in four tone grey scale.
But wait, there’s more! Like an industrial strength mail order cleanser, this change introduces increased control over rust. The best way we’ve found to present rust in space involves the use of two separate materials.  In the previous 3-material system that was a bit too expensive; we didn’t want to be limited to two materials and one accent. V5++, however, allows a 4th material.  With the added utility we can now keep three primary materials, and have more realistic rust on Minmatar hulls.  The Amarr, Caldari, and Gallente hulls receive non-rust benefits in the form of improved metal and tech areas.
