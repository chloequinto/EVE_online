While the structures themselves have bonuses to Reprocessing, Upwell are also introducing rigs to improve the functionality exclusive to these new structures. These are focused on the activities that only these structures can perform: Reactions and Moon Mining. 
Rigs that effect the Moon Drill come in two sizes, Medium and Large.
Moon Drilling Efficiency - these rigs effect the volume of the moon chunk that is pulled from the moon, in relation to the amount of time set for the extraction.
Moon Drilling Efficiency Rig M Tech 1 - 2% volume/time increase
Moon Drilling Efficiency Rig M Tech 2 - 2.4% volume/time increase
