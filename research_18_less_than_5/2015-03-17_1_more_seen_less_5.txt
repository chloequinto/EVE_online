Greetings, stylish stream-watching capsuleers.
The Fanfest 2015 HD Stream is FREE this year! Three packed days of presentations, unveiled mysteries, interviews and nail-biting PVP action.
But that probably raises the question; what about the Fanfest goodies? For the last few years we’ve sold the HD stream separately and bundled it with the Fanfest digital items. This has been a popular tradition for many who can’t attend in person, who like to collect nice things or perhaps want to show their support for Fanfest. This year the Fanfest digital items include not one but THREE ship skins and we want to make all three of them available in alternative ways for those unable to cross the Atlantic Ocean to attend the greatest party ever held on a glacial rock.
To get your hands on these beautiful commemorative ship skins you can head on over to Account Management at right now, and choose from one of the game time bundles at the standard multi-month discounts.
