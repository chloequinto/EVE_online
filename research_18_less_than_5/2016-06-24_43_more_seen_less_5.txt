Hello valiant capsuleers!
We're happy to be able to bring you a dev blog today covering some of the exciting new Serpentis ships and implants that will be coming your way as part of the Shadow of the Serpent event coming in less than a week on June 28th. For more info about the release, check out EVE Updates.
If you haven't already read CCP Affinity's dev blog about the Shadow of the Serpent event, we highly recommend you check it out now. This event is the next evolution of our efforts to bring you enjoyable events tied to the in-universe EVE storyline and we're very interested in hearing your feedback so we can continue improving future events.
There's a variety of valuable rewards that will be available from this event, some of which will be saved as surprises. However today I'll be revealing a few of them and letting you know how you can get your hands on them!
These new items have all been developed by the Serpentis Corporation in conjunction with their allies in the Angel Cartel. The rapid pace of Serpentis tech advancement has shaken many of the other powerful factions of New Eden:
The other pirate factions are racing to catch up with their own research and development
CONCORD and the empires are taking steps to undermine the Serpentis narcotics income
Upwell has partnered with mercenaries to strike and Serpentis assets and steal blueprints
The upshot of all this maneuvering is that some of the new Serpentis tech is going to start landing in capsuleer hands earlier than Sarpati wanted.
