Solar System Window
The Solar System map has been decoupled from the Star map.  It now resides in its own resizable window accessible at the moment via either the new Probe Scanner or new Directional Scanner.  Right now there is no other way to access it, but this will change when the feature leaves beta.
Options can be found in the top left and right corners of the window.  We strongly encourage use of the filtering options on the left to reduce bracket noise in the map to fit your needs.  To the right of the filters, we have a “Focus on Location” button, which snaps the camera to center on your ship.  To the right of that there is an option to permanently align your Directional scanner to your camera.
Docking options are located on the right hand side of the window.  Beside the X, there is a square button you can push to make the map full-screen, to dock it to the left or right of the screen, and to return it to a floating window.  We have also added the system name to the header of the window.
Working with probes in the Solar System map has changed slightly.  Resizing probes by “picking” the sides of the spheres had caused some issues for people, so we added the ability to hold the Alt key and use your mouse wheel to resize the probes.  Initially we had replaced the resizing system with this solution, but after concerns from players over accessibility issues and laptops not having mouse wheels, we determined that both methods could happily live side by side.
There is one change that will hopefully come as a nice surprise to all you hunters out there – the radial menu in the solar system map now allows you to snap your Directional scanner to whichever celestial you select, making your hunting that much more precise.  Doing so also refreshes your Directional scan when your camera snaps to the location.  This works whether you have your Directional scanner aligned to your camera or not.
