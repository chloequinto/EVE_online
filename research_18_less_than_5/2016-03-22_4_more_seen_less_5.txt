There is no better source of experience and help than the existing players of EVE. Remember that this is a single-shard server, which means everyone plays on the same server. Notable places to check are the EVE subreddit, the New Citizens Q&A forum on the EVE Online forums, the EVE University Wiki, Brave Newbies Wiki and EVE101.com. If you have a Twitter account, you can also see what other players are currently talking about by watching #eveonline and the player created hashtag #tweetfleet.
In addition to this, there is a fantastic index of new player resources compiled on the /r/eve subreddit that can be viewed here.
