Changes in CSM management
In the week leading up to the summit CCP’s CSM management was transitioned to myself (CCP Guard) and CCP Logibro, both members of CCP’s community team. The transition was part of an overdue revitalization effort following a difficult few months where relations between CSM and CCP had deteriorated to a point where the CSM project would have been at risk without re-commitment and clear action on our end. Logibro and I had a lot to catch up on before the summit.
Together with the CSM, and with the help of key people internally, we managed to address much of the built-up sentiment of the past few months nd have a very productive string of meetings with the teams responsible for EVE, its producer crew, and some executives.
The positive energy of meeting face-to-face and talking in detail about all the topics detailed in the minutes below has been a great starting point for the rest of this CSM term. However, we will not allow ourselves at CCP to get dazzled by that positive momentum and lulled into complacency. It is on us to remember that nothing but consistent work and continued dedication will keep the CSM relationship working. In the coming weeks and months, we will continue the process to maintain and evolve a strong role for the CSM in EVE Online.
