Sovereignty Conquests
Generally the graphs displayed below are labelled with the date of the Jump Fatigue announcement blog (October 1st 2014) and the date of the Phoebe release (November 4th 2014). The lack of labels on the Y axis is intentional, as we want to minimize the ability of clever players to use this data to gain advantages over others. What I can tell you is that for the unlabelled graphs, the Y axis begin at 0 and increase linearly (no cheating). None of the data in the graphs below is normalized by any other factor.
The distinct time periods that are worth watching are:
The period before the announcement dev blog, representing the older activity patterns
The period between the dev blog and the Phoebe release, when many players were proactively dealing and shifting to prepare for the post-Phoebe game
The period after the Phoebe release, after which Phase One is in effect
Without further ado, let’s jump into the discussion!
