THE INDUSTRIAL CORE MODULE
(Click image for a larger, animated version)
The Industrial Core module will continue to be the most important unique module for the Rorqual, and in November it is gaining powerful new bonuses in addition to those it already possesses.
The Industrial Core deploys the Rorqual into a temporarily immobile mining support platform and magnifies all three of the mining foreman pillars.
In addition to the new bonuses provided by the industrial core, a new Tech 2 version of the core will be added in November, bringing it up to par with the similar Siege and Triage modules.
The stats and bonuses of these modules are:
Industrial Core I:
Requires Industrial Reconfiguration skill level 1
Duration: 5 minutes
Consumption: 1000 units of Heavy Water
