I transcribed nine of the sessions for the Summer Summit minutes. I write a weekly roundup of my CSM activities. This is a mixture of awareness with direct links to developers blogs and posts and personal opinion, thoughts, and input into the process. Occasionally, I write direct opinion pieces and appear on podcasts or take interviews when asked.
