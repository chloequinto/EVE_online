Fetch the base material quantities for manufacturing the item from your blueprint, from the blueprints.yaml file in the SDE. In the case of invention and reverse engineering jobs you should use the materials from the T2 or T3 blueprint instead.
Multiply each material quantity by the market adjustedPrice as returned from the /market/prices/ endpoint and sum them all together. This is called the base cost. For reverse engineering jobs with multiple possible outcomes calculate the baseCost for each then create an average.
