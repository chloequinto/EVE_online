**THE LATEST CAPTURE SYSTEM DESIGN**
This section of the blog will bring you up to date on the current status of the Sovereignty capture system design. We highly recommend that everyone read and understand our original dev blog covering the first public version of the proposal. These updates build upon the design that was laid out in that blog, and all the goals expressed there still apply.
