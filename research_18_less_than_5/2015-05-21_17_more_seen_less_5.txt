New Texture Maps
Our first PBR push last year added two new texture types to our system – Albedo to replace diffuse maps and Roughness to replace specular maps. With V5++, we are adding two new texture maps to all ships. Material now appears on its own, rather than being indicated two separate maps. By using a limited greyscale system, we have been able to expand the number of available materials per hull. We’ll discuss the benefits of that addition later on.
The Dirt map is completely new. This map will ultimately enable the display of a variable range of space grime, filth, and unsightly buildup according to selected parameters which are currently under consideration. Initially, however, the map is used to variegate the immaculate hulls of EVE at a predetermined level, providing contrast and color in addition to a little flavor.
Additionally, every ship now features an Ambient Occlusion map, once reserved only for capital ships. This enhances the realistic behavior of reflection on all ship hulls, reducing shine when a surface sits somewhere entirely lusterless. We’re still simulating the effect, but in a far more realistic manner than previously possible.
