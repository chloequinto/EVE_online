CCP Leeloo
CSM Coordinator
Despite some challenges in transitioning to the new release model in the latter half of the term, the performance and dedication of the delegates of CSM 9 has been exemplary, and we are looking forward to working with the next council in 2015, with the hope that many of the CSM 9 delegates will be successfully re-elected to continue their work.
Keep an eye on our official forums and this Devblog feed for more information regarding the CSM, and details of the upcoming candidacy and election periods for CSM X.
