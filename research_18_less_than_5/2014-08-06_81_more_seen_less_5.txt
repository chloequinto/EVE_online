As I mentioned earlier, one of our goals in the Hyperion release is to provide players more avenues with which to enjoy the random and unpredictable elements of wormhole life. One way we intend to reach this goal is to increase the prevalence of random wormhole connections that appear in W-space systems. We will be significantly increasing the spawn rate of all the existing wormholes that originate in W-space, as well as adding a whole new class of random wormholes with unique properties.
