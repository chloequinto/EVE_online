Extra Special
Each team has four team members. Each team member has its own specialty. The specialty dictates what jobs it affects and to what extent. The effectiveness of teams and team members was explained in the first blog on teams, but here is a bit more information on the specialties themselves.
There are a total of 134 specialties. They are divided amongst 6 types: Structure, Components, Consumables, Ship, Mobile and Equipment. The types are not of equal size, the Consumables one has a total of 11 specialties for instance, while the Equipment one has 50.
Specialties are either broad or narrow. Broad specialties affect more items, but generally have less effect, while narrow affect fewer items, but can have a higher impact. For a team to have a team member with a narrow specialty, another team member must have the broad specialty related to it. For example, Ammo is a broad specialty, with Hybrid Ammo being a narrow specialty. A team can thus never have a team member with the Hybrid Ammo specialty, without having a member with the Ammo specialty.
There are 39 broad specialties. Of those, 23 have narrow specialties linked to them. Each of the 95 narrow specialties is linked to a single broad specialty. A broad specialty with a narrow specialty associated with it can have a single one or as many as 10 (there are 10 narrow specialties for the Medium Class broad specialty).
Each specialty is linked to one or more item groups. Some specialties only affect a handful of items, while others can affect dozens. On mouseover on the specialty on a team, a tooltip appears listing all item groups affected by the specialty.
While giving an exact mapping is outside of the scope of this dev blog, we can give a complete list of all the specialties. In most cases, figuring out what items the specialty affects is fairly self-explanatory.
