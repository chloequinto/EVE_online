Service slots will use powergrid and CPU like regular modules.
Existing ship modules cannot be fitted into the Citadels, and vice-versa.
As mentioned on the “Citadels, Sieges and you v2” blog, the new structures automatically repair themselves during the repair state, as such there is no shield recharge rate on them.
The damage mitigation is a hard limit on incoming damage the structure can take in a specific amount. More details on the blog linked just above.
Citadels will be able to use fighter and fighter-bombers and their new mechanics tied to the capital ship overhaul also coming in the Citadel expansion.
It is likely that Citadel slots and fittings will not be fully used during first release. This is intentional as we plan to add more modules as time passes.
The new structures will be immune to most form of Electronic Warfare (EW) – specifically anything that can impede targeting, like ECM or Sensor Dampening.
