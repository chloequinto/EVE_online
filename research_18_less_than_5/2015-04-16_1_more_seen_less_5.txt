If you have any questions regarding alliance logos and the submission process, please post in this thread and they will be answered as soon as possible.
Questions?
What if I already have an alliance logo submission pending?
Since the technical requirements for alliance logo submissions have changed with this announcement, all previous and pending alliance logo submissions are now void.
If you would like to have your alliance logo displayed in game, you will need to resubmit it with the new technical requirements in mind.
When can I expect to see my alliance logo in game?
