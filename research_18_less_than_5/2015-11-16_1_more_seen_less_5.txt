Ensure you are actually on the CCP web site before entering your credentials
Ensure you have selected the correct character
Ensure the application is not requesting any permissions it should not be or that you are not happy with giving it
There are two permissions specific to fittings that players should be aware of. A web site or application can request:
characterFittingsRead: This allows the application full access to see all of the fittings for the selected character.They cannot however create new fittings or delete fittings with just this.
characterFittingsWrite: This allows an application to create and delete fittings. It however does not allow the application to see any existing saved fits.
If you ever feel like your information has been compromised, you can revoke an application or web sites access to your information from our site: //community.eveonline.com/support/third-party-applications/
