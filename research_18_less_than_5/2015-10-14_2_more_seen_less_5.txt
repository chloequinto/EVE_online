Hopefully by now you’ve watched this video, as seen on the EVE Updates site.
With the Parallax release, we are adding the necessary behind-the-scenes kill tracking for individual ships. This is in preparation for the availability of Kill Marks coming to ships in a subsequent release.
There are going to be a few restrictions about what type of kills will count towards a ship’s Kill Mark tally. Here are the current rules about which targets will be scoring:
Only player ship types will count. Shuttles, Capsules and Rookie ships are excluded, as are drones, NPCs, structures, cans, wrecks.
Ships must be owned by player characters. Ships owned by characters on trial accounts will be excluded. Ships owned by NPCs (or with no owner) will be excluded.
Ships must be piloted at the time of death. Unpiloted ships will be excluded.
Killing your corp-mates’ ships will not count.
Only the ship with the final blow can earn a point for a kill. If a drone, missile or bomb kills a target, the parent ship will count as the killer.
So start warming up those guns.
