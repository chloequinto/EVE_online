This time limited offer will add the amount of game time you choose to your account
For active accounts on a subscription plan: The purchased time will pause your billing until it is depleted, but will not alter the subscription plan you are on. It will resume unchanged.
For inactive accounts: Purchasing the time will put you on a corresponding recurring subscription cycle that you can cancel at any time
The ship skin/s will be available in the redeeming system upon next login
The ship skin/s will be delivered in the form of single run blueprint copies which can be used to build the skinned version of the ship
Those using in-game funds exclusively to pay for accounts should be able to pick up the ship skins on the in-game market from other players
