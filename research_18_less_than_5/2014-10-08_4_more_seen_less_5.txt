Compass Display
Besides adding more types of location to the Sensor Overlay, another objective of our iteration was to make it easier to see at a glance what locations are in your current system, and give more indication of where to look for them. To help with this we've added a compass display around the ship’s HUD. The compass faces in the direction of your camera and displays markings for all unfiltered Overlay items, color coded as they are in space. It also has handy markings that correspond to the compass directions and the lines in the Tactical Overlay. If you ever wondered which way 'Space North' is (shout out to CCP Antiquarian as he scowls at me every time I call it that), or yearned for a way to communicate direction to your buddies without having to reference celestials, then this should make you happy, even if you don't use the sensor overlay (Seriously though, total spoilsport).
