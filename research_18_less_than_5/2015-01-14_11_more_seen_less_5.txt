I started a proactive PvE fixing project. There were so many little irritations that I had heard the same complaints about since I started the game. I decided that now that I had more access to the development staff that I would see if I could get some of the daily annoyances cleared up. The project led to a balance pass on escalations released in Phoebe. During that, several DED complexes that had microwarpdrive restrictions were corrected. This has involved numerous small fixes to missions and complexes, improper accesses, and such things. The ability to warp your fleetmates to your escalation was added.
I have been running Open Question and Answer sessions. I try to run these monthly and have other members of the CSM in attendance. The goal of these sessions has been to collect problems, concerns, and thoughts as well as sharing what the CSM is up to on a one-to-one open floor format. I run these at different time zones during the weekend to cover as many playtimes as possible. I have also joined Corbexx with his soundboards having done one for PvE and another for structures with more planned. I have attended the CSM 9 Town Halls that have been presented. I have attended some of Corbexx’s wormhole town halls as well. I’ve also been available at local player gatherings and events such as Eve Vegas where I had many good conversations and even let myself be roped into a session on the live stream.
