The 3D Preview screen (accessed by clicking on the image icon in the Show Info window) will contain a copy of the left sidebar available in the fitting window. This sidebar will function exactly the same as the fitting window, with all of the purchasing and linking options. Because it can be of any ship, the 3D preview window will also allow you to preview and purchase any SKIN on any ship. 3D previews for specific SKINs are also linked from the show info window of a specific SKIN item. Simply find the SKIN item through in the market, or linked from the SKINs tab of the show info window for the desired ship. Then click on the hexagonal SKIN icon in the upper left to bring up the 3D preview.
