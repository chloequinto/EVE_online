Signal Amplifier: increases structure maximum locked targets and scan resolution
Reactor Control Unit: increases structure powergrid at the expense of CPU
Rigs:
Structure rigs will work a bit differently from ship rigs. While they require calibration and a matching structure hull size to be fitted, it will not be possible to fit more than one rig that affects the same attribute twice. For example, while you could fit the Medium Missile Application I and Medium Missile Projection I from the list below, it is not possible to fit both a Medium Missile Application I rig and the Medium Missile Application II rig on the Astrahus, or even two  Medium Missile Application I rigs.
Another difference is that structure rig bonuses will vary based on the solar system security-status of the structure they’re in. As such, low-security, null-security and wormhole spaces will always receive better rig bonuses compared to high-security structures. This is made to preserve the various changes in gameplay in those different areas.
Finally, rigs of different sizes will offer the same bonuses, but will cover more or less attributes. For instance, while a Medium Missile Application I rig would offer 10% increase missile explosion velocity, the Large Missile Application and Projection I rig will still give a 10% increase to missile explosion velocity while also increasing missile velocity by 10% at the same time.
There may be exceptions to this – for instance the reprocessing rigs below do not follow this pattern as we want to preserve existing reprocessing differences between structure types.
