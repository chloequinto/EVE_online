What are we changing?
We decided to look at all things that can be displayed in the Overview and put them into 4 primary categories:
Ships - All man-made objects in space that can travel/move
Structures - All man-made objects in space that don’t travel or move
Celestials - All objects in space that are not man-made
Other - Anything that doesn’t fit the definition of the other groups
