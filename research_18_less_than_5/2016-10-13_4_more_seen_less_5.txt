Hi pilots,
We from Team Psycho Sisters, a UI/UX focused team for EVE Online, have been looking at making skilling up your characters a bit more pleasant in parallel with our work on the Clone States feature coming in the November expansion EVE Online: Ascension.
We‘ve focused on streamlining the journey from wanting to fly a ship to buying all the skills and then training them.
YOUR NEW ID CARD AND A NEW VIEW OF SKILLS
The EVE Online character sheet has undergone substantial redesign. A new and improved header includes your character profile and basic ID at the top. Skill groups are now shown as a bar graph that doubles as an overview of your skill distribution. You can toggle the skill groups one by one and viewing group specific certificates is as simple as adjusting the filter dropdown menu. You can always search across skill groups using the search input above.
Other parts of the character sheet are still in their old format, but we have restructured the information and hope to give those panels an update in the future.
