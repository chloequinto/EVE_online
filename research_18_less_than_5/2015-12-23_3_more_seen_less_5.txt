CCP Mimic:
I am continuously surprised by the generosity of this Community and astounded that such ruthless players in-game are in fact the most caring and thoughtful people out of game. So many great player-driven movements and mini-communities exist, but one that has really stood out for me this year is the Care4Kids movement started by C4w3.
Hearing regularly about their progress from just a simple idea to pass the time in hospital, to full-blown Non-Profit Organization status and hearing about all the external media coverage they have been receiving in Sweden has been fantastic. The support from the EVE Community has been no less awe-inspiring and one of my personal favorites of the contributions players have made, are the coloring-book additions created by Rixx Javix.
Such a great addition to help these kids feel a little bit better and be introduced to the amazing EVE Online Community that all of our wonderful players have created. More can be seen here.
