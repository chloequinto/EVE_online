The small weapon bonus in Wolf Rayet wormholes is currently underused and overshadowed by the far more applicable Magnetar bonus. We also have some concerns about the power of the armor resist bonus in this effect, especially when combined with capital ships. The solution is to swap the resist bonus into a flat HP bonus like the one found in Pulsars and push the small weapon bonus far enough to create a truly unique combat environment. This huge bonus to frigate weapons will create one of the most distinct combat environments in EVE, which should nonetheless remain quite accessible to all players since keeping a small ship doctrine for your corp requires relatively little in skillpoints, isk and SMA volume.
