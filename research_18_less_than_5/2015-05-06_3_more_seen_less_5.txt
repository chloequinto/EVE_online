Over to Rixx Javix:
"I've always been fascinated by spaceships and the ships of EVE are uniquely powerful, complex and riveting from an artistic perspective. They are, in so many ways, the pure expression of ourselves within the game. They each have personalities and histories that are as individual as the people who fly them. That spirit is what I've tried to capture in these pieces.
The important thing for me was to treat each ship with the respect and knowledge that it deserved, to try and capture the elements that make it what it is, in an artistic design. To put on paper what it is about these ships that make them important to me. A unique spirit that lives within a universe of wonder, darkness and expression.
Removing the ships from the confines of how we normally see and experience them, within the rendered space of our computer monitors, brings the focus purely on the design of the ships themselves. These are objects of immense significance to anyone that lives and plays in the world of EVE Online, but they are also souls unto themselves, brought to life by thousands of players each and every day. In so many ways, they are us and we are them.
I am extremely encouraged by the overwhelming response these pieces have received from the EVE Community and from CCP Games. And I'm proud of our partnership with Quantum Mechanix that gives us the chance to finally bring these to a wider audience. It can be a daunting prospect to have your work open to the world and I hope the response continues so that we can bring fans of Eve, and fans of science-fiction and gaming, even more in the future."
