On sale March 20th at 15:00 GMT
The Limited Edition will go on sale Friday 20 March at 15:00 GMT/11am ET/8am PT. You cannot pre-order it. You have to make the order once it goes live. But take heed. It will sell out. This is not us just saying that. We realize it will sell out and after that, there will be no way to get one online.
Out of the 2001 copies, CCP staff actually got primae rights, so 110 have been purchased already by spaceship-loving CCPers. Another 150 went to Dark Horse Comics and will be sold at their booth at conventions and events such as San Diego  Comic-Con in July. A final 150 units went to IKON publishing in Australia, who will be making them available there. That leaves 1591 books available to order.
To keep shipping costs down, we split the stack in two and are shipping half out of the US and half out of Europe. Rest of world countries will received theirs from the US. So we have 795 units in the USA and 795 in Europe. 
We have created a custom page for ordering this edition.
