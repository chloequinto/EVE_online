Reprocessing will be the simplest and most universal of the initial Refinery roles. Refineries will receive bonuses when using the existing Standup Reprocessing Facility service module, and the existing reprocessing rigs will be rebalanced to go along with these new bonuses. On patch day we will automatically unfit existing reprocessing rigs that are fit to Citadels and Engineering Complexes so that structure owners can have the option of either fitting their rigs right back on to the same structure or moving those rigs to a Refinery if they wish.
Since Refineries will not have an XL version, the rebalance of reprocessing rigs will include improved generalization for the L and M sized reprocessing rigs and a reduction in cost for the XL reprocessing rigs. We will be issuing appropriate compensation for owners of any rigs that have their build costs reduced.
