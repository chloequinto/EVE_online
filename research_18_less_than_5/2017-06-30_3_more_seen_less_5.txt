As part of the analysis, you’ll be given tools that will allow you to fold the luminosity curve of over time, and chop the curve into pieces of a given length so that you can overlay them across each other. This can make it easier to define periodic drops in luminosity, as they’ll line up if the graph is folded to the same frequency.
You‘ll also have a detrending tool at your disposal, which attempts to filter out large scale events caused by the star itself rather than a transiting object. Pilots can set the granularity of the detrending tool so that it will only filter out events that take longer than the set time span (options are 1 hour, 5 hours, 10 hours and 24 hours).
