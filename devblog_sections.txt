0	english	 	 To the stargates and beyond	This change in how we update EVE Online is an important part of how we will bring about some of the biggest changes EVE Online has seen in years, as part of our vision for a universe more and more controlled by capsuleers, all the way to them mastering the technologies of space travel and breaking out of the known universe.	The line of titan releases marching your way will bring more and better EVE to you, more often. Expansions were for the last decade - expanding EVE with release after release after release is what we'll do in this decade.	As we make this change, we want your feedback - tell us what you think and ask questions in the comment thread!	/CCP Seagull – Senior Producer EVE Online Development
1	english	 	 (In animated format)	This work has been built up from some initial A/B testing efforts and then a deeper dive into how tooltips and other contextual information can benefit all players and assist in crafting a much better new player experience.	This is the only just the beginning and we have plans to considerably extend the scope of new tooltips in EVE and to offer advanced tooltips in the future. We hope these improvements are useful to you all as you navigate your way around the many opportunities New Eden has to offer.	@CCPDelegateZero

1	english	 	 Predictive Mouse Movement	This release has a significant extra feature courtesy of some UI programming work done on the side: predictive mouse movement in menus.	Say what now? Well, what’s happened is that a method has been added to predict if the mouse cursor is heading into an expanded menu, preventing a mouseover update on other UI elements if this is predicted to be so. This is enabled for the NeoCom menu, context menus and the new interactive tooltips.	This is shown below – red is the old motion required and green is the new way unlocked by the prediction method.
1	english	 	 (click to enlarge)	The all-important ship HUD is shown above with a selection of tooltips in composite. The displayed hitpoint readout, heat, capacitor and speed readouts are also tipped. All the elements have a tooltip and the modules tooltips have had a sprucing up.	At this point, we should mention that in general the response time of the new tooltips is much higher than the old “hints,” but we have made sure to tune the response time of the module tooltips to preserve the significant delay on them that we know is important in this case.	We are also improving the tooltips for many buttons such as the NeoCom above, as well as station services, the character sheet sidebar and the selected item window as indicated in the list earlier in this post.	This is not all though. We also have tooltips for all the elements of the Fitting Window, as seen in the following image:	This work has also been extended into tooltips for the key attributes of ships and drones in their Show Info windows. For example, as shown below:	The Star Map system tooltips have been much improved, with some streamlining and cleaning up of information. Where relevant they are also interactive: for example, with station listings when set to display services.	As part of this cleanup we’ve removed the large extended information on orbital objects in the system, including stations that would pop up after a short delay. However, to make sure the station information for a system is still readily available, this detail has been added to the Show Information window for star systems under its own tab.
1	english	 	 (click to enlarge)	This above image shows the new overview tooltips, demonstrating the status information that can be applicable in many cases (stations, containers, wrecks and NPCs are other examples), plus the new way of clearly presenting information on clusters of brackets in space. Notably, when the list of items is over 10, this interactive tooltip will be scrollable.
1	english	 	 Selected Item window buttons	Overview entries have tooltips showing icon, group name, and status information where applicable	Brackets in space have mouse-over tooltips and groups of brackets close together in space are listed in a scrollable tip	HUD buttons, hitpoint bars, heat indicators, speed readout, etc. tipped	HUD module buttons in new format but with a higher delay than other new tooltips to preserve the usability as seen currently	To give an idea of these, we have prepared some composite images for the dev blog, but these changes are now live and can be enjoyed on Tranquility.

The team here is all super excited to bring you another awesome tournament and we’ll be bringing you more info on the rules and tournament format in the next few weeks as we get ready to open signups for teams.	One aspect of the Alliance Tournament is already being decided: the player commentators that we fly out to Iceland to join us live on set for the last two weekends of live broadcasting. Giving truly diehard, committed players the ultimate trip to CCP HQ is one of my favourite things about EVE’s flagship tournament,. We take choosing these players very seriously and a large number of these players have gone on to work for CCP over the years.	Full details on this process are below, copied from CCP Gargant’s dev blog, but I want to bring one thing to your attention right now:	Signups for Alliance Tournament XII will close at midnight UTC on Sunday the 18th. That means you have just a few days left to apply to be a commentator!	Got your attention? Then read the details below:	As a commentator you'll be on the set discussing the tournament, tactics, teams and talking with developers about EVE live on air. You'll also take shifts in the commentary booth providing live commentary on the matches themselves. You need to know your internet spaceship PvP and you need to know how to keep on talking!	Alliance Tournament XII will take place over four consecutive weekends starting on Saturday, August 16th and ending with the grand finale on Sunday, September 7th. Flights (from all Icelandair destinations) and accommodations are supplied by us. All you need is a little spending money.	So you're interested? The next step is to check this short list and make sure you match what we're looking for!	Can you come out and play? Selected players will need to hold a valid passport (we will require scans to confirm this at a later stage) and be available to fly to Iceland on Wednesday, August 27th and return home on Monday, September 8th.	A sense of humor is a must: commentators will need to be sharp-witted, knowledgeable, presentable and comfortable with talking on camera and into a microphone. To increase your chances of getting through, we highly recommend submitting any pre-made or purpose filmed video you have of yourself (link to a YouTube clip or Twitch recording) as part of your application.	You need to know your PvP: We don't despise industrialists, mission-runners and miners but as this is a PvP tournament and you need to be well versed.	You must be 21+ in order to apply.	If you are interested in taking part, please email us at evetv@ccpgames.com by 23:59 UTC (Eve Time) on Sunday May 18th, 2014 with the following information. Those lucky enough to be selected for the second round of eliminations must be available to attend voice chat interviews on Saturday, May 24th, 2014. The chosen commentators will be announced by June 11th, 2014.
2	english	 	 QUALITY OF LIFE IMPROVEMENTS	Kronos will also bring numerous small improvements to make your playing experience that little bit more enjoyable. This includes things like reload and repair timers on modules, right-click menu option to clear all broadcast icons in the watchlist, and different HUD icons for warp scrambling and warp disruption. To find out more check out this post by CCP karkur, and keep your eyes open for even more little things.The full list will be available in the patch notes at release.	We may have a few more things making it into Kronos that we will update you about next week, but that’s it for now.
2	english	 	 SMARTER NPCS IN FACTIONAL WARFARE	Some tweaks are coming to Factional Warfare complexes so that NPCs will arrive repeatedly in an attempt to defend their base and will now behave a bit differently than before. Additionally the usage of cloaking devices has been prevented within 30 km of the capture points. You can read more detailed information here: //forums.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=posts&t=343137

2	english	 	 FACTION-THEMED STATIONS	In Kronos, all stations that are owned by a NPC corporation are now recognizable in space as they are now reconstructed with the same visual identity previously only shown on ships.
2	english	 	 THE MORDU’S LEGION BARGHEST BATTLESHIP	The flagship of the new Mordu’s Legion fleet is the mighty Barghest. This Battleship was developed in response to emerging threats from the Guristas. It is designed as a fast battleship with high-speed missile delivery systems along with increased range for warp scramblers and disruptors, making it fully capable of contesting the field with more traditional heavy skirmishers.
2	english	 	 THE MORDU’S LEGION ORTHRUS CRUISER	As Mordu's Legion raises its profile in low security space as an elite mercenary and security force, they have also developed the deadly Orthrus cruiser, coming in Kronos. Like the other Mordu's Legion ships, this cruiser has big bonuses to missiles as well as warp scrambler and disruption range. The Orthrus is at the core of the Legion’s new strike formations and provides the mercenary pilots a ship for executing rapid attack maneuvers.
2	english	 	 THE MORDU'S LEGION GARMUR FRIGATE	Mordu's Legion ships are focused on three main themes: exceptional speed and agility, high missile range and damage, and longer warp scrambler/disruptor range. The Garmur frigate will be available in the Mordu's Legion Loyalty Point (LP) Store in the Pure Blind region, but it can also be attained by hunting down rare Mordu's Legion ships in asteroid belts in low security space.	For the full range of ship properties, see this forum thread from CCP Rise. For full details, keep your eyes open for a dev blog coming out soon, showing all the new Mordu's Legion ships in their full glory.
2	english	 	 NEW VISUAL EFFECTS IN SPACE	Before Kronos, the solar flare effect was one of the oldest effects in EVE. Now they have been completely redone using new underlying technology and completely new graphics.  
3	english	 	 Fly safe!
3	english	 	 Nosferatu Thread	As most of you will have come to expect from us by now, we are also introducing a collection of new modules and module rebalances in the Kronos release to ensure that every player has an excellent variety of interesting choices to make when fitting their ships.	We are adding a new Medium Micro Jump Drive module, which is similar to the Large variant but can be fit to Combat Battlecruisers, Command Ships and Deep Space Transports. More details in this thread.	We are also introducing a new set of low slot warp speed modules called Hyperspatial Accelerators. These modules provide a flat bonus to a ship’s warp speed and will be especially popular with slow ships like Freighters. All the details can be found in this thread.	We are also adding new rigs in the Kronos release. Known as Transverse Bulkhead rigs, they add hull hitpoints at the expense of cargo capacity and will open up new options for effective honor tanking. All the details can be found in this thread.	We are also making improvements to Nosferatu modules in Kronos. All Nosferatu modules will cycle faster than before, increasing their effectiveness over time and making them even more useful for keeping other modules alive under extreme capacitor pressure. These changes pair especially well with the revamped Blood Raider ships that we have already discussed. All the details can be found in this thread.	I hope you have all enjoyed this walk through the ship and module balance changes of the Kronos release. We are very happy to be releasing all of these new and rebalanced ships and modules for your personal enjoyment this upcoming Tuesday June 3rd.	Until next time, this is @CCP_ Fozzie signing off.

3	english	 	 Dev Blog	Drones are one of the most popular weapon systems in EVE and are used on a huge variety of ships in a huge variety of situations. In the Kronos release we are introducing a huge set of changes to all kinds of combat drones in order to improve the experience for all drone users.	We are balancing drones between different factions (meaning that Amarr and Caldari drones should now be much more useful), rarity levels and sizes, we are making drones easier and more consistent for new players to train for, and we are adding new low slot Omnidirectional Tracking Enhancers.	We are also increasing the engagement range and optimal ranges of most drones to reduce the negative effects of a drone’s own orbit velocity on its tracking.	All the details of these changes can be found in this Dev Blog.

3	english	 	 Forum thread	The Phoenix dreadnaught has been in need of a revitalization for quite some time and we are giving it the love it needs in the Kronos release. We are giving this capital ship a new shield resistance bonus, as well as allowing it to hit just as hard with all damage types.	We’re also vastly increasing the speed of the citadel missiles themselves and making some changes to their damage application so that pilots using them will find their damage more generally consistent.	All the details and feedback can be found in this forum thread in Features and Ideas.

3	english	 	 Deep Space Transport forum thread	Transport Ships are the advanced tech two versions of the ubiquitous Industrial Ships, and fall into two classes each with their unique specializations.	Blockade Runners are designed to carry smaller amounts of cargo quickly and securely through all kinds of space. Their access to Covert Ops Cloaking Devices has given them a strong and useful role, and in Kronos we are reinforcing that role through slightly increased cargo, improved slot layouts and a new bonus to warp velocity.	Deep Space Transports are heavier duty haulers designed to take a beating and keep on rolling. They have not been compelling choices for most pilots before Kronos, so we are giving them some very significant improvements. All Deep Space Transports will be gaining a large fleet hangar that allows the carrying of significant loads without sacrificing defenses and provides new opportunities for group gameplay. These ships also sport extremely strong defenses and a unique bonus to the benefits of overheating defensive and propulsion modules. This allows a clever Deep Space Transport pilot to shrug off attack until help can arrive or until it makes its way to safety.	All of the details on these changes can be found in our Features and Ideas forum threads for Blockade Runners and Deep Space Transports.

3	english	 	 Forum thread	Freighters and Jump Freighters are the most heavy duty haulers in New Eden, and serve as the life blood of EVE Online’s living economy. These ships have always been very powerful and effective movers of freight, but before Kronos they have lacked any choice or customization gameplay. Player freedom is at the core of everything we do at CCP and we are always striving to ensure that every aspect of EVE provides interesting choices for players to make.	We have worked through several different approaches for providing this crucial player choice to Freighters and Jump Freighters. After discussion with you and with the CSM we have settled on low-power fitting slots as the best method. In Kronos, each Freighter and Jump Freighter will have three low power slots that can be used to customize your ship to meet your specific needs at any given time.	The stats of each freighter and jump freighter are being changed to work with the new low slots, so for all the details and to provide feedback go check our forum thread in the Features and Ideas section.
3	english	 	 Forum thread	Mining Barges and Exhumers are the backbone of large scale mining in EVE Online. They provide the greatest possible yields over time and can be seen in many asteroid belts across the New Eden cluster, satisfying the universe’s insatiable appetite for minerals.	In 2012 we rebalanced these ships to remove the old tier system and provide three distinct roles for players to choose from. In the Kronos release we are focusing and strengthening these roles to ensure that all pilots in EVE have the tools to meet their mining needs.	The Procurer and Skiff are the defensive barges and enjoy extremely strong tanks. In Kronos they will also be gaining a drone damage bonus so that miners can choose to punch back at anyone who would threaten their industrial operations.	The Retriever and Mackinaw continue to enjoy the greatest ore holds of any mining ships and are receiving smaller changes since they are already the most popular barges by far.	The Covetor and Hulk will be gaining even more yield to strengthen their position as the most profitable mining ship in all of EVE Online. They are also gaining a completely new bonus to strip miner and ice harvester range that will allow them to more efficiently clear their asteroid belts, especially when working in teams.	For all the juicy details on these barge and exhumer changes, as well as connected changes to mining crystals and gang links, check out this forum thread.
3	english	 	 Dev Blog	When the Venture mining frigate was introduced in late 2013 it quickly became one of the most popular ships in EVE Online history. The combination of a low barrier of entry, excellent mobility and decent mining yield attracted many pilots. In the Kronos release we are introducing a tech two progression path from the Venture, with the Prospect.	The Prospect is the first in a new class of Expedition Frigates, designed for exploiting the deepest and most remote stretches of space. It sports improved ore mining capability, gas mining yield that matches its predecessor, a larger ore bay, improved defenses and most importantly, the ability to fit Covert Ops Cloaking Devices. This allows the Prospect to get to and from asteroid fields in the most dangerous areas of space, as well as take advantage of covert jump bridges from Black Ops Battleships to bypass deadly chokepoints.	For more information on the Prospect’s stats, as well as other improvements to mining in dangerous space, check out our recent dev blog.

3	english	 	 For more information on all of these pirate faction ships and to provide your feedback, check out our Features and Ideas forum threads for the frigates, cruisers, and battleships.
3	english	 	 Sansha’s Nation	The Sansha’s Nation ships are some of the most iconic pirate vessels in EVE, and their Nightmare battleship has long served as a staple of high-end PVE gameplay. On the other hand, the Succubus frigate and Phantasm cruiser have suffered from poor performance relative to their costs.	In the Kronos release all of the Sansha’s Nation ships will be receiving a huge new bonus to Afterburner velocity bonuses. This will enable them to travel extremely quickly while using less capacitor, enjoying lower signature profiles, and shrugging off scramblers.
3	english	 	 Blood Raiders	The Blood Raiders vessels have long enjoyed the strongest energy warfare in New Eden, and their Bhaalgorn battleship enjoys a venerable role in group PVP. However before Kronos the Cruor frigate and Ashimmu cruiser had languished in relative mediocrity.	In the Kronos release all of the Blood Raider ships will be gaining a new “rule breaking” bonus to Nosferatu modules that ensures they will always drain enemy capacitor no matter what your own capacitor level is. The Blood Raider stasis webifier bonus is also being unified to a range bonus across the whole line of ships and the Cruor and Ashimmu are receiving significant upgrades to their speed and slot layouts.
3	english	 	 The Guristas ships also enjoy impressive shield defenses through a resistance bonus and punishing missile damage with either kinetic or thermal damage.	Angel	The Angel Cartel ships have always been very strong, enjoying impressive speed, agility and long range damage enabled by projectile falloff bonuses. Before Kronos, however, they lacked that special something that breaks the normal ship patterns and set them apart.	In Kronos the Dramiel frigate, Cynabal cruiser and Macheriel battleship will be gaining a special role bonus that increases their warp speed and acceleration by 50% above and beyond the other ships in their classes. This will help reinforce the Angel role as supreme fast attack vessels that can hit and run with ease.
3	english	 	 The Serpentis ships provided the example of what other pirate ships should and could be. They already had their unique game changer feature in the form of a 10% per level bonus to Stasis Webifier effectiveness. This bonus allows Serpentis ships to show their target down to 10% speed with one module and make escaping their brutal close range particle blasters nearly impossible.	Since the Serpentis theme was working so well, the changes to their ships in Kronos are more subtle than the other pirate factions. The Vigilant cruiser needed the most help and is receiving significantly more targeting range and speed. The Daredevil frigate and Vindicator battleship are already in a very good place and will be receiving smaller tweaks.	Guristas	The Guristas ships are receiving a new and unique trait, the ability to field small numbers of superpowered drones. Each ship receives a gigantic role bonus to the damage and hitpoints for drones of a specific size: light drones for the Worm frigate, medium drones for the Gila cruiser, and both heavy and sentry drones for the Rattlesnake battleship. These bonuses allow the Guristas ships to field two superpowered drones that fight with the ferocity and durability of much larger drone swarms.
3	english	 	 Battleship Forum Thread	Pirate faction ships represent some of the most powerful and unique combat ships in EVE Online, and in the Kronos release they’ll be getting even better. All fifteen ships from the main pirate factions are receiving a rebalance and the end result is some of the most exciting ships the game has ever seen.	Each of the pirate factions has a unique way that their ships “break the rules” that other ships follow. These unique and powerful abilities represent the resourcefulness and disregard for convention shared by successful outlaw organizations. In Kronos we are reinforcing this theme of rule breaking and ensuring that all of the pirate factions have an exciting and identifiable trait that sets them apart from the pack.	Serpentis

3	english	 	 NEW DRONE MODULES	Finally, we are rounding out the collection of drone upgrade modules by introducing low slot Omnidirectional Tracking Enhancers and faction versions of the Drone Damage Amplifier and Drone Navigation Computer modules, and adding more faction versions of the Omnidirectional Tracking Link module. The faction modules will be available in Gallente Navy and Amarr Navy variants (available in both normal and FW LP stores) as well as Guristas and Rogue Drone variants available as loot drops. More details about these modules will be available at a later date.
3	english	 	 BALANCE FOR SENTRY DRONES	Sentry drones are among the most popular drones in EVE Online, for good reason: They allow drone ships to project instant damage across long distances. But the balance between the four different racial varieties and three quality levels of Sentry drones could use some work.	For quality levels, Tech Two sentry drones are currently massive upgrades over their Tech One equivalents since range, tracking and damage are all such important attributes for sentries. We will be keeping the 20% bonuses to hitpoints, tracking, optimal, and falloff that Tech Two enjoys over Tech One; but instead of the current 20% increase in damage over T1, we will be increasing the base damage multiplier of Tech One sentries and limiting the Tech Two advantage to the 2% per level gained from the racial Drone Specialization skills that will now be required to use T2 sentries.	We will also provide Faction navy sentry drones with the same 20% increase in optimal and falloff that T2 enjoys.	This will serve to reduce the gulf between T1 and T2 sentries and ensure that players have a clear progression path as they advance in skills and riches.	We are also adjusting the balance between the racial flavors of sentries to provide the best possible set of choices for players when they decide which to use.	We are swapping the position of the Bouncer and Curator sentries in the damage ranking, and adding tracking to the Bouncers to compensate. This means that the spectrum between the Gallente Garde sentries (with the shortest range, highest damage and highest tracking) and the Caldari Warden sentries (with the highest range, but lowest damage and lowest tracking) will be consistent all the way across.	We are also swapping some optimal range to falloff on the Bouncers, adding falloff to the Wardens and Gardes, and removing falloff from the Curator sentries, these help ensure a good spread of range profiles while also helping the drones more closely match the weapon systems used by their races.
3	english	 	 BALANCE FOR DRONE SKILLS	Congratulations for reading all the way to the middle of a dev blog! The reward for your perseverance is some extremely important information about changes to skills coming in the Summer 2014 expansion!	Currently drones are a very skill-intensive weapon system, thanks to the legacy of the original drone implementation years ago. The Drone Interfacing skill currently provides a 20% increase in drone damage per level, which makes it one of the most powerful skills in the game but also means that to be competitive with drones it is usually necessary to train this rank-5 skill all the way to level 5. The result is that drones have earned a reputation as a weapon system that is not suitable for new players.	We will be minimizing this problem by reducing the bonus from the Drone Interfacing skill to 10% per level, and building the extra damage into the base stats of the drones. That means that on average, all drones will be gaining about 33% more base damage and a character with Drone Interfacing trained to level 5 will see their damage remain constant (ignoring for a moment all the other drone changes being made in this release). We believe that 10% per level is still a very suitable bonus for a rank 5 skill, and the Drone Interfacing skill will remain very desirable. Level 5 Drone Interfacing should, however, cease to be the absolute necessity that it is today.	We are also splitting the current Combat Drone Operation skill into two new skills, Light Drone Operation and Medium Drone Operation. This means that all light combat drones will now be unlocked and bonused from the Light Drone Operation skill, and medium combat drones will be unlocked and bonused from the Medium Drone Operation skill. During the patch downtime, existing players with the Combat Drone Operation and/or Scout Drone Operation skills trained will receive both new skills trained to a level equal to the highest level that they have in either Combat Drone Operation or Scout Drone Operation.	We initially announced that we would reimburse only from the Combat Drone Operation skill but after recieving some excellent feedback from the community on our forums we decided to reimburse based on the highest of these two skills so that we could ensure that pilots who could use these drones before don't lose any capability after the patch.	This change makes light and medium drones consistent with heavy and sentry drones in their skill paths. It also allows us to create new ships and modules with bonuses that only affect light or medium drones separately, such as the newly rebalanced Guristas Worm faction frigate.	Finally, we are renaming two drone skills to clarify their roles. The Scout Drone Operation skill is being renamed “Drone Avionics”; the Electronic Warfare Drone Interfacing skill is being renamed “Advanced Drone Avionics” to better represent their roles. The effects, prerequisites and unlocks provided by these skills will not be changing.	The other major change we will be making to drone skills in the summer release will be the expansion of drone skills to affect all drone types consistently. This means that the racial Drone Specialization skills will now provide their damage bonus to Tech Two sentry drones as well as the normal combat drones, and that the Drone Interfacing, Drone Sharpshooting, Drone Durability, and Drone Navigation skills will all provide their bonuses to Fighters and Fighter Bombers. More details about these changes can be found in the following sections.
3	english	 	 BALANCE BETWEEN SIZES OF DRONES	Travel time is a constant issue for combat drones, as the delay between ordering your drones to attack and their arrival at their target often cripples the effectiveness of drones over moderate ranges. This is also one of the major reasons that Heavy Drones have trouble competing with the stationary Sentry Drones.	Currently each size of combat drones (Light, Medium and Heavy) has only half the MWD approach velocity of the size below it. This means that Heavy Drones take 4x as long to get to their targets as Light Drones do.	In the Summer 2014 expansion, we will be changing the scaling so that each size of combat drones has 60% of the MWD speed of the size below it. This equals a 20% increase to the MWD speed of Medium Drones, and a 43% increase in Heavy Drone MWD speed. These increases only effect the MWD speed of the drones, so they will reach their distant targets faster but they may still struggle to keep up with a fast moving target, as intended.
3	english	 	 GIVING DRONES AN ASSIST (UPDATED)	Hello once again, spacefriends. CCP Fozzie here, bringing your our next dev blog covering some of the exciting changes coming your way in the EVE Online Summer 2014 release.	We have updated the thread with the latest information, namely changes to the range and tracking of combat drones and changes to the plan for converting skills on patch day. This blog is now fully up to date as of May 30, 2014.	This blog will discuss our constant companions in the darkness of space, the loyal drones. Drones have received many improvements in recent years that have increased their stature to that of a main weapon system and expanded the options available to drone users immensely. However there are several aspects of drone balance that are not yet up to our current standards. In the summer release we will be implementing a wide ranging balance rework for drones of all sizes. This will affect drone skills, modules and ship bonuses as well as the attributes of the drones themselves.	I will include a link to a spreadsheet with the new drone attributes at the end of the blog, but first we’ll cover the changes at a higher level. This revamp includes over a thousand separate behind-the-scenes changes, but it’s simpler to look at each category of problems we are trying to solve and how we intend to address them one by one.
3	english	 	 Forum Thread	Three of the most exciting ships in the Kronos release are being introduced by Mordu’s Legion. These ships fill the need for a set of dedicated pirate-level missile ships. They are specialized in long range high speed missile warfare, and make ideal skirmishers.	The Garmur frigate, Orthrus cruiser and Barghest battleship all share bonuses to missile damage, warp disruptor and scrambler range, and a special supercharged bonus to missile velocity. They also enjoy some of the best mobility in their classes, allowing them to use range and speed to engage against overwhelming odds. Their raw missile damage bonuses to all damage types also make them perfectly suited to using the deadly burst damage of Rapid Missile Launchers.	These ships will be available from the Mordu’s Legion LP store in their nullsec station, but most blueprints that make it to player hands will come from new Mordu’s Legion faction NPCs that will appear as rare spawns in all low security asteroid belts. More information on these ships and the other activities of Mordu’s Legion in Kronos will be coming in upcoming dev blogs. You can find all the applicable stats and provide feedback in this forum thread in our Features and Ideas subforum.

With the release of the New Eden Store, we will stop selling Aurum Tokens and start selling Aurum directly instead. Existing Aurum Tokens can still be redeemed for Aurum – we will just stop selling new ones. You can also continue to convert your PLEX into AUR like previously. Coupled with the AURUM sales we are changing the pricing structure. You will now get slightly more AURUM when purchasing directly.	The new Aurum prices are as follows:

5	english	 	 FINDING OUT ABOUT THESE UPDATES	Recently we have been making changes to the EVE API and public CREST at a fairly fast pace and in some cases in pretty minor changes. That combined with the fact that most of these releases don't happen at the same time as an EVE release means that there is often not a dev blog about this stuff. So where then does this stuff get announced and where can you go to find out information on changes?	The simplest place to find out about updates to TQ is check this post here: //forums.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=posts&m=4384137#post4384137	If you want to know about changes ahead of time, discuss them, know when they are on the test server, and that kind of thing, you should follow this thread: //forums.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=posts&t=332097&find=unread	More generally you should check out the Technology Lab forum. We are trying very hard to make sure the things we do are posted and discussed there: //forums.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=topics&f=263
5	english	 	 After wanting to put new documentation on the EVElopedia site relating to third party developers it became clear that the third party developers section of EVElopedia was not in good shape. Due to this we decided to make some changes. We began with deleting all information on the wiki we could find relating to third party developers. Not only was the wiki missing information lots of it was wrong, which is worse. After deleting it all we started putting new documentation up which you can find here: //wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Third_Party_Developers	It is a wiki so if you feel like contributing please feel free to do so. There is a forum thread here to discuss things relating to this endevour: //forums.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=posts&t=346902&find=unread

5	english	 	 TEST SERVER	We have recently opened up the ability to generate API keys for the Sisi API which means you can actually test these and future updates: //community.testeveonline.com/support/api-key
5	english	 	 PLAYER WARS IN PUBLIC CREST	Wars are a fun thing and we like to show a corporations war history in the client. That is all fine and dandy. However we think you pilots can do some cool stuff with war information, especially some cool over time charts. With this in mind and the fact that wars are public information in the EVE client, we have added a new endpoint to public CREST. The endpoint will be /wars/ and will list all wars in the history of EVE Online, right back to warID 1. You can then go /wars// and get detailed information on the specific war. Please keep in mind some information, such as ISK and ships killed, only started getting tracked with the wars revamp. The final resource you can expect is /wars//killmails/all/ which will list all killmails associated with the specified war. Again, this is all information available in the EVE client and we are just making it available via public CREST.
5	english	 	 POCOS IN THE EVE API	You can currently get a list of all your corporations Player-Owned Customs Offices (POCOs) by looking at your corporations asset list through the EVE API. That’s however very limiting in that it only tells you that you have some POCOs, not how they are configured. We have added corp/CustomsOffices to the EVE API which will require a CEO or director level corporation API key with the asset list access mask. Provide that and you will get a list of all your corporations POCOs and their configured settings.	Due to limitations with the EVE API and how the data is stored for POCOs in the database, we unfortunately are not returning information on what planet the POCOs are orbiting. We are however returning the POCOs item ID which, just like you can now from the asset list endpoint, take that item ID and send it to the corp/Locations endpoint. From that you will get an X, Y, Z returned. Use that information with information from the EVE SDE and you can look up what planet a POCO orbits.	If you are really lazy, and trust Steve Ronuken, you can use his API to look this up: //www.fuzzwork.co.uk/tools/api-map-data/
6	english	 	 All of the above is on Sisi and still in active development. While we will try and keep you apprised of any changes, things may change before they are released to TQ.	That's all for now, just a quick heads up on things to be aware of.	CCP FoxFour	@regnerba
6	english	 	 BONUS ROUND!	As an extra special bonus CCP Tuxford has added two new endpoints to public CREST on Sisi for industry related activities.	You can find them here: public-crest-sisi.testeveonline.com/industry/

7	english	 	 We want to give a huge shout out to those participating in this trial. Their feedback has been wonderful and the effort they are clearly willing to put into this is awesome.
7	english	 	 Due to the SSO only being on Sisi right now you probably won’t see it showing up on the participants main site right away, but those are the web sites you can expect to start seeing the SSO on for now.

7	english	 	 SSO LIMITED TRIAL	Back in the middle of May we opened sign-ups to everyone (thread can be found here) for a trial of the EVE SSO. Since then we have chosen some web sites to take part in this trial and have given them the information they need to begin using the SSO. While the trial is limited to a small number of web sites we have put the documentation up for everyone to see and you can find that here.	The first phase of the SSO trial is complete and was simply to share the documentation and process of using the SSO with trial participants. This resulted in some great feedback, based on which some changes to the SSO were made. We are now going forward with phase two, giving the trial participant’s access to the SSO on the Singularity server (Sisi) only. That has happened and they have begun integrating the SSO into their web sites. This will continue through the month of July with only access to Sisi and so long as everything goes well in August we will give those same web sites access to the SSO on Tranquility. After that our goal is to open up the SSO to anyone who wants to use it. We do not however have a time frame on that yet as we want to make sure we do this right.	The web sites participating in the SSO trial are:
7	english	 	 Manual verification of the certificate	By manually verifying the certificate of the web resource you are connected to you can check if the certificate is valid for the domain it is used on and if it has actually not expired yet.	Following these recommendations you can reduce the risk of getting your credentials and therefore your virtual identity stolen. Also, we encourage you to report any misleading, bogus or questionable usage of our SSO to security@ccpgames.com.
7	english	 	 Hey capsuleers! We are writing to you all with some pretty serious information. In the very near future you will begin seeing web sites other than the official EVE Online sites using what is known as the EVE Single-Sign-On (SSO). Well OK, that's cool, but what is an SSO?	Simply put, SSOs are a way for users to log into one web site using their username and password from another web site. For example, if go to //www.goodreads.com/ and try to sign in they will ask you if you want to sign in with Facebook, Twitter, Google, or even Amazon. For Goodreads this is great because it means they don't have to worry about trying to manage your username and password information. It also has the nice advantage of making it a lot easier for you as a user to sign into their site as you don't need to register or keep track of multiple extra account names and passwords.	For EVE Online, the SSO means that you can sign into a web site that has integrated the EVE SSO and confirm you are a specific character. While signing into a site you will be asked which character you wish to authenticate with and the web site that let you sign in with the EVE SSO will get confirmation from CCP that you own that character. The original web site will only ever get your character, they never see your account name or password. The original web site will not know what account that character is on or have any way, from us at least, of linking that character to any other character on the same account.	The SSO looks something like this:	OK, that is all great and dandy but what does it mean for you as an EVE player and why are we telling you this information? Since you can expect to soon see this page coming from other sites it is important for you guys to know what to look for to avoid phishing attempts and other scams. Until now since only EVE Online official sites were the only ones using this login, if you saw it coming from somewhere else you knew immediately not to enter your username and password elsewhere. With this expanding very soon to include more web sites we want to make sure everyone knows what kind of things to look out for when signing into their EVE Online account.

Fetch the base material quantities for manufacturing the item from your blueprint, from the blueprints.yaml file in the SDE. In the case of invention and reverse engineering jobs you should use the materials from the T2 or T3 blueprint instead.	Multiply each material quantity by the market adjustedPrice as returned from the /market/prices/ endpoint and sum them all together. This is called the base cost. For reverse engineering jobs with multiple possible outcomes calculate the baseCost for each then create an average.	The base cost is then modified based on the type of activity:

9	english	 	 ENDY BIT	This should comprise everything that is changing in these two areas (blueprints and pricing) in the Crius release scheduled for July 22nd. We will of course be monitoring and responding to this blog’s feedback thread, the issues and feedback threads for the release and the way use of industry features evolves on Tranquility in the months after release.	If you have questions, comments etc please raise them in the feedback thread!
9	english	 	 THINGS WE AREN'T DOING	After considerable discussion, both internally and on the forums, we have decided that we are not going to award any additional compensation for blueprints currently researched past ME/PE 10. There are a lot of things feeding into this decision, including the strong precedent it sets, the fact that no functional value is lost, and the work involved in a one-time compensation deal that could be spent on polishing up the features we're shipping. We understand that some people will be unhappy about this, and we empathize with that, but we have to weigh everyone's interests equally and we believe in this case that the best thing for the game as a whole is to convert blueprints to the new system as previously described but not make any additional changes in this area.	We had intended to implement a bonus for having multiple similar facilities of the same type at a given starbase. This was in fact implemented in a draft state, but there was no easy way to make it both user-friendly and well-performing (it was only updating once an hour), and given the relatively limited upsides it provided, we elected to cut it and focus the time that would've been spent bringing it up to an acceptable standard on polishing the rest of the release instead.	The original design had a batch discount, whereby longer jobs had their job costs reduced. After further consideration we have also decided to cut this on the grounds that it offered fairly marginal benefit in the best case, had some counterintuitive implications (researching TE would reduce your batch discount), was challenging to explain clearly, and was at the end of the day adding complexity that we decided we didn't want or need.	We had discussed, in previous blog feedback threads, making adjustments to Gallente outpost copy speed bonuses. After slowly walking through the scenario, this turns out not to actually cause a problem. The concern revolves around the total throughput of T2 BPOs, and the impact of an increase in BPO throughput on the invention market given that total cost from a BPO undercuts total cost from invention. Currently they can get a 0.4x build speed bonus in Amarr outposts, so switching this out for a 0.4x copy speed bonus doesn’t impact potential throughput at all given that a blueprint can only be doing one thing at a time. Even if you copy in a Gallente outpost and then build in an Amarr one, you’re still bottlenecked by the copy speed. In practice, being able to take advantage of the speed bonus without having to manufacture in nullsec may increase the usage of this bonus, but balanced against that in practical terms is the need for a T2 BPO sitting in a Gallente outpost upgraded for copy speed, which is believed to be a somewhat rare occurrence.
9	english	 	 Base invention time is thus:	Time to build a max-run BPC of the possible job output(s)	Divided by 2 due to the assumed 50% success rate	Minus time to make the T1 copy	Thus, 2*(T1 copy + invent)=T2 build.	We've then played with the numbers a bit further, multiplying invention time for rank 3 or less blueprints by 0.9, and by 1.1 for blueprints above rank 7. This means "larger" items are more invention-bound while "smaller" items are more build-bound. Obviously, various bonuses available will mess with this balance; dealing with those is deliberately left as an exercise for the player :)	Max runs have been adjusted to be more consistent, based around build times:	Most T1 items are set to ~2 days' production time	Components are set to ~7 days' production time	T2 ships and rigs are set to 1 run	All other T2 is set to 10 runs	We then round, to the nearest 100 if the build time is above 1400, and to the nearest 10 otherwise.	Finally, build costs have (as noted earlier) been multiplied by 1/0.9 for T1, and 1.5 for T2, to balance out the removal of wastage.
9	english	 	 BLUEPRINT DATA	We've done a fairly comprehensive overhaul of blueprint stats, to try and bring them into a more consistent and interesting pattern.	Firstly, we've assigned all blueprints a behind-the-scenes rank, which dictates a lot of the values. You can see examples in Appendix 1, and here are the rules we used to determine them:	Modules: Sized 3/6/9/120, multiplied by 2.6 for T2; unsized modules are sized S/M/L by low/medium/high slot	Some modules have had their ranks adjusted to be more "interesting", principally cloaks, warfare links, mining modules and "specialist" modules that are generally intended for use on specific ship groups, such as interdiction launchers, doomsdays and so on. Still multiplied by 2.6 for T2 variants.	Ships: Sized 20/30/40/50/60 for frigate/destroyer/cruiser/battlecruiser/battleship, with industrials sized as cruisers, and multiplied by 20 for T2. Capitals are 200, except for supercarriers at 400 and titans at 600.	Charges: Sized 1/2/3/4, multiplied by 1.6 for T2	Drones: Sized 1/2/3/40, multiplied by 5 for T2	Starbase structures: Sized 20/30/40 for S/M/L turrets, 100/200/300 for towers, 40/60/80 for other structures based on CPU usage (40 is below 200, 60 is below 750, 80 is above that)	Rigs: sized 5/10/15/20, multiplied by 10 for T2	Everything else: assigned on a case-by-case basis	With a few exceptions outlined below, the combination of rank, classification and tech level determine a blueprint's stats.	Build times are generally rank * 300 seconds.	T2 ammo is multiplied by a further x10, keeping their current batch sizes	T1 capital ships are multiplied by a further x25	T2 capital ships are multiplied by a further x4 (not cumulative with the x25 multiplier above)	Components have not had their build times changed at all, as they're balanced around specific build chains	Special edition ships (including all the skins) have their build time set to 10 seconds	Note: Special edition ships also have an attribute set so that they never cost any ISK to build - The New Eden Painters’ Union still isn’t on speaking terms with the Interstellar Industrial Workers Union.	Copy times are, as noted above, always 80% of base build time. Due to the interaction of various skills, copy and build end up having the same max throughput. We may revisit this in future to give copying an additional edge.	Research times are always rank * 105 for the first level, with scaling for additional levels as described earlier.	Invention time is slightly more complex. We wanted to line the base stats up so that, assuming a 50% success rate, research time would match up roughly with build time, so a max-skilled character can supply itself with enough T2 BPCs to fill its manufacturing slots. Yes, we know invention job length is problematic. See previous point about tackling invention more thoroughly once we're done with Crius!
9	english	 	 PRICING MODIFIERS	There are a range of modifiers that further affect the final price.	1. A reduction in price based on the stations and upgrades present in a system. Stations, Factional Warfare upgrades and certain outpost upgrades provide beneficial multipliers to costs. For any applicable job in a given system, the multipliers for all the stations and upgrades in that system are multiplied together with the base price. See Appendix 2 for a full list.	Also note: nullsec outpost upgrades which previously added manufacturing lines to the station, will instead offer a 1% material use reduction (i.e. an additional ME-1%) per upgrade installed.	2. Teams will increase job costs when they're used. This cost is a simple percentage increase, and will be listed in the team's information.	3. Facilities can impose a tax on jobs within that facility. For NPC-owned facilities, this is a flat 10%, meaning a 1.1x multiplier to the job price. For player-run outposts, this can be configured by the owners. For starbases, setting taxes won't be supported in the initial release but we are investigating supporting this in future after player feedback.	These multiply together with the base price to create a final per-run price for that job, which needs to be paid up front.
9	english	 	 I.e., where:	system_activity_job_hours is the total duration of all jobs of that activity type in that system over the last 28 days, and:	global_activity_job_hours is the total duration of all jobs of that activity type in the universe over the last 28 day, and:	system_activity_index is the index we’re creating, the formula is:	This index is then used in conjunction with job value to create a base cost. (For those of you who want to do the actual math, we suggest taking a read of this devblog.)	Job value is based on the item or blueprint that represents the primary output of the job. For manufacturing, this is the value of the inputs required to build that output item, so for pretty much all build jobs it's the value of the job's input.	For copying and ME/TE research, this is fairly straightforward: it's 2% of the inputs for a job using that blueprint.	For invention and reverse-engineering, it's 2% of the average value of the inputs for the thing(s) built by the blueprint(s) you're /hoping/ to get out of the job. For T2 ships and T3 stuff generally, the output can be several things, so we average across all possibilities.	With this value (input costs for manufacturing, 2% of output's input costs for research), we then multiply by the activity index for the activity in question to get the base build cost. Example: let's say the manufacturing index in Jita is 5%, and you want to build an Apocalypse whose base materials cost 200m ISK. Base build cost is 200m*5% = 10m.	For ME and TE research, there's a further wrinkle, which is that the higher level jobs both take longer (as above) and also cost commensurately more. There is a cost multiplier for each level of research, equal to the time it takes to research to that level divided by the time it takes to research to level 1.
9	english	 	 BASIC PRICING	Slots are gone. There is no longer any limit on how much work you can do in a given facility. Anywhere you can start an industry job of any sort, both stations and starbases, is a facility).	Instead, we have dynamic pricing to give an incentive to not just build everything in Jita 4-4. This is explained as the cost to hire necessary workforce in a given system.	The base component of pricing is the system activity index. This value is tracked per activity (Manufacturing, Copying, ME research, TE research, Invention, Reverse Engineering), per system, so Jita will have a separate index for each of the six job types.	The index for a given activity-system pair is equal to the number of job-hours of that activity type in that system over the last 28 days, divided by the number of job-hours of that activity type in the universe as a whole over the last 28 days, and then square-rooted to give better numbers. This is then expressed as a percentage, which will tend to be in the low single digits, and can be all the way down to 0 at one end and (in theory) all the way up to 100 at the other.
9	english	 	 Headline changes	Copying times are now expressed per-run, and are always 80% of base build time for the blueprint (thus generally shorter for ships, longer for modules)	Invention only requires one run from a blueprint copy, and deducts it exactly as if you'd built from the blueprint	Successful invention always outputs a maximum-run copy as a baseline, which is then modified by decryptors; max runs have been adjusted to be 1 for T2 ships and Rigs and 10 for all other T2 products	Successful invention without decryptors now creates an ME-2%/TE-4% blueprint; material requirements for T2 items have been increased by 50% to balance this out as it means we’re no longer adding +50% materials due to negative ME, so that decryptor-less invention now requires 2% less materials than previously.	Decryptors have been adjusted to the new system with the TE bonuses doubling to reflect the fact that TE goes up to 20%. This leaves them in a somewhat unbalanced state, which will be addressed with the aforementioned upcoming Invention/Reverse Engineering changes coming after Crius.	To transition old blueprints, we'll be adding 6 to ME and TE for all T2 BPCs, and then converting them according to the above scheme. Thus an un-decrypted blueprint at ME-4, PE-4 will first become ME2, PE2 and then be converted to ME-7%, PE-14%. This is a one-time windfall to make the DB scripts for the transition simpler and more robust, so enjoy it while it lasts!
9	english	 	 COPYING AND INVENTION/REVERSE ENGINEERING	Team Game of Drones will be working on a more comprehensive overhaul to Invention and Reverse Engineering mechanics immediately after Crius, so the changes here are merely to keep these systems functional while we invest further work in them.
9	english	 	 (For negative ME/TE, see the next section!)
9	english	 	 In order to keep blueprints differentiated, we have a system of ranks, all of the above times are multiplied by a blueprint's rank. T1 ammo is rank 1; jump freighters are rank 4000. For a better outline of what falls under what rank, see Appendix 1.

9	english	 	 Two specific notes: firstly, we are now rounding materials per-job rather than per-run, so savings of less than one unit can often be realized with a long enough production run. Secondly, to prevent weirdness with T2 builds in particular (for example building 10 Paladins from 9 Apocalypses), every run requires a minimum of one unit of every listed material.	In order to keep a non-linear progression, each subsequent level takes longer to research than the previously one.	Here is the time for a T1 ammo blueprint:	Level	Seconds	Approximate readable time
9	english	 	 Headline changes	PE (Production Efficiency) is now called TE (Time Efficiency) because it's more obvious what it means. ME (Material Efficiency) keeps the same name. In both cases we are now displaying both values in the UI as negative numbers, as they are reductions; this is possible because of the invention changes mentioned later on!	Wastage as a concept is gone. All material-affecting bonuses simply reduce from the "full price" input materials. Material needs for T1 items have all been adjusted upwards by 1/0.9 to balance this out. We no longer need to guard so vigilantly against "material printing" from ME bonuses as reprocessing-built items now only return 50% of the materials.	ME and TE research now operates on a 10-step scale. Each step of ME reduces materials by 1% (always rounded up). Each step of TE reduces build time by 2%. These are expressed as simple percentage values, so a blueprint might be ME-3%, TE-12%.	Details

9	english	 	 Obviously we need to ensure that pre-Crius blueprints still work post-Crius, so we will be altering the values on existing blueprints for the new system. The guiding goal with this translation is "no blueprint gets functionally worse" i.e. the materials needed for a single run should be the same or less after the transition. Do note that, because we are calculating percentage reductions on the job as a whole rather than per-run, there will be cases where multiple runs can realize hidden savings that weren't previously accessible.
9	english	 	 Additionally, the old Material Efficiency skill has been renamed to Advanced Industry, and gives a build time reduction of 1% per level. We are not totally happy with the reduction in skill value that’s happened here, and we are committing to revisiting this skill post-Crius to evaluate how to meet our overall goals here in a less dramatic fashion.

9	english	 	 ENDY BIT	This should comprise everything that is changing in these two areas (blueprints and pricing) in the Crius release scheduled for July 22nd. We will of course be monitoring and responding to this blog’s feedback thread, the issues and feedback threads for the release and the way use of industry features evolves on Tranquility in the months after release.	If you have questions, comments etc please raise them in the feedback thread!
9	english	 	 THINGS WE AREN'T DOING	After considerable discussion, both internally and on the forums, we have decided that we are not going to award any additional compensation for blueprints currently researched past ME/PE 10. There are a lot of things feeding into this decision, including the strong precedent it sets, the fact that no functional value is lost, and the work involved in a one-time compensation deal that could be spent on polishing up the features we're shipping. We understand that some people will be unhappy about this, and we empathize with that, but we have to weigh everyone's interests equally and we believe in this case that the best thing for the game as a whole is to convert blueprints to the new system as previously described but not make any additional changes in this area.	We had intended to implement a bonus for having multiple similar facilities of the same type at a given starbase. This was in fact implemented in a draft state, but there was no easy way to make it both user-friendly and well-performing (it was only updating once an hour), and given the relatively limited upsides it provided, we elected to cut it and focus the time that would've been spent bringing it up to an acceptable standard on polishing the rest of the release instead.	The original design had a batch discount, whereby longer jobs had their job costs reduced. After further consideration we have also decided to cut this on the grounds that it offered fairly marginal benefit in the best case, had some counterintuitive implications (researching TE would reduce your batch discount), was challenging to explain clearly, and was at the end of the day adding complexity that we decided we didn't want or need.	We had discussed, in previous blog feedback threads, making adjustments to Gallente outpost copy speed bonuses. After slowly walking through the scenario, this turns out not to actually cause a problem. The concern revolves around the total throughput of T2 BPOs, and the impact of an increase in BPO throughput on the invention market given that total cost from a BPO undercuts total cost from invention. Currently they can get a 0.4x build speed bonus in Amarr outposts, so switching this out for a 0.4x copy speed bonus doesn’t impact potential throughput at all given that a blueprint can only be doing one thing at a time. Even if you copy in a Gallente outpost and then build in an Amarr one, you’re still bottlenecked by the copy speed. In practice, being able to take advantage of the speed bonus without having to manufacture in nullsec may increase the usage of this bonus, but balanced against that in practical terms is the need for a T2 BPO sitting in a Gallente outpost upgraded for copy speed, which is believed to be a somewhat rare occurrence.
9	english	 	 Base invention time is thus:	Time to build a max-run BPC of the possible job output(s)	Divided by 2 due to the assumed 50% success rate	Minus time to make the T1 copy	Thus, 2*(T1 copy + invent)=T2 build.	We've then played with the numbers a bit further, multiplying invention time for rank 3 or less blueprints by 0.9, and by 1.1 for blueprints above rank 7. This means "larger" items are more invention-bound while "smaller" items are more build-bound. Obviously, various bonuses available will mess with this balance; dealing with those is deliberately left as an exercise for the player :)	Max runs have been adjusted to be more consistent, based around build times:	Most T1 items are set to ~2 days' production time	Components are set to ~7 days' production time	T2 ships and rigs are set to 1 run	All other T2 is set to 10 runs	We then round, to the nearest 100 if the build time is above 1400, and to the nearest 10 otherwise.	Finally, build costs have (as noted earlier) been multiplied by 1/0.9 for T1, and 1.5 for T2, to balance out the removal of wastage.
9	english	 	 BLUEPRINT DATA	We've done a fairly comprehensive overhaul of blueprint stats, to try and bring them into a more consistent and interesting pattern.	Firstly, we've assigned all blueprints a behind-the-scenes rank, which dictates a lot of the values. You can see examples in Appendix 1, and here are the rules we used to determine them:	Modules: Sized 3/6/9/120, multiplied by 2.6 for T2; unsized modules are sized S/M/L by low/medium/high slot	Some modules have had their ranks adjusted to be more "interesting", principally cloaks, warfare links, mining modules and "specialist" modules that are generally intended for use on specific ship groups, such as interdiction launchers, doomsdays and so on. Still multiplied by 2.6 for T2 variants.	Ships: Sized 20/30/40/50/60 for frigate/destroyer/cruiser/battlecruiser/battleship, with industrials sized as cruisers, and multiplied by 20 for T2. Capitals are 200, except for supercarriers at 400 and titans at 600.	Charges: Sized 1/2/3/4, multiplied by 1.6 for T2	Drones: Sized 1/2/3/40, multiplied by 5 for T2	Starbase structures: Sized 20/30/40 for S/M/L turrets, 100/200/300 for towers, 40/60/80 for other structures based on CPU usage (40 is below 200, 60 is below 750, 80 is above that)	Rigs: sized 5/10/15/20, multiplied by 10 for T2	Everything else: assigned on a case-by-case basis	With a few exceptions outlined below, the combination of rank, classification and tech level determine a blueprint's stats.	Build times are generally rank * 300 seconds.	T2 ammo is multiplied by a further x10, keeping their current batch sizes	T1 capital ships are multiplied by a further x25	T2 capital ships are multiplied by a further x4 (not cumulative with the x25 multiplier above)	Components have not had their build times changed at all, as they're balanced around specific build chains	Special edition ships (including all the skins) have their build time set to 10 seconds	Note: Special edition ships also have an attribute set so that they never cost any ISK to build - The New Eden Painters’ Union still isn’t on speaking terms with the Interstellar Industrial Workers Union.	Copy times are, as noted above, always 80% of base build time. Due to the interaction of various skills, copy and build end up having the same max throughput. We may revisit this in future to give copying an additional edge.	Research times are always rank * 105 for the first level, with scaling for additional levels as described earlier.	Invention time is slightly more complex. We wanted to line the base stats up so that, assuming a 50% success rate, research time would match up roughly with build time, so a max-skilled character can supply itself with enough T2 BPCs to fill its manufacturing slots. Yes, we know invention job length is problematic. See previous point about tackling invention more thoroughly once we're done with Crius!
9	english	 	 PRICING MODIFIERS	There are a range of modifiers that further affect the final price.	1. A reduction in price based on the stations and upgrades present in a system. Stations, Factional Warfare upgrades and certain outpost upgrades provide beneficial multipliers to costs. For any applicable job in a given system, the multipliers for all the stations and upgrades in that system are multiplied together with the base price. See Appendix 2 for a full list.	Also note: nullsec outpost upgrades which previously added manufacturing lines to the station, will instead offer a 1% material use reduction (i.e. an additional ME-1%) per upgrade installed.	2. Teams will increase job costs when they're used. This cost is a simple percentage increase, and will be listed in the team's information.	3. Facilities can impose a tax on jobs within that facility. For NPC-owned facilities, this is a flat 10%, meaning a 1.1x multiplier to the job price. For player-run outposts, this can be configured by the owners. For starbases, setting taxes won't be supported in the initial release but we are investigating supporting this in future after player feedback.	These multiply together with the base price to create a final per-run price for that job, which needs to be paid up front.
9	english	 	 I.e., where:	system_activity_job_hours is the total duration of all jobs of that activity type in that system over the last 28 days, and:	global_activity_job_hours is the total duration of all jobs of that activity type in the universe over the last 28 day, and:	system_activity_index is the index we’re creating, the formula is:	This index is then used in conjunction with job value to create a base cost. (For those of you who want to do the actual math, we suggest taking a read of this devblog.)	Job value is based on the item or blueprint that represents the primary output of the job. For manufacturing, this is the value of the inputs required to build that output item, so for pretty much all build jobs it's the value of the job's input.	For copying and ME/TE research, this is fairly straightforward: it's 2% of the inputs for a job using that blueprint.	For invention and reverse-engineering, it's 2% of the average value of the inputs for the thing(s) built by the blueprint(s) you're /hoping/ to get out of the job. For T2 ships and T3 stuff generally, the output can be several things, so we average across all possibilities.	With this value (input costs for manufacturing, 2% of output's input costs for research), we then multiply by the activity index for the activity in question to get the base build cost. Example: let's say the manufacturing index in Jita is 5%, and you want to build an Apocalypse whose base materials cost 200m ISK. Base build cost is 200m*5% = 10m.	For ME and TE research, there's a further wrinkle, which is that the higher level jobs both take longer (as above) and also cost commensurately more. There is a cost multiplier for each level of research, equal to the time it takes to research to that level divided by the time it takes to research to level 1.
9	english	 	 BASIC PRICING	Slots are gone. There is no longer any limit on how much work you can do in a given facility. Anywhere you can start an industry job of any sort, both stations and starbases, is a facility).	Instead, we have dynamic pricing to give an incentive to not just build everything in Jita 4-4. This is explained as the cost to hire necessary workforce in a given system.	The base component of pricing is the system activity index. This value is tracked per activity (Manufacturing, Copying, ME research, TE research, Invention, Reverse Engineering), per system, so Jita will have a separate index for each of the six job types.	The index for a given activity-system pair is equal to the number of job-hours of that activity type in that system over the last 28 days, divided by the number of job-hours of that activity type in the universe as a whole over the last 28 days, and then square-rooted to give better numbers. This is then expressed as a percentage, which will tend to be in the low single digits, and can be all the way down to 0 at one end and (in theory) all the way up to 100 at the other.

10	english	 	 **IN CLOSING**	These proposals are not the only improvements we hope to make for wormhole space in the future, and we are actively discussing with the CSM other improvements that could be made. We encourage you to keep communicating your requests both directly to us here at CCP and to your hardworking CSM members.	We hope you have enjoyed this dev blog and that you are looking forward to the Hyperion release as much as we are here in Team Five O. We are very interested in your feedback on all of these concepts and we encourage you to post your feedback, along with reasons for your arguments, in each of the individual feedback threads linked with each section of this blog. We will be hard at work over the next few weeks coding, refining designs, responding to feedback and testing changes for wormholes and we can’t wait to see how all you incredibly clever players find a way to pleasantly surprise us once again once Hyperion arrives on August 26th.	As for the rest of the changes you should expect in the Hyperion release, CCP Seagull will be posting a "Coming in Hyperion" blog soon with an overview and we will be continuing to release more dev blogs with all the juicy details in the coming days.
10	english	 	 Feedback thread	As many of you may know, we have been thinking about the mechanics surrounding K162 wormhole appearance for quite some time.	Currently, as soon as the first player initiates warp to a new wormhole, the other side of that wormhole connection (the K162) appears and is visible to probes and to the sensor overlay in the destination system. This provides an unfair amount of early warning to players in the destination system since they receive warning of an impending incursion before the first player jumps into their system. The addition of the sensor overlay in Odyssey made this problem more visible, but it has always existed through the probe system and has never been good gameplay.	We floated an early proposal concerning this issue on the wormhole forums, which discussed the option of implementing a delay after players jump through a wormhole before the K162 wormhole is visible. After discussing this idea on the forums and at Fanfest with members of the W-space community, we heard the major concern that the idea as proposed would have caused players to feel helpless, like there was nothing they could do to detect the potentially hostile players in their system. This is a very legitimate concern, so we went back to the drawing board.	The result is our next proposal, which we believe effectively navigates the concerns of the hunters and the hunted.	As of Hyperion, we are planning to have K162 signatures appear as soon as the first player jumps through their wormhole connection. This prevents players in the destination system from receiving unfair early intelligence while also ensuring that a vigilant player can determine if a potentially hostile intruder has entered their system through a new wormhole connection.	Once a wormhole has been jumped through once, the K162 signature will remain scannable for the lifetime of that wormhole. This scannable state will persist across downtimes.	After discussion with the community we have decided to make some adjustments to this plan to ensure that enough wormhole connections become visible to keep travel options open.	Although K162 signatures will not appear as soon as a player warps to them (as they do currently), they will have a random chance to appear every several minutes once the wormhole connection has less than 15 hours of natural lifetime remaining.	We are looking forward to your feedback on this change, and will be reviewing it from this thread.

10	english	 	 Feedback thread	The next major change we are proposing to wormhole mechanics is a variable adjustment to the distance that ships appear at after jumping through wormholes.	This change is intended to ensure that all attempts to control the local wormhole environment are open to risk of player disruption. We are not satisfied with how easy and safe it is to close wormholes that could potentially allow other players to interact with W-space operations, as the risk of player interaction should always be the main source of tension and danger in W-space.	A proof of concept version of this change appeared on our Singularity test server over the weekend, which caused some consternation among parts of the wormhole community. I want to remind people that unannounced changes appearing on test servers are not a reliable guide for what might reach Tranquility. The version on SISI had distance values that are very different than the ones we had been discussing with the CSM most recently.	The basics of this proposal is for the mass of any individual ship to influence the range that they appear from the wormhole when they emerge on the other side. This should provide a more interesting tactical environment in wormhole combat and ensure a basic level of risk to rolling a wormhole without proper support.	This change would indeed increase the amount of time involved in “ragerolling” (intentionally collapsing static wormhole connections repeatedly to search for targets), but we believe that with the correct values ragerolling can still be viable and that the increase in random wormholes will provide a secondary outlet for players looking for fights without needing to rageroll as often.	After continued discussion with the community we have made some adjustments from the original plan. We are reducing the base range significantly for large ships, and changing the random element to the jump distance. Now the maximum deviation from the base distance will increase for jumping through wormholes that have had significant amounts of mass pass through them. The deviation will be a maximum of 2km for fresh wormholes, and will increase to as much as 5km (in either direction) for a wormhole that is about to collapse. There will also be a lower bound of 2.5km set to prevent the wormhole from decloaking ships.	We beleive these changes will help ensure that the average time to return to a wormhole after jumping will be reasonable, while also keeping an element of risk and randomness. The variable deviation will also allow players to strategically choose how and when to jump ships through a wormhole to reach their desired outcomes.	The new base distance would scale as high as ~14km from the wormhole for the largest ships, and the random factor for each jump would range from 2km (for a fresh wormhole) to 5km (for a crit wormhole) in either direction. The distance from a wormhole that ships must be within to jump will remain 5km as always. The potential distances for several types of common ships would be:	Ship	Mass

10	english	 	 Feedback thread	As I mentioned earlier, one of our goals in the Hyperion release is to provide players more avenues with which to enjoy the random and unpredictable elements of wormhole life. One way we intend to reach this goal is to increase the prevalence of random wormhole connections that appear in W-space systems. We will be significantly increasing the spawn rate of all the existing wormholes that originate in W-space, as well as adding a whole new class of random wormholes with unique properties.	The new class of random wormholes will have a very low maximum jump mass, navigable only by frigates, destroyers and multi-bubble heavy interdictors. They will also enjoy a very high stable mass and will be the first wormhole connections in EVE to regenerate mass over time. This means that collapsing these wormholes will be nearly impossible, and they will virtually always last to the end of their 16 hour lifespan.	These new small ship wormholes will only originate in W-space systems, and can lead to any other W-space systems or to nullsec space. The chance of connections between the extreme ends of the spectrum (very high class to very low class and vice versa) will be somewhat lower to ensure that low-class wormholes do not become flooded with frigate fleets from higher classes.	We believe that these new random wormholes will provide new opportunities for players interested in flying lighter ships than are common in the current wormhole meta, and roaming into nullsec with fast wolfpacks. They should also make it more difficult for players to completely close off their systems from external connections, ensuring that emergent player interaction remains a constant influence in W-space. We are taking feedback on both of these changes to randomly spawning wormholes in this feedback thread.
10	english	 	 (click to enlarge)	As you can see in the above chart, Class 2 wormholes fall below the curve in NPC kills, but are extremely healthy in other metrics. This is due to the unique position C2 wormholes occupy thanks to their dual static connections. This makes C2 wormholes especially well connected to both W-space and K-space and an excellent choice for corporations who are particularly interested in PVP.	In the Hyperion release we are planning to provide C4 wormholes with their own area of expertise, by adding a second W-space static connection to each of them. This will make C4 wormholes exceptionally well-connected to other W-space systems and a great choice for corporations who want to enjoy a variety of travels within wormhole space.	The new static connections from C4s will have the same mass and lifetime values as the existing C4 statics, and will all lead to a different class of wormhole space than the system’s existing static connection.	We expect that this change will add a lot of value to Class 4 wormholes and create a new class of hub systems that allow for exceptional access to wormhole space. We will be listening to your feedback on that proposal in this thread.

We also have some concerns about the power of the armor resist bonus in this effect, especially when combined with capital ships. The solution is to swap the resist bonus into a flat HP bonus like the one found in Pulsars and push the small weapon bonus far enough to create a truly unique combat environment. This huge bonus to frigate weapons will create one of the most distinct combat environments in EVE, which should nonetheless remain quite accessible to all players since keeping a small ship doctrine for your corp requires relatively little in skillpoints, isk and SMA volume.

The change here cuts the cap recharge time penalty in half (so that ships receive higher cap per second rates in Cataclysmic Variable wormholes) and add a new penalty to remote capacitor transmitters. Due to the nature of capacitor transfer bonuses on logistics cruisers and capital ships, this penalty is much more significant for carriers than for smaller ships.

10	english	 	 These are the most popular wormholes by far for PVE, for good reason. The big bonus to all damage provides a very compelling environment. Our goal here is to preserve their current uniqueness and feel while making it a bit easier to take advantage of the tracking penalty to avoid damage in PVP, as well as keeping the effect more balanced for PVE. We will accomplish this goal through a reduction in the effectiveness of target painting modules. Switching the missile penalty to explosion radius helps focus the Magnetar effects towards the signature radius side of the tracking system, as opposed to the Black Holes which mostly interact with the speed side.

10	english	 	 (click to enlarge)	This is the big one. Black Holes are generally unfun and uninteresting in their current form, a shame since living in a system with a black hole should be awesome in a sci-fi game. The major penalties to inertia (which affects agility) and damage projection currently prevent players from truly taking advantage of the speed bonus.	Our solution is to keep the core concept of a “speedy” wormhole but make it truly useful by cutting the inertia penalty in half and rebuilding the other bonuses around high speed missile skirmishing. With bonuses to missile velocity, missile explosion velocity, targeting range and a new penalty to stasis webifier strength this wormhole should provide a new and exciting environment that is unlike anything else in EVE.
10	english	 	 Black Hole
10	english	 	 (click to enlarge)	It is obvious that the Black Hole effect is in need of some help, and indeed one of the most commonly requested changes to wormhole space is a reworking of Black Holes. This effect increases ship speed greatly, but also applies penalties to agility and damage projection. The result is a set of systems that players consider frustrating and tend to avoid. In Hyperion we are completely reimagining the Black Hole wormhole effect into an environment that makes proper use of the speed bonus and provides exciting high-velocity gameplay.	We are also making a set of changes to the other wormhole effects that will help focus their strengths and keep them balanced relative to the other choices.	Finally, we are also streamlining the progression of wormhole effect strengths across different classes of wormholes. This means that the increase in effect strength from one class to another will be more predictable and that the bonuses in lower class wormholes will be more noticeable than before.
10	english	 	 Feedback Thread	One of the many unique aspects of wormhole life is the variety of special wormhole effects that can be found in many W-space systems. These effects can significantly change the balance of power within any given wormhole system by providing system-wide buffs and debuffs and they provide a great variety of combat environments for players to encounter. We are extremely happy with how wormhole effects have worked out overall, and will be taking steps in the Hyperion release to make them even better.	We have had a good understanding for quite some time about which wormhole effects are in need of significant changes, both from the experience of CCPers in wormholes and from reviewing feedback from our very vocal wormhole community. However metrics can also often be useful for evaluating the state of existing features and in this case metrics can be especially instructive.	The following chart shows the relative activity level in systems that contain each of the six wormhole effects, normalized for the number of systems available with each effect.

10	english	 	 Normally I wouldn’t feel that we have to go over our views this explicitly, but I’ve been seeing a distressing number of players misunderstand our position and I wanted to hopefully end the confusion once and for all.	Now that we have that cleared up, I’m sure you’re interested in seeing what we have been working on for our Hyperion release!
10	english	 	 We are absolutely happy with how players have taken the wormhole feature and run with it over the last five years and we look forward to many more years of watching the adventures of the wormhole community with joy and awe. Anyone telling you otherwise is woefully mistaken.
10	english	 	 Back? Ok let’s talk about the parallels between that emergent activity (jetcan mining) and long-term wormhole residence. In both cases EVE players proved even more creative and resourceful than CCP had ever expected, and CCP developers were surprised by the emergent gameplay. In both cases CCP also quickly realized that what the players had created was even better than what we had originally planned. We are not interested in trying to squash unexpected player behavior (unless it’s an exploit that breaks the game experience for everyone else of course). When CCP speaks about giving players the power and acting as janitors of the game we’re not just spouting marketing lines. This acceptance of player agency is right at the core of EVE’s success over the last 11+ years.
10	english	 	 Feedback thread	This section covers a change that wasn't included in the original version of the dev blog, but that we were able to complete in recent weeks.	One very commonly request feature by wormhole residents, especially those who live in Australia and other territories where their playtime often straddles downtime, is for scan IDs of signatures and anoms to remain consistent across server downtimes.	We were initially unsure if we could achieve this change but thanks to the diligent work of CCP Masterplan we now have it working and deployed to our Singularity test server.	This change should go a long way to make the lives of AUtz wormholers much easier as they will no longer need to rescan every signature in their wormhole chain after each downtime.	Feel free to post your feedback on this change in this thread.
10	english	 	 Feedback thread	This final change is a bit more focused, but should still be of interest to most wormhole residents. Over the years we have implemented certain restrictions to bookmark copying, since it has historically been a major source of database load for EVE. At this point after many other gameplay changes wormhole residents are the most common users of the bookmark copying system, and the request was passed to us from the CSM to investigate loosening the restrictions around this activity. We have done some investigation and it does appear that we can safely reduce these restrictions.	So as of the Hyperion release, you will be able to copy more bookmarks at once and the operations should complete significantly more quickly. We will continue to investigate loosening the restrictions further if the first set of changes works out well. While you wait for us to finish the ongoing work that will eventually enable the long-requested alliance bookmarks, this should at least be a helpful change to tide you over.	As always, we are interested to hear your feedback on this change and to hear what else you would like to see from the bookmark system in the future. Feel free to post all your bookmark feedback in this thread.
10	english	 	 **LOOSENING OF BOOKMARK COPYING RESTRICTIONS**
10	english	 	 Feedback thread	As many of you may know, we have been thinking about the mechanics surrounding K162 wormhole appearance for quite some time.	Currently, as soon as the first player initiates warp to a new wormhole, the other side of that wormhole connection (the K162) appears and is visible to probes and to the sensor overlay in the destination system. This provides an unfair amount of early warning to players in the destination system since they receive warning of an impending incursion before the first player jumps into their system. The addition of the sensor overlay in Odyssey made this problem more visible, but it has always existed through the probe system and has never been good gameplay.	We floated an early proposal concerning this issue on the wormhole forums, which discussed the option of implementing a delay after players jump through a wormhole before the K162 wormhole is visible. After discussing this idea on the forums and at Fanfest with members of the W-space community, we heard the major concern that the idea as proposed would have caused players to feel helpless, like there was nothing they could do to detect the potentially hostile players in their system. This is a very legitimate concern, so we went back to the drawing board.	The result is our next proposal, which we believe effectively navigates the concerns of the hunters and the hunted.	As of Hyperion, we are planning to have K162 signatures appear as soon as the first player jumps through their wormhole connection. This prevents players in the destination system from receiving unfair early intelligence while also ensuring that a vigilant player can determine if a potentially hostile intruder has entered their system through a new wormhole connection.	Once a wormhole has been jumped through once, the K162 signature will remain scannable for the lifetime of that wormhole. This scannable state will persist across downtimes.	After discussion with the community we have decided to make some adjustments to this plan to ensure that enough wormhole connections become visible to keep travel options open.	Although K162 signatures will not appear as soon as a player warps to them (as they do currently), they will have a random chance to appear every several minutes once the wormhole connection has less than 15 hours of natural lifetime remaining.	We are looking forward to your feedback on this change, and will be reviewing it from this thread.

10	english	 	 Feedback thread	The next major change we are proposing to wormhole mechanics is a variable adjustment to the distance that ships appear at after jumping through wormholes.	This change is intended to ensure that all attempts to control the local wormhole environment are open to risk of player disruption. We are not satisfied with how easy and safe it is to close wormholes that could potentially allow other players to interact with W-space operations, as the risk of player interaction should always be the main source of tension and danger in W-space.	A proof of concept version of this change appeared on our Singularity test server over the weekend, which caused some consternation among parts of the wormhole community. I want to remind people that unannounced changes appearing on test servers are not a reliable guide for what might reach Tranquility. The version on SISI had distance values that are very different than the ones we had been discussing with the CSM most recently.	The basics of this proposal is for the mass of any individual ship to influence the range that they appear from the wormhole when they emerge on the other side. This should provide a more interesting tactical environment in wormhole combat and ensure a basic level of risk to rolling a wormhole without proper support.	This change would indeed increase the amount of time involved in “ragerolling” (intentionally collapsing static wormhole connections repeatedly to search for targets), but we believe that with the correct values ragerolling can still be viable and that the increase in random wormholes will provide a secondary outlet for players looking for fights without needing to rageroll as often.	After continued discussion with the community we have made some adjustments from the original plan. We are reducing the base range significantly for large ships, and changing the random element to the jump distance. Now the maximum deviation from the base distance will increase for jumping through wormholes that have had significant amounts of mass pass through them. The deviation will be a maximum of 2km for fresh wormholes, and will increase to as much as 5km (in either direction) for a wormhole that is about to collapse. There will also be a lower bound of 2.5km set to prevent the wormhole from decloaking ships.	We beleive these changes will help ensure that the average time to return to a wormhole after jumping will be reasonable, while also keeping an element of risk and randomness. The variable deviation will also allow players to strategically choose how and when to jump ships through a wormhole to reach their desired outcomes.	The new base distance would scale as high as ~14km from the wormhole for the largest ships, and the random factor for each jump would range from 2km (for a fresh wormhole) to 5km (for a crit wormhole) in either direction. The distance from a wormhole that ships must be within to jump will remain 5km as always. The potential distances for several types of common ships would be:	Ship	Mass

Bombs are less heavily used in wormhole space thanks to the prevalence of lower signature ships, but this bonus should help those players who wish to experiment with stealth bomber tactics in wormholes.

10	english	 	 **IN CLOSING**	These proposals are not the only improvements we hope to make for wormhole space in the future, and we are actively discussing with the CSM other improvements that could be made. We encourage you to keep communicating your requests both directly to us here at CCP and to your hardworking CSM members.	We hope you have enjoyed this dev blog and that you are looking forward to the Hyperion release as much as we are here in Team Five O. We are very interested in your feedback on all of these concepts and we encourage you to post your feedback, along with reasons for your arguments, in each of the individual feedback threads linked with each section of this blog. We will be hard at work over the next few weeks coding, refining designs, responding to feedback and testing changes for wormholes and we can’t wait to see how all you incredibly clever players find a way to pleasantly surprise us once again once Hyperion arrives on August 26th.	As for the rest of the changes you should expect in the Hyperion release, CCP Seagull will be posting a "Coming in Hyperion" blog soon with an overview and we will be continuing to release more dev blogs with all the juicy details in the coming days.

Our planned solution is to strengthen the counters and provide more interesting variety in gameplay by adding a bonus to capacitor warfare.

10	english	 	 Feedback thread	This section covers a change that wasn't included in the original version of the dev blog, but that we were able to complete in recent weeks.	One very commonly request feature by wormhole residents, especially those who live in Australia and other territories where their playtime often straddles downtime, is for scan IDs of signatures and anoms to remain consistent across server downtimes.	We were initially unsure if we could achieve this change but thanks to the diligent work of CCP Masterplan we now have it working and deployed to our Singularity test server.	This change should go a long way to make the lives of AUtz wormholers much easier as they will no longer need to rescan every signature in their wormhole chain after each downtime.	Feel free to post your feedback on this change in this thread.
10	english	 	 Feedback thread	This final change is a bit more focused, but should still be of interest to most wormhole residents. Over the years we have implemented certain restrictions to bookmark copying, since it has historically been a major source of database load for EVE. At this point after many other gameplay changes wormhole residents are the most common users of the bookmark copying system, and the request was passed to us from the CSM to investigate loosening the restrictions around this activity. We have done some investigation and it does appear that we can safely reduce these restrictions.	So as of the Hyperion release, you will be able to copy more bookmarks at once and the operations should complete significantly more quickly. We will continue to investigate loosening the restrictions further if the first set of changes works out well. While you wait for us to finish the ongoing work that will eventually enable the long-requested alliance bookmarks, this should at least be a helpful change to tide you over.	As always, we are interested to hear your feedback on this change and to hear what else you would like to see from the bookmark system in the future. Feel free to post all your bookmark feedback in this thread.
10	english	 	 **LOOSENING OF BOOKMARK COPYING RESTRICTIONS**
11	english	 	 Some final words	Please remember all of this is subject to change until deployed and that Market speculation is done at your own risk.	Stay tuned for more and expect threads to appear on the “Features & Ideas Discussion” to discuss specific points mentioned in this blog with time.
11	english	 	 Multiple invention runs	Last but not least, we recently changed Invention to only consume one run of a Tech I blueprint copy instead of eating the whole stack. The next logical course of action is to allow players to start invention with multiple runs (that each consume one run of the input blueprint copy) so they don’t have to launch them manually every hour, which is what we’re going to do with this set of changes.	As a direct consequence of what’s explained just above and after gathering some data of what’s happening post-Crius, we may tweak invention times further on some blueprints to make sure Invention is in a proper state before we move on. We will post more details on this particular point as we get them.
11	english	 	 Tech III subsystem selection	While players can select the race (Amarr, Caldari, Gallente, Minmatar) and type (Offensive, Propulsion, Defensive, Engineering or Electronic) of a given subsystem they are going to invent, there is a random element in the exact type returned, which exists in four variations.	We are going to remove that chance element out of the system by allowing players to directly select the subsystem output they desire instead of running multiple attempts. We are aware that Tech III subsystems are not all equally valuable right now, which is why we may iterate on their material composition to counteract these changes if needed.
11	english	 	 TWEAK TO BASE SUCCESS CHANCES	We would like to tweak base success chance on various item types so they are a bit more consistent with ship sizes. Base invention chances currently are:	Modules and Ammo have a base probability of 40%	Frigates, Destroyers, Freighters and Skiff have a base probability of 30%	Cruisers, Industrials and Mackinaw have a base probability of 25%	Battlecruisers, Battleships and Hulk have a base probability of 20%	We would like to tweak those numbers to:	All modules, rigs and ammo have 40%	All Frigates and Destroyers have 35%	Cruisers, Battlecruisers, Mining Barges, Industrials, ORE industrial have 30%	All Battleships, Industrial Command Ship have 25%	Capitals and Capital Industrial Ships have 20%	So basically it results into a 5% base chance increase for all ships, except Freighters that drop down from 30% to 20% and Exhumers, which get a 0 to 10% boost depending on the exact hull.
11	english	 	 This would give more granularity to the outcome, provides returns on investment when failing or establish a better sense of accomplishment when maximizing success chance. While this would mean less ISK sink into Invention, this is quite needed to counteract the success changes mentioned above.
11	english	 	 Failure (standard): 50% of datacores returned	Failure (poor): 25% of datacores returned	Failure (terrible): 10% of datacores returned	Failure (critical): no datacore returned
11	english	 	 Success (exceptional): yields a ME 2 and TE 3 bonus to the outcome.	Success (great): yields a ME 1 and TE 2 bonus to the outcome.	Success (good): yields a TE 1 bonus to the outcome.	Success (standard): basic unmodified outcome.
11	english	 	 Frankenstein is trying to invent a 425mm Railgun II blueprint copy out of 425mm Railgun I blueprint copy. Base chance is 40%, he has all skills to 5 and uses no decryptor, which results into a 50.4% chance to succeed.	Old (left) versus new (right) Invention chance outcome:	Outcome details:
11	english	 	 ADDING MULTIPLE OUTCOMES TO INVENTION	Invention feels very absolute in its outcome right now - you either get the full results for your trouble or quite nothing, except for a soft pat in the back by a sympathizing CCP Fozzie. We would like to provide more outcome gradients between just a binary 0 or 1. This would be calculated as a % chance on success or failure, and give various outcomes.	Example:
11	english	 	 It is made of:	Again, once the job is initiated, a chance-based roll will determine the outcome based on the following formula (which has been updated with Crius as well):	There are several pain points with the two systems explained above:	Gameplay wise, both have the same goal, to obtain advanced blueprints. For that purpose they employ very closely related mechanics (initiator, sink, chance-based system).	However, despite their similarity, components of the same type don’t behave on the same fashion depending on the activity they’re used into. Data Interface type is determined from the blueprint for Invention, while it sets the racial output for Reverse Engineering.	Invention has two variables affecting the output (Meta Items, Decryptors), while Reverse Engineering has none.	In essence we end up with two different industrial activities that almost have the same look and feel, while having some key differences. That gets confusing when comparing the two: features should either have different gameplay to justify their existence or should not exist separately at all.	That is precisely why we have decided to merge Invention and Reverse Engineering into a single activity.	This merged feature, which shall still be named Invention, will henceforth be defined as the industrial activity that yields advanced blueprints no matter their tech level. If using a Tech I blueprint copy, the output will be a Tech II blueprint copy. When using an Ancient Relic, a Tech III blueprint copy is to be expected.	This activity will have sinks, mainly through Datacores, and will offer ways for the player to modify its inputs and outputs through Teams and Decryptors.	To reach this goal, we will need to do the following:	Data Interface removal: Data Interfaces are going to be removed from the game. We don’t feel they provide gameplay that’s valuable enough to keep around. Data Interfaces will be properly reimbursed when that happens.	Meta Item removal: Meta Item consumption to affect success chance is messy. It only affects modules, not ships and has a formula that is full of exceptions. Those will not be reimbursed as they can be used independently from Invention.	Introduction of Teams to replace Meta Items: we are going to extend the role of Teams to Invention, just like it works right now for other industry activities.	Decryptors will affect Tech III blueprints. We will most likely tweak decryptor attributes in the process to balance their gameplay value.	Invention formula changes: the formula will be changed to the following.	Where the required Racial Encryption Methods skill is going to vary depending on the outcome:	Tech II Blueprint copy: Amarr, Caldari, Gallente or Minmatar Encryption Methods.	Tech III Blueprint copy: Sleeper Encryption Methods, which is the old Reverse Engineering skill that we are going to rename.	For comparison purposes, below are the old Invention + Reverse Engineering success chances (left) versus new (right):	That means a 20% chance drop when inventing Tech II Blueprint copies if you were using a Meta 4 item, and approximately 40% chance drop when inventing Tech III blueprint copies with maximum skills. While that is quite a lot in practice, this is not set in stone yet and we have a lot of changes coming in to mitigate that.	We are compensating the success chance decrease by:	Having Decryptors now affect Tech III blueprints as well, allowing you to impact their ME and TE levels.	Having Teams affect Invention ME and TE inputs, which can shave Datacore costs down.	And more importantly, by the changes that are explained below, so we encourage you to keep reading.
11	english	 	 It consists of:	Once the job is started and the components consumed, the system uses a chance roll mechanic to determine if the player gets the coveted Tech II blueprint copy or gets out empty-handed.	The formula has been slightly changed with Crius and now is:	Reverse Engineering is used to obtain Tech III blueprint copies out of Ancient Relics from Sleeper space in wormholes and was introduced back in EVE Online: Apocrypha.
11	english	 	 MERGING INVENTION WITH REVERSE ENGINEERING	Let us quickly explain how Invention and Reverse Engineering work right now for the non-initiated before going into details.	Invention is used to obtain Tech II blueprint copies out of Tech I blueprint copies and was introduced to replace the old Tech II blueprint original “lottery”.
11	english	 	 (click image to enlarge)	Finally for Tech II manufacturing we are bringing all “Construction” skill requirements to 1 instead of having arbitrary restrictions to 4 or 5. To compensate, we are giving a bonus for training those skills, like a Time Efficiency reduction. We are also renaming them “Advanced Ship Construction” to emphasize on the fact they’re not required for basic hull manufacturing.	For example let us compare a Sin manufacturing before (left) and after the changes (right):
11	english	 	 For modules and ammunition:	We would like to break the overabundance of Electronic Engineering and Mechanical Engineering skills and datacores, while linking Racial Encryption Methods skills to be more intuitive in general.

11	english	 	 Combat: stays as Mechanical Engineering
11	english	 	 Attack: High Energy Physics
11	english	 	 For ships:	Mechanical Engineering is needed for most ship invention (for Tech I hulls) and manufacturing (for Tech II hulls), except for Stealth Bombers and Covert Ops which require Rocket Science and Electronic Engineering respectively. We are making things more even by matching the role of the ship with a required science field.
12	english	 	 THE FUTURE	In this iteration we hope to have all the basic functionality of the feature established and have some of the most essential notification types included, but we won’t stop here.  In follow-up releases we expect to add more notification types to this system, including but not limited to: industry job notifications, combat log events (killmails, not damage logs) and potentially various kinds of invites (convo, fleet, corp etc) and of course NPE notifications.   We will also make changes based on your feedback to improve the feature overall, as always.	So tick that box and give notifications a try!  Thanks for reading!	@CCP_Rise for Team Boiled Cod, over and out.
12	english	 	 (click image to enlarge)
12	english	 	 BETA OPT-IN!	We here on Team Lopapeysa are not only excited about the feature itself, but also the way we get to release it. Rather than pushing back a release to allow time for us to tune and polish based only on feedback from testers on Singularity, we are going to ship it to Tranquility and give you the option of turning it on. There’s a few great things about doing it this way:	We will (hopefully) get a lot more exposure than we would on Singularity which means more feedback	Players choosing to try the feature will be getting realistic amounts and types of notifications so their feedback and our data will be more accurate and informative	If there’s anything wrong with the feature, we don’t have to worry about it negatively affecting the entire player base before we get a chance to make changes (hello tooltips)	So, after Oceanus has launched, if you want to try the new notifications (and we would really appreciate if you did), just open the ‘general’ tab in the ESC menu and click the box to activate new notifications.
12	english	 	 (click image to enlarge)	The last thing to mention here is that, for our first release, we will use the notification system for contact log on/log off, skill training related events, and all notifications currently sent to the notifications tab in EVE mail. More on this in a second.
12	english	 	 (click image to enlarge)	Finally, and maybe most importantly, the options! We know this feature runs the risk of being too noisy to be useful for you savvy veterans, so we’ve tried to make it as customizable as possible to make sure you are getting the information you need instead of just getting spammed. In this screen you can control whether a certain notification type or entire category give you a pop-up, a sound, a history entry, or nothing at all.
12	english	 	 (click image to enlarge)	Next up, history view!  Clicking the notification widget will expand a history view that shows all the notifications you’ve received, up to a limit of (we aren’t sure on limit yet).  Again, clicking particular notifications in the history view will open up the most relevant feature/window.  The history view will collapse itself if the mouse goes somewhere else or you click on the widget a second time.
12	english	 	 (click image to enlarge)	If you get several notifications at once they will stack up and eventually queue if the stack limit is reached. The size of the stack can be configured and is set at 3 as a default.  If you haven’t interacted with the pop-ups for a few seconds they will automatically fade. This fade time is also completely configurable.
12	english	 	 (click image to enlarge)	When a new notification is received, you will get a small pop-up with some basic text content and a small image associated with the category of the notification. If you want to know more about this particular event, just click on the notification pop-up and we’ll open the most appropriate game window for you.
12	english	 	 BUT WHY	Before I dig into details I want to take a second to explain why we’re doing notifications now.  Our team is dedicated to working on the new player experience (NPE) and one of our goals is to eventually remove the existing tutorial and replace it with a much more open-ended experience - for that to work we need a way to let new players know when they’ve done something awesome (or failed horribly) and there isn’t such a system in the game at the moment that fits very well.	On top of not finding a pre-existing system for messaging the NPE, when we started looking at what systems we might have been able to use we realized how many different feedback avenues there are in the game, scattered all over the place like Elise Randolph’s tears after the Alliance Tournament semifinals. Sometimes you get mail notifications, sometimes it’s confined to the specific feature window (industry jobs for example), sometimes it’s a popup (could be anywhere on the screen), and sometimes it’s a big dialog box smack in the middle. Rather than building a new, stand-alone NPE feature that would add yet another method of giving feedback, we thought this would be a great opportunity to clean up the feedback experience for everyone by consolidating as many of these methods as possible into one simple notification system.  Ta-da!

14	english	 	 For Ship Scanners, duration and range are also important, but the difference between Tech I and Tech II is less pronounced than for Cargo Scanners so making variations on those stats doesn’t make sense.

One that has reduced duration, called Enduring Cargo Scanner. It has reduced cycle time and reduced cap need (3 instead of 4). The other has better range and is called Scoped Cargo Scanner.

14	english	 	 As you can see, the changes arriving in Oceanus represent the tip of the iceberg for the module work that is coming your way over the coming months. This Module Tiericide project involves input from five development teams within CCP and we have high hopes that it will be just as beneficial as the Ship Tiericide initiative has been. Of course this also doesn’t mean that we’re going to stop our ongoing work on ship balance and on introducing new ships. You’ll be seeing a mix of module balance, ship balance and new items from release to release as we continue to charge forward with our 5-6 week release schedule.

14	english	 	 Ship Scanners also have scan falloff, as ship scanning results are not binary as they are for Cargo Scanners. The named variation goes for a scan falloff in between Tech I and Tech II.
14	english	 	 For Ship Scanners, duration and range are also important, but the difference between Tech I and Tech II is less pronounced than for Cargo Scanners so making variations on those stats doesn’t make sense. However, fitting variation is much more viable due to higher CPU requirements. So we’re going for one named module, called Compact Ship Scanner, focused on reduced fitting requirements.

The “Basic” type will get the CPU bonus of the old T1 version, and both the T1 and Upgraded versions will be getting a boost to bring them closer to T2 in power.	Finally, we’ve also gone ahead and cleaned up the progression among the faction officer versions of the Co-Processors. This mainly takes the form of bringing the Gallente/Serpentis variants up to par with the Caldari/Guristas ones. The Federation Navy, Khanid Navy and Shadow Serpentis variants will now give an equal bonus to the other faction Co-Pros and we’ve fixed up the progression among the officer variants to bring Serpentis and Guristas to parity.	After our changes:	Type Name
14	english	 	 Co-Processors represent the simplest possible set of named modules, since there is nothing but basic power level to differentiate modules within this group. This means that the only named version will get the title “Upgraded” and all of the current named co-processors will be converted into Upgraded Co-Processors.

14	english	 	 Some modules will have fewer viable specializations, and in these cases we will be consolidating many types of modules into fewer types of modules. When this happens, we will follow the same procedure each time:	All market orders for the affected modules will be removed, the modules and escrow will be returned to the character who created the order.	We will convert every module of one type into modules of another type, everywhere in the database. This includes modules currently fit to ships and modules in containers or contracts.	Any instance where the old obsolete module types are dropping from NPCs will be replaced with the new type.	None of the modules we are consolidating have blueprints, so manufacturing will not be an issue in this case.	You’ll see the exact plans for what modules are being consolidated in Oceanus below.
14	english	 	 MODULE TIERICIDE	With Module Tiericide, we are taking our aim at another set of tiers that can stifle choice: meta levels.	The meta level attribute is partially used to differentiate classes of modules behind the scenes, but it’s most visible place for players is with the so-called “meta” modules (also known as named modules). Named modules drop from NPCs all over EVE, and were originally intended to represent a tiered set of special upgraded versions of the base T1 module. Since their names are not very helpful in determining their power level, most players have come to rely on their meta level attribute to figure out which is best at a glance. This is why the phrase “meta 4 module” has become so common in EVE.	The problem with this system is that cost/rarity tiers only work as gameplay tools if the differences in rarity and/or power are very significant. Named modules have suffered from the same problem that the old Tech One ship tiers faced before Tiericide; there’s virtually no reason to use anything other than the top level.	Our solution to this problem is to replace the meta-based named module system with a new role-based system. Each named module in a class will have roughly equivalent power level, and that power level will be above T1. Each named module will also have a specialization that gives a player interested in shopping for named modules a viable and interesting choice. As part of this system, we may consolidate a number of named modules together since we may not need four variations to represent all the areas of interesting player choice. To make it clear that meta levels will no longer represent power differences within the named modules, we will be changing all the named modules to have a meta level of 1.	This image gives a basic overview of how the meta level attribute is used now and how it will be used after Module Tiericide is complete:	You’ll notice that we are keeping the meta level progression for deadspace and officer modules. At these rarity levels the progression system is a bit more successful and can provide some valuable choices. We will be making changes to the balance surrounding deadspace and officer modules but we have no plans to unify their power levels at this time.	There is a set of images that I showed at this year’s Fanfest that still apply very well to our Module Tiericide plans, so I’d like to repeat them here. They use the hypothetical example of a beam laser module, as that example provides a lot of options for named module specializations.	This images shows the current state of meta level progression in EVE. The power level increases along the x axis, with damage modifier being the key “power” metric for lasers:	You can see that the modules mainly fit into a linear path of advancing power, which does not represent a very interesting set of choices for the player.	After the Module Tiericide of beam lasers has completed, the chart would look more like this:	Under the new system, named modules will fall into anywhere from one to four areas of specialization, so that players can choose what attributes matter the most to them.	Each specialization will also have a unique name that is consistent across all named modules, so that if you see a module with the word “Compact” at the front of it you can know that it has reduced fitting costs no matter what type of module it is.	The “named module” names that will be used in our Oceanus changes are:	Upgraded- Used for named modules where no specialization is possible	Compact- Used for named modules that specialize in reduced fitting cost	Enduring- Used for named modules that specialize in lower cap use or otherwise longer running time	Ample- Used for named modules that specialize in extra capacity	Scoped- Used for named modules that specialize in longer range	Restrained- Used for named modules that specialize in reduced drawbacks	It’s important to note that none of the named modules specialize in stronger “primary” stats, as those modules would become the obvious best choice for most situations. So every one of the named modules after Tiericide will have the same primary stats. For instance all of the named Light Missile Launchers have the same rate of fire, all of the named Capacitor Flux Coils provide the same cap/s increase, and in the future all of the named Heavy Beam Lasers will have the same damage multiplier.	We expect that we will be adding more categories as we go forward with more module groups (for instance once we move into turrets you can expect that we’ll be adding a tracking specialization).	At the same time we will be consolidating the so-called “Basic” tier of modules. These modules generally have lower skill and fitting requirements than T1, and provide a very small bonus in exchange. “Basic” modules stopped entering the game quite some time ago, but the remaining copies of the modules are sometimes used for niche fits. We will be consolidating these modules down to one type, which will generally be equal or better to the best “basic” module in the class pre-Tiericide. This new module type will be clearly labelled as “Basic” and will have the COSMOS tag to indicate that it’s a special snowflake.
14	english	 	 THE STORY SO FAR	Before Tiericide, tech one ships were split into artificial “tiers” that were intended to represent a progression from weaker ships to stronger ships. Lower tier ships required lower skill levels and cost less, but were much weaker. Higher tier ships enjoyed extra slots, more hitpoints and powerful bonuses. In practice, this system presented a false choice, as everyone correctly flocked to the highest tier ships and the lower tiers languished in disuse.	As CCP Ytterbium outlined in his Fanfest 2012 Balancing presentation, followed up with multiple dev blogs, the Tiericide initiative replaced those old tiers with a series of ship lines that represented distinct strengths and weaknesses for distinct roles. Each tech one ship within the same class (like “cruiser” or “frigate”) post-Tiericide is intended to have roughly similar overall power, but that power can and should be expressed in a variety of forms.
15	english	 	 Therefore, changes we are making to the previously-announced plan:	Jump freighter max range will be bumped up to 10LY, and they will keep the 90% fatigue-distance reduction. This represents a slight range reduction compared to TQ so some cynos will need to be repositioned, but otherwise leaves them largely alone. Note that, because ranges multiply together for fatigue purposes, one 10LY jump is substantially less fatiguing (multiply by 11) than two 5LY jumps (multiply by 36). Rorquals will stay at 5LY/90%.	All ships designated as having a "hauling" role in ISIS (i.e. the following ship groups: Industrial, Blockade Runner, Deep Space Transport, Industrial Command Ship, Freighter) will similarly get a 90% reduction to distance counted for the purpose of fatigue generation. Obviously they can't jump themselves, but this does apply to the use of bridges or portals.	We are adding some additional code to allow us to put a bonus on jump portals that reduces fatigue generation for all ships jumping through that portal. This will be applied to Covert Jump Portals, with a value of around 50% (subject to further tuning). This means that all ships using a black ops portal will generate less fatigue.	We're going to bump the max range of black ops ships up slightly to 8LY, and likewise give them a ~50% fatigue bonus.	Finally, we're slightly nerfing the skill Jump Drive Calibration from 25%/level to 20%/level, and tuning base ranges accordingly. This allows us to give most capital ships a base range of 2.5LY, rather than 2.2r LY, and still hit our max range targets. More work on these skills will probably be done in future, this is just minimum changes necessary to get these changes on TQ so we can see how they play out in practice and establish how comparatively valuable their different bonuses are.	For more details on these updates, please see this forum thread.
15	english	 	 In addition:	Almost all jump-capable ships will have their range reduced to 5 LY after skills; this is both necessary to allow us to not penalize short-distance travel in a cleaner way, and also as a goal in and of itself to constrain the distance covered in single hops. . (Note that jump portal range on a ship is always the same as its own jump drive range.)	As above, capital ships will be able to use stargates, but will for the time being they will still be barred from entering Highsec (that is a larger discussion that we would like to revisit in future).
15	english	 	 What is changing?	We are going to allow capital ships to use gates in lowsec/nullsec, and we are aiming to make gate-to-gate travel take less time than jump travel over distances of more than ~20 LY. We've run simulations for capital ships travelling between arbitrary pairs of systems, and settled on the target movement speed of no less than 3 minutes per lightyear for travel over 20 LY. This should allow us to bring about the main change we want to see – less sustained use of jump travel – while still preserving its value for short bursts of movement.	How is this going to be achieved?	The primary change is the addition of a new mechanic, called "jump fatigue".	Jump fatigue is tracked for each character, persisting between play sessions and over downtimes as appropriate.	Every time you use any jump drive, jump bridge or jump portal (hereafter all treated as "a jump"; note that this does NOT include stargate travel!), you will accumulate jump fatigue. If your fatigue is below 1 before a jump, your fatigue will be 1 + (light years travelled) after the jump. For subsequent jumps, the fatigue is multiplied after each jump by 1 + (light years travelled). This stays on the character as mentioned earlier, and decays at a rate of 0.1 per minute.	After a jump is complete but before your fatigue is increased, you gain a jump cooldown timer. The length of this timer is a number of minutes equal to your jump fatigue (before being increased by that jump!), and you are unable to make another jump of any kind until this timer expires. Note importantly that, because fatigue decays at a slower rate than a cooldown timer, you will retain fatigue for a length of time after your cooldown timer expires. Additionally, there is a minimum jump cooldown of 1 + (light years travelled) minutes. (See Appendix A for examples.)	The status of both your fatigue and your cooldown timer will be displayed in the timer bar in the upper left corner of the screen:
15	english	 	 Why this?/Why now?	Nullsec is stagnant and needs a change. This is the first of many steps in our plan.	Big fights are cool, but they’re crowding out more accessible and more frequent smaller ones.	These changes have positive implications for people not involved in sovereignty warfare, for example making use of capitals in lowsec less risky.	We expect the impact of these changes to be emergent, and as a consequence are unpredictable and will take a while to develop on TQ. This plays into our longer-term plans, as you’ll see in a second!	How do these changes fit into the Nullsec plan?	As we’ve previously discussed at Fanfest, in our recent forum post, and in the premiere episode of The o7 Show, a group of developers here at CCP has been working on Nullsec and associated game systems with the goal of releasing a series of changes to shake up the status quo and improve the overall state of Nullsec. We are planning to deploy changes over several phases, which will each provide specific improvements individually while also fitting into one greater whole.	Phase One contains the long-distance travel changes, as well as some other associated changes planned in Phoebe in November. These changes are not intended to be a silver bullet to fix all of Nullsec’s issues in one fell blow. Instead, they represent a significant improvement to specific areas of concern for Nullsec (and Lowsec) while also setting the stage for the later changes.	Phase Two is focused on medium-term changes to the ways that organizations capture and hold Nullsec space and infrastructure. We are working with the CSM as we firm up our plans for this phase and as we develop internal prototypes. It is during this phase that we expect to make greater progress towards smaller and more diverse Nullsec holdings. It is too early to go into great detail about what these changes will contain, but currently most of our conceptual prototyping has loosely fallen into categories that could be described as “occupancy-based” systems and more “freeform” systems that decentralize sov to focus more on control of the individual pieces of infrastructure. As we continue this investigation we will be working closely with the CSM and following all appropriate player feedback.	Phase Three is the stage that CCP Seagull discussed in the EVE Keynote at Fanfest this year. This stage is intended to build upon the changes that we are planning for starbases/structures and corps/alliances in 2015, changes that will open up new possibilities for more dynamic warfare and more granular control of territory. This phase is also intended to lead quite deliberately into the future through our vision for player-built stargates.	By splitting the task of improving Nullsec into manageable chunks, we are ensuring that we get you the best changes as quickly as possible rather than holding back needed updates. We’re happy to be getting the first significant chunk of these changes out to you all later this year.
15	english	 	 Hi everyone,	We are about to make some significant changes to how long-distance travel in various forms works in EVE, with the aim of significantly increasing minimum travel times between two arbitrary distant points, most particularly in regards to jump drive and portal based movement. The overarching reason for this is that the current ease of movement has shrunk the practical dimensions of New Eden considerably, to the detriment of the game experience.
15	english	 	 Conclusions we have reached through this exercise:	The ease of nullsec logistics permitted by jump freighters, and to a lesser extent jump bridge networks, is not aligned with where we would like nullsec industry to be.	It is however, pretty well aligned with where nullsec industry is right now. As we improve the status quo for industry in nullsec, we will want to reevaluate this balance along with the impact potential changes would have on logistical work for other areas of the game.	We're pretty happy with the impact of the proposed changes on the movement of non-covert combat ships, as it relates to both jump drives and jump bridges for all ranges.	We're not overly concerned about the battle rorqual; if it starts being used in a widespread fashion we will nerf it, but we're not expecting this to happen.	We're also not overly concerned yet about High Grade Ascendency equipped capital fleets, since such capital movement would be very vulnerable to disruption and because it relies on very rare items. If this becomes a widespread usage pattern we will likely take action, and we'll be keeping a close eye on everything surrounding capital movement after Phoebe.	Black ops are working in a generally OK manner on TQ right now, and we want to minimize harm to their use with these changes.	We don't like repeating decimals.
15	english	 	 Very large fatigue values will take a loooong time to decay, is this too much?	Possibly yes, we'll have a look at this.	Does a titan providing a bridge gain fatigue when people jump through it?	No. Only if the titan itself jumps.	Is the ability to push your fatigue up to really high numbers a good idea?	Probably not, no. We're looking at just capping fatigue at 1 month.	Appendix C - Updates
15	english	 	 Does this make it too difficult for new pilots to get out into 0.0?	Yes, it probably does. Following further discussion after publishing this dev blog, we have come up with the following additional feature:	For players less than thirty days old, once per player corporation joined, or	For all players greater than thirty days old, once per year:	You may push a button in your corp interface (while a member of a player corp and docked) that:	Moves your medical clone to a station designated by your corporation, and	Then moves you to the (new) station containing your medical clone	The exact method of corporations designating the target station is still being ironed out, but it will involve at the very least being able to designate a default station for all corp members and will likely be allowed for any station with a corp office, regardless of system sec status. This seems to us like it solves the "I want to recruit people to Nullsec" concern, and also gives non-Nullsec recruiters an easier way to get genuinely new players to the right location quickly and easily.	Is the balance for Black Ops final?	No. Please give feedback!
15	english	 	 Appendix A – Examples	Little Bobby Tables is sitting in his Archon in UJY-HE in at the top of Deklein, just after the Oceanus release. He wants to travel to Atioth, at the bottom of Geminate, which is around 50 LY as the space-crow flies. He consults a popular jump planning service, which gives him a route of four jumps and 53 LY. He’s travel fit and has max skills, so his jump range is 14.625 LY and he’s expecting to be limited primarily by the session change timer. The journey takes him around two minutes.	A month or so later, he’s back in UJY-HE, and Phoebe has just shipped. His Archon’s jump range is now 5 LY. He consults his jump planner, and finds that his route is now 12 jumps and 54 LY. He hasn’t jumped anywhere since the release, so he has no jump fatigue.	His first jump, of 4.85 LY, takes him to U-TJ7Y. Because he has no fatigue before the jump, he gains a minimum-length jump cooldown timer: 1 minute, plus 4.85 minutes for the distance travelled, for a total of 5.85 minutes, or 5 minutes 51 seconds. He also gains a jump fatigue value of 5.85.	He waits for just under six minutes. In this time his jump fatigue decays down to 5.27. He then makes his next jump – 3.57 LY to LEK-N5. He gets a 5 minute 16 second jump cooldown timer, because his fatigue was 5.27 when he jumped, and his minimum timer would be 4 minutes 34 seconds based on range travelled. He then gets a fatigue increase after the jump. Because he travelled 3.57 LY, his fatigue is multiplied by 4.57, taking it up to 24.06.	He waits out his timer, which also reduces his fatigue to 23.53. After his cooldown timer expires, he makes his third jump, to RO0-AF, a distance of 4.19 LY. He gains a jump cooldown timer of 23 minutes 32 seconds, and his fatigue is multiplied by 5.19, up to 122.14.	After waiting for 23.5 minutes at the convenient local station, his fatigue is down to 119.79. He jumps again, to 2R-CRW – 4.9 LY. At this point his cooldown timer is 2 hours 2 minutes 8 seconds, and his fatigue is 706.74. At this point his total distance travelled is 17.51 LY, leaving him with 37.04 LY to go. He looks at his map, and finds a 40-route jump through nullsec to get to the same destination, and figuring two minutes per system, his warp travel time for the whole journey is a bit over half the cooldown for his next jump. He decides to fly there directly rather than trying to jump any further.	The next week, he finds he needs to take his Ark from HED-GP to 373Z-7, at the bottom of Stain. It’s been long enough that his fatigue has entirely decayed, so he’s starting fresh again. He plots the route, and sets off.	First jump takes him to 5-N2EY, 4.73 LY. Because his jump freighter counts distances as being 10% of their actual distance, he incurs a minimum timer of 1.47 minutes, or 88 seconds. His fatigue similarly becomes 1.47, dropping to 1.32 while he waits out the delay.	He jumps again when his timer expires, to 4NBN-9, a 4.88 LY jump. His timer after this would be 79 seconds, but because this is a longer jump his minimum is 89 seconds (1.488*60). His fatigue is multiplied by 1.488, taking it to 1.97, and then dropping back to 1.82 as he waits out the timer.	This continues until he reaches 373Z-7, with a total journey time of around 7.5 minutes, and a jump distance of 22.3 LY.	Appendix B - Frequently Asked Questions	Can supercapital ships use gates after this change?	Yes.
15	english	 	 What's next?	We will be actively participating in the comments thread of this blog and listening elsewhere around the internet.	These changes will be appearing on the Singularity test server in the next couple of weeks.	We anticipate shipping them in Phoebe, which comes out in November.	We are expecting to make follow-up adjustments in Rhea, in December.	The medium-term shake-out of these changes will be very impactful on sovereignty-system changes we are anticipating making next year, so we are expecting to revisit all this again as the work on those changes progresses.	Greyscale, on behalf of the Nullsec Working Group (Scarpia, Fozzie, Ytterbium, Rise, Bettik, Delegate Zero, Masterplan and Nullarbor)	**Update:** As mentioned above, we're taking feedback and responding in the thread, so look for those blue bars. Greyscale has also created a short FAQ that will be updated as needed as the first reply to the thread.
15	english	 	 What are the anticipated consequences?	In the short term, we would anticipate a reduction in the degree to which the average non-trivial capital fight escalates, and the number of parties involved. This seems likely to increase the frequency of capitals being deployed in small-scale engagements, in both lowsec and nullsec.	Over the medium term, we see the potential for more substantial changes in the nullsec status quo as the various competing parties work to adjust their internal objectives to the new situation; it seems plausible that the general reduction in travel capabilities will lead to more localism, but we don't want to make any firm predictions in this area. We're confident that these changes improve the overall system of lowsec and nullsec gameplay and take them in better directions, but any set of changes that would allow us to accurately predict their consequences would by their nature be too simple to be interesting for very long.
15	english	 	 What's being special-cased?	Jump Freighters and Rorquals will gain a role bonus: 90% reduction to effective range jumped for the purposes of all these calculations, but will otherwise get all the described changes. This means that, for all the math we’re doing on this feature, whenever we use the range jumped as a variable we first multiply it by 0.1. We will still likely want to revisit the logistical power of these ships in future, but for now we want to bring them into the new system without nerfing them too hard.	Black Ops ships will have their range unchanged, but will otherwise get all the described changes.  This also keeps the range of their jump portals unchanged. We don’t feel that Black Ops range needs adjustment right now.
15	english	 	 What's not changing?	Starbase jump bridges already have a 5 LY range, so they don't need range adjustments.	We are hoping to leave skills as they are for the initial release; we will likely readjust them in the near future, but we want to see how behavior settles down first.	Jump clones are being left alone for the time being. We are likely to want to revisit them once the initial changes shake out, the use of ship caches becomes clear and so on, but they serve a diverse enough set of purposes (null-null movement, null-highsec movement, implant swapping etc.) that we don’t want to make major changes too quickly.
15	english	 	 What else?	You will only be able to move your medical clone to the station you are currently docked at. This prevents obvious movement workarounds with suicide-cloning.  (If your clone contract is revoked by the station owner, we are keeping the current behavior that it is moved to your home system as defined in the character sheet.)	Hitpoints and resistances on various sovereignty-related structures will be revisited, to balance out the reduced ability to use Supercarriers against them. Stay tuned for a follow-up blog on this.	We will be releasing a collection of other smaller changes in Phoebe that will be of interest to many of the same people who are affected by these travel changes. These include a rebalance of starbase weapons, a rebalance of stealth bombers and heavy interdictors, enabling of lowsec doomsdays, and changes to interdictor bubble mechanics. More information to come.
16	english	 	 PHASE TWO	Phase two is the final phase where we have fully implemented responsive design. Once preparations have completed, we want to launch a beta forum in parallel with the current forum in order to get feedback. We will talk about phase two in more detail later.	We would love to get your feedback on the forums. If everything goes as planned then phase one will be launched within the next two weeks.	Thanks!

16	english	 	 The new drop-down menu. 	The quick search has been moved to its own drop-down menu. 	All forum related settings have been moved from EVE Gate to a single settings page on the forums. 	The signature editor has also changed, it's now using Markdown editor which gives you more control to format the signature with live preview.
16	english	 	 PHASE ONE	The first phase involves a major clean up. We are going to remove the giant EVE Gate header and move most of the EVE Gate links, such as the link to your EVE Gate Profile, to a new drop-down menu in the navigation bar. The new drop-down menu will also display all of your characters, where you can easily switch character without having to go to EVE Gate.

17	english	 	 TRIAL ACCOUNT UPGRADE IMPROVEMENTS	Messaging around limitations on trial accounts and the path to subscription are being improved in Phoebe. A number of limitations for trial accounts are also being removed, such as the ability to fly battleships and participate in incursions and factional warfare. More information in an upcoming dev blog.	That’s it for now, hope to have you all join us on the stream from EVE Vegas, and please bring us your feedback on the forums.
17	english	 	 NEW AND REBALANCED EXPLORATION REWARDS	Data sites get better reward balance and a variety of new items will be possible to find in these exploration sites. Data and Relic sites found in Null Security Space will also be present in wormhole Class 1-3 systems. An upcoming blog will describe the changes.
17	english	 	 NEW INVENTION	Invention and reverse engineering are merged in Phoebe along with a number of other changes to this area of industry, that you can read all about in this dev blog: Lighting the Invention bulb There will also be a number of requested changes to the Industry user interface, such as the ability to collapse the top view. More on the changes since the first blog in an upcoming dev blog.
17	english	 	 MULTIPLE MARKET SELL ORDER CREATION	Phoebe brings the possibility to create multiple market sell orders at the same time, to for example quickly sell off a large amount of assorted items. The feature is live on Singularity in an early form already. Read more in this forum post, and stay tuned for a dev blog.
17	english	 	 UNLIMITED SKILL QUEUE	To help people temporarily lacking access to an EVE client and generally remove annoyance, in Phoebe you will be able to construct and start training skill queues of unlimited time length. Trial accounts will still have a 24 hour queue limitation. This change will be live on Singularity along with a feedback thread next week.
17	english	 	 LONG DISTANCE TRAVEL CHANGES	Phoebe brings big changes to long distance travel in EVE Online, introducing jump fatigue for characters using jump drives, jump bridges and jump portals along with a number of related changes that affect the ecosystem of travel, warfare and logistics in EVE. Related changes include capital ships using gates, doomsday weapons working in low security space, sovereignty structure hit point adjustments, starbase weapon rebalance, Stealth Bombers and Heavy Interdictors rebalance, and station bubble modifications.

18	english	 	 Secondly we have touched upon Expeditions.	For those of you that are in the dark regarding these so called ‘Expeditions’, (also referred to as Escalations), here’s a brief rundown to bring you up to speed.	“Once in a while, battles in Deadspace tend to escalate due to you being able to track down the origins/destinations of enemy messages or finding compromising plans or data in ship wrecks. These are called Expeditions and normally escalate further and further, until you either reach a dead end or the final location (mostly found in Low Security Space).”	The general bulk of the work has simply been to smooth out Expeditions by fixing all of the existing defects associated with them, (Bosses that didn’t spawn, triggers that didn’t work etcetera) but we’ve also touched upon a few other aspects.	For example in some ‘parent’ anomalies and signatures (where you have the possibility of an escalating path occurring) most of the expeditions require you to interact in some way with the space scene.	So we’ve added in some messaging to guide you towards these specific structures.	![](//content.eveonline.com/www/newssystem/media/66598/1/ExpeditionNotification.jpg)	Do it! We know you want to

So for Phoebe, we’ve made the following exploration changes to help alleviate this:	Lowered the volume of the most commonly dropped items (Electric Conduits for example) in exploration Data Sites from 1.0 (and above) to 0.5.	The drop frequency of faction POS blueprints in all Data and Relic sites has been increased.	The drop frequency of 'Optimized' items in all Data sites has been increased.	Faction Materials have been added to the all the exploration Data site loot tables.	These can be found in the Manufacture & Research > Materials > Faction Materials section of the Market.

19	english	 	 WHAT WE ARE CHANGING	We want players on trial accounts to have a chance to experience a large variety of activities in EVE without being overly burdened by existing restrictions. This will help to make it easier to find something they enjoy doing and thus decide to stick around. In that vein we are lifting the following restrictions in Phoebe:	Trial accounts are no longer limited in the ways they can send and receive ISK. They are now able to directly transfer ISK to other characters and corporations and send ISK to other characters by direct trades in stations. This will assist trial players who want to share ISK with each other or are looking to get into a corporation.	Players looking for places to trade will now be able to post in trade chat channels (Channels 10 - 15). The normal restriction on chat frequency still apply. 	Players interested in mission running are no longer limited to just level 1 and 2 agents and they can now participate in incursions (and receive a cut of the reward pool). Those interested in some low-sec mission running and/or PvP can now sign up for Factional Warfare.	To assist with joining corporations, trial players will now be able to apply to up to 5 corporations at any one time. If they are rejected by a corporation or withdraw their application, an application slot will free up and they will be able to apply to another corporation. For those who are not quite ready to make the jump into a permanent corporation, trial players will now be able to post fleet finder advertisements.
19	english	 	 WHY WE ARE CHANGING TRIALS	The goal of these changes is to open up the game to new players so they can explore a greater variety of the content available in EVE. We believe getting new players invested in the game early on will keep them playing longer than if we throw all the good stuff behind a subscriber wall. In addition to opening up the game for trial users, we will be adding extensive logging in every area that we are removing restrictions. This way we can closely follow changes to ensure they are not enabling negative behavior such as botting or trial cycling exploits.
20	english	 	 With the new release cadence, we have realized that we need as an efficient team as possible and we can’t afford to have a CSM that is only partially functioning. We simplified a lot of internal processes and we are also working on updating the CSM White Paper right now. There will be more discussion of this and finalization at the CSM9 Winter Summit.	The main change that some of you might have noticed – we found a new way to deal with resigning members. This is thanks to your feedback from this thread, by the way!	Before now, we would just run a short staffed team. This will be changing and we will be replacing members if they decide or have to leave (we are also looking into a possibility to deal with inactive members).	We will be removing the person who has left from the ballot and re-running the elections with an updated ballot.	However, this will only be done if there are three or more release cycles left till the end of the term. We are still polishing this idea, so please, leave your feedback in the discussion thread for this dev blog.	Please expect more information about this and other changes with the CSM later in the future.	<3	@CCP_Leeloo
20	english	 	 Unfortunately, while CSM9 has additional time for the summit, they won’t have any additional time for their actual term. Furthermore, they will be a short-term CSM as we will be announcing the new council during the keynote at FanFest 2015, which has been moved forward to March 21 to coincide with a solar eclipse here in Reykjavik.	For all people who want to try themselves at this tough job, I will start accepting the applications for CSM10 on January, 30th and the elections themselves will happen on February, 25th.	Don’t worry if you don’t know anything about the process, I will be publishing another dev-blog regarding the elections closer to that date. 	Internal changes
21	english	 	 MULTI-INVENTION OUTCOME AND INVENTION TEAMS	These two features will not be going live for Phoebe.	After some discussion we arrived to the conclusion that multi-invention outcome, while adding a beneficial impact on this activity, was annoying with large industry batches and messing with players wishing to accurately predict long term job outcomes.	So we instead decided to spend our time working on force projection changes, which we’re sure you can agree was a much more pressing problem to address for this particular release.	Regarding invention teams, we are currently investigating the purpose and state of teams in the game as a whole.	In all cases, we hope you are going to appreciate the invention changes we have been working on for Phoebe. Manufacture safely out there and may the invention RNG gods be with you.
21	english	 	 DECRYPTOR MERGING:	As part of our effort to remove needless complexity from EVE, racial decryptors are now going to be merged into one set of generic decryptors which affect all races in the same way. Decryptors will also now affect Ancient Relics.	So, for example, if you had an Occult Accelerant and Esoteric Accelerant Decryptor in your hangar, you will now receive 2x Accelerant Decryptors when Phoebe goes live.	As an added bonus, Cosmos items will no longer require Decryptors as part of their manufacturing requirements.

21	english	 	 2018-02-13 - BY CCP FALCON
21	english	 	 New mechanic added: Jump Fatigue	This constrains jump-aided movement over time, encouraging such movement methods to be used rarely and locally. Fatigue and related mechanics never arise from or apply to stargate travel.	Jump fatigue is expressed as a time value, indicating the duration over which it will take to decay to 0. This value counts down in real time.	Jump fatigue has a minimum amount of 10 x (1 + (LY traveled)) minutes after a jump. Jump fatigue has a maximum amount of 30 days.	Jump fatigue is otherwise multiplied by 1 + (LY traveled) after each jump.	This allows us to discourage people travelling longer distances using jump travel, while keeping penalties relatively light for tactical/occasional movement.	After each jump, pilots gain a jump cooldown timer which prevents them using a jump drive/jump bridge/jump portal again until this cooldown has expired.	The length of the timer is dependent on the amount of fatigue present on the pilot when the jump is executed.	The length of your timer, should you jump right now, is displayed in the fatigue tooltip.	There is a minimum length a timer can be, equal to 1 + (LY traveled) in minutes.	The cooldown timer is the thing that actually constrains movement.	Certain ships have bonuses to “effective distance traveled for the purposes of jump fatigue”. This multiplies with the (LY traveled) element of the above expressions.	Note that it does not affect the “1 +”; this prevents fatigue from being reduced by very short jumps.	Ships in the following groups gain a 90% reduction to effective distance traveled: industrial, blockade runner, deep space transport, freighter, industrial command ship, capital industrial ship, jump freighter.	This eases the impact of these changes on alliance logistics for the time being. We would like to remove these bonuses in future, but we don’t feel nullsec industry is in a sufficiently strong place that it would be prudent to do so right now.	Black Ops ships gain a 50% reduction to effective distance traveled.	Ships using a Covert Jump Portal similarly gain a 50% reduction to effective distance traveled for that jump; this multiplies with other similar bonuses.	This eases the impact on Black Ops operations, which are not a primary target for these changes. Note that a) we are expecting to need to tune these numbers in the short term as we see how they play out after Phoebe’s release, and b) these ships are in need of larger balance attention, at which time these numbers might change further.
21	english	 	 **JUMP FATIGUE**
21	english	 	 **GATE MOVEMENT**	Carriers, dreadnoughts, supercarriers, titans and capital industrials can now use stargates, provided they do not lead into a highsec system.	We want to reduce the usage of jump drives (see below), but we don’t also want to lock ships into particular systems. We also want to encourage more gate-to-gate traffic and allow more ships to use gates!	We’d like to allow capitals into highsec without restriction in the future, but it’s a major change that is for a later time. For now, this maintains the status quo in highsec.
21	english	 	 **JUMP DRIVE RANGES**	Jump Drive Calibration (JDC) skill bonus reduced from 25%/level to 20%/level.	Primarily to allow us to make base ranges whole numbers while hitting our target ranges – a 2.25x multiplier leads to lots of repeating decimals.	Titan base jump range reduced from 3.5LY to 2.5LY, for a new maximum range of 5LY with skills.	Supercarrier base jump range reduced from 5LY to 2.5LY, for a new maximum range of 5LY with skills.	Carrier base jump range reduced from 6.5LY to 2.5LY, for a new maximum range of 5LY with skills.	Dreadnought base jump range reduced from 5LY to 2.5LY, for a new maximum range of 5LY with skills.	Combat capitals (i.e. the above listed classes) brought down to a universal 2.5LY base range, for uniformity, ease of fleet logistics, and to make multiple jumps still be necessary in many situations over the shorter deployment ranges expected post-Phoebe.	Rorqual base jump range reduced from 3.5LY to 2.5LY, for a new maximum range of 5LY with skills.	Rorqual is – for now – keeping its 20%/level drone damage bonus, and consequently being balanced alongside other combat capital ships. This ship needs further balance work, and these numbers will probably change when that happens.	Jump Freighter base jump range remains at 5LY, for a new maximum range of 10LY with skills.	Jump freighters are slightly reduced in range, but the max range we want is achieved by the JDC change without needing further adjustments to the ships themselves.	Black Ops base jump range increased from 3.5LY to 4LY, for a new maximum range of 8LY with skills.	Minor range increase after JDC changes are taken into account, to create nicer numbers and err on the side of being generous to Black Ops given the impact of other changes.

21	english	 	 THE SCOPE
21	english	 	 When he makes the first jump, he has no fatigue or cooldown, so incurs the minimum fatigue value (10 (1+5) = 60 minutes) and the minimum cooldown value (1+5 = 6 minutes).	When he makes the second jump, he has waited for 6 minutes, so his fatigue is 54 minutes before the jump, and 54 (1 + 5) = 324 minutes after. His cooldown would be 5.4 minutes (10% of fatigue), but the minimum is 6 minutes so he has another 6 minute cooldown.	When he makes the third jump, his fatigue is 318 minutes (waiting 6 minutes again), and becomes 318 * (1 + 5) = 1908 minutes. His cooldown is 31.8 minutes, or 31 minutes 48 seconds.	Frankie Flowers has an Ark, and travels 3 jumps of 10LY each. Because he has a bonus, all distances are instead treated as 1LY when calculating fatigue values.	When he makes the first jump, he has no fatigue or cooldown, so incurs the minimum fatigue value (10 (1+1) = 20 minutes) and the minimum cooldown value (1+1 = 2 minutes).	When he makes the second jump, he has waited for 2 minutes, so his fatigue is 18 minutes before the jump, and 18 (1 + 1) = 36 minutes after. His cooldown would be 1.8 minutes (10% of fatigue), but the minimum is 2 minutes so he has another 2 minute cooldown.	When he makes the third jump, his fatigue is 34 minutes (waiting 2 minutes again), and becomes 34 * (1 + 1) = 68 minutes. His cooldown is 3.4 minutes, or 3 minutes 24 seconds.	alt

21	english	 	 **THE FUTURE**	“And with the force projection changes, we're starting of course earlier that we had maybe planned before to touch sovereignty and so on, and we will just keep rolling with this, in the phases that we're outlined in the devblog about the long-distance travel changes, and I'll just recap them here. The first phase is the changes we are shipping now in Phoebe, and the phase coming after that, which is really starting in 2015 right away, is real changes to nullsec space holding and infrastructure, and as soon as we get to more interesting pieces — we have plans for revamping corporations, alliances, structures, and so on — we also start building towards more ambitious changes to the sandbox gameplay — more things to do, more player-driven infrastructure, just more interesting pieces to play with, with the overall goal to create more things to do for everything from the solo person to small groups, bigger diversity of small groups, as well as the megagroups that you guys organize. So, phase three is really about combining all the new stuff we want to do into a next level of sandbox gameplay in EVE Online.”	-Executive Producer CCP Seagull, EVE Vegas 2014	This blog describes the final state of affairs for what is shipping in Phoebe – barring catastrophe we will not be making further adjustments. We are, however, intending to make follow-up changes immediately following Phoebe’s release if needed, in the December 9th Rhea release as we see how things work out, and in future releases as we continue to work on nullsec issues.	Thanks,	-Greyscale
21	english	 	 **MEDICAL CLONE MOVEMENT CHANGES**	You can normally only move your medical clone to the station you are currently docked in.	You can always set your medical clone to your starter corporation’s HQ station.	This removes the method of moving your clone and then podkilling yourself to quickly teleport at will.	Once per year, characters can move their medical clone to either their corp HQ, or any station in which their corporation has an office. This option does not accumulate if it is unused.	For characters less than 30 days old, every time they change corp this counter will reset and they will be able to move their clone again.	This makes it easier for new players to move to where their new corp is based, now that they can no longer podjump there. Older players are assumed to be capable of relocating themselves without assistance.
21	english	 	 Exact changes below:	Adding 1 Neurovisual Output Analyzer to Electronic, Engineering and Propulsion subsystems	Adding 1 Nanowire Composites to Offensive subsystems	Adding 1 Fulleroferrocene Power Conduits use in Defensive subsystems	Increasing Electromechanical Interface Nexus use in Electronic subsystems to 7 (+6)	Increasing Reinforced Metallofullerene Alloys use in Defensive subsystems to 7 (+6)	Increasing Optimized Nano-engines use in Engineering subsystems to 7 (+6)	Increasing Warfare Computation Core use in Offensive subsystems to 7 (+6)	Increasing Reconfigured Subspace Calibrator use in Propulsion subsystems to 7 (+6)	Increasing Emergent Neurovisual Interface use in Hulls to 2 (+1)	Decreasing the Fullerene Intercalated Sheets use in Hulls to 7 (-1)	Increasing Neurovisual Input Matrix use in Fullerene Intercalated Sheets to 55 (+53)	Increasing Electromechanical Hull Sheeting use in Electromechanical Interface Nexus, Reinforced Metallofullerene Alloys, Optimized Nano-engines, Warfare Computation Core, and Reconfigured Subspace Calibrator to 10 (+4)	Increasing Powdered C-540 Graphite use in Electromechanical Interface Nexus, Reinforced Metallofullerene Alloys, Optimized Nano-engines, Warfare Computation Core, and Reconfigured Subspace Calibrator to 2 (+1)	Increasing the Cartesian Temporal Coordinator use in Electromechanical Interface Nexus to 4 (+3)	Increasing the Fused Nanomechanical Engines use in Optimized Nano-engines to 4 (+3)	Increasing the Resonance Calibration Matrix use in Reconfigured Subspace Calibrator to 4 (+3)	Increasing the Emergent Combat Analyzer use in Warfare Computation Core to 4 (+3)	Increasing the Heuristic Selfassemblers use in Reinforced Metallofullerene Alloys to 4 (+3)	Increasing the Thermoelectric Catalysts use in Emergent Neurovisual Interface to 7 (+6)	Increasing the Defensive Control Node use in Emergent Neurovisual Interface to 7 (+6)	Increasing the Emergent Combat Intelligence use in Emergent Neurovisual Interface to 7 (+6)	Increasing the Central System Controller use in Emergent Neurovisual Interface to 7 (+6)	Increasing the Jump Drive Control Nexus use in Emergent Neurovisual Interface to 7 (+6)	Increasing the C3-FTM Acid use in Emergent Neurovisual Interface to 310 (+32)	Decreasing the Graphene Nanoribbons use in Electromechanical Interface Nexus, Optimized Nano-engines, Reconfigured Subspace Calibrator, Reinforced Metallofullerene Alloys and Warfare Computation Core to 7 (-15)	Decreasing the Lanthanum Metallofullerene use in Electromechanical Interface Nexus, Optimized Nano-engines and Reconfigured Subspace Calibrator to 7 (-15)	Increasing the Lanthanum Metallofullerene use in Emergent Neurovisual Interface to 50 (+39)	Increasing the Methanofullerene use in Fulleroferrocene Power Conduits to 60 (+27)	Decreasing the Scandium Metallofullerene use in Reinforced Metallofullerene Alloys and Warfare Computation Core to 22 (-22)
21	english	 	 TECH III SUBSYSTEM BALANCING	Other changes that are coming for Phoebe are the removal of Data Interface and Subsystem Data Interfaces. Those will be properly reimbursed at market price. Blueprint copies will be reimbursed at a static price.	With the removal of those items, players will be able to directly pick and choose the exact race and subsystem type they want instead of relying on a random number generator (RNG) mechanic.	Below is the updated UI for picking subsystems:	To compensate for this and to stimulate the market for Tech III materials, some changes are being made to the build requirements of various Tech III components.
21	english	 	 MULTIPLE INVENTION RUNS	Since the Crius release in July, invention only consumes one blueprint copy run at a time. As such we are adding the possibility for Phoebe to queue those runs on a similar manner with Manufacturing runs.	We will keep a close eye on the effect of this change on the game, and we may tweak blueprint job times if the need arises.	Below is the updated UI of the invention window:
21	english	 	 Freighters: from 20% to 18%	Taken in conjunction with the changes to the Invention formula above, that means the basic Invention chance will pretty much stay identical to its previous iteration.
21	english	 	 MERGING INVENTION WITH REVERSE ENGINEERING	When Phoebe is deployed, Reverse Engineering will no longer exist as a separate activity, with Ancient Relics now falling under the purview of invention.	Experimental Laboratories and Caldari Outposts will still be the only places where Ancient Relics can be invented	As mentioned in the last Dev Blog, the invention formula is going to be tweaked to compensate for the merge. However, we have changed its values since then to account for player feedback regarding science field and invention skills not having enough repercussions in the success output.	The new invention formula thus is:	Where Racial Encryption Method is Amarr, Caldari, Gallente and Minmatar Encryption Methods for regular invention, and Sleeper Encryption Methods for Ancient Relics.	Meta items will no longer have an effect for Invention jobs	In addition, base invention chance for all items is going to be modified to compensate for the formula tweaks above:	All modules, rigs , ammo and all intact Ancient Relics: from 40% to 34%	All Frigates, Destroyers and all malfunctioning Ancient Relics: from 35% to 30%	Cruisers, Battlecruisers, Mining Barges, Industrials: from 30% to 26%	All Battleships and all wrecked Ancient Relics: from 25% to 22%
21	english	 	 Rocket Science	To compensate for this change, all those skills will now give a 1% Time Efficiency bonus for the Tech II manufacturing job they are required for, which is still going to give an incentive for players to train those up, or give an edge for players that already trained them.	Please note this will however not affect the training structure for construction skills, as you still need the smaller advanced ship construction skill before you can train for the next size.	Current manufacturing skill requirements (left) versus Phoebe (right) for an Arazu:	So after the change, the Arazu manufacturer would gain a 15% TE bonus if he / she had Advanced Medium Ship Construction, Gallente Starship Engineering and Electronic Engineering skills at 5.	Advanced Small Ship Construction skill would however give no bonus here since it is a prerequisite of Advanced Medium Ship Construction.

If you haven’t seen the changes yet and are even loosely involved with those activities, we strongly recommend you read them so you can plan ahead, as skills will not be reimbursed (none are taken away. requirements are just shuffled around) and you may find yourself unable to invent a particular item you were the day before release.	We are specifically referring to the module changes here and ship changes there.	We are also renaming the following skills:	Frigate Construction to Advanced Small Ship Construction	Cruiser Construction to Advanced Medium Ship Construction	Battleship Construction to Advanced Large Ship Construction	Industrial Construction to Advanced Industrial Ship Construction	Reverse Engineering to Sleeper Encryption Methods	In addition, we are going to decrease level requirements to 1 for Tech II item manufacturing on the following skills:

22	english	 	 THE REST	Lastly, I want to mention a few small changes we have implemented recently but not had the opportunity to tell you about:	Added a Booster Timer that clearly shows you how much time you have left on your active boosters, their benefits, and side effects. This timer is displayed next to other timers such as Weapon and Limited Engagement timers.	Added the ability to select which overview preset to use when scanning with the Directional Scanner.	Added a visual timer in the HUD on modules (such as micro jump drives and cloaking devices) that have cooldown time to indicate how much was left of the cooldown.	Added the ability to name your jump clones. This can be done through a right click option on the jump clones in the Character Sheet	We hope these small changes make your stay in New Eden a little bit more pleasant.
22	english	 	 SHORTCUT FOR DIRECTIONAL SCANNER	We have added a shortcut to directly open the Directional Scanner.
22	english	 	 Many have asked for the ability to have both the Probe Scanner and the Directional Scanner open at the same time, but none have pleaded more than the wormholers among us who are not only constantly scanning with probes but also need to be on the lookout for someone sneaking up on them. These two very useful scanning tools have lived together as tabs in the same window, along with a lesser used tool, the Moon Analyses tab. In Phoebe we will be splitting them apart, giving each its own window, and these can of course be stacked just like any other windows.
22	english	 	 To summarize:	Always show	Entities with this state will always be shown regardless of the display setting of additional states they may have	Filter out	Entities with this state will be filtered out unless they have additional states that are set to always show	Show by default	Entities with this state will be shown unless they have additional states that are filtered out	Always showEntities with this state will always be shown regardless of the display setting of additional states they may have	Filter outEntities with this state will be filtered out unless they have additional states that are set to always show	Show by defaultEntities with this state will be shown unless they have additional states that are filtered out	These changes are compatible with all current Overview profiles, which are simply treated as having no state with the "Always Show" setting.	It‘s worth mentioning that although we talk about "Always Show", nothing will override the settings in the Group tab. That is, if you have chosen to not see Battleships in your Overview, your fleet mate in the Raven will not be in the Overview, no matter how your state display settings are.	With this change, we've had to change the interface where you control the display settings of the entity states. The states are back to being in one list, but now you have 3 radio buttons ("Always show", "Filter out", "Show by default") to choose from for each of the states.	You can click each of them individually, or select many states in the list and set them all at once by clicking on the header icons.	![](//content.eveonline.com/www/newssystem/media/66639/1/overview.png)
22	english	 	 ASSET SEARCH AND ADVANCED SEARCH	Many of you like organizing your assets into station containers, which is all well and good, that is, until you need to find that Polaris Engima or that 'Nibelung' Mining Laser you have misplaced but know you have somewhere. The Asset Search you are used to has not searched inside your containers. 	That's changing in Phoebe-- items inside containers in stations will be included in the search results.	I should note that for those who have thousands and thousands of neatly organized items in containers, fetching the information on the items might take a bit longer than you are used to.  However, after the data has been cached the searching should be really fast, and you can actually find the items you are looking for :)	Some of you may know that we have pretty powerful advanced search functionality in EVE. However, I've found that surprisingly many citizens of New Eden either don't know it exists at all, or don't know how to use it.	We wanted to raise the visibility of this powerful tool, so we have added a little question mark icon in the Asset Search tab, which will show a handy tooltip that lists all the keywords you can use and how to use them when you hover your mouse over it. For further information on the advanced search, please take a look at this dev blog by CCP Frellicus.

23	english	 	 AND FINALLY	What we want the UI Modernization project to achieve is forming a really solid visual foundation to build on. There are still various things that will not get touched this time around, but having a stronger foundation will make it that much easier to sculpt prettier things once we get there.	These changes will be on Singularity today. There is still a lot of work to be done, so please take it for a spin and give us your feedback on the forums. We’re currently aiming to get the final thing out with the Rhea release on December 9th.	Enjoy your spaceships in a responsible manner.
23	english	 	 (click to enlarge)	The above example is to show the normal state and hover state of the new Neocom icons. The shapes of the new icons are all very much on the operating table still but we wanted to get some version of them on SiSi to start having a conversation with you on their shape and style. We recognize that the old icons have been part of the game from the beginning and have a special place in our hearts. We want to make sure they can be remembered and will make sure the collection will available to download as a .ZIP file after the update for those that want to own a piece of EVE UI history.
23	english	 	 ICONIC ICONS	Last but not least, we’ve completely re-done all window icons. The brightest reflection of this change is to be witnessed in the Neocom. We are introducing a whole new set of modern, monochrome, clear cut icons. I’m going to go ahead and predict that some of you are already thinking; “Strip all color! Are you insane?”. Although I can neither confirm nor deny any claims of insanity, I can assure you that once you’ve learned the new icons (which takes practically no time at all) you’ll be opening windows faster than ever before. As a matter of fact, it has been scientifically proven that stripping color away from such icons reduces search time, as it allows your brain to focus purely on form. It’s a “try it to believe it” kind of thing. I was skeptical at first too.
23	english	 	 (click to enlarge)
23	english	 	 SKINNING THE BEAST	As if all of this wasn’t enough, we’ve additionally re-done most of the UI control skins. This includes windows, buttons, checkboxes, scrolls and tabs. Instead of excessive yapping, I’ll let the following pictures do all the talking.
23	english	 	 (click to enlarge)	The above example is just a preview of the current themes we are exploring but the main idea is to have themes that fit for all the major factions so that you can immerse yourself into the branded interface that fits your ship or your preferred faction. Let us know what your preferred colors and factions are.
23	english	 	 FLYING COLORS	Black on black has its charm, but we were quite interested in unlocking more color themes that actually made visual sense. For that to happen, we’ve completely redefined, simplified and clarified how UI color is selected and applied. First off, you have the base color, which is applied to the window backgrounds and secondly you have a highlight color that is applied to intractable elements, such as buttons, checkboxes, as well as being used to colorize the glow of iconic buttons, such as the ones in the Neocom. We’ve completely redone the color themes, limiting the base colors to dark tones while allowing the highlight ones to shine a bit brighter. Simple theme selection will be replacing the old RGB sliders and dropdowns.
23	english	 	 (click to enlarge)	The re-skinning of the UI and updating of UI component and menu icons is just the first strategy step in fulfilling this vision and will pan out more in the coming months. We wanted to make a clearer distinction between windows and interface elements, so the Neocom, Overview and Station Service Window, all integral parts of the interface and always visible, will feel less intrusive than windows that you open, use and close.
23	english	 	 LOOK AND FEEL	Our UI designers didn’t have to meet for long to reach a consensus that they wanted the UI to look more holographic and futuristic than it currently does. For interacting with the UI, instead of using skeuomorphism (a word I’m pretty sure to have been invented by a certain fruit company that shall not be named here) such as having a button feel like an actual button when pressed, we want to use burning light and glow to indicate button presses, blinks and such. Here is a part of their vision statement for the EVE UI Modernization project:	Everything is made from light and behaves similar to light. Objects are dim and darkened or de-saturated when off/inactive instead of just alpha faded. Objects flicker and offset when under damage, power out, power disruption. Objects are drawn in, they turn on and flicker slightly to immitate a more realistic, mechanical state. Retro references used by the group was things like Jet HUDs, LED gauges, oscilloscope / vector scope, lasers, spectrum analyzers in 70‘s stereos.
23	english	 	 THE GOALS	For the sake of clarity, I have prepared a list of the goals we set out to reach with the UI Modernization effort.	Roll out a complete new UI that will define the visual direction for EVE UI in the coming years	Less operating system, more Sci-Fi, and militaristic looking UI	Functionality and usability should feel modern and intuitive	Have the UI complement the beautiful New Eden view, instead of blocking it.	Better consistency between UI control look and feel.	Use colors in a sensible way.	Simpler, and more recognizable icons with a clear distinction between icons that represent items vs icons that represent UI controls and labels.	Now, let me explain a bit further.
23	english	 	 Even though we feel we‘ve really picked up pace with various quality-of-life interface fixes  and improvements throughout the last few years, as well as raising the bar quite a bit with usability and visual intrigue of new features, we have never attempted to do an overhaul of the look and feel of the UI as a whole. That is, until now.	It all started with a project called EVE UI Modernization. The UI Group came together in an Icelandic summer hut way up north (beyond the wall) to define a vision for a new and better EVE UI. In that effort we asked ourselves what “better” means and found out it was a combination of many components that all had to come together in a holistic way. The group came up with a strategy to push the UI into a direction of having a better identity, better functionality, better usability and better aesthetics.	The first efforts where Initially kicked off by a couple of individuals on the UI Team as conceptual work and has been ongoing behind the scenes for quite a while now  and has recently been adapted by Game of Drones to push it all the way to Tranquility with ongoing support from other UI developers.
24	english	 	 Thera will attract a mix of crowds as diverse as pvp corporations searching for some variety in their combat, industrialists serving the local market, explorers intent on puzzling out the secrets of the system’s history, adventurers looking to make a quick buck under their hunter’s noses, and dedicated local pvpers preying on all the rest and using the system’s unique geography to their advantage.	We expect that Thera will appeal most strongly to players who find the concept of living at the center of an ever-shifting set of wormhole connections appealing. Residents of Thera will know that each day they will have a different menu of neighbors and access to different areas of known space.	We anticipate this to be one of the busiest nullsec systems in EVE over sustained periods, and have plans in place to ensure that it receives appropriate hardware support.	As of the publishing of this dev blog, the Singularity test server is up and running with the first early build of the Rhea release; including Thera and the shattered wormhole systems. We can’t wait to start reading your feedback as you explore these systems for yourself and hope you send any videos you make of its beauty and terror to share@eveonline.com,	More information about how you can get to Thera and start exploring can be found in our Test Server Feedback forums.	[![](//content.eveonline.com/www/newssystem/media/66665/1/Ring_Vista550.jpg)](//content.eveonline.com/www/newssystem/media/66665/1/Ring_Vista.jpg)	This new space represents just one of the many improvements and additions to EVE Online that will be coming your way with the Rhea release on December 9th. Our Executive Producer CCP Seagull will be bringing you a “Coming in Rhea” dev blog soon, jam packed with lots of surprises.	I hope you’ve enjoyed this first look at our new solar systems, and remember to never stop exploring!	-CCP Fozzie
24	english	 	 The four stations in Thera will each have a full set of services, including cloning, office slots, and manufacturing. You will be able to set these stations as your medical clone location, and install Jump Clones if you wish.	Thera has multiple static connections highsec, lowsec and nullsec space as well as access to wandering wormholes and K162 connections that can connect it to W-space. The result is a system that is much more connected to K-space than to W-space.	None of the connections to Thera will admit capital ships (freighters will be able to squeeze in), none of the stations in Thera will allow capitals to be built, and there are no moons for starbase anchoring. This means the system will only ever contain sub-capital vessels.	Thera is the largest system we have ever had in EVE. The stations are spread between three different planets at the edges of the system and warps between them can be up to 342 AU. The vast distances and huge number of wormholes ensures that keeping a lockdown on all of the stations and wormholes in the system will be exceedingly difficult, although we expect it to be an extremely dangerous place.	Anchored warp disruption bubbles will not be usable within Thera, although interdictor and heavy interdictor bubbles work normally.	Thera does not have a system bonus effect.	Thera contains wormhole signature and anomaly sites appropriate for class 3 and class 4 wormholes, as well as all the different types of wormhole gas mining sites on par with a class 6 wormhole system.	Thera does have distinct visuals including new unique station skins for the Sisters of EVE, a new nebula and a new sun effect.	[![](//content.eveonline.com/www/newssystem/media/66665/1/Undock550.jpg)](//content.eveonline.com/www/newssystem/media/66665/1/Undock.jpg)	The Thera system is colonized by a research expedition organized by The Sanctuary corporation, and more information about their presence in Thera will be revealed bit by bit in the future.	As always, we know that our players will take EVE’s new features in creative directions that we at CCP can never fully foresee, however we do have predictions for at least a few of the ways these systems will add to the diversity of experiences in EVE.	The shattered wormhole systems should represent an excellent “neutral ground” for wormhole entities that might be hesitant to engage in a system containing hostile starbases. They will also be an excellent reward for pilots bold enough to mine ice or run anomalies outside the security of their home wormhole. And although it will be more difficult to live in a shattered wormhole system without the use of starbases, we know that some of our players will find a way like they always do.
24	english	 	 The seventy five **Standard Shattered Wormhole Systems** will be similar to normal W-space systems in many ways (including delayed-mode local chat), but will have a few important distinctions:	They will have no moons and every planet will be shattered. The reasons for this phenomena are heavily tied into the ongoing and upcoming events within New Eden.	They will have some special landmark sites that also connect to the storyline and provide clues to the reason they were previously inaccessible. I wouldn’t be surprised if they found their way to Mark726’s EVE Travel blog.	They will have a somewhat higher occurrence of some of their class-appropriate W-space signature and anomaly content compared to a normal W-space system.	They will contain a new celestial debris field asteroid belt anomaly that will be larger and richer than most belts.	They will contain minable ice fields. This will be the first ice available in wormhole space.	They will all have an additional known-space “static” wormhole connection alongside the normal “static” connections that they receive by virtue of their class. For those unfamiliar with wormhole navigation, a “static” connection in this case means that there’s always a wormhole exit to a particular security level “known-space” system (one in EVE’s star map).	They will be distributed into all the existing wormhole classes, and some will have one of the current wormhole system effects.	There are also some extra unique lore-connected surprises to be found in a small percentage of these new systems.	The twenty five **Small Ship Shattered Wormhole Systems** will have all the features of the normal Shattered Wormhole Systems, with the following additions:	All wormholes in or out of these systems will be small ship wormholes, meaning that only Frigates, Destroyers and Heavy Interdictors (Heavy Interdictors can use their bubble generators to reduce their mass) can enter.	These systems will all receive anomaly and signature sites appropriate for wormholes between class 1 and class 3, but will receive the system effects normally reserved for C6 Wolf Rayet systems (+100% armor hit points +200% small weapon damage, -50% shield resists, -50% signature size)	And then we come to the most significant of all the new shattered systems:	[![](//content.eveonline.com/www/newssystem/media/66665/1/Wreckage550.jpg)](//content.eveonline.com/www/newssystem/media/66665/1/Wreckage.jpg)	**Thera** is a new and unique wormhole system that will be intimately tied to EVE’s developing storyline and will essentially represent a new 5th variant of space in New Eden.	Thera is a gigantic shattered wormhole system that contains four NPC stations and a large number of wormhole connections.
24	english	 	 On the heels of our successful Phoebe release last week, this is CCP Fozzie bringing you details of a few of the many exciting additions in store for our Rhea release, which is coming to you in less than a month on December 9th.	If you’ve been paying attention to EVE’s game world news over the past several weeks you will have noticed that unusual events are unfolding in the New Eden Cluster, and that the enigmatic Sleeper residents of the ‘Anoikis’ wormhole regions are somehow involved.	With these new developments, this would be an excellent time to brush up on your scanning skills and learn some wormhole fundamentals.	These events are ongoing and will have far reaching consequences. We’re now ready to announce that one consequence of these events will be that Capsuleers will gain access to one hundred and one new wormhole systems in the Rhea release.	[![](//content.eveonline.com/www/newssystem/media/66665/1/Epicenter550.jpg)](//content.eveonline.com/www/newssystem/media/66665/1/Epicenter.jpg)	These wormhole systems will all be distinct from existing space in several important ways and will fall into three categories:
24	english	 	 Hello dauntless Capsuleers!
24	english	 	 THERA AND THE SHATTERED WORMHOLES	Rough transition through wormhole conduit to seventh candidate location. Shields and nanoplating held with minimal erosion. Deployed camera drones and was immediately impressed by the vivid blue glare of the central star. Even brighter than typical blue A0 types. Analysis showed it to be subtype A0IV and qualifying as a blue subgiant. Extremely turbulent with many signs of instability in star and the background radiation of the system. Briefly turned forward plating transparent with polarizing filters in place, and was struck by the dire beauty of the star.	Sensors indicate several outer planets of various types and an inner zone of numerous terrestrials. The innermost pair of planets show signs of shattering similar to that seen in previous candidate locations. This system stands out as extremely capacious and probes are returning multiple wormhole signatures. Could it be lucky seven?	~ Zakari Kovalis, Exploration Vessel Katydid, Log Entry YC112.07.09	[![](//content.eveonline.com/www/newssystem/media/66665/1/Thera550.jpg)](//content.eveonline.com/www/newssystem/media/66665/1/Thera.jpg)

25	english	 	 THE REST	Some features we have talked about recently but aren’t listed here may still make it into Rhea, so read the final patch notes for the full list of changes. We are also closely monitoring the results of our Phoebe changes to jump drive travel and working towards the next phase of changes to sovereignty. You can expect further communications on this topic in December.	We really hope you enjoy Rhea , coming to EVE Online on December 9th.	And do remember to pay attention to in-game news and movements, as this overview blog does not reveal everything happening around Rhea or why things are happening in New Eden!
25	english	 	 OPT-IN NEW STAR MAP	The Star Map has been completely redone to improve readability and usability, and in Rhea you can try this new map as an opt-in beta feature. Read more about what’s new in an upcoming dev blog.
25	english	 	 OPT-IN KEYBOARD SHIP CONTROL	In Rhea, you will be able to try keyboard ship control as an opt-in beta feature. No new mechanics or movement options are introduced, just the ability to fly with WASD or arrow keys for the same movements you can do today using double-click. Read more in this dev blog from CCP Nullarbor: Quick, give me manual control!
25	english	 	 THE BOWHEAD – ORE FREIGHTER	Move assembled ships in this new freighter from ORE that comes with a large ship maintenance bay. If a Bowhead is destroyed, there is a chance that assembled ships can be found amongst the wreckage. Read about the stats and capabilities of the Bowhead in this forum post. 
25	english	 	 KILL REPORT AND CONTRACT NOTIFICATIONS	Kill reports and contracts will be available in the new Notification system, fully configurable.
25	english	 	 NEW PIRATE APPAREL	Pirate faction themed clothing will be added to the New Eden Store.
25	english	 	 SPECIAL EDITION DREADNOUGHTS	Four new Special Edition Dreadnoughts will be available from the New Eden Store with Rhea: The Interbus Moros, the Sarum Revelation, the Wiyrkomi Phoenix and the Justice Naglfar.

26	english	 	 DEATH MATTERS...	Those are the changes coming in Rhea, but before I go, let me talk to you a bit more about death, and about what comes after Rhea.	EVE is a game built on connections. It is a network of NPCs, ships, structures and players, all interacting with each other in a single, unified space. These interactions are what drive the universe forward and provide meaning for players who inhabit New Eden. We want every choice you make as a player to impact the world around you. From the rookie ship mining Veldspar to calling targets in the largest Alliance battles, your actions in the game should have meaning and affect other players either directly or indirectly.	Death is one of the most meaningful things a player can experience, and can happen at any time. The consequences and meaning a player applies to the loss of their ship is very powerful, and the ways they can affect and deal with that loss are very real.	The same cannot be said for the current clone death mechanics. They are not a real choice, they are an illusion of choice. A choice between a bad option of losing ISK, and a worse option of losing skillpoints. A choice which does not affect the EVE universe as a whole, other than to empty players accounts of ISK and discourage the same interactions we want to foster.	It is for these reasons we have set down the path of changing the death penalty, and ultimately how clones work, to bring these systems in line with the rest of the vision for EVE Online.
26	english	 	 THE CHANGES IN RHEA	With the release of Rhea, changes will be made to medical clones and how they work.	There will no longer be any clone grades.	You will not have to upgrade your clone upon being pod killed. New players can be badly surprised by this system since they have so many other important things to learn. Forgetting to upgrade the clone and losing skill points because of that is a terrible experience for new players. Skill point acquisition is very much tied to your subscription and the real money you spent on the game, so taking some of their skill points away can feel like wasted money to the player.	In addition, veteran players will have more reasons to undock in cheaper ships, furthering our goal of increased interactivity within the game, since the cost of the higher clone grades could be orders of magnitude more than the cost of a PvP ship hull. We expect more risks to be taken more often by veterans because of this change.	There will no longer be any skillpoint loss upon death.	Small lapses of forgetfulness will no longer cause players to retrain weeks of lost skillpoint time. This too should encourage veterans to fly even more boldly into battle without worrying about protecting valuable skills. Note: Subsystem skills related to T3 Strategic Cruisers will still work as they did before. This is because their skill loss is a component of the ship balancing itself. This may be revisited in the future.	The cost of setting your home station will be increased from 5400 ISK to 100,000 ISK.	This keeps the cost of moving your home station low without making it completely trivial.
26	english	 	 THE CURRENT MEDICAL CLONE SYSTEM	When a player’s capsule (known colloquially as a pod) is destroyed, their clone is killed, leaving behind a frozen corpse floating through space.  Upon reviving in a new clone in a space station, the pilot must then upgrade their medical clone’s grade to cover the amount of skillpoints they have accrued though skill training. If that player fails to do so and is podded again, they will lose skillpoints if their clone grade isn’t high enough.

27	english	 	 Once clicked, you will get a second map icon in the Neocom with a small beta tag on it. Click on that and bam, new map.	Your participation in beta features is very much appreciated and we can’t wait to see what you think of our new map. Once you’ve checked it out, post your thoughts in the comments thread for this dev blog so that we can make the map the best it can be before we release it officially.	See you in space o/
27	english	 	 No jump range visualization for ships with jump drives	The map won’t currently load if you’re in a wormhole	The sovereignty filter hasn’t been hooked up yet	There’s probably more that we haven’t mentioned here but just remember this is an experimental feature and we will be adding features and functionality consistently over the coming weeks and months.
27	english	 	 We are working towards consolidating the solar system map and the star map into one seamless map. You can see the beginnings of this work by zooming in (by using the mouse wheel, double clicking or control clicking) on any system. The map will seamlessly zoom all the way down to the solar system level, showing you the location of stations and stargates. For now, using scan probes will still only be possible in the old solar system map but hopefully before long we can integrate that, together with more solar system scale functions, into the new map.	In addition to those major changes, there is a range of smaller ones:	You can now use the ‘grouping’ options to show the map at region or constellation level, rather than only showing all the stars at once	You can mark a home station with a label	The display of statistics and filters has been normalized in some cases to improve readability	The code that handles ‘picking’ has been rewritten which should improve the feel of system selection	We have a lot of work going into performance improvement, largely to help support windowed mode.	All that being said, there are some things missing or not workingthis is a beta after all. Here are a few that we know of and will be dealing with as soon as possible:	No search functionality
27	english	 	 WINDOWED MODE	The new map can be made into a window that is completely resizable and retains 100% of the functionality and interactability of the full screen view. All you need to do to take advantage of this is head to the map control panel at the top and click the box icon. You will notice that in addition to the ‘floating’ mode there are also ‘dock right’ and ‘dock left’ modes, both of which will lock the map to either side of your screen while pushing the main scene over to fill the rest of your screen space.	These modes can also be resized and makes it very easy to run the map on a second monitor full time. AMAZING.
27	english	 	 UPDATED VISUALS	The new map is beautiful. We’ve put the map in an actual space scene with nebulas and stars and ditched the old flat black background. We’ve also made a lot of changes to coloring, highlighting, and labeling in the map to improve readability and aesthetic appeal (sexiness).
28	english	 	 Well, no.	PBR shows the state of our assets far more accurately than the simple model we have been using up to now. We used to rely on the physically inaccurate numbers to avoid certain display problems, but now we have to tackle those issues directly. Accordingly, many assets will only be perfected through additional attention.	We are working to identify areas for improvement and determine the best courses of action to address them. In some cases we will rebake the normal maps. In some cases we will adjust the factional data.  And in some cases, we will execute complete redesigns. With the implementation of PBR in EVE, we hope capsuleers across New Eden can contribute to these ongoing graphic developments while enjoying increased pixel accuracy.	Additionally, the new system allows for further improvement of our shaders. We could introduce a new material, apply dynamic dirt levels (older ships showing their age?), or generate ambient occlusion maps for sub-capital ships. And of course, there is always ship customization. By adopting a better system for determining the colors of our pixels, we have increased the options available for future feature work that realistically conveys the vision of EVE.	That is the true benefit of PBR, and the reason that we have worked to provide it in Rhea.
28	english	 	 THE NEW PROBLEM	Having adjusted our math to emulate better the behavior of light and materials in the real world, we plug those equations into EVE and everything is suddenly perfect, right?
28	english	 	 THE NEW ANSWER	For all its popularity, however, Phong Reflection shows its age. One of the most visible wrinkles is its complete ignorance of energy conservation, a fundamental principle of physics. This means that under certain lighting conditions a resulting pixel is much brighter than it could actually be given the amount of energy that hits it. This prevents us from showing our assets realistically.	Subsequently, we need a new and better formula to determine accurate pixel color. It should account for energy conservation and be more complicated and more realistic than the Phong Reflection Model because GPU cycles are made to be spent on better results!	In fact, we can replace the single formula with a collection of different ones, all using the same data (material properties), but with different levels of exactness/simplification. We get to pick and choose. This new collection of rendering models is called “Physically Based Rendering” or PBR.	For implementation in New Eden, we chose Schlick’s approximation for the Fresnel factor, a distribution model from Trowbridge and Reitz (also known as GGX), and a Schlick-Smith based visibility function. All in all, a pretty standard PBR cocktail when it comes to non-organic objects. To give you an idea about the new complexity of our calculations, here is just the formula for the specular.	Here are some of the results (the new PBR ship is always the one closest to the camera):

That is the true benefit of PBR, and the reason that we have worked to provide it in Rhea.	Since its creation, many improvements have been made to the Phong model. Especially with the introduction of GPU shading languages to replace the fixed function, programmers have gained significant freedom in the generation of each pixel on the screen. But despite adding improvements like normal maps, specular intensity maps, cubemap reflections, et cetera, the end results still rely on the basic principles of the decades-old model.

28	english	 	 THE OLD ANSWER	In the past we determined pixel color using a formula named the “Phong Reflection Model,” which was so popular that it was built into the hardware of the first generation 3D-acceleration cards. Phong was part of the hard-wired pre-shader implementation known as the Fixed Function Pipeline. Have a look and guess why:	This model, despite being from 1973, still produces very good results. Countless games and movies have been made with it, including EVE Online.
28	english	 	 THE OLD PROBLEM	The fundamental question of any CGI programmer is: “What color is a given pixel on screen?” The more accurately the programmer answers that question, the higher the quality of the final picture. The essential tools for coming up with an accurate answer are of course real world physics and math. However, finding an exact formula that describes how the real world around us looks is impossible--at least with our current understanding of nature.	So what do we do in CGI? We simplify! And we have to because, at least in computer games, the images we need to calculate must be delivered in real time to fervent players desperately eager to watch “realistically” imaged spaceships explode. In such an environment, we must simplify for efficiency while maintaining as much of the realistic math as possible.
29	english	 	 GOT FEEDBACK?	Once you have tried this out, please let us know your thoughts on the forums. What was your overall experience like? Did you encounter any problems, issues or did anything weird happen? If you did encounter issues, make sure to give as much detail a possible, including your internet connection speed as that can be a vital part of the equation.
29	english	 	 The Target field should look like this:	(Note that the Target field shows only the end of the string in the field.)	Hit the 'Apply' button, and then the EVE icon to start the launcher. When the launcher has downloaded the necessary minimum set of resources to start playing, the 'PLAY' button will turn from gray to yellow and you can fly away!	We should note that the initial set of resources that the client downloads is roughly around 300 MB, but you should make sure that you have plenty of disc space. The whole set of resources is more the 12GB, so you should make sure that you have this space available in your installation location. 	How do I try this (Mac)?	Grab the installer here. When it has downloaded, click the .dmg file and proceed with the installation. After the installation is complete, open Finder and highlight your EVE Online installation. Choose 'Show Package Contents', then select the 'Contents' folder and the 'MacOS' folder.  Now open a terminal, drag the launcher into the terminal and add /server:87.237.38.60. Hit enter and the launcher pointing to Duality will open.  
29	english	 	 What about multiple clients?	This will actually make your life easier with multiple clients – the cache for downloaded resources will be shared without any special setup. Each install is only about 350MB and the resources live in a shared location.	How do I try this (Windows)?	We have a setup currently on Duality, which is one of our test-servers, where you can try this out. Click on this link to download an installer. Run the installer, but do choose a new installation folder instead of the default one (your location may of course be different).	When you do get to the 'Completing the EVE Online Setup' you should untick the 'Run EVE Online' box, as we have make a small change before logging into Duality.	After you hit finish, go to you desktop and right-click on the EVE icon that's just been added	This will bring up this box:	You have to add the following to the Target field:	/server:87.237.38.60
29	english	 	 What about slow connections?	You can use the offline installer, or you can wait while the launcher downloads everything. Or you can enjoy the fact that you can get into the game sooner, although load times before ships show up might be long when you see a particular ship for the first time.
29	english	 	 What about the offline installer?	We will still offer a way to install from a pre-downloaded package, if for example you need to transfer it on a USB stick.
29	english	 	 I'VE GOT A QUESTION!	Does that mean I have to download everything again?	No, when we switch over to this we will offer a way to unpack the stuff files you already have.

This penalty will be increasing slightly in order to add more significance to the stat and allow for greater variance. All modules still fall between the 1% and 5% Inertial Modifier increase. Reinforced Bulkheads II gain the largest penalty from this, keeping with the theme of Tech II modules having the most power outside of faction and storyline modules, but with the largest drawbacks.

31	english	 	 MODULE NAMING	We’ve looked at the feedback from the renaming we did in the first module pass, and we agree we may have gone too far in stripping out the lore and history from modules. However, we still value the information given by the new module names, and as such we will be creating a hybrid naming structure incorporating the two.	Each name will now consist of three parts: flavour name type name	For example, the Type-D Altered SS Overdrive Injector and other meta 1-4 Overdrive Injectors will be combined and renamed the Type-D Restrained Overdrive Injector. This keeps some of the flavor name, while adding in the specialization name informing you of its focus.	In addition, All flavor names will be consistent if paired with a specialization name meaning all Type-D modules will be Restrained. This adds further consistency to the naming system and prevents knowledge of one naming section from conflicting with another.	These changes will be retroactively applied to modules which have gone through the tiericide process in the past to keep everything consistent.

33	english	 	 THAT'S ALL FOR NOW FOLKS	You may have noticed we didn't include a release date in this dev blog or on the o7 show. The point of this announcement is to begin gathering your feedback on the feature while we work on it. We are not yet ready to announce a release date for feature. When we get closer to release we will have another dev blog that goes over the feature in its more complete state along with information about how we will handle the transition from the current paint system over to the new Super Kerr-Induced Nanocoating system. I hope you people are all as excited as we are for this.	Thank you for taking the time to read and fly safe. 	CCP FoxFour on behalf of Team Size Matters	p.s. Hyasyoda Automatic Transformation System was the runner up for what to call the new system.  ;)	p.p.s Kerr effect is a real term, no we didn't make it up. See: //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerr_effect

33	english	 	   
33	english	 	 INTRODUCING SUPER KERR-INDUCED NANOCOATINGS	We decided a while ago that it was time to revisit the ship painting pilot program from top to bottom. This meant looking at what the paint jobs were, how players applied them, their cost, and every other aspect we could think of.	Now that we’ve finished our evaluation and started on some designs for a new system, we would like to introduce to you Super Kerr-Induced Nanocoatings, aka SKINs.	SKINs are quite different from the paint jobs we have now in terms of how you use them and at a higher level of how to think about them. With the painting system you would combine a paint style with a ship and they would become a new ship, taking that paint with the ship everywhere. If you had torpedoes delivered directly to it that caused an unfortunate explosion and loss of the ship, the paint style would be lost with it.	With the new SKIN system you will buy a license to use a specific design or pattern for a ship. You then apply that license to your character and then your character will be licensed to use that design whenever you wish. For now the licenses are permanent and cannot be removed from your character once applied. Even if your character loses their pod and dies or jump clones around they still have the license to use all their SKINs. The licenses themselves can still be traded on the market, contracts, and all other ways before being applied to your character.	Here is a work-in-progress mockup of how we imagine this looking in the ship fitting window:
33	english	 	 THE CURRENT SYSTEM	The current ship painting system from was started as (and remains) a pilot program--an experiment of sorts to validate some assumptions we had, to test the customization of ships, and to see generally how popular this kind of feature might be. Since the launch of the ship painting program back in March of 2014 we have grown from selling 8 different paint styles to a much greater variety (with 28 currently available in the store), adding new ship types, trying different pricing options, monitoring their consumption, and trying to understand what parts of system are really important to you capsuleers.
34	english	 	 For autocannons of all sizes, we wanted to improve the weapon class slightly while reducing the reliance on the excellent Barrage T2 ammo type. To that end, we are increasing the base falloff of all subcapital autocannons and decreasing the falloff bonus provided by Barrage ammo to match.	All autocannons will receive +7.5% falloff	Barrage ammo will provide a +40% falloff bonus instead of +50%	The end result is that falloff with Barrage loaded will remain almost identical, but there will be more situations where using another ammo type is a correct choice.	Thanks for joining me for this dev blog, and thanks in advance to all of you who will be posting constructive feedback in this blog’s comments thread. As always we plan to work with our community to ensure that these changes find their best possible version before release.	The Svipul and these projectile changes will be hitting Singularity for your testing pleasure as soon as possible, and we look forward to releasing them in our Tiamat release coming your way on February 17th.
34	english	 	 33.3% bonus to Small Projectile Turret tracking while Sharpshooter Mode is active	100% bonus to sensor strength, scan resolution and targeting range while Sharpshooter Mode is active	Slot layout: 7 H, 4 M, 4 L, 6 turrets , 1 launcher	3 Rig Slots, 400 Calibration

34	english	 	 Minmatar Tactical Destroyer Bonuses Per Level:	10% bonus to Small Projectile Turret damage	10% bonus to Small Projectile Turret optimal range	5% reduction in heat damage generated by modules	Role Bonus:
34	english	 	 **Autocannons and Barrage:**
34	english	 	 -3% tracking speed
34	english	 	 In Tiamat we are making some adjustments to small artillery weapons to help keep them in line with other similar weapon systems. We will be increasing damage multipliers slightly while reducing tracking speed.	All small artillery will be receiving:	+10% damage multiplier
34	english	 	 We are also making some adjustments to projectile weapons in the Tiamat release, to help tweak their balance and ensure that players have the best possible variety of viable tactics to choose from.	These changes will be familiar to those of you who remember our energy weapon tweaks from the Rhea release, as they are once again focused on two goals: improving the quality of small artillery weapons slightly and reducing the reliance of all autocannon weapons on their ‘Barrage’ Tech Two ammo.	**Small Artillery:**
34	english	 	 We will of course be looking for feedback on these stats and bonuses in the comments thread, as well as on our Singularity test server once the ship is available for player testing there.	But that’s not all!
34	english	 	 Cargo capacity: 430
34	english	 	 Signature radius: 50
34	english	 	 Defense (shields / armor / hull) : 800 / 700 / 550	Base shield resistances (EM/Therm/Kin/Exp): 50 / 40 / 40 / 50	Base armor resistances (EM/Therm/Kin/Exp): 80 / 51.25 / 25 / 10	Capacitor (amount / recharge rate / average cap per second): 600 / 225s / 2.667	Mobility (max velocity / agility / mass / warp speed / align time): 290 / 2.65 / 1,900,000 / 4.5 / 6.98s	Drones (bandwidth / bay): 0 / 0	Targeting (max targeting range / Scan Resolution / Max Locked targets): 40km / 375 / 7	Sensor strength: 11 Ladar
34	english	 	 Fittings: 78 PWG, 215 CPU
34	english	 	 Although the mode archetypes (Defense, Sharpshooter, Propulsion) are the same on all the Tactical Destroyers, the specific bonuses given by those modes are adapted by each Empire to fit their own needs. The stats and bonuses of the Svipul are:
34	english	 	 This is CCP Fozzie bringing you the long-awaited details of the second Tactical Destroyer coming your way this February in the Tiamat release.
34	english	 	 Like the Confessor before it, the Svipul has three modes with distinct physical configurations and bonuses. Unlike the Confessor, the Svipul actually pivots on an internal axis to present a horizontal profile in Propulsion Mode and a vertical profile in the default Defense Mode as well as Sharpshooter Mode.
34	english	 	 (click to enlarge)
34	english	 	 (click to enlarge)
34	english	 	 However I think we all know the real question on every reader’s lips is “How vertical is it?” and that is a question best answered with a picture (the following is a work in progress image of an untextured model):	[![](//content.eveonline.com/www/newssystem/media/66828/1/Svipul550.jpg)](//content.eveonline.com/www/newssystem/media/66828/1/Svipul.jpg)
34	english	 	 Wielding six turret slots bonused for projectile weaponry, the Svipul is deadly with artillery and autocannons alike. It also makes excellent use of the trademark Minmatar versatility, gaining bonuses to both armor and shield resistances while Defensive Mode is active. Although its lower mass makes it a bit less suited to oversized afterburners compared to its Amarr contemporary, the Svipul is the fastest of all the Tactical Destroyers and can use that speed to pick apart unwary enemy fleets.
34	english	 	 The Minmatar Republic came second in the Research Race, and their engineers are getting close to having a production-ready Tactical Destroyer of their own. The Minmatar Tactical Destroyer is known as the Svipul (properly pronounciated by CCP Scarpia), and it represents many of the best aspects of Minmatar engineering.
34	english	 	 We have been very happy with how the Confessor and the new Tactical Destroyer mechanics have been received by players. Industrialists and wormhole resource harvesters have been able to make huge profits off the new technology and there are numerous great examples of skilled pilots demonstrating their mastery with this flexible ship. PVP live streamers like Fintarue and video makers like Chessur have demonstrated particularly impressive performances.
34	english	 	 The supporters of the Amarr Empire were the most dedicated and thanks to their hard work the Empire’s shipyards were able to release the Confessor-class Tactical Destroyer to capsuleers in December with the Rhea release.
34	english	 	 For anyone who isn’t familiar with the Tactical Destroyers, they are new advanced ships created by the four great Empires of New Eden with the help of capsuleers like you! Last October we ran an event that encouraged players to participate in new research on the mysterious Sleepers of Anoikis. Players could choose whether they wanted to support one or more of the empires (or if they’d prefer to work towards their own ends) and the relative amount of support each empire received determined how quickly they would be able to release their new ships.
35	english	 	 See you in space o/	@CCP_Rise
35	english	 	 As many of you remember, the first few days in New Eden can be some of the most difficult, and it’s been a mission at CCP for a very long time to try and improve the experience for new bros. The tutorial has undergone several major reworks over the years and we also constantly strive to make EVE’s core systems more intuitive and usable without sacrificing sophistication. Despite all that, we still feel there’s room for improvement, especially when it comes to the tutorial itself.	Over a year ago, our team took on the mission to overhaul the NPE and since then you’ve seen us establish some systems we felt were needed to make our vision for new players possible. First, we added and tweaked a lot of tooltips covering the major interface elements and features and then we installed a new notification system to improve feedback and give us a better way to deliver information to new players. Most recently we began work overhauling the star map. With all these pieces in place (or at least getting close to where we want them to end up) we’ve finally been able to really dig in to a system that we hope will eventually completely replace the current tutorial: Opportunities.	It would take a lot of time for me to describe the evolution of this project in detail, but you can find two different talks covering our progress on YouTube: one from Fanfest 2014 and one from EVE Vegas 2014.	The short version is that we began with a vision of the NPE that would encourage and inspire new players to set their own goals and objectives by gently hinting at the opportunities available to them in the world, as goal setting is perhaps the most important part of each pilot’s EVE journey.	We then put together some very rough prototypes and started doing ‘friends and family’ testing. Based on those tests, we are now arriving at a version of the NPE that we feel is fit for trying on Tranquility with actual EVE players.	That brings us up to now and this blog. We feel it’s really important to get you in the loop since you are so essential to supporting our new players.
35	english	 	 A/B TESTING AND ROLL OUT	Team Pirate Unicorns has been very happy with the results of our previous soft releases (opt-in notifications, beta star map, etc.) which gave us great opportunity (!) to hone and study the impact of each new feature, and so this NPE release will be no different.	Starting some time shortly after the official release of Tiamat, we will begin adding sets of new players to test groups where we can measure their experience without having to expose the entire player base at once. This will give us a chance to spot problems and gather feedback before going live to everyone.	We know some of you will want to give this system a try and so we are planning to make it available to all players on our Singularity test server this Friday, the 20th of February. Feel free to log on, make a new character and give it a try. The main purpose of this test will be to catch bugs and make sure that there is plenty of information available to current EVE players in case they come across new players in help chat or local looking for assistance with the new system. Of course, any feedback you have would also be appreciated so let us know what you think in the comments thread for this blog.
35	english	 	 NEW PLAYER LANDMARK SITES	We have also introduced a new landmark site in each starter system. This site is available to all players and has some asteroids as well as a few NPCs which will respawn quickly. These NPCs (along with the ones in the starter site) drop some civilian modules and civilian module blueprints, allowing new players to easily check out ship fitting and industry.	We hope to follow up with more changes to starter systems and starting characters to make sure new players have access to a wide range of experiences and tools from the very start.
35	english	 	 ASSOCIATED CHANGES	During early user testing we established some peripheral changes that we felt were necessary to provide a good experience in the absence of missions.	The biggest example is that we will once again be starting new players in space rather than in a station. The EVE universe is truly awe inspiring and we want people to see that as soon as possible. Players in the new NPE will therefore begin the game in a rookie ship, in the starter systems, in a new site which will have three rats and some veldspar.	Once they leave, this site will quickly despawn and they will have to look elsewhere for their mining and shooting needs, which leads me to…
35	english	 	 We hope to be expanding rapidly on this list and eventually provide enough Opportunities that a new player could easily fill their entire trial period. For the time being though, we are still very focused on validating the general flow of the system and tuning our presentation.
35	english	 	 Traveling within and between star systems	Skill training
35	english	 	 Introducing the market
35	english	 	 Stations and some associated services
35	english	 	 Basic mining
35	english	 	 Basic combat	Looting
35	english	 	 Ship movement
35	english	 	 THE CONTENT	One of the biggest limitations we face for the first release is a rather small amount of content. We are adding more daily, but at first, we will be releasing with only some very essential opportunities covering concepts such as:
35	english	 	 The final point I want to mention is that, for now at least, we have no rewards associated with completing Opportunities. One of our original goals was to separate tutorial content and rewards so that players don’t feel compelled to do something they aren’t interested in just for money. That said, we can also acknowledge that starting without tutorial rewards may be very harsh so we are still open to changes related to starting assets and income. This is something we hope to learn more about after release.
35	english	 	 HANDS OFF	One of the most fundamental principles for the new NPE is that we want to do less hand-holding. We think players will be more likely to learn, and more likely to have fun if they get to experiment, discover, and even fail as they explore New Eden. As a result, there is deliberately less explanation in the opportunities system than there was in the tutorials. Again, we need to use testing to find out exactly how little explanation we can get away with but our internal testing suggests that we don’t need a lot.
35	english	 	 OPEN-ENDED COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS	It’s very important to us that you can complete opportunity tasks however you like. For instance, if there is a task in an opportunity to dock at a station, you can dock at any station. This small distinction from the old tutorial means that we no longer have to trust people will find a particular item, location or agent to move forward. Not only does it mean that players have a lot more freedom in how they move through the NPE, but it also means we can provide opportunities to do things like join a fleet, kill another player or go to 0.0 space. In turn, this allows us to introduce a huge range of concepts that are essential to playing EVE but could never be explained in missions without simply having an agent describe them in a giant wall of text (much like this blog is turning out to be).
35	english	 	 NO MORE LINEAR TRACKS	Firstly, you can complete opportunities in any order you like and can always see all opportunities available from this tree view (work in progress):	This means no more getting stuck on a step that you can’t figure out until you’re so mad that you give up on EVE forever. It also means you can do the things you’re interested in right away without having to slog through a bunch of steps that you don’t need.
35	english	 	 OPPORTUNITIES ABOUND	The core system we are using to drive the NPE is called ‘Opportunities’. Aura (we decided to keep her around) will introduce new players to opportunities in New Eden that they can investigate and complete. Each Opportunity consists of a set of tasks which must be completed to finish the Opportunity. Each task will have some explanation of how it can be completed. Simple.	There’s a couple very important principles in this system that we are working hard to preserve that I want to go over quickly:
36	english	 	 If you feel like you need more details, check out the video recording of the o7 show from February 26th 2015. There we presented in more details how it will look in client.	Once we have polished these icons and validated that they are bringing you the value we intended for them, we want to find ways to include them wherever it makes sense to have them. We also want to make sure 3rd party developers can get their hands on these new icons once they have been finalized and validated. We will send out a news announcement when that time comes and we have updated the IEC zip files.	That’s it for now folks. From the various feature team developers working tirelessly on both features and the UI Modernization project we hope you like these changes and are willing to try them out and give us your feedback. Give us your thoughts in the blog comments and if you happen to be coming to Fanfest this year there will be plenty of panels and roundtables to discuss in great details all things related to the UI Modernization project.	Fly safer and more informed with more descriptive icons.	@CCP_Arrow
36	english	 	 Going forward
36	english	 	 How will this look in client?	We could try to explain it to you and say that we think it looks great and that we believe it will make interactions, encounters and engagements much more interesting once they are on TQ. But instead of all that, let us just show you. We are deploying this to SiSi now so that you can try it out for yourself so go and check it out and give us your thoughts and feedback on it. We want this to have a positive and meaningful impact on gameplay and ask that you try it out with an open mind. All drastic changes to iconography takes time to get used to, but we hope with time you will be able to recognize at a glance a much broader range of things in your surrounds than before.	If you can’t for some reason check it out on SiSi right away, here is a screenshot from our development client that shows how the client looks with the new icons.	(click to enlarge)
36	english	 	 With so many new icons introduced into the Overview we had to make sure the old ones still made sense on their own. We therefore looked at all the existing icons to see if there was a way to improve them based on the strategy we used when creating the new group icons for ships, drones and structures.	Many of the icons have existed in the game since the initial launch and if we had the chance to rethink them visually we probably would have done things slightly different knowing what we know now. So we did an iteration pass on all the existing icons, making changes based on our strategy and goals where it made sense by having all things with unique purpose have unique icons. We still wanted to make sure we weren’t just change things for the sake of changing them, because we completely understand that many of these icons have become stored both in our player’s long term memory and in their muscle memory, but as things have evolved throughout the years some icons have become too out of style with the overall visual strategy. We hope to have a good discussion with the community regarding these proposed changes to reach a consensus that brings added value to the community in the long run.	(click to enlarge)
36	english	 	 The Celestials group had the most interesting cases. We couldn’t simply just say that all things that were different should have different icons. We need to make sure we are not introducing too many things for players to learn so we had to also be selective to what things were worth having a distinction between. We definitely felt ships, drones and structures with different roles, function and purpose fully deserved unique icons, but what about different celestials. Even if they are different in some ways, do they deserve a unique icon? Is there actual gameplay difference that supports that decision? The things we looked at where things like suns, planets, belts and sites.	We decided not to make different icons for different types of suns because at least currently we don’t have specific gameplay around suns. If we would however then we would be sure to revisit the icons so this icon strategy is a living breathing effort that will react to any interesting changes to gameplay.	Another thing we consciously did not want to differentiate was different wormhole classes. The classes are not supposed to be easily spotted at a glance but rather something you investigate and explore so we did not want to tinker with the interesting mysterious gameplay that provides.
36	english	 	 We are currently doing extensive discovery (research) work on Structures in EVE so it made sense to make a longterm strategy for how we would display icons for them in the client. The rollout of this will of course rely on the progress of the much larger plan for structures so no promises for when this will go out, but we still wanted to show it to you to give you all the details of our complete icon strategy.	Structure Group Icons – Design Sheet:	In-game sizes for Structure Group Icons:	The final names and even amount of structure groups are very much work in progress and might very well change in the coming weeks. But the underlying strategy for how they are visually represented is very much in alignment with our approach for the Ship Groups and Drone Groups. We use a base shape to identify that this is a structure (the downward facing bracket at the top). Then we use a specific shape to identify the purpose and finally show that base shape in different sizes to represent the different structure size. In this current design example, the Small, Medium and Large represent structures for Personal, Corporate and Alliance use. But again, such details on the functions and mechanics of structures might change.
36	english	 	 Since we had our drawing pens in hand anyway and we had created a new authoring system for defining ship groups. We decided to go ahead and create new group icons for drones as well. Using the same reasoning as used for the initial design of Ship Groups we came up with a way to categorize drones in a way that would make sense and be of use in combat situations and other engagements with drones (not all interactions with drones are bad).	We created base shapes in a similar way we did for ships and different bulkiness feel to each size within a class to identify the sizes of the drones. Using the base shapes we then added attribute icons in the upper-right corner to identify the primary role, function or purpose of each drone. This will give a huge advantage for players that need to take strategic decisions regarding drone targeting as well as knowing at a glance what drones you, your allies or your foes have on grid.	Drone Group Icons – Design Sheet:	In-game sizes for Drone Group Icons:
36	english	 	 Once we had iterated on the Ship Groups we wanted to also tackle NPC ships and make them consistent so that all ship groups would have the same base look. We re-authored all icons tied to NPCs, making them visually consistent with player ships with an added ‘+’ icon in the upper-right corner to identify NPC ships specifically. This was to address the fact that some NPCs can be neutral and are therefore displayed in the same white color as player ships but also to ensure that we are not using color as the primary method of identification but rather as a secondary emphasis. This is part of our ongoing mission to use shapes as the primary way of identifying UI objects, which should cater specifically well to those with color blindness, but is also simply a proven preferred way for all humans to store information.	In-game sizes for Ship Group Icons:
37	english	 	 THE END PART	That’s what I have for you for now. Even though there is so much more to do (hello bombers, supers, ECM and missiles!), we believe ship and module balance in EVE is in one of the best positions we’ve seen in a long time. We hope to keep improving based on these great guiding principles that my colleague and dance partner, CCP Fozzie, outlined some time ago:	We rebalance to improve the variety of ships and modules that are viable for our players to both fly and produce.	We rebalance to shake up the combat meta and give smart players opportunities to show off their abilities by becoming the first to find new powerful tactics.	We rebalance to keep different tactics and systems in check and prevent overpowered mechanics from ruining enjoyment for everyone.	Thanks for reading, see you in space o/	@CCP_Rise
37	english	 	 (click to enlarge)	It is also clear that with the HAC rebalance, along with bomber popularity, combat BCs are not getting as much action as they did when they were the end-all class in EVE a couple years ago. As the meta shifted away from combat BCs down to more frigs and cruisers, battleships aren't the right answer as often as they used to be. One good result here is that we see much higher damage per attacker the larger the classes get, generally, i.e. fewer battleships in space, but, when they are used they are potent. Finally, we talked about warp speed changes and once again considered whether the tactical depth added is worth the inconvenience of roaming in battleships and agreed that it is. An interesting point of comparison is agility and align time. We would all want our ship to align as fast as a Stiletto, or at least a Stabber, but if everything at the same align time we would lose a lot of strategic depth.	Proposed change: None. We are pretty happy with the state of class variation right now and see no reason to make changes.
37	english	 	 BATTLECRUISER AND BATTLESHIP VIABILITY	Problem: Strong community sentiment that battleships and battlecruisers are not viable currently and that the biggest reason is warp speed changes.	We took a fresh look at this issue to make sure we were on the same page as a game design department and this is how we approached it: we started by going over usage metrics and once again saw that clearly that both classes are getting heavy use and are being effective by any measure we have available. Have a look at this awesome graph of PVP damage by class:
37	english	 	 (click to enlarge)	Note: look at those “Drake era” heavy missiles, goodness gracious!	Proposed change: We want to reduce rate of fire for all medium rail guns by 7.5%. This brings their actual dps down by about 7%, which puts them in a more even place relative to other medium long range weapons, opening up some more flexibility in fleet comps for other cruisers.	Note: Shout-out here to CSM member mynnna for a great internal discussion on this topic. He raised the point that if you look at these weapon systems on their own, rather than comparing the ships using them, they look very balanced. It would follow then that the problem is more about Tengu, Eagle and Vulture than about rails. However, we can never look at weapon systems or ships without taking the other into consideration. The relationship between cap use of energy weapons and ships with cap use bonuses for energy weapons is another good example where trying to look at one without the other causes problems. We are therefore happy to consider balancing via the weapons or the ships depending on which fits the situation best. In this case, we are happy to use rails as the avenue because it is much simpler for us to design and you to adjust to.
37	english	 	 MEDIUM RAILS	Problem: We over-buffed a bit here. The result is that fleet meta is heavily favoring rail doctrines in most cases that drones aren’t the main damage source.	Approach: - Quick looks at usage metrics show that even though we are in the best place for medium weapon balance in TQ history, rails show a pretty significant advantage in damage done over beams, arties and heavy missiles, as you can see below:
37	english	 	 Problem: Carriers and Super Carriers assisting fighters to small, fast ships from the virtually 100% safe edge of starbase shields is becoming more and more common. Victims and perpetrators alike are expressing frustration and it’s time to take action.	Approach: Rather than a data based decision, this one is really about design philosophy. In general, we want there to be risk associated with power. We also want to promote active gameplay as much as possible. We're failing on both with Skynet by having very little risk associated with something rather powerful, and we're also not providing any gameplay to the carrier pilot.	However, this problem quickly leads us down a path of needing to redesign capitals in general (which would be nice but it isn’t happening just yet). We also have some hesitation about the lost tactical gameplay that comes from larger scale applications of fighter assist. That said, this problem needs to get addressed. We discussed choosing to expose Skynet carriers to more risk rather than taking away the ability to assist fighters, but in the end this solution felt more convoluted and in reality would probably end skynetting but would still leave a strange and unneeded mechanic in the game.	Therefore our proposal is to simply remove fighter assist.	Additional notes: Removing fighter assist raises the question of whether or not fighters should still warp. We would lean towards not, as usually it is undesirable to have your fighters go chasing off grid when you want the damage to stay put. But, once again this chips away at fighter uniqueness. We would really appreicate feedback on this issue so please tell us what you think.

37	english	 	 THOSE GOSH DARN TENGUS	The problem: We’ve been saying for a long time that T3 cruisers are in need of a rebalance. Subsystem variation isn’t nearly as high as we would want, certain configurations are too strong and overall the class doesn’t represent the kind of flexibility we want from Tech 3. We still don’t have time to do the full pass quite yet, but we don’t feel okay letting the strongest configurations continue to run rampant without change.	Approach: The extreme resilience provided by the defensive subsystems is where we want to focus our efforts for now. This group of subs is allowing effective hp numbers that far exceed that of competing classes (like more than double), even though Tech 3 cruisers offer plenty of extra utility and compare fine in areas like signature and damage. By lowering the % hp bonuses from 10% to 7.5% for the Proteus/Legion and from 10% to 5% for the Tengu we expose a little more tradeoff for that added flexibility. We still have a more complete balance pass scheduled for Tech 3 cruisers, but for now this will help bring the class in line.	Changes:

37	english	 	 THE ISHTAR	The problem: Ishtars are too good. They are squashing out diversity in several environments because of their excellent damage projection and solid survivability	Our thoughts: - First, we wanted to establish whether the problem was more about the Ishtar or more about Sentry Drones. The data makes a pretty convincing case that it really is mostly the Ishtar. While several other ships (Dominix, Navy Vexor, Archon, etc.) are making use of sentries, none of them are anywhere near as sentry reliant as the Ishtar and none of them are coming close to the overall damage that Ishtars represent on TQ. After deciding to just make a change to Ishtars, we considered what approach would be the most elegant. Options included changes to the bonuses, changes to base attributes (moving a mid slot was one example here), or possibly screwing around with sentry drone bandwidth use and adjusting other ships as needed. Eventually we settled on the bonuses, even though it means having the only drone damage bonus below 10% per level in the game.	Changes:
38	english	 	 We hope that this blog has made the designs behind the new Sovereignty system clear, and given you a good glimpse into how these updates would change life for all players living in Sovereignty Nullsec space.	Sovereignty is a huge priority for CCP in our plans for 2015 and we are not going to hold back when it comes to making bold changes to the Nullsec landscape.	As I mentioned at the beginning of the blog, we are now entering a significant period of public feedback on these designs and we absolutely encourage our whole community to share with us your feedback in as much detail as possible. The comments thread for this blog will be an excellent place to share your opinions with us, and we will be reading it carefully. We will also be discussing all of these changes with you at Fanfest, which will include presentations and roundtables on the ongoing plans to revamp Nullsec. This new Sovereignty system is currently scheduled for release in June of 2015, which we believe gives us enough time to refine these designs and incorporate the best community feedback. If we decide that another release date is preferable however we won’t hesitate to make use of our rapid release cadence to move these changes to the date that fits them best.	I’ll leave you now with a flow chart that summarizes the new system of Sovereignty structure reinforcement, capture and destruction. It’s the counterpart to the now-famous image released with the Dominion announcement blog more than five years ago and kicked off the Dominion Sov that’s being replaced this Summer.	Thanks for taking the time to read this massive blog, and good hunting!	-CCP Fozzie, on behalf of Team Five 0 and the whole EVE Game Design team.
38	english	 	 SUMMER IS COMING	We know that when changing a system as complex and competitive as Nullsec Sovereignty, it is very important to provide adequate time to incorporate feedback and get the changes right. We have been discussing these designs in detail with the Council of Stellar Management for a little over a month now and we are releasing these dev blogs early so that we can get the crucial public feedback process started as soon as possible. Our current plan is to release Phase Two of the Nullsec and Sovereignty revamp in June 2015. We’ll be listening and working closely with the community from now until then to incorporate feedback and ensure that the changes we release represent the best possible update to Sovereignty gameplay.	Of course like everything in game development, these dates are open to change and we’ll be taking full advantage of our rapid release schedule to ensure that these changes are released as soon as they are ready.
38	english	 	 Hypothetical Example Battle	To illustrate how all of these elements come together, let’s walk through a hypothetical battle over the Sovereignty structures in a single Nullsec system.	Let's use the example of a fight in the RHG-4O constellation in Feythabolis. Blackhawk Alliance owns all 5 stations, as well as TCUs and IHubs in every system.	A director in Blackhawk Alliance's executor corp has set an alliance-wide primetime period to the 4 hour period of 18:00 - 22:00 EVE Time. This means that all of Blackhawk Alliance's Sovereignty structures are only vulnerable to reinforcement between 18:00 and 22:00 each day. At other times attackers are free to disable station services but cannot reinforce the Sovereignty structures to capture or destroy them.	A small gang from the Flameburst Coalition comes by one day at 19:30 and wants to reinforce the Sovereignty structures in the RIT-A7 system. They have one of their members equip an Entosis Link module from a Mobile Depot, and activate it on the station. When the first cycle of the Entosis Link completes, this triggers an alert for everyone in the system (including docked players) and the fact that the station is under attack is visible in a new Sov Structure system info panel on the right hand side of the screen. Blackhawk Alliance members with the correct roles also receive a notification letting them know about the attack. If members of Blackhawk Alliance (or their allies) are nearby they can undock and drive off the Flameburst Coalition attackers. The Flameburst member who is using the Entosis Link is especially vulnerable since he cannot warp or be remote repped while the Link is active. If the attackers are kiting 200km away and the Blackhawk members don't want to chase them down, a Blackhawk Alliance member also would have the option of activating his own Entosis Link on the station to pause the progress of Flameburst's attack and force them in. However for this example Blackhawk Alliance mostly lives far away and nobody is close enough to properly respond until it's too late.	Since RIT has mediocre system indexes, it receives a 2x defensive multiplier from occupancy. It therefore takes 20 minutes for the Flameburst gang to reinforce the station. Since Entosis Linking doesn't scale with numbers, they wouldn't have reinforced it any faster even if they had activated 100 links on the station.	When the station enters reinforced, it picks a random time within the same 4 hour vulnerability window ~48 hours later (similar to the current station reinforcement mechanic) and displays that timer to everyone watching the station. In this case it picks 20:45. The Flameburst gang would then be free to keep roaming Blackhawk space and reinforce more structures (which would create their own separate random timers within the same 4 hour window). They decide to reinforce the TCU and IHub in RIT-A7, which create exit timers at 19:10 and 21:05 respectively.	The occupancy defense bonuses for all of these structures lock while they are reinforced and will not be affected by changes in indices over the two days of reinforcement. This ensures that Blackhawk Alliance cannot grind themselves into better defense bonuses for the capture events. The occupancy bonus of 2x that existed when the Sovereignty structures began their reinforcement period will apply to the capture events as well.	When the Sovereignty structures each exit their reinforcement timer, the capture events begins. For the purpose of the event, Blackhawk Alliance (the guys who own the structures) are Team A and literally anyone else in EVE are Team B. This means that although Blackhawk can feel free to call their friends to help them kill their opposing fleets, the actual capturing of the control points using the Entosis Link module only benefits the defenders if Blackhawk Alliance members are doing it.	At 19:10 the capture event for the TCU begins, and five Command Node anomalies immediately spawn at random points in the constellation. For this example scenario we’ll say that the defenders from Blackhawk Alliance win that event quickly and easily, capturing 10 Command Nodes before a late Flameburst fleet arrives. This returns the TCU to an invulnerable state, but has no effect on the other two Sovereignty structures. Since each structure operates independently, each must be fought over independently.	At 20:45 the Station capture event begins, spawning its own set of five Command Nodes at random points in the constellation. For our example scenario, the attackers from Flameburst Coalition have arrived in force at this point and outnumber the Blackhawk Alliance defenders.	The Flameburst Coalition has a larger fleet, but Blackhawk Alliance does have the advantage of the 2x occupancy defense bonus. This means that the Blackhawk Alliance members capture Command Nodes in 10 minutes while Flamebust Coalition members (and anyone else showing up) require 20 minutes. The Blackhawk Alliance members can take advantage of this by staying mobile and hitting the weakest of the Flameburst Coalition squads.	Since the Station capture event is not finished by 21:05, when the IHub event begins it becomes the second active capture event in the same constellation. This is perfectly fine, as any number of capture events can operate at the same time in the same constellation. The Command Nodes are clearly marked on the overview and scanner window to show which structure in which system they influence, and both sides are free to choose which events they wish to prioritize.	The status of the tug of war for each Sovereignty structure is clearly visible on the actual Command Nodes, as well as in the system info panel in RIT. Members of Blackhawk Alliance may also use their Alliance Sovereignty overview page in the Sovereignty dashboard to keep up to date on the real-time status of the capture events for each of their structures. The only way to determine which systems contain Command Nodes is to use active scouting.	In our example case, let's say Flameburst Coalition manages to catch the majority of the Blackhawk fleet in some bubbles and decimates their force, allowing them to win the first capture event for the RIT station and the capture event for the RIT IHub. The IHub explodes, allowing anyone to place a new replacement hub.	On the other hand, the station goes into its 48 hour Freeport Mode.	Everyone can freely dock in the station during this period, allowing Flameburst to more easily stage in the area. Members of Blackhawk Alliance start evacuating their most important assets to secure stations nearby just in case they lose the second timer.	At the end of the Freeport Reinforcement Period the second sov capture event begins. This time every individual alliance is considered their own team for the tug of war, and any number of coalitions can compete for ownership of the station. Since the station has no owner, no occupancy defensive bonuses apply for this second event. Since everyone can also dock in the station before and during this event, it becomes much harder to control the area. If members of any two alliances at all have Entosis Links active on the same Command Node during this second event, the capture progress will be paused. Whenever any alliance captures a Command Node anomaly, they gain points while also removing points from every other alliance with a current score.	The second event ends when any one alliance (which could include Blackhawk Alliance taking back their station, Flameburst Coalition winning the system or Dragon Fleet swooping in to surprise them both) manages to win the multi-side tug of war. If an alliance wants to support an ally instead of capturing the station for themselves, they can do so by shooting enemy ships and leaving the actual Linking to the ally they are trying to support. If there are only two sides attempting the actual Linking, then this event will work just like the first capture event with a simple two sided tug of war. If more than two sides are all competing for the station, it would be expected that temp-alliances may form between losing groups against the group that is currently winning (they can easily work together for short times by simply agreeing to hit different Command Nodes until their targeted opponent has fallen behind).	In this example the surprise attack from Dragon Fleet is effective, as they are able to break the will of both the Blackhawk and Flameburst fleets and take the station.
38	english	 	 USER INTERFACE	This new Sovereignty system will bring with it a new set of UI elements. We are currently working on a complete revamp of the Sovereignty dashboard to clearly show both individual systems and the status of all your Alliance’s Sovereignty structures.	The following images are early mockups and will likely change significantly before the final release based on continued iteration and community feedback.	This is an example of how the new system information panel on the top left hand side of the UI might look. It demonstrates a system in which each of the Sovereignty structures is owned by a different Alliance. The status and owner of each structure would be visible at all times here, and each element would be interactable to allow quick warping or aligning to each structure.	This is an example of the new Sovereignty dashboard window displaying information on a specific star system. This page would show the position of the system within its constellation, the system indices, the status and owners of each Sovereignty structure as well as their occupancy defensive bonuses.	This is an example of the new Sovereignty dashboard displaying information on an alliance level. This panel would only be available to members of the alliance, and could be potentially restricted by roles. Each Sovereignty structure belonging to the alliance would be visible here, with the ability to filter and sort by distance, type and status. With this panel, alliances will be able to keep track of the real-time status of their active Sovereignty capture events to direct their forces where they will be most needed.
38	english	 	 SOVEREIGNTY CONQUESTS	The rate of systems changing hands in Sovereignty provides a solid indicator of strategic conflict in Nullsec space. Increases in this metric tend to go along with major wars, and extended periods containing few system flips tends to indicate stagnation.	We were hoping for a significant increase in system flips per day during Phase One, with the theory that increased localism from the power projection changes would allow a number of smaller Sov conflicts as non-superpower organizations claim their own chunks of territory.	The results of Phase One on this metric have been noticeable and positive, however we would have been happier with a higher status quo over the past three months.	An initial spike is obvious as alliances made diplomatic deals to transfer space and moved around the map to prepare for the post-Phoebe Nullsec. Although this spike momentarily surpassed the peaks during the Fountain and Halloween Wars visible earlier on the graph, it is not by itself a real indicator of lasting Nullsec health. After the spike, the continued fighting (mainly focused in regions containing Angel NPCs) has generated Sov activity that is acceptable but not particularly exceptional. The new status quo appears to be about four times larger than the status quo in the months immediately preceding the Phase One Dev Blog, and approximately match the periods between wars in 2013.	If Phase Two is a success, we would ideally like to see a significantly higher status quo, less reliant on bursts of activity from major wars.	Overall score for Sovereignty Conquests: We’re successfully off life support, but we absolutely need to do better.	Thanks for joining me for this look back on the metrics surrounding Phase One of our Nullsec changes. Huge thanks to every player who has discussed their own Nullsec experience with us, and helped provide feedback for all our changes so far. I encourage all of you to check out our new Dev Blog covering the plans for Phase Two, and to provide us your feedback on those designs. We will be looking to talk with you all on the forums as well as in person at Fanfest later this month!
38	english	 	 CAPITAL SHIP ACTIVITY	Since capital ship travel mechanics played such a big part in Phase One and Phoebe, this is an area with a lot of potential for change. As we mentioned in the original Phase One Dev Blog, we hoped that the reduced chance of being hotdropped would provide more opportunities for people to feel comfortable using small numbers of capital ships in PVP. The general reduction in capital power projection would also have the potential to reduce many other types of capital ship use, but our hope had been that capital ship usage in PVP would increase overall.	The feedback we have been hearing directly from players has been a mixed bag on this topic. In general we are hearing a lot of happiness from lowsec capital users, and a combination of some neutral and some negative feedback about the opportunities to use capital ships in Nullsec space.	The following graph displays a two week rolling average of PVP damage dealt by capital and supercapital ships (in all areas of space). It does not include delegated fighters, and does include structure shooting. The battles of HED-GP and B-R5RB from earlier in the year are clearly visible.	Overall the PVP damage dealt by capital ships has remained fairly steady. We would have ideally liked to see this number rise with Phase One, but stability is better than decreases. With Phase Two we would expect this number to fall quite significantly as the amount of structure shooting drops dramatically. We’ll be keeping an eye on it as we go forward.	The next graph shows a two week rolling average of the total number of capital ships killed per day. The big capital battles at the beginning of the year once again stand out very clearly.	In this metric we can clearly see a modest increase. This is considered a good sign as more explosions suggest that some pilots are feeling more comfortable putting their capital ships into harm’s way.	Overall score for Capital Ship Activity: A wash. Continued work on engaging and balanced roles for Capital Ships will be needed in the future, especially as some of their current roles in structure shooting are de-emphasized in Phase Two.
38	english	 	 NULLSEC PVP ACTIVITY	This is one of the most important areas of evaluation, and will likely be one of the most controversial. PVP is a huge part of EVE, including Nullsec gameplay. Our hope with Phase One was that with a reasonable expectation that people from halfway across the galaxy won’t suddenly appear on top of you, players would be more willing to engage in PVP. We also hoped that the increased localism that would come with slower travel for the great powers, new conflicts would spark between groups that might not get a chance to fight otherwise.	The following graph displays a two week rolling average of total PVP kills in Nullsec space:	These numbers are going in the direction we like to see, but in order to get the real picture of what’s going on we need to dig a little deeper. Firstly, is this increase simply coming from more people dying in cheap frigates? The following graph displays the same two week rolling average of the ISK value of PVP kills in Nullsec space:	By this metric, the gains are more modest, but are still dramatic and clearly visible.	However this data may still seem at odds with the personal experiences of some players. The feedback we are hearing directly from players is very mixed on this issue, with many claiming that they are experiencing much more PVP activity since Phoebe and many others claiming that their PVP experience is stagnating over the same period. Both experiences are completely true and valid, but each only reflects one part of the overall picture.	What if we look at the change in total PVP activity since the Phase One dev blog for each Nullsec region individually?	This clearly demonstrates that certain areas are showing major increases in conflict since Phase One was announced. In general, these areas are in the space that was occupied by the N3 coalition before Phoebe. With the release of Phase One, that coalition moved to take new space in Delve and Querious, and reduced their presence in several of their previously held regions. This power vacuum was quickly filled by competing factions looking to stake their own claim in Nullsec, and became host to a great deal of PVP activity.	Another way to look at this regional distribution of conflict since the beginning of Phase One is to split Nullsec into six sections based on the type of NPC found in their regional asteroid belts. We can then look at each of those superregions and observe the changes in PVP activity over time.	The following graph displays the percentage change in PVP activity in each of these super-regions since the release of the Phase One Dev Blog on October 1st.	You can see that over these months significant increases in conflict occurred within the Drone Regions (which eventually settled down) and within Nullsec regions occupied by Angel Cartel and Sansha’s Nation NPCs.	This explains why we tend to hear such dramatically different feedback on the amount of PVP activity since the beginning of Phase One. If you live in the swath of Nullsec space between Stain and Perrigen Falls, you have probably experienced significantly increased PVP in your home regions. If you live in the rest of Nullsec, you have probably experienced similar rates of PVP activity to what came before.	So the truth of this metric is that overall Nullsec PVP activity has significantly increased during Phase One so far, but that activity is distributed unevenly across Nullsec space. Communicating larger trends that may not be reflected by individual experiences is always a challenge, but that doesn’t change the facts of the EVE-wide pattern. We hope that the changes we have coming in Phase Two will make some major progress towards bringing these PVP opportunities to ALL areas of Sovereignty space, including those areas that have not seen the benefits of Phase One yet.	Before we wrap this section up, I want to quickly address one of the other questions that we have seen raised surrounding this trend. Some people have suggested that the overall increase in PVP activity may be largely caused by the conflict between the HERO Coalition and Pandemic Legion. Now it is true that the HERO Coalition represents a huge chunk of all Nullsec PVP activity. Since forming a year ago their largest alliance, the Brave Collective, has placed second out of every alliance in EVE for total ISK-value destroyed in Nullsec PVP, and third place in ISK lost. Over the past two weeks, a total of 38.1% of all PVP kills in Nullsec have had a member of the HERO Coalition as either the final blow or the victim. It makes perfect sense to assume that any wars the HERO Coalition engages in will have a big impact on these metrics.	However the truth is that the HERO Coalition was already involved in 31.6% of all Nullsec PVP kills in the two weeks before the Phase One Dev Blog was released. The number of kills involving the HERO Coalition has increased at a faster rate than the rest of Nullsec, but even if you completely remove all killmails with a HERO member as the final blow or victim the rate of other PVP kills in Nullsec has still increased by 22.1% since the Dev Blog was released.	Overall score for Nullsec PVP Activity: Significant overall improvement, but largely in one half of Nullsec. We need to work towards better PVP for all of Nullsec.
38	english	 	 NULLSEC POPULATION AND GENERAL ACTIVITY	We’ll start with this category as it’s the most generally applicable. It also happens to be the clearest cut in its results.	The following graph displays a two week rolling average of the number of characters on active (subscribed) accounts that are in Nullsec space (either in space or docked in a station within Nullsec) each day. For this metric, we’re generally happier with higher numbers. Increases represent a combination of players moving to Nullsec, existing Nullsec players bringing a higher percentage of their characters into Nullsec space, and older Nullsec players resubscribing.	For a metric as stable as this one, the changes seen at the Phoebe release are quite extraordinary. At the beginning of November we saw a rapid increase in the total Nullsec population, which has been followed by robust and steady growth over the following four months. Subscriber demographic data over the same period of time suggests that a major factor contributing to the immediate Phoebe increase was an influx of Russian speaking players taking advantage of the power vacuum in the South and East of Nullsec space created by Phoebe’s power projection changes. At the same time, other organizations such as the Phoebe Freeport Republic were also able to gain footholds in the newly available Nullsec space and contributed by bringing in players that would have struggled to carve out their own territory pre-Phoebe.	The release of the celebrated This is EVE trailer came after the initial period of rapid growth, but likely contributed to the subsequent steady rise in population.	As we prepare to launch into Phase Two, we would ideally like to see more growth in this metric. Our hope is that by designing mechanics that allow a wider variety of organizations to claim their own space without requiring the support of massive powerblocks, more and more of our players will see opportunities to have fun in Nullsec space.	The next graph is not particularly important for evaluating the success or failure of Phase One, as the Phoebe changes directly affected the baseline. Jumps per day is normally a valuable metric for determining overall player activity but since the Phase One changes directly encouraged more travel by gates and less use of teleportation we would expect a dramatic increase no matter what. If this graph hadn’t increased we would have been very worried. J	The real use of this metric will be later as we evaluate Phase Two. As the next set of changes do not involve direct changes to power projection we would hope that an increase in Nullsec jumps over the summer would reflect an overall increase in player engagement.	We also watch a wide variety of other metrics related to general life in Nullsec space. The results of these range from very positive (+23.6% increase in manufacturing jobs per day in Nullsec since Phoebe) to somewhat positive (+5% increase in NPC kills per day in Nullsec since Phoebe) to fairly neutral (+0.7% increase in mining volume per day in Nullsec since Phoebe).	Overall score for Nullsec Population and General Activity: Significant progress, but we can do even better!
38	english	 	 Sovereignty Conquests	Generally the graphs displayed below are labelled with the date of the Jump Fatigue announcement blog (October 1st 2014) and the date of the Phoebe release (November 4th 2014). The lack of labels on the Y axis is intentional, as we want to minimize the ability of clever players to use this data to gain advantages over others. What I can tell you is that for the unlabelled graphs, the Y axis begin at 0 and increase linearly (no cheating). None of the data in the graphs below is normalized by any other factor.	The distinct time periods that are worth watching are:	The period before the announcement dev blog, representing the older activity patterns	The period between the dev blog and the Phoebe release, when many players were proactively dealing and shifting to prepare for the post-Phoebe game	The period after the Phoebe release, after which Phase One is in effect	Without further ado, let’s jump into the discussion!
38	english	 	 Capital Ship Activity
38	english	 	 Nullsec PVP Activity
38	english	 	 Nullsec Population and General Activity
38	english	 	 What are the anticipated consequences?	In the short term, we would anticipate a reduction in the degree to which the average non-trivial capital fight escalates, and the number of parties involved. This seems likely to increase the frequency of capitals being deployed in small-scale engagements, in both lowsec and nullsec.	Over the medium term, we see the potential for more substantial changes in the nullsec status quo as the various competing parties work to adjust their internal objectives to the new situation; it seems plausible that the general reduction in travel capabilities will lead to more localism, but we don't want to make any firm predictions in this area. We're confident that these changes improve the overall system of lowsec and nullsec gameplay and take them in better directions, but any set of changes that would allow us to accurately predict their consequences would by their nature be too simple to be interesting for very long.	Today we are unveiling the plans for Phase Two, but as we look to the future of Nullsec it is also important to look back. This blog will show some of the metrics surrounding the Phase One changes and the current state of Nullsec space as we prepare to launch into Phase Two.	Our development team takes multiple approaches to evaluate the effects of any changes to EVE Online.	First, we actively play the game and evaluate how our own experiences change as the design changes. Yes, there are several members of our team playing actively in Sovereignty space. No, I won’t tell you what their character names are. :)	We also have access to many sources of direct player feedback. We read the forums, listen to your stories and requests at player gatherings, chat with members of the Council of Stellar Management (who you should go vote for if you haven’t already) and more.	Finally, we have access to metrics that display the bigger picture of trends in player activity. Using metrics and statistics to reach conclusions must always be done with care (correlation does NOT equal causation), but in a game as huge and diverse as EVE they can be a crucial tool. This last category is one that you as players often lack access to, as when sharing data we must always be wary of the danger that some players might use our information to gain an unfair advantage over others. This blog will focus largely on giving you a glimpse into some of the metrics that we watch to help us judge the effects of Phase One of our Nullsec efforts.	We will split the metrics shown in this blog into four categories, each representing one aspect of our goals for Phoebe and Phase One. These categories are:
38	english	 	 Why this?/Why now?	Nullsec is stagnant and needs a change. This is the first of many steps in our plan.	Big fights are cool, but they’re crowding out more accessible and more frequent smaller ones.	These changes have positive implications for people not involved in sovereignty warfare, for example making use of capitals in lowsec less risky.	We expect the impact of these changes to be emergent, and as a consequence are unpredictable and will take a while to develop on TQ. This plays into our longer-term plans, as you’ll see in a second!
38	english	 	 Some other example values:	This system of occupancy defensive bonuses is intentionally built to be modular and adjustable. In future iterations of the Sovereignty system we plan to refine the process for measuring activity, including expanding what kinds of activities are counted towards the bonuses.
38	english	 	  	To determine the full bonus applied to each owned structure, find the appropriate value of your current level in each of the three indices and add them together, then add 1. The speed at which attackers reinforce or capture structures or command nodes is then divided by that result.	For a fully maxed out system, this occupancy bonus would divide enemy capture speed by 4 (causing them to require 4x as much time to capture or reinforce a structure or service).
38	english	 	 FREEPORT MODE	Stations will enter a mandatory 48 hour Freeport Mode and second reinforcement period if their owners lose a capture event for them. While in this mode, the Station is not owned by any alliance and all players are able to dock and use the services of the station. No players will be able to change any settings for the Station during this time period, and no fees or taxes will be awarded to any corporations. No docking fees may be charged.	Freeport Mode stations will be clearly visible on the map and the timer for when they will exit the second reinforcement period will be visible in their show info window.	When a station exits this second reinforcement timer, another capture event begins with a twist. Since the station has no owning alliance, no occupancy defense bonuses will apply to anyone capturing the Command Nodes. As well, unlike the standard capture events where the two sides are the defender and attackers, the capture event for a Freeport Mode station pits each individual alliance against each other in a free for all multi-side tug of war. Only one alliance can capture each Command Node, and each of those successful captures gives that specific alliance points towards the larger tug of war.	The station remains in Freeport Mode for the duration of this second capture event, so any pilot may dock and make use of the station during the fighting.	Whichever alliance wins this tug of war for the second capture event (it could be the old Station owners, the alliance that attacked in the first place, or a third party) takes ownership of the Station at that point. The Station would then become invulnerable until the next occurrence of this winning alliance’s prime time period.
38	english	 	 THE MAIN EVENT	When Sovereignty structures exit their reinforcement period approximately 48 hours after the initial attack, they spark the beginning of a new capture event in which players fight over Command Node anomalies that spawn at random points throughout the constellation.	These Nodes have an equal chance to appear in any system in the constellation, regardless of who owns the Sovereignty in the other systems.	These Command Nodes will be visible through the anomaly scanner, sensor overlay and overview, and will be clearly named after the structure that they apply to. Capturing a Command Node follows exactly the same process as reinforcing a structure, with players competing to make progress towards capture by applying Entosis Links to the Command Node structure.	When an Alliance captures any individual Command Node, they will gain progress in the constellation-wide tug of war for that structure. Multiple capture events can occur simultaneously in the same constellation if more than one Sovereignty structure within that constellation exits their reinforcement periods in close succession. In that case each event operates independently of the others and the tug of war for one structure has no effect on the tug of war for any other structures.	If the Sovereignty structure exiting its reinforcement period has an owner, then occupancy defense bonuses apply to all of the Command Nodes for that structure’s event. The level of the occupancy defense bonuses are determined by the occupancy indices in the system containing the reinforced structure (at the time of initial reinforcement), not the system containing the individual Command Nodes. More details about the occupancy defense bonuses can be found later in the blog.	Immediately as the structure exits its reinforcement period, five Command Nodes will spawn at random points throughout the constellation. More than one Command Nodes can potentially spawn in the same system. As soon as each Command Node is captured, a new Command Node will spawn somewhere else in the constellation.	In addition, as time passes extra Command Nodes beyond the initial five have a chance to spawn and capturing those Nodes will also spawn new Nodes instantly. This ensures that if a capture event starts running long it becomes easier and easier for it to reach a resolution and for any stalemates to break.	If one side is allowed to capture the Command Nodes uncontested, then capturing 10 nodes will be enough to win the event. This means that it will be possible for a defender with no opposition and at least five active pilots to complete the event and secure their structure in less than 30 minutes of capturing. This minimum time would also be possible for a small group of aggressors who are attacking an undefended solar system with no occupancy indices.	If nobody shows up to defend or attack a capture event, or if the involved parties are perfectly matched, the event can go on indefinitely. The addition of new Command Nodes to the event over time makes stalemates extremely unstable over time however. If downtime occurs while a capture event is active, it will save its state and continue as normal after downtime.	The expected flow of a battle over a capture event will vary greatly depending on the landscape of the constellation, the size and strength of the involved parties and the skill of opposing fleet commanders and pilots. Both attackers and defenders will need to split their forces and stay mobile to be effective, which should encourage a fluid battle as well as providing more opportunities for newer fleet commanders and leaders to step up without needing to run a whole fleet.	Defenders with high levels of activity will be able to use their occupancy defense bonuses to great effect in these battles, as they will be capturing Command Nodes up to 4x as fast as their opponents. Defenders will also often enjoy the benefits of jump bridges, starbases, stations and other infrastructure spread throughout the constellation.	The nature of the Entosis Link gameplay combined with these events should create strong opportunities for enjoyable and fluid fleet combat, rather than the largely static nature of current set piece Sovereignty battles.	We see a huge potential for varied and enjoyable gameplay in this new capture event system, and it’s very exciting to once again have constellation geography matter in a significant way to combat in EVE. The variety of constellation layouts throughout Nullsec is something that is often overlooked since the current Sovereignty system largely ignores it. Each constellation has its own chokepoints, key systems and unique movement patterns. As a hint of what’s possible, take a look at the following images of different constellation geography as viewed from Dotlan. All of these constellations are from one Nullsec region (Providence) and each one of them would provide a completely different tactical environment.	In a capture event for a structure with an owner, the system considers every member of the owning alliance to be defenders and every other player to be attackers. This means that if you wish to support your allies in another alliance in defending their structures you may do so by engaging their enemies in combat but if you apply your own Entosis Link to the Command Nodes you will contribute to the attacker side instead of the defender. In this way, we ensure that although allies in other alliances can be a huge help when defending space, a successful defense does require at least some active presence from members of the structure owning alliance.	When one side wins the capture event, all remaining Command Nodes for that event will go inert and despawn.	If the defender wins a capture event for one of their owned structures, the structure becomes invulnerable until it becomes vulnerable during their alliance prime time the next day. It does not need to be repaired in any way.	If the attackers win a capture event for a Territorial Claim Unit or Infrastructure Hub, then the structure explodes and any alliance will be free to attempt deploying of their own replacement structures.	However if the attackers win a capture event for an owned Station, it will enter a new Freeport Mode for another 48 hours and when it exits from that timer it will be available for capture by any alliance through a free for all capture event.
38	english	 	 PRIME TIME	In the new Sovereignty system, each alliance will designate a four hour window through a new option available in the Corporation Management window to certain members of the alliance executor corp. This period will represent the alliance’s declared prime time, and will be visible in the show info window for the alliance and in the show info window for each Sovereignty structure belonging to that alliance.	When an alliance changes their prime time window, their new choice will not take effect until after 96 hours have passed. At the end of this 96 hour waiting period all the structures belonging to that alliance will be vulnerable twice in the same 24 hour period (one in the old window and once in the new one). The new setting will then take effect and become the new daily vulnerability window.	This will determine the time period within which all Sovereignty structures belonging to that alliance are vulnerable to be reinforced, and the time period within which the exit time of all reinforcement periods for that alliance’s Sovereignty structures will be randomly selected. All Sovereignty structures belonging to the alliance will become vulnerable to be reinforced during that same four hour period every day, except for days when those structures are in the middle of a reinforcement period.	This allows alliances to ensure that they can defend their structures both from initial attacks and in subsequent Capture Events through active combat in their most important time zone. The fact that all structures belonging to the same alliance will be vulnerable during the same period of time allows more localized attackers to receive an advantage over a more widely spread defender since the defender will need to respond to attacks anywhere in their territory.	During the vulnerability period any character can activate an Entosis Link on the Sovereignty structures to begin the process of reinforcing it. Once the first cycle of the Entosis Link completes and the capture progress begins the Alliance who owns the structure will be notified of the attack and will need to respond in order to prevent the attackers from reinforcing the structure.	Reinforcing a Sovereignty structure with the Entosis Link will take anywhere between 10 minutes and 40 minutes of uncontested capture, depending on the level of occupancy defense bonuses in the system. If the attackers are successful in completing the capture progress, the structure will pick a random time within the same prime time window two days later, and enter reinforced mode until then.	If a structure is partially captured at the end of the vulnerability window, it will remain vulnerable until it is either captured and enters reinforced mode or is returned to full owner control by the owning alliance using their own Entosis links.	Although reinforcing of Sovereignty structures may only occur during the owning alliance’s prime time window, station services can be disabled at any time through use of the Entosis Link for between 5 and 20 minutes (depending on occupancy levels).
38	english	 	 Stations will continue to provide all the services you know and love, including docking, fitting, refining, industry and markets. Station services will now be enabled and disabled through the Entosis Link mechanic rather than shooting through hitpoints.	To disable a station service, anyone other than the alliance that owns the station must apply an Entosis link directly to the targetable station service. The capture mechanic for station services is exactly the same as for any other structure, except that station services activate and deactivate in half the time that Sov structures reinforce or capture.	To enable a station service again, any member of the alliance that owns the station must apply their own Entosis link directly to the targetable station service. Multiple station services may be disabled at the same time by multiple ships with their own active Entosis links. Neither DPS nor remote reps will be used for controlling station services in the new system.	Stations will now have part of the Sovereignty upkeep cost that was previously attached to the TCU.	Sovereignty Blockade Units are not needed as part of this new system and will be phased out, leaving us with three key structures instead of four. The existing stock of SBUs and their blueprints will be removed, with compensation to their owners.
38	english	 	 Infrastructure Hub	The Infrastructure Hub will continue to enable system indices and provide a location for the installation of system upgrades so that alliances can improve their space. The Infrastructure Hub will now have a base upkeep cost and the Strategic Sovereignty Index will now be obtained by keeping an IHub alive in a system rather than being obtained from the TCU. Future iterations on this system will add more structures that alliances can use to obtain new kinds of bonuses and effects in their space.	Station
38	english	 	 Territorial Claim Unit	This structure will be distilled down to its core function: a declaration to the whole of New Eden that you lay claim to a particular system and that you intend to defend that claim. The TCU will no longer have an upkeep cost (this cost will be split between the IHub and Station) and will not be required in order to operate the other Sovereignty structures. The benefits of this structure will be registration into the Sovereignty filters on the map, your alliance logo visible to every pilot in the system and the existing 25% bonus to starbase fuel use.	By removing the upkeep cost from TCUs and keeping their affordable cost, we will ensure an affordable entry level option for alliances interested in dipping their toes into Sovereignty.	Since we are no longer forcing alliances to use a TCU in order to anchor and protect IHubs and Stations, the value of TCUs will now be able to be set entirely by the goals and aspirations of each alliance. You will also no longer need a TCU in order to gain the benefits of Infrastructure Hub upgrades. How much value your alliance places on defending its TCUs can depend entirely on your own priorities.
38	english	 	 STRUCTURE FREEDOM	Under the new Sovereignty system, each of the three key Sovereignty structures (Territorial Claim Unit, Infrastructure Hub, and Station) will all exist and operate independently from each other. They will have their own separate functions and there will no longer be any requirement for the same alliance to own all three (in practice however, they will often end up owned by the same alliance).	Under this new system, only one of each Sovereignty structure can exist in the same system at the same time.	The functions of the three Sovereignty structures will be:
38	english	 	 Disabling and Enabling Station Services	Capturing Command Nodes during Sovereignty capture events	This means that Entosis Linking will replace shooting of structures in every part of the Sovereignty system. After the June release, shooting of structures will not play any part in Sovereignty.	Before occupancy defensive bonuses are applied, exerting uncontested control over Territorial Claim Units, Infrastructure Hubs and Outposts will take 10 minutes (plus the duration of the first cycle) and enabling/disabling station services will take 5 minutes (plus the duration of the first cycle). Like everything in this plan, these numbers are subject to change based on playtesting and discussion.	The Entosis Link will be added to the game about a month before the launch of this Sovereignty system to allow players adequate time to manufacture stockpiles.	This basic Entosis Link gameplay is used repeatedly throughout the Sovereignty capture and defense gameplay, so it’s worth making sure you’ve fully read the previous section before moving forward.
38	english	 	 INTRODUCING THE ENTOSIS LINK	We’ll begin by introducing a new module that sits at the core of the new system, and that will become more and more important to many parts of EVE over the upcoming months and years.	Recently mysterious new ships have been spotted all across New Eden, sporting advanced technology unlike anything seen before. Exploring the recovered wreckage of these Drifter battleships, researchers are already starting to make startling breakthroughs in the field of mind-machine interfacing.	One of the first results of these breakthroughs is a new module that enables capsuleers to directly interface with the computer systems governing certain structures, bypassing the need for abstracted hacking interfaces.	The Entosis Link module represents the central interaction mechanic of the new Sovereignty system (among its other uses) and the interaction between competing groups of players wishing to use their Entosis Links will provide much of the gameplay and conflict.	The Entosis Link is a targeted highslot module that can be activated on certain structures. For the purpose of this Sovereignty redesign, the important targets are Territorial Claim Units, Infrastructure Hubs, Stations and Station Services.	The Entosis Link is used for all kinds of manipulation of these structures. In general, activating an Entosis Link on a structure you own will activate and protect it, while activating an Entosis Link on a structure you do not own will disable, reinforce or capture it.	Crucially, the process of exerting control over a structure using an Entosis Link cannot be sped up by using more links or more players.	If two or more Entosis Links belonging to different “sides” are operational on the same structure at the same time, neither will have any effect and all capture will be paused. This remains true even if one side has more Links operational on the structure than the other side.	For the purposes of Sovereignty structures, there are two ways that the system can determine “sides”:	If the structure has a current owner, then the alliance that owns the structure is one side and everyone else in EVE is the other side as far as the server is concerned. All Entosis links from any alliance other than the owning alliance are considered to be the same side. This means that in fights over an owned structure, allies of the owner can provide support by shooting other players but if those allies activate their own Entosis links they will not pause enemy capture progress or do anything to return the structure to its owner’s control. This ensures that a defending alliance must show up personally to at least help with the defense of their territory, no matter how strong their allies are.	If the structure has no current owner, then every alliance represents their own team and any two separate alliances running their own active Entosis links will pause capture.	The basic flow of Entosis Link gameplay is shown in the following flow chart:	This power doesn’t come without risks however.	Entosis Links have a significant cycle time (5 minutes for the Tech One variant, 2 minutes for Tech Two) and do not start affecting the battle for control of the target structure until the end of their first cycle.	Activating an Entosis Link also causes ships to become extremely vulnerable for the duration of the module’s cycle: the equipped ship cannot warp, dock, jump or receive remote assistance until the cycle completes.	Other key attributes of the Entosis Link module are:	Requires the skill Infomorph Psychology (rank 1 skill).	Low fitting requirements, uses high power slot.	Only one may be fitted per ship.	Cannot be used by trial accounts.	Maximum range of 25km for Tech One, 250km for Tech Two.	Requires a target lock on the structure.	Capital Ships would have restrictions for using these modules, most likely in the form of a role bonus that increases the cycle time by 400% (this means a 10 minute cycle time for a T2 Entosis Link on a capital ship).	A clear visual effect shows which ships are applying Entosis Links.	Build costs of approximately 20 million isk for Tech One, and approximately 80 million isk for Tech Two.	The cycle time of Entosis links does not affect the speed at which structures are captured once the first cycle is complete. This means that using a T1 Link will cause a longer initial delay before capturing begins (during the first cycle) and will leave the player vulnerable and unable to warp for longer periods of time, but will still capture the structure in the same amount of time as a T2 link once it’s up and running.	Both the cycle time of the Entosis Link module and the actual capture process will be affected by time dilation.	When a target structure does not have a current owner, every alliance represents their own “side” and all characters are capable of making progress towards capturing it at the same rate. When a target Sovereignty structure has a current owner, the system recognizes two sides (the current owning alliance on one side and everyone else on the other) and the rate at which attacking characters make capture progress is reduced according to the occupancy defensive bonuses of the solar system. More details about how these bonuses work will be explained later in the blog.	The result of all these design features is that the best method to exert control over a structure with the Entosis Link is to establish effective military control over the grid around the target structure.	In this Sovereignty update, the Entosis Link will be used for the following tasks (details later in this blog):	Activating newly deployed Territorial Claim Units and Infrastructure Hubs	Reinforcing Territorial Claim Units, Infrastructure Hubs and Outposts during their vulnerability period
38	english	 	 TARGET SELECTION	I’m sure many of you are already skipping down to look at the new mechanics, but before we talk about implementation I think it’s important to review the clearly defined goals our game design team had for the new system.	Goal #1: As much as possible, ensure that the process of fighting over a star system is enjoyable and fascinating for all the players involved	This goal forms the core of what we want to accomplish with Phase Two. We have released many changes over the past few years that have focused on Nullsec income, industry and resources, and those changes have been very successful. However the gameplay surrounding conquering and defending space has not changed significantly since 2009 and this is the area where we see the most opportunity for improvement.	It’s absolutely key that Sovereignty warfare provide exciting gameplay and opportunities for significant contributions by all the players involved. Players from coalition leaders to line members and everyone in between should be able to look forward to the gameplay surrounding defending their home or invading their neighbors.	We hope to achieve this goal by rebuilding EVE’s Sov warfare mechanics to emphasize the best aspects such as strategic planning, empire building and dynamic PVP engagements, while minimizing the less exciting parts of the gameplay. We are well aware that Nullsec empires have mastered the strategy of weaponizing their opponent’s boredom, so our new system must be built around a core of engaging competitive gameplay.	Goal #2: Clarify the process of taking, holding and fighting over star systems	It is vital that the core mechanics involved in taking space be easily understood and flow logically. The best multiplayer game systems involve simple mechanics that combine with competing player interests to generate complex and unpredictable results. Sovereignty must be one of these systems.	We hope to achieve this goal by focusing on an easily understood core game system that encourages player interaction and conflict. Unlike the Dominion Sovereignty system with its intertwined structures and states, the different structures in our new Sovereignty system operate independently to keep each structure simple and to give players freedom to choose their own priorities.	Goal #3: Minimize the systemic pressure to bring more people or larger ships than would be required to simply defeat your enemies on the field of battle.	One major flaw of the current Dominion Sovereignty system is that the use of structure hitpoint grinding forces players to use huge numbers of players or colossal capital ships to fight over space, even when they would otherwise prefer to work in smaller units. This also creates an artificial floor on the size of alliances or coalitions that can be successful in Sovereignty.	A new Sovereignty system should not attempt to artificially determine the size of groups that can operate within it, either by forcing larger fleets or by forcing smaller ones. Instead, players should be able to work with numbers of friends that they consider appropriate for the situation.	Rather than trying to enforce some arbitrary limit on how many friends or allies you have, this system is simply designed to give organizations and players more freedom to choose the size of coalition that they prefer.	Bringing more players will always have some value, as it will provide advantages in direct fleet combat with your opponents. But a system that allows small numbers of players to conquer space as quickly as larger numbers ensures that if your fleet has the capability to win the fight, you automatically have enough people to take the Sovereignty objectives.	Goal #4: Drastically reduce the time and effort required to conquer undefended space.	Directly following from the goal above, it’s extremely important that we minimize the total player-hours required to take undefended and/or unoccupied space. The large time investment required to grind structure hitpoints under the current system allows alliances to effectively use fallow space as buffer zones and to wear down the will of an opponent through sheer boredom.	With our new system we intend to reach this goal by tying the defense of Sovereignty directly to the actions of players, through both combat fleets during attacks and active residency gameplay in peacetime. Our realistic goal for the new Sovereignty system is that a very small group of players in virtually any ship types should be able to completely conquer an undefended system with a few ~10-30 minute sessions spread across a few days. On the other hand, evicting an alliance that actively uses and defends their space should be a very difficult task indeed, which leads us to the next goal.	Goal #5: Provide significant strategic benefits from living in your space.	It’s very important that active and prepared alliances be provided with the tools they need to defend their homes. Providing benefits for robust in-space activity has been one of the key drivers of many of the economic changes to Nullsec over the past few years, and those changes have been quite successful in shifting the focus of Nullsec economic activity from static assets to bottom-up gameplay. It’s now time to begin linking this same bottom-up economic activity more strongly with the world of strategic Sovereignty warfare.	In the new Sovereignty, systems full of active occupants will be vastly easier to defend and control than abandoned ones, bustling empires with a variety of activities will be stronger than AFK ones, and disrupting your enemies everyday activities in their space will help you gain advantages both strategic and economic. More details on how we intend to begin achieving this goal will be discussed later in this blog.	Goal #6: Spread the largest Sovereignty battles over multiple star systems to take advantage of New Eden’s varied geography and to better manage server load.	By spreading objectives across multiple star systems we can provide unique tactical choices tied to the layout of individual constellations. This should help ensure variety and enable more dynamic engagements.	Huge clashes between empires have become one of the most iconic symbols of EVE’s uniqueness and a source of well-deserved renown both for the game itself and for the fleet commanders who lead these battles. However anyone who has experienced these events firsthand will tell you that user experience suffers under the technical realities of battles containing such massive numbers of players. For the last 12 years, CCP has combined top-shelf hardware with innovative software techniques to fit more players on one star system than anyone ever imagined would be possible, and more advancements in both Tranquility’s server hardware and EVE’s codebase are in the works to push the envelope even further. However we must face the reality that player numbers will always outstrip our ability to increase server capacity. When we made 500 player battles smooth, alliances started bringing 1000. When we made 1000 player battles smooth (on reinforced nodes), 4000 of you folks decided to show up at once. This means that we need to do everything we can through design to spread battles out into multiple smaller simultaneous engagements which should each perform more smoothly.	Goal #7: Any new Sovereignty system should be adaptable enough to be rapidly updated and to incorporate future changes to EVE.	We are not under the illusion that some theoretical perfect Sovereignty system would ever be able to stand the test of time without changing. Sovereignty gameplay is the most ruthlessly optimized part of EVE and will always need to be adjusted and updated regularly to remain fresh.	It’s also important that our new Sovereignty system be flexible enough to incorporate new improvements to EVE as they are released, especially improvements to structure gameplay that are being developed as we speak. The possibilities for engaging gameplay provided by the combination of complete revamps to Sovereignty and structures are nearly endless.	To reach this goal, new Sovereignty is being designed to be as modular and flexible as possible. We have intentionally built many aspects of the new system that can be easily adjusted and tweaked. This will allow us to incorporate the feedback from the community before release, respond to problems or stagnation after release, and replace specific parts of the design with new types of gameplay as they are released in the future.	You’ll see a great many numbers, durations and percentages in the rest of the blog, and it’s important to remember that they’re all open for adjustment.
39	english	 	 PARTING WORDS	We hope reading about those plans made you as excited as we were coming up with them. Please remember everything mentioned is highly subject to change based on feedback, time, and implementation methods.	Our goal is to release the first set of new structures sometime within 2015 and we look forward to opening up gameplay possibilities and inspiring new emergent behaviors from our player base.
39	english	 	 THE NEW STRUCTURE SYSTEM	With all the goals above in mind, we set out on our prototyping search and came up with different ideas. We quickly looked for comparison points regarding existing gameplay and what players like the most in our game: ship control and fitting.	Before we move forward, we would like to make it clear the changes listed below are ideas and highly theoretical. Those are not set in stone or fixed, we are telling our plans to you, our players, months in advance to initiate feedback and spark interest. Also please remember that concept art is just that, concept.	We are also not going to remove existing structures instantly without a transition plan. There is a detailed example of this particular point further down this blog.	With that in mind, we would like to introduce the following.
39	english	 	 IMPROVEMENT GOALS	Our exploratory work highlighted many pain points in the existing structures design. Since they have been progressively added one after another over a long period of time (the first Starbase structures were added during the Exodus expansion in 2004), they show disparate behaviors in their functions, use, attack and management options.	Our first deliverable was as such to come up with a list of high-end goals that any new structure system should aspire towards. Those became:	Support and enhance existing gameplay: We found early on that structures have no need for new mini-games or to introducing radically new ways of playing EVE. Their main appeal is to improve, create or magnify gameplay in the area they control. For example Starbases work best to give capsuleers an edge when manufacturing, or contesting space. Adding a mini-game to deploy Starbase structures and link them together was not something with enough perceived value to pursue.	Everyone who wants to use a structure, does: We want structures to be as widely used as possible, by removing artificial barriers or mechanics that may be in the way. This has to stay within a reasonable risk versus reward scope, of course, and as such the most rewarding structures should always be vulnerable to attack.	Strong connection with the player: This means we want to enthrall our players to feel meaningfully connected with the structures they deploy, use, and manage. We want them to have an active cooperative (or disruptive) role in the space around them so that players care about their placement.	Structure combat is more exciting: Structure combat leaves a lot to be desired, as the AI target selection is lacking, while defensive options are limited and not that effective. This goal ensures structures work well in asymmetrical warfare, being force multipliers in the area they contest to compensate for their static nature. We want structure combat to feel more like ship combat between several parties and less like a static grind.	Visually aspirational: This is self-explanatory, we want structures to feel imposing, visually rewarding as a whole. That includes showing different visuals for their various states, actions or reactions to their activities, but also making the largest structure feel like a great achievement for whichever social group managed to build them (or blow them up).	System is extensible, future proof and unifying: Our new system should be scalable and flexible enough to ensure it remains viable under design pressure over time, such as different player group sizes and evolving, emergent usage. It also means the system is flexible enough to add more functionality easily if the need arises.	Create more interesting locations in solar system: We want the new structure system to provide more locations for players to interact within EVE solar systems, which in turn will bolster emergent gameplay. We however need to make sure travel or critical player behavior is not negatively affected in the process.	Simple and intuitive to deploy, manage and use: We should strive to provide a stark improvement over management, deployment and usage tools currently in place for structures, which are not flexible nor powerful enough to account for our player needs.	Coherent progression between all structures: All structures should feel part of a natural progression system with niche roles in specialization branches, not being the norm. The basic interaction with all of them should feel consistent and natural no matter what their functions are.	Encourage interaction between groups of players: Partly covered before, we want our new system to greatly favor player interactions via cooperative or competitive gameplay. This not only means structures should matter to be considered primary targets, but also promote public participation if needed.
39	english	 	 CURRENT STRUCTURES	There are currently five different types of structures available in the game, each with a unique purpose, which we shall quickly review now.	Deployables are mainly structures that provide short term gameplay for immediate benefits. They usually suit a personal playstyle and do not have a complicated interaction process. A few examples include Mobile Depots, Mobile Tractor Units and Mobile Scan Inhibitors. We should mention this category also includes containers and even Mobile Warp Disruptors. Their roles are numerous, including storage, harvesting, staging and space upgrading capabilities (for the Encounter Surveillance System deployable).	Customs Offices (often abbreviated to POCOs for Player Owned Customs Office) are heavily tied with the Planetary Interaction feature, as they are used to move goods away from planets into what’s technically a glorified storage container. The interesting factor comes with the added tax on PI goods, which allows the owning corporation to make a profit from the tenants, and create emergent behavior.	Starbases (often called POS for Player Owned Structures or even Player Owned Starbases) are in fact a collection of structures at a specific point around moons. They consist of a Control Tower, which groups most managing and administrative functions of the Starbase, and secondary structures, which add extra functionalities to the whole. Depending on the secondary structure anchored, a Starbase may offer storage, harvesting, industry, defense or even fleet staging roles. Starbases are also unique for offering a forcefield mechanic, which allows players inside to be safe from direct harm, and is often used to store ships (albeit this is not their designed purpose and is something done at your own risk).	Sovereignty Structures are tied to player territorial conquest in null-security space, including Sovereignty flag claim and other disruption mechanics as a whole. Those structures, and the fate that are going to befall them in the near future are explained in this blog from CCP Fozzie.	Outposts form the last structure group, which are player-made, upgradable stations which can only be deployed in null-security space, and provide a wide variety of functions (storage, industry, defense, staging) through their various upgrades. Because of their location and attack mechanics, they are sometimes included as part of the Sovereignty system.
39	english	 	 TRANSITION PLAN	It is obvious such changes will not come in one release, nor that we are going to alter or remove existing structures without prior and sufficient warning.	As such our plan is to:	Progressively cut functionalities from existing structures. This would match new structures arrival that provide an overlapping gameplay. For instance, deploying the new Assembly Arrays would cause existing Starbases and Outposts to lose their manufacturing bonuses at first, then their manufacturing capability.	Give ample time for players to evacuate their assets from existing structures and adapt to the changes.
39	english	 	 Dedicated to intelligence gathering.	Service module possibilities: Being able to increase, decrease or block Star Map filters in the solar systems they’re deployed, act as solar system wide D-scan blockers, disrupt ship intelligence in the solar system, take over player tracking capabilities from NPC agents or be able to affect or pinpoint cloak users. We are considering basing their effectiveness through a network coverage (like cell phones) so that a single one may not be that useful, but maintaining a bunch of them in space could give a significant advantage.	Rigs possibilities: anything affecting the duration or effectiveness of what’s mentioned above.	F.      Gates	Structures specialized toward movement in general.	Service module possibilities: Being able to affect warp speed in a solar system (positively or negatively), affect jump capabilities for capitals, alter ship movement inside a solar system, allow vessels to travel to other solar systems and modify wormhole spawning behavior.	Rigs possibilities: anything affecting the duration or effectiveness of what’s mentioned above.	G.     Administration Hubs	Structures affecting solar system control and ownership as a whole.	Service module possibilities: territorial Sovereignty flag, modifiers to change the security status of a solar system, to change NPC agents spread in the solar system, to switch NPC faction control or NPC security forces.	Rigs possibilities: anything affecting the duration or effectiveness of what’s mentioned above.	H.     Advertisement Centers	Structures mainly aimed toward propaganda spreading.	Service module possibilities: Text advertisement, billboard replacement, being used as gigantic monuments with no purpose (except to show how big your e-peen is by showing the statue of your glorious alliance leader). Could also involve frozen corpses somehow.	Rigs** possibilities**: Anything affecting what’s above.

39	english	 	 STRUCTURE FITTING	Instead of forcing players to anchor multiple individual structures to provide basic functions, we are taking a different approach by making structures fittable, just like ships, with all the repercussions this implies. This means we can get rid of the Control Towers and greatly reduce anchoring complexity. Please note such modules will be in a different category from the ones used on ships to avoid design issues that would overcomplicate balancing as a whole.	High slots: Those structure slots will be dedicated to weapons (turrets, launchers, AoE defense mechanics), remote assistance modules (remote hull, armor and shield boosters) and various warfare linked to disruption (energy neutralizers and nosferatus, for instance).	Mid slots: Can be fitted with electronic warfare, electronic upgrades and sensor upgrade modules.	Low slots: May be used for engineering, weapon upgrades or expanded cargoholds.	Service slots: The new additions to the slot family which will only be available for structures. Some will provide station like functionalities, while most will open totally new gameplay. Examples on those are given below under the various structure roles. One point we are considering is to remove fuel requirements to online structures and move it as a requirement to operate service modules. So for instance, onlining the equivalent of a Manufacturing Array will no longer require fuel until you insert a Ship Manufacturing module into one of its service slots and start using it to produce ships.	Rigs: Will work similarly to ship rigs – they cannot be removed without being destroyed once inserted and will provide various benefits. The main difference remains in the magnitude of the given bonuses, which will be quite dramatic here. They will take over the old Outpost upgrade system as a whole, and may be several ten times (or more) more expensive than the structure hull itself. By extension, we want the new structure equivalent of Outposts to be available for high-security space, but providing less bonuses due to the reduced risk this implies. Rigs will be the means to deliver on that vision, either by having different rigs which can only be used in separate security status areas, or by having rigs bonuses change depending on its parent hull location.

41	english	 	 We would like to address some common questions which have been asked over the course of developing the SKINS feature:	Q) Why is there a lack of Caldari and Minmatar SKIN options?	A) It will require a little more time in order to address the disparity between the Amarr and Gallente versus the Caldari and Minmatar ship SKIN lines. We are aware of it and are working towards a state of greater parity.	Q) Does the skin for a T1 ship also apply to any T2 variants?	A) Unless the SKIN item specifically mentions it affects multiple ships it will only affect the ship hulls stated on the item. Therefore a Rifter Nefantar SKIN (Permanent) item will only work on a Rifter, not a Jaguar or Wolf for instance.	Q) Will SKINs follow a character if it is traded to another account?	A) Yes. Like skills, SKINs will transfer when you purchase a character from the Character Bazaar.	Q) Will the SKINs I have active be exposed in the API?	A) Yes, we plan on making that information available from the API, however it will not be available on launch.	Q) Will the active SKIN on a ship be shown in Killmails?	A) On initial release we will not be recording the active SKIN for a ship when it is destroyed. However, we do realize the rich tradition of celebrating the loss of something shiny and it is on our list for further developments in the future.	Thank you for taking the not-insubstantial time to read this dev blog, and remember to fly safe! (Especially with those skinned ships!)	See you in the comments section for this blog.

41	english	 	 TIME-LIMITED SKINS	Time-limited SKINs will drop in game and may be available through other means in the future. They work exactly like Permanent SKINs when interacting with them. The only difference is they do not last indefinitely. Time-Limited SKINs have the following properties: 	The time begins counting down as soon as the SKIN is activated. It will count down in real time from that point onwards until it expires.	If you activate a Time-Limited SKIN while you already have an active copy, it will add the specified amount of time on to the existing time left. For example: If you activated a Brutix Roden SKIN (30 Days) 2 days ago and then activate another copy today, you will have 58 days of time left with that SKIN before it expires.	Time-limited SKINs will only be for SKINs which drop in the game (We have no plans at this time to sell time-limited SKINs on the Tranquility server for Aurum.)	The reasoning for having time-limited SKINs comes down to a few factors. First, we want the SKINs you find in-game to retain their ISK value by preventing market saturation over time. By having them time-limited, we create a continuing demand for the SKIN, which keeps the loot valuable. Time-limited SKINs also allow for a number of promotional opportunities like SKIN giveaways, and possible try-before-you-buy options in the future.
41	english	 	 PERMANENT SKINS	Permanent SKINs exist as items which are bought from the NES. Once activated for a character they last indefinitely, and allow that character access to visual variants for a certain ship or collection of ships. Other characters on the same account will not have access to the SKIN.
41	english	 	 You can now buy SKINs (with Aurum) from the New Eden Store, in the Fitting screen, or the 3D Preview screen.	Before activation, each SKIN is an item which can be bought and sold in the market (for ISK), can drop if it's in your cargo and your ship explodes, etc.	SKINs are used by activating them for a character, giving that character access to SKIN variations that the item covers.	Once activated, SKINs cannot be removed, but also cannot be destroyed (including loss of ship or pod)
41	english	 	 With Ship Paint Pilot Program, you would manufacture a custom ship by combining a blueprint of a paint pattern and a packaged version of the base ship. This meant that the paint patterns fate was locked to the fate of the ship. So for instance, if you wanted to self-destruct a bunch of Interbus Moros' instead of flying them halfway across New Eden, the paint style would go with it. 	In contrast, the new SKIN system acts much closer to the way skillbooks work in EVE. Each SKIN variant comes as a SKIN item (a licensed pattern), which you can activate for your character or sell on the market. This character then has access to the SKIN for any ships that it applies to, meaning once you lose a skinned ship, you can simply hop in to another and reapply the SKIN pattern. If your character loses their pod and dies or jump clones from one location to another they will still have access to use all their SKIN's.	So to recap:
41	english	 	 ClassRaceExisting ItemNew SkinPrice / AquisitionPreview	As an addendum, there are a few ships we would like to convert over in the future, and will be doing so in subsequent releases.	The Rattlesnake Victory Edition has some technical issues with the underlying model, but once those are sorted it will be converted to a SKIN.	The Capsule - Genolution 'Auroral' 197-variant is currently created from an implant (Genolution 'Auroral' AU-79) in a very specific and roundabout way. This will be removed in the future in favor of standardizing it with the rest of the ships as a capsule SKIN.
41	english	 	 CONVERSION LIST	The following existing ships will be converted to the new SKIN system:
41	english	 	 CONVERSION AND NEW SKIN PLANS	The general conversion plans will give you a SKIN if you had a Blueprint perviously, or a SKIN and base ship if you had a skinned ship. If you do not have the ship at the time of conversion (ex. you sold it or it was blown up) you will not receive a SKIN. The conversion process is as follows:	Skinned ships will become a base version of the same and a SKIN item for that skin will be added to the owning players redeeming queue. For example: If you have a Megathron Quafe Edition you will get a standard Megathron in the same location as the original, and 1 Megathron Quafe SKIN (Permanent) item placed in your redeeming queue.	Skin Blueprints will become a number of SKINs equal to the number or runs remaining on the blueprint. They will all be placed in the redeeming queue. For example: If you have an Abaddon Tash-Murkon Edition 10 Run Blueprint you will receive 10 Abaddon Tash-Murkon SKIN (Permanent) items in your redeeming queue.	Skinned Ships and blueprints which are located in a corporation owned location will find the new SKINs in their HQ deliveries hangar. Ships will not move.	Skin blueprints that drop in game will become time-limited SKINs that last 30 days once activated.	Pirate ships which are skinned through blueprints that drop in-game (4 destroyers, 4 battlecruisers) will become the base ship and 1 time-limited version of the SKIN.	Any special edition ships or BPCs in the market or contracts will be cancelled and refunded the ISK it cost to put them up. The ships and BPC's will then be converted over as normal.	Codes and referral packs which reference ship skins, or skin items in your redeeming queue will provide a copy of the SKIN equivalent when redeemed.	Ship skins BPCs in your redeeming queue will be converted into SKINs in your redeeming queue.	Any SKINs in general, which are given to you under this conversion will be put in your redeeming queue.	As a way to reward early adopters of the Ship Paint Pilot Program, and in preparation for the new SKIN system release, all existing skin Blueprints will no longer be purchasable from the NES as of the publication of this dev blog.
41	english	 	 THE CHARACTER SHEET	The character sheet has been updated with a new SKINs section on the sidebar. This section will show you all the potentially available SKINs in the game, and all of the SKINs you currently own, with a countdown visible for time-limited SKINs. In this section, SKINs are divided in to factions/designer categories, allowing you to see the size of your collection both overall, and for a certain faction/designer.
41	english	 	 THE 3D PREVIEW SCREEN	The 3D Preview screen (accessed by clicking on the image icon in the Show Info window) will contain a copy of the left sidebar available in the fitting window. This sidebar will function exactly the same as the fitting window, with all of the purchasing and linking options. Because it can be of any ship, the 3D preview window will also allow you to preview and purchase any SKIN on any ship. 3D previews for specific SKINs are also linked from the show info window of a specific SKIN item. Simply find the SKIN item through in the market, or linked from the SKINs tab of the show info window for the desired ship. Then click on the hexagonal SKIN icon in the upper left to bring up the 3D preview.
41	english	 	 THE FITTING SCREEN	Above: A player has the Nefantar SKIN active for their Rifter, is previewing the Krusual SKIN, and has clicked on the purchase for Aurum button for the Krusual SKIN.	The fitting screen allows you to purchase SKINs for the ship you are looking at directly from the left side menu. SKINs will always have a link to the appropriate market category for the SKIN, and they may also be purchased directly from the NES if the item is available. If there are any active time-limited SKINs the amount of time remaining will be shown beside the SKIN name.	In this location you can also preview SKINs you may want to purchase, and select your active SKIN from the list of purchased options. By clicking on a SKIN it will change the ships visuals. If the SKIN clicked on is part of the My SKINs category, this also sets that SKIN as the active one. If you wish to return the ship to its default visuals you can do so by simply de-selecting the currently active SKIN.

43	english	 	 CLOSING THE GARAGE DOOR	One final balance change that Team Five 0 has sourced from your feedback for Mosaic relates to the tactic known as “garage door cynos”. This tactic was taking advantage of starbase shield mechanics to provide for extremely safe movement of supercapital ships. After discussion internally and incorporating your feedback, we’ve decided to make changes that prevent this mechanic from allowing such safe travel. All the details and feedback can be found in this Features and Ideas thread.
43	english	 	 WARP SPEEDS	Another set of balance changes that we’ve been working on alongside feedback from the community and CSM is a set of tweaks to warp speed for battlecruisers and warp rigs.	In Mosaic we are increasing the warp speed and acceleration of all Battlecruisers by 8% to bring them in line with the rest of the ship size progression. We are also making a change to the penalties of warp rigs that will hopefully make them much more attractive to pilots who highly value the warp speed of their vessels. All warp rigs will now have a penalty to signature radius, instead of the old penalty to CPU capacity.	You can find all the details and discussion of these changes in this thread.
43	english	 	 THE CONFESSOR AND SVIPUL	In the Rhea and Tiamat releases we introduced two of the most exciting new ships EVE has seen in a very long time. The Amarr Confessor and Minmatar Svipul are the first two members in the new Tactical Destroyer class, and have the ability to change between three different tactical modes on the fly. We’ve been very happy to see players embracing this new gameplay and enjoying the ships, but we’ve also been hearing the legitimate feedback that these ships are a bit too powerful relative to their competition.	We originally announced a set of balance changes to these two ships on the o7 show earlier this month, and while those changes achieved our main goals we heard more feedback from the EVE community letting us know some of the areas in which these changes could be improved. So we’ve gone back to the design and released a new and improved version of the proposal.	Under the new design, the Confessor and Svipul will move to 4 turret slots, and gain a new +50% damage role bonus. This allows us to more effectively balance the fitting requirements of long range and short range weapons. All the details of these changes can be found in this forum thread, and we want to thank everyone who helped us improve the design with your excellent feedback so far.
43	english	 	 MORE CHANGES… LATER	Ultimately, there are more things the team would like to do with the corporation management system, like additional quality of life improvements we can implement to make dealing with roles better. High on our list would be mirroring this new functionality in the title management system, as we’re aware that many corporations use these instead of roles, but in the meantime we are helping with the work on the new sovereignty system so more improvements will have to wait for now. Rest assured that we would like to get back to this, so stay tuned for future corp work from Five 0 and toss more suggestions for us in the comments section of this blog!	This feature is now live on the Singularity test server, please log in and check it out!
43	english	 	 SEARCH FUNCTIONALITY	We also added a search field in the role management where you can search by a member name. The search widget is a new EVE UI component that gives you results from your text input in a dropdown that you can then select your results from
43	english	 	 SLIDE FROM SIDE TO SIDE	One of the corp management features our players frequently requested is the ability to see all the content of each screen in the smallest resolutions. Instead of band-aiding that by adding a side scroll feature to the content, we tilted the column headers making them vertical. The labels get cut if they exceed the header height, but you can always hover over to get a tooltip with the full text string. This change solves the scrolling problem (all the screens fit in the minimum resolution) and also helps with tightening the checkbox matrix.	Before	After
43	english	 	 ALL TOGETHER NOW!	All in all, these changes bring the total number of screens for role management down to 5 from the initial 19.
43	english	 	 HANGAR AND CONTAINER ACCESS CONTROL	Previously, in order to deal with hangars and containers you had to go through a total of 12 screens, 6 for the standard roles and 6 for the grantable variants. With roles and grantable roles merged, this number was reduced to 6. On top of that we created a checkbox matrix allowing all access controls (whether HQ, Base or Other) to be on the same screen, cutting the original 12 screens down to 1. Not only does this make assigning these controls easier, but also gives you a much clearer overview of all the access controls for a corp member.
44	english	 	 On behalf of the PLEX for GOOD Taskforce	Please note that CCP regards any scamming attempts surrounding PLEX for GOOD to be morally reprehensible, and any attempts at scamming relating to this program will be met with the harshest and swiftest action at our disposal.

45	english	 	 With these changes, the total mineral supply gained by mining out an entire Ore Prospecting Array anomaly (other than the small belts) will now more closely match the average mineral consumption across the EVE universe, allowing alliances to more easily source the bulk of their raw minerals locally for industrial activities. The relative compositions of each anomaly are slightly different, allowing each corporation or alliance to decide which best matches their personal industrial activities.	Small:

Strategic Upgrades still require at least a Jump Freighter or Freighter.	To go along with these changes we have enabled the deploying of all structures (including Starbase Control Towers) from fleet hangars, so that ships like Orcas and Deep Space Transports will have more structure deployment options.	We have also made all of the IHub upgrades manufacturable using PI materials. Blueprints are sold by the Empire Navy corporations, and the material requirements consist of Tier 4 PI Commodities and Capital Construction Parts.	More details about these changes can be found in this forum thread.

45	english	 	 **PREVIOUSLY, IN THE MOSAIC RELEASE**	Those of you who read the forums, watch the o7 show on our Twitch.tv channel, or read the Mosaic release patchnotes already know that a few important improvements were made to the Sovereignty system last week with the Mosaic deployment. I want to quickly highlight these changes here as well, to ensure that every player is completely up to date.
45	english	 	 **THE LATEST SOVEREIGNTY UI DESIGNS**	Our team is hard at work implementing the new system as well as refining the UI designs that will connect players with Sovereignty and provide them with the information they need to outplay their enemies. Keep in mind that these are work in progress images and there will be details in some of them that aren't correct or that reflect earlier versions of some designs. Here are a few UI mockups showing the latest versions of the UI design work in progress:	This image shows the updated system info panel, including icons for the three sovereignty structures and the Activity Defense Multiplier:	These mockups provide examples of the kinds of information we plan to share in tooltips for the system info panel:	(click image for a larger version)	This image shows the public show-info panel for a nullsec star system:	This image shows the summary window available to members of an alliance, helping them keep track of the status of their alliance’s sovereignty structures:	(click image for a larger version)
45	english	 	 **THE LATEST RELEASE SCHEDULE**	As we have continued to incorporate community feedback into our designs and work on implementing the new system, we have been able to further refine our anticipated deployment schedule for these updates. As we discussed with the community previously, the original estimate was deployment on our June 2nd release, with the expectation that this estimate could change as implementation continued and we received a clearer picture of what work was needed.	We now have that clearer picture and we’re ready to announce that the currently announced changes will be spread across multiple releases. As previously announced, some Sovereignty changes were deployed last week in our Mosaic release.	We are planning to release the rest of the announced features across the upcoming June 2nd and July 7th releases.	The deployment on June 2nd is called the Carnyx release, and will contain the core Entosis Link influence mechanic and the Activity Defense Multiplier mechanic, which will be connected to the enabling and disabling of station services in that first release. We also plan to release the user interface for alliances to manage their default vulnerability window and capital systems, so that they can be selected and ready to go when the rest of the features release.	The deployment on July 7th is called the Aegis released, and will contain the rest of the announced changes. The Entosis Link will be expanded to impact all Sovereignty structures, the vulnerability windows will take effect, and the constellation-wide capture events and Freeport mode mechanics will become active.	This deployment schedule is intended to ensure that we will be able to release the most polished system possible. It also allows any potential issues with the core Entosis Link mechanic to expose themselves with the comparatively low-impact station services.	As part of this schedule update, we now expect that the Singularity test server playtests of the full system will take place in June. More details will be made available as we get closer to the date. We have received quite a few signups for the playtest so far, and we’ll be keeping signups open until downtime on Friday, May 22nd. If your alliance wishes to participate in a competitive playtest of the new Sovereignty capture system on SISI this summer, have your alliance executor corp CEO character send an EVEmail to the character “CCP Fozzie” expressing your interest, as well as a rough estimate of how many players you expect to get in fleets for such a test and information on your primary timezone(s) before downtime on May 22nd. As we announced at Fanfest, the winning alliance will have their alliance name added to the description of the Entosis Link I blueprint as a permanent testament to your contribution.
45	english	 	 VULNERABILITY AND TIME ZONE MECHANICS	The designs surrounding vulnerability windows and time zones have been a major area of focus for us over recent months. Time zone safety is an absolutely critical part of any capture system in a worldwide game like EVE Online, and it is also one of the most challenging aspects of the design to get right.	Time zone safe game systems are those that allow players to determine the rough time period in which events can occur and their assets are in danger. They play two crucial roles in a game like EVE:	They prevent players from losing their stuff while they are unavoidably away from the game (work, sleep, etc). Nobody should feel the need to play the game 24/7 in order to be competitive.	They encourage players to show up at the same place at the same time, facilitating multiplayer gameplay. Playing with and outplaying other human beings is the core of EVE, and putting players in contact with each other is a big part of that. If people can fight over an asset without ever coming into contact with each other, we've lost something very valuable.	The initial design for reaching these goals was explained in the previous Sov dev blog, and we have been working with the community to improve and refine the designs from that point. We created a Sovereignty time zone mechanics survey which has been immensely helpful in collecting your feedback. As of now, the survey has received a little over ten thousand responses and we’re extremely grateful to everyone who took the time to participate, especially those of you who filled out the text answers.	We’re ready to announce two significant changes to the earlier vulnerability window design, which we believe will improve the system significantly and address the most crucial player needs expressed in your feedback.	Firstly, it will be possible for alliances to set custom vulnerability timers per structure.	 Many players have expressed concerns that the alliance-wide prime time windows will reduce their freedom to designate certain structures and/or areas for defense by certain time zones within their alliance.	Under the new version of the vulnerability window design, each alliance will still have a default prime time set, and all newly captured or deployed structures would take on that default. Once the structure is in place though, the alliance would be able to choose to separate the structure from the default vulnerability timer and set a custom timer.	Changes to the vulnerability timer of a structure will have a delay before taking effect to prevent alliances from shifting timers to dodge enemies.	This system will allow alliances to choose their level of customization. If your alliances wishes, it can keep all Sovereignty structures on the alliance default to keep management simple, or it can spread out vulnerability windows to provide content for members within many different time zones.	In addition, vulnerability windows will now scale in size based on the Activity Defense Multiplier.	This is an idea that was first suggested by Steve Ronuken at the CSM 9 Winter Summit, and has come up quite a few times since in the community feedback. In conjunction with the addition of the alliance capital systems described above, we believe that it has the potential to significantly improve the options for attacking forces in many time zones as well as reinforcing the importance of the Activity Defense Multiplier and active occupancy of Sovereignty systems.	Under the new design, the vulnerability window of each structure would get longer or shorter depending on the activity defensive multiplier of its specific system. The alliance chooses the middle of the window and the window scales in size in both directions from that middle.	The length of the vulnerability window would be 18 hours divided by the activity defensive multiplier (leading to windows ranging in length from 18 hours to 3 hours). Since the timer is divided by the activity index it begins to drop fast as the activity index increases even slightly. A system with Military and Industrial each at 1 would already have shrunk its vulnerability window all the way to 8.18 hours. A system with Military 5 and Strategic 5 (quite common) would have a vulnerability window of 4 hours.	To ensure that players are not surprised by last minute changes in vulnerability windows, the length of each day's vulnerability window will be locked in at the midpoint of the vulnerability window the day before.	Combined, we believe that these updates to the Sovereignty design represent significant improvements that will help ensure that we get the best possible system this summer. Team Five 0 wants to once again express our sincere thanks to every member of the community who has provided us with reasoned feedback.
45	english	 	 ACTIVITY DEFENSE MULTIPLIER MECHANICS	The Activity Defense Multiplier is the mechanic that provides defensive advantages from active occupancy of a star system. This is the key mechanic through which we hope to achieve the goal of making unused space easy to conquer and heavily used space hard to conquer.	As described in the last Sov dev blog, this multiplier will be obtained through the existing Sovereignty system indices (Military, Industrial and Strategic), which together will form a collected defensive multiplier.	In-universe, this mechanic represents an advanced AI built into the Sovereignty structures that uses behavioral profiling to determine the difference between benign network access and dangerous intrusions. The more normal baseline activity in the system, the more data available for this AI to use in its intrusion detection system, minimizing system vulnerability and slowing hostile influence.	In practice, the Activity Defense Multiplier slows down the rate of hostile Entosis Link capture for all Sovereignty structures within the star system and all their associated command nodes, allowing defenders more time to respond to attacks and providing a major advantage to the defender when competing in a capture event.	We are making a number of changes to the original designs that increase the effectiveness and importance of this Activity Defensive Multiplier. We believe that these changes will go a long way towards improving the defensive options for alliances that make use of their space and avoid over-extending.	The first significant update to the design is a 50% increase in the maximum activity defense multiplier, from 4x to 6x.	This change allows for much stronger defense of actively used systems, while still ensuring that defenders must undock and actively fight for their space when threatened.	This new cap for the multiplier means that disabling a station service with the Entosis Link would require between 5 minutes and 30 minutes of uncontested linking depending on the system activity level (under the old cap the range was 5-20 minutes) and reinforcing a structure or capturing a hostile command node would take between 10 and 60 minutes of uncontested linking (as opposed to the previous range of 10-40 minutes).	This higher multiplier is especially powerful during the capture events, where the defenders can capture command nodes up to 6x faster than the attackers if they have maximum activity. This allows much more powerful asymmetric warfare for smaller, determined defenders fighting larger attackers, and forces the invader to further split their forces to keep up with the node capture rates of an active defender.	We are also planning to allow multiple paths to reach the activity defense multiplier cap.	One piece of feedback we’ve seen since the reveal of the initial designs is that a cap that matches the top level of all three indices can feel a bit too punishing, as reaching the cap would require the owners of a star system to be equally active in both NPC killing and mining. Ensuring that the cap is reachable without maximum levels of all three indices allows players to play to their strengths and interests without being punished. This also has the effect of increasing the multiplier of the average system, further increasing defender advantage.	With these new changes, the contribution towards the Activity Defense Multiplier for each level of system indices is increased significantly, and the final result is capped at 6x.	The new version of the table listing the bonus provided by the system indices is:	To determine the full bonus applied to each owned structure, find the appropriate value of your current level in each of the three indices and add them together, then add the base value of 1. If the final result is above 6, cap it at 6. The speed at which attackers reinforce or capture structures or command nodes is then divided by that result.	We’ve also created a new version of the example table from the last blog:	You’ll notice that the defensive benefits obtained from all of the system indices have been increased significantly.	The fairly achievable goal of having a Strategic Index of 5, one of Military or Industrial at 5 and the other at 3 is enough to reach the new cap of 6x.	We are also introducing a new mechanic to help alliances defend their home staging systems: designated alliance “capital” systems.	This feature is designed specifically to address the fact that major staging systems are often singularly unsuitable locations for mining or ratting. These systems tend to be some of the busiest in Nullsec space, with many pilots docked and in space, very active markets and strong industrial operations. However they also tend to attract too much attention to make excellent PVE systems, and our first generation Activity Defense Multiplier system will not include contributions from typical capital system activity such as trading and manufacturing. We hope to work towards including these factors in future iterations of the Activity Defense Multiplier mechanic, but in the meantime we need an effective way for alliances to defend their staging systems.	Under this system, each alliance will be able to designate one system as their “capital”. The system they choose must already have an active Territorial Control Unit belonging to their alliance and when changing capitals, the bonuses in the new capital will not take effect for several days. This is intended to prevent alliances from shifting their capitals rapidly to react to invasions or to stabilize newly captured territory.	The capital system for each alliance will provide a flat +2 addition to the Activity Defense Multiplier of all Sovereignty structures owned by that alliance within that system. The cap of 6x multiplier still applies. This allows capital systems to hit the activity multiplier cap much more easily, even in systems that are not particularly safe ratting or mining locations.	If the bonus on this feature is too high there would be danger of alliance intentionally splitting just to get more capital systems, but we currently think that a +2 to the multiplier in a single system isn't so strong that it will push people too hard in that direction. We're of course interested feedback from the community on this feature. If people start abusing this feature by splitting alliances to gain large numbers of capital systems, we will not hesitate to reduce or even remove the bonus.
45	english	 	 250km range	Fitting requirements: 100 PWG, 10 CPU	500 Capacitor per cycle (4.166 cap/s)	Consumes 1 unit of Strontium Clathrates per cycle	More details about the Entosis Link module mechanics as well as the design goals for the module can be found in this forum thread.
45	english	 	 ENTOSIS LINK MODULE MECHANICS	While the basic mechanics and gameplay goals for the Entosis Link were clear in our original dev blog, we were intentionally vague about many details in that document. We then asked the EVE Community to participate in helping us design the ideal Entosis Link details, primarily in the Features and Ideas forum. We received a lot of great feedback in that thread, and together with the EVE community we have put together a much more detailed set of information about the Entosis Link module itself.	So that we’re all on the same page, I’ll spend a little time going over some of the key goals that we are working towards with the Entosis Link module design:	**As much as possible, the Entosis Link capture progress should reflect which group has effective military control of the grid.**	At its core, the Entosis Link mechanic is a way for the server to tell who won (or is winning) a fight in a specific location. The best way to win a structure or command node with the Entosis Link should be to gain effective control of the grid by simultaneously keeping your forces alive and eliminating your opponents. It’s expected that many fights over structures or nodes should go through a potentially extended period where the grid is effectively contested between multiple sides, and where the capture progress remains paused until one side or another has taken critical losses.	This goal would be broken if certain types of forces could somehow just ignore enemies (for instance, through overwhelming remote repair or through evasion) or if mechanics pushed fights towards indefinite deathless stalemates. This goal is the reason for most of the special restrictions and limitations on the Entosis Link, such as the “no remote reps” rule.	**The Entosis Link itself should have the minimum possible effect on what ships and tactics players can choose.**	Entosis Links will always have some effect on the types of ships and tactics people find viable for Sov warfare, but we should strive to keep those effects to a minimum. As much as possible, we should work towards a prevailing metagame where whatever fleet concept would win the fight and control the grid would also be viable for using the Entosis Links. 	This also means that we don't want to be using the Entosis Links to intentionally manipulate ship use. We've seen some people suggesting that we restrict Entosis Links to battleships, command ships or capital ships in order to buff those classes. Using the Entosis Link mechanics to artificially skew the metagame in that way is not something we are interested in doing.	This goal is why we intend to use the lightest touch possible when working towards the first two goals. It would be easy to overreact to potentially unwanted uses of the Entosis Link by placing extremely harsh restrictions on the module, but we believe that by looking at the situation in a calm and measured manner we can find a good balance.	**The restrictions and penalties on the Entosis Link should be as simple and understandable as possible.**	This is a fairly obvious goal but I do think it's worth stating explicitly. If we can achieve similar results with two different sets of restrictions and penalties, we'll generally prefer to use the simpler and more understandable set. This also means that we'd generally prefer to use pre-existing mechanics that players will already be familiar with, rather than using completely new mechanics.	We announced this information in a forum thread in the Features and Ideas section, and we’re reprinting it here for visibility.	The most current design details for the Entosis Link Module are:	High Slot module with a limit of one per ship	Requires a target lock on the structure to have any impact	While the module is active, your ship is unable to cloak, warp, dock, jump or receive remote assistance. There is no way to get rid of the module penalties early except for losing your ship	The first cycle of the module is always a "warmup cycle" and has no impact. If you lose lock or the module is disabled for any reason, you'll need to go through that warmup cycle again before you can continue exerting any influence over the structure	Other than that warmup cycle, the cycle time of the module does not impact how long it takes to capture a structure. Once you're past the warmup cycle all that matters is that your module stays active	Capital ships have a role penalty that increases the module cycle time by 5x	Consumes Strontium Clathrates as fuel for each cycle	The Entosis Link comes in two distinct variations: Tech 1 and Tech 2.

46	english	 	 THE END	And that’s it for now, we hope this answers a few of the questions you may have had, and most likely add a lot more into the fray. Please remember we still are at the beginning of the development process and many more Dev Blogs are due to come at a later date.

While Citadel structures are specialized in repelling attacks (through specific bonuses and attributes), keep in mind most structures will be able to fit defensive options--if they have enough slots and fittings of course.	With that in mind, let’s have a look at what we are planning so far for defensive modules. Also remember this remains work in progress and is susceptible to change.
46	english	 	 FIRE ZE MISSILES	We have established Citadels need to be able to take care of themselves in a fight.
46	english	 	 Available in High-sec	Variations
46	english	 	 Available on sizes
46	english	 	 Structure Doomsday Weapon	The Doomsday weapon will only be available on the X-Large structure, and have a similar purpose to the ones installed on Titans. However, it will have extra capabilities next to its ship counterpart to compensate for the single, static nature of the structure on the field.	For instance, we are considering a weapon that bounces off multiple times after hitting its main target, a bit like another weapon we’ve shown in the past.
46	english	 	 Point Defense Batteries	This particular module will be similar to a smartbomb – by doing a certain amount of area of effect damage to anything close to the structure. As they are intended to clear drones or small deployable clutter near the structure undock points, they will have a constant damage but low reach.	This will only be available for large and X-Large structures and cannot be used in high-security space.
46	english	 	 Electronic Warfare	Structures will be able to fit their specific variations of Electronic Warfare modules we all know and love. They include, but are not limited to: ECM, remote sensor dampening, stasis webifiers, tracking disruptors, target painters and warp disruption. We are considering the introduction of area of effect variations of those modules later on.	Single target modules will be available for all sizes and locations, while AoE effects will most likely be restricted by size and security status.
46	english	 	 Drone and Fighters	We are planning for structure to have drones as of one of their available weapon systems. Number and various bonuses given are going to vary depending on the structure type and size – larger ones could be focused towards fighter and fighter-bombers instead of regular drone for instance, but this is pretty much open at this point.
46	english	 	 Two variations exist:	The first with a  short cycle and small drain amount, again aimed for sub-capital targets.	Another with a very long cycle and large drain amount intended to be used against capital ships.
46	english	 	 Energy Neutralizers	Energy Neutralizers are part of the utility high-slot suite of defensive modules and drain capacitor from the targeted ships. Their effect works exactly in the same manner as their ship module counterparts. They remain available for L and X-L structures.
46	english	 	 Single Target Weapons	They are either going to be turrets or missiles (or maybe even a combination of both) which can be fitted in M, L and X-L structures, but only exist in 2 variations based on their role. Unlike ship weapons, they will not exist in multiple sizes themselves – we’ve investigated that option but felt it was not worth the small variety it brought next to the extensive design, technical and skill training costs.	One long range weapon, primarily meant to take down large and slow ships, like battleships or capitals. Can be fitted with ammunition that reduces range but increases damage proportionally.	One short-medium range weapon, best at taking down smaller threats, but doing considerably less damage. Can be fitted with ammunition that reduces range but increases application proportionally.	They are going to require a new line of skills to operate, but most likely use existing gunnery and / or missile support skills. More details as we get them.	Launcher With Area of Effect Missiles	This particular weapon type is going to revive the torpedoes of old since they release an AoE blast on impact. They are meant to be particularly effective against fleets that cluster together.	They can be fitted in L and X-L structures only and be loaded with blast charges aimed to either take down slow and large ships or small and fast ones.	An extra option is to use energy draining missiles which make them work like targeted bombs.	Please note this launcher won’t be available for high-security space structures since they make no distinction between friends or foes.
46	english	 	 CAPTURE THE FLAG	As mentioned during the last blog, we also have given some more thought on how players will be able to take structures out.	Small structures, which are going to assimilate existing deployables, cargo containers and mobile warp disruptors will still be able to be directly shot by players. Some exceptions may be kept around for the time being, like the Mobile Depot having a reinforcement timer on their own.	Medium, Large and X-Large structures will use a version of the Sovereignty capture mechanic, which means they will only be attacked through the use of the Entosis module. Please refer to this blog for more information on how that works and this blog for an update to those plans for this summer’s Carnyx and Aegis releases and beyond.	Some details will vary however, as our needs aren’t exactly identical:	Unlike existing Outposts, nothing is to prevent us from having the new structures destroyed after a successful Entosis capture.	Those structures will use the same principles of vulnerability and reinforced states from the Sovereignty overhaul. The structure can only be attacked by Entosis modules when it is vulnerable, and is invulnerable when reinforced. The difference between normal and reinforced modes remains that penalties may be applied to the structure in the latter case (like jobs stopping for instance). The number of vulnerable and reinforced states depends on the size, role and importance of the structure being attacked.	Example: Capturing a Large Citadel structure could require attackers to go through 3 vulnerability phases before it is destroyed, while a Medium Observatory Array may only require 2.	While the capture of X-Large structures will require the use of Command Nodes just like Outposts, the various timers and mechanics fine tuning will vary depending on the structure balancing.	Scooping a structure will require it to be offlined first. Offlining a structure will immediately put it into a vulnerability window (to avoid players bypassing the timer altogether). If a structure already was in a vulnerability mode while being offline, the duration will be refreshed to its full value.	Example: A structure vulnerability window lasts for 2 hours. Offllining the structure will immediately put it into a 2 hours vulnerability window. If the structure only had 1 hour of vulnerability window left when being offlined, the window will go back to 2 full hours.	Structures will drop fitted modules through the same loot mechanic than ships, but corporate and personal stored items inside them will not be affected – this will be handled through asset safety mechanic which we quickly explained in the previous Dev Blog and shall be more extensively tackled in a later blog.	Destroyed structures will leave wrecks which can be salvaged just like ships. What they contain will most likely be some of their built materials although this is still highly speculative at this point in the design process.	Structures having a solar system wide-effect or otherwise impacting some kind of area will be publicly visible in space and in the overview like standard celestials. The same principle applies to structures that the pilot is allowed to interact with.	Example: an alliance member having sufficient roles to interact with an Assembly Array will see it displayed in space / overview. A neutral pilot will not see it there however.	All structures will show on D-scan, can be probed, and will be scannable to see their fittings and contents. We are also thinking of having them visible and directly warpable from the on-board scanner to preserve Wormhole space gameplay.	Below is a visual representation on how such capture process would look:
46	english	 	 We will spare you the endless debates, bartering sessions and casualty reports coming out after locking two dozen EVE developers in various meeting rooms and go straight to the point: we have decided to start with Market and Office Hubs, but with a twist.	Since we like giving you a place you can call home and collectively interact with, be it for cooperative or competitive needs, this role is ideal to start with. At the same time we want to achieve much more than just adding a fresh coat of paint on existing structures. We want to develop their use in the EVE universe and develop excitement as a whole.	 “Market and Office Hubs” sounds a little bland, like another day at the office dealing with a grumpy boss and an unreliable coffee machine. How about we spice that up a little bit?	Of all the structures, we want these to be the most dedicated to asset safety, protection, and a feeling of home – just like when you are tucked inside your bed sheets while the elements rage outside. At your coziest you should be fortified in giant bunkers equipped with mega death rays to weather the storm.	As such, we are slightly changing the purpose of the Market and Office Hubs structures and renaming them “Citadels” to give a better approximation of what they do (note: I initially wanted to have them called “space châteaux” but got rejected by a team full of damn barbarians who don’t know what good French taste is).	In time they will still retain the other functionality mentioned (Market, corporation offices, cloning, insurance, character customization, Customs Office and potentially Interbus), as we release new service modules.	CCP Nag and CCP Maximum Cats have scattered a few concept arts for the Citadel structures within this dev blog for you to feast your eyes upon. As usual, please remember those are still work in progress and may not represent final look.

46	english	 	 FIRST STRUCTURE TYPE: CITADEL CLASS	Since the scope of a full structure overhaul is larger than the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, we had to play smart and focus our efforts into one structure role at a time instead of crossing the streams everywhere.	There is difficulty involved in picking which one of those roles to start with. Since the first structure we release is going to require core mechanics to work, like fittings, deployment or even management, we need to make sure the foundation is solid while still delivering an interesting package for players to enjoy. When that is out of the way, it will significantly speed up development time for more advanced structure roles that have their own new mechanics but still require the core gameplay listed above.	You may remember the structure roles from our previous Dev Blog for being:

48	english	 	 EVE Universe Community Manager	On behalf of the PLEX for GOOD Taskforce
48	english	 	 CCP Falcon
48	english	 	 (click to enlarge)	From everyone here at CCP Games, we offer our most sincere thanks and profound gratitude for the astonishing level of support you all show for PLEX for good.
48	english	 	  	(click to enlarge - Photos courtesy of Arnar Valdimarsson - CCP ArnarV)	Both the Icelandic Red Cross and the President wish to express their most profound thanks to our community for the incredible generosity that has been shown. The President also remarked that the EVE community is a shining example of multi-national crowdsourced fundraising for charity, and that more games companies and online communities should follow the example set by the PLEX for GOOD program in order to assist their fundraising efforts.	Once again, here at CCP we are finding it very difficult to choose words that express our gratitude to the EVE Community for the incredible generosity you have all shown over the course of this fundraiser. The Community Team does however have an amazing display on the windows of our office as a constant reminder of the fact that we serve what is, without a doubt, the finest gaming community on Earth.
48	english	 	  
48	english	 	 **The Check:**	Today we had the pleasure of welcoming representatives of the Icelandic Red Cross, as well as the President of Iceland to CCP Headquarters in order to hand them a check for $103,650 on behalf of the players of EVE Online:
48	english	 	 TOTAL: $470,616	This is an astonishing feat for a community the size of ours, and really shows that while EVE players may explore the in game limits of morality while they play, our amazing community has once again demonstrated its immense collective strength and capability as a force for good.	There have been some amazing stories that came out of PLEX for GOOD this time around, including an unfortunate player who was scammed out of a number of PLEX which were then directly donated to the PLEX for GOOD fund less than 10 minutes later by an individual who can only be described as the interstellar equivalent of Robin Hood.	PLEX for GOOD “Bit By Bit” hosted by Chribba has also raised an amazing amount of donations once again as a program which puts aside small amounts of ISK from individual contributors, which is then pooled to purchase PLEX as donations to PLEX for GOOD.	However, the most awesome story I personally came across was that of our largest individual donator, who gifted 700 PLEX / $10,500 / 626,500,000,000 ISK (almost 10% of the total to PLEX for GOOD).	This in itself is an immense contribution, however when we looked at this donation further and came to the realization this this player is from the Philippines, which were assisted by our last PLEX for GOOD drive after the terrible impact of Typhoon Haiyan, it became an incredibly heartwarming story of giving something back.
48	english	 	 Roughly Kr. 13,770,000 (Icelandic Krona)	This includes a $500 donation from our wonderful ISD Volunteers, as well as a donation of 365 PLEX from the PLEX for GOOD Item Auction.	In terms of donations, this is the second largest PLEX for GOOD drive that we’ve ever hosted on behalf of our community, and this brings the total that EVE players have raised for charity to almost half a million US Dollars:
48	english	 	 6910 PLEX	Roughly 575 years, 303 days of game time	Roughly 6,149,900,000,000 ISK (Interstellar Kredits) at current prices on board Jita IV- Moon 4 – Caldari Navy Assembly Plant.

49	english	 	 The final thing we would like to clarify is that lore is not something that is stopping us from using the existing SKINs we have on other ships. The two biggest factors are quality and performance as demonstrated above. Hopefully this gives you a bit of insight into where things are going and why. Our goal is to continuously be adding SKINs to the game over time. We want to offer a wide range of options for SKINs that appeal to lots of people. We aim to accomplish that using the SKINs from existing factions or corporations along with this new designer SKINs system we are working on.	Until next time,
49	english	 	 Another concern of allowing any SKIN on any ship is making Tech 1 ships resemble Tech 2 ships which would have visual gameplay implications. While deciding what SKINs to offer in the release of this feature we carefully selected SKINs for ships by making sure that if we offered a SKIN for that ship the same look was not used by its Tech 2 counterpart. This is the reason why for example there is no Sarum SKIN for the Apocalypse, as it would too closely resemble the Paladin.
49	english	 	 When it comes to SKINs we have two general types of SKINs	Here is a standard Raven battleship.	Here is the same Raven with the Lai Dai SKIN.	Here is the Raven with the Kaalakiota SKIN which includes what we refer to as a custom mask map. That is a whole other texture as part of the material that changes where the colors on the ship goes.	We have concerns about the performance impact of having lots of different ships with different custom mask maps on them. We are pushing this a little with the new Marauders with the thought that they very rarely are seen in large fleet battles.	Tech 2 and Faction Ships
49	english	 	 Quality Assurance	While it is technically possible to put any SKIN on any ship in the game that is not how we test internally at CCP. So far we have been using existing faction SKINs which were only designed and tested for a single race of ships. Even then those SKINs don't necessarily work across the whole race. It is fairly common that SKINs will break when going to tech 2 hulls or especially to capital hulls. For example the Moa looks amazing with the Ishukone SKIN as can be seen here.	However when that same Ishukone SKIN is applied to the Wyvern it no longer looks like an Ishukone SKIN. While it could be argued as to how good it looks, the bottom line is it doesn't look like an Ishukone SKIN.	In the above image the Wyvern has the Ishukone SKIN applied but doesn't get the gold to black fade that is a signature feature of the Ishukone SKIN. This isn't just a capital ship issue either. Here is the Ishukone SKIN on an Abaddon, which again doesn't look like an Ishukone SKIN.	Again it's missing that fade from black to gold. Further there are issues where sometimes you just get things completely broken such as in the case of the Ore SKIN on the Revelation.	Those black spots on the Revelation shouldn't be there and are not part of the SKIN. They are the pure black we render when missing parts of a material for the ship. Or even more subtly the Sanctuary SKIN on the Venture results in these black areas that should not be there.	The bottom line however is that each SKIN we put out is tested and tweaked to make sure that the quality level we strive for in EVE is always there. We are extremely dedicated to making sure that we hit a certain quality bar for the art in EVE.	Performance
49	english	 	 WHY NOT USE EXISTING SKINS?	There have been some questions regarding the SKIN system and why we don't just let players put any SKIN on any ship. Here are a few of the reasons.
49	english	 	 THE FUTURE	OK great, new Marauder and SOE SKINs! What about the future though? What else is coming later this year? We have begun working on what we call "designer SKINs" made by corporations or people in New Eden that are setup for the sole purpose of designing dramatic or unique looking SKINs. Right now every SKIN is tied to a single corporation or faction and follows their design philosophy. These designer SKINs help give us a bit more freedom in that we don't have to try and tie each SKIN to an existing corporation or create a new corporation for each SKIN we want to make. With that in mind we are aiming to have four new designer SKINs out this summer. Two for Minmatar and two for Caldari as those two empires have the least number of SKINs available right now.	Here are some concepts that our art director has come up with. These will likely not be what we end up releasing but should hopefully give you an idea of what we are considering doing.	Again these are just concepts but we are aiming to ship some form of the new designer SKINs this summer. The end result of this new designer SKINs system is that we will be able to ship
50	english	 	 FIRE ZE MISSILES!	Let’s start with a package of missile-related balance changes.	First of all, we are introducing two entirely new module groups to enhance performance of all missile systems in the game.	Missile Guidance Enhancers – these are passive, low slot modules that give bonuses to missile velocity, missile flight time, explosion radius of missiles, and explosion velocity of missiles.	Missile Guidance Computers – these are active, scriptable, mid slot modules that give bonuses to missile velocity, missile flight time, explosion radius of missiles, and explosion velocity of missiles. Using ‘Missile Precision Script’ or ‘Missile Range Script’ you can double the bonus to either range or application, sacrificing the other.	For both module groups we are starting with a Tech I variation, a ‘Compact’ meta variation with reduced fitting requirements, and a Tech II variation. You can find details on their statistics in this forum thread.	The second change, which has been requested ever since the Great Drake Nerf of 2012, is a direct buff to Heavy Missile Damage.	All heavy missile damage will be increased by 5%.	We don’t necessarily expect Drakes and Tengus to once again blot out the sky, but, it may provide some more viability to certain hulls and also grant some more interesting choices between Heavy Missile Launchers and Rapid Light Launchers, especially when combined with Missile Guidance Modules.	And lastly, for missiles, we are going to reduce the volume of all Torpedoes by half. This means you can fit twice as many torpedoes in your launchers before having to reload and also frees up some cargo space.	Now, let’s tranision from making missiles better to making drones a little worse:	Even though we have chipped away at the Ishtar’s power, and even though it’s popularity does seem to be in decline, it’s still pushing around twice as much pvp damage as other top tier ships so we don’t feel too bad going for one final tweak to it.	In Aegis we will be making the following changes to the Ishtar:	One mid slot removed, one low slot added	Power grid lowered from 780 to 740	Mass decreased from 1,100,000 to 1,060,000	Velocity decreased from 185m/s to 175m/s	Agility increased from .52 to .56	Overall this should lead to a huge decrease in power for the vastly more popular shield fits, and especially for those using 100mn afterburners.	We’ve done a lot of talking about the Ishtar in the last few months, but drone bonused ships in general have been performing extremely well. The Gila, Dominix, Tristan, Vexor, Vexor Navy Issue, and Stratios all make top lists for usage and damage in their respective classes. For this reason, in Aegis we will also be making a small nerf to all Drone Damage Amplifiers.	You can find the details of that change in this forum thread.	We were looking into a set of Battleship and Battlecruiser changes as well, but unfortunately we had to delay most of that pass until a later release. One of the intended adjustments will make its way into Aegis though, a nice buff for the Tempest.	The Tempest’s Minmatar Battleship bonus to rate of fire will increase from 5% per level to 7.5% per level.	And to finish things up, let’s not forget the best flying wing to be invented since Kit Cloudkicker’s ride in Tailspin, the Hecate.	Here is some of what CCP Fozzie has to say about this little monster, “With 5 turrets and a 5% RoF bonus, the Hecate enjoys 10 effective turrets, one more than the Confessor and Svipul. It is also the first T3 destroyer with an active tanking bonus. Since both the damage bonus and the active tank bonus come in the form of RoF reductions, capacitor will be a definite challenge for the Hecate and cap boosters should be common.”	If you want to know more, check out this forum thread!	That’s all for now! Fly safe and we’ll see you next time.	@CCP_Rise
51	english	 	 Fidelas Constans: 7	In a future release we will be listing all the competing alliances in the description of the Entosis Link I BPO, with a special mention for PL as the most successful testers.	We have also drawn four of these five alliances for another special honor, having meta variations of the Entosis Link named after them. The winners of this draw were selected with Chribba’s dice. All the details on how this selection process was executed can be found in this forum post.	The default naming convention for the new Entosis Link variations will be to include the alliance ticker of the winning alliances as the “flavor” name. We will be open to considering alternate suggestions from the winning alliances, but those suggestions will be subject to approval by CCP’s development team and will only be accepted if we determine that the names fit into the EVE universe. Direct references to other intellectual property will not be accepted for obvious reasons. You know who you are.	The alliances drawn for the module naming are:	Pandemic Legion, Spectre Fleet, No Not Believing, and Affirmative.	We’ll be in touch with your team captains and alliance executors to discuss the details.	Thanks once again to everyone who participated on Duality so far, and remember that Duality remains open for people to keep trying out the new system right up until release.	Thanks for taking the time to read this update blog, and I hope it’s been informative. We’ll be continuing our communication over the next week as we prepare to launch this huge revamp of EVE’s Sovereignty capture system on July 14th. We have one more blog full of announcements coming later this week, and after release we will be continuing our iteration on Nullsec and Sovereignty with help from your feedback. Huge thanks to everyone who has provided us with your feedback so far!	From all of us at Team Five 0 and Team Pirate Unicorns, fly safe!
51	english	 	 Affirmative.: 22

51	english	 	 Spectre Fleet Alliance: 40
51	english	 	 Pandemic Legion: 198
51	english	 	 The final scores are:
51	english	 	 DUALITY PLAYTEST	For the past few weeks we have opened the Duality test server with an in-development version of the new sov system so that players could try it out and help us refine the user experience and find bugs. We also put together a playtest competition in which Alliances could fight over Sovereignty of a region to gain bragging rights and cosmetic rewards. We want to express our thanks to every player who has taken the time to log onto Duality and help submit bug reports and feedback on the new system. You’ve all been a huge amount of help.	We want to congratulate all the Alliances who fought for Providence on Duality over this last month.	The final score for each alliance is obtained by adding one point for each of the three core Sovereignty structures (TCU, IHub, and Station) that they control within the competition area.	Fourteen alliances entered the competition and were each given a starting constellation within Providence or Catch. When all was said and done five alliances remained.	Every alliance that participated in the playtest will have their name added to the description of the Entosis Link I blueprint original, as notable capsuleer alliances that led the way in discovering visionary applications of the new technology.
51	english	 	 SOV STRUCTURE DEPLOYMENT PROCESS	For those players who have not yet had a chance to try out the new system on the Duality test server, we also want to go over some of the details around deploying structures in the new system. This information can also be found in the show-info window for the Sov structures, but we want to make sure the maximum number of people see it.	In the new Sovereignty system we are largely doing away with the launch/anchor/online process inherent in the older style of EVE structures. Instead, TCUs and IHubs will use the newer spacecomponent deployment system, and will feel quite similar to the mobile structures introduced in recent years.	Both TCUs and IHubs will now need to be deployed at planets. Their location restrictions will actually mirror those of Customs Offices. They must be no closer than 350km from the planet and no further than the distance from the planet to the warpin point plus 1000km. Existing TCUs will be grandfathered in and won’t need to be moved, but any newly deployed TCUs will now need to be placed at planets.	Only one TCU and one IHub may exist in space in each system at one time. This means that if there is already a copy of that structure somewhere in the system you will receive an error when you attempt to launch your structure. Both TCUs and IHubs are now globally visible on overviews everywhere in the system, so you’ll never have trouble finding existing sov structures.	Only characters that belong to an Alliance will be able to deploy a TCU and/or IHub, although no corporation roles will be required.	You may deploy the TCU or IHub through the right click menu, radial menu, or by simply dragging the structure from your inventory into space. Once deployed into space, the TCU or IHub will exist in a neutral state, owned by the Secure Commerce Commission NPC corp. To complete the claim process you must activate an Entosis Link on the neutral structure to capture it for your Alliance. This means that the process of getting an active TCU or IHub into space will be much faster under the new system (total time will be about 12-15 minutes instead of 2-8 hours under the old system). However the process now requires that ships remain on grid for those minutes and other players can challenge your claim and attempt to capture the structure themselves.	When TCUs and IHubs are first launched into space, they will automatically find an appropriate location nearby to anchor themselves. They will always deploy on a spot at the center of a grid (in the same way that starbases deploy to the center of the grid when anchored) to reduce the chance of grid conflicts near the structure. They will also automatically find another suitable nearby location if their first location overlaps with ships or other items. This means that when a TCU or IHub launches it may appear quite a ways away from the ship that launched it.	The deployment process of Outposts will remain largely the same for this release. Deploying a new Outpost will still require your Alliance to have an active TCU in the system, and the outpost creation process will still require the same platform filling procedure. Team Game of Drones is hard at work on the system that will replace this process in the future.	Once you have successfully captured the Sovereignty structure, ownership will transfer to the executor corporation of your Alliance. Infrastructure Hubs will create a new maintenance bill for the executor corp, with a 24 hour grace period before the first payment is required. TCUs will no longer have any bills under the new system. If bills for Infrastructure Hubs expire before they are paid, the structure will automatically self-destruct. Directors in the corporation that own the structure (executor corp for newly claimed/captured structures) can transfer ownership to other corporations within their alliance using the right click menu on the structure when there are no outstanding bills.	When a corporation leaves an Alliance, all Sovereignty structures belonging to that corporation will transfer their ownership to the executor corporation.	To ensure that anyone starting a Sovereignty capture event will also be able to complete the process, characters must be in a valid capsuleer Alliance in order to activate an Entosis link directly onto a TCU, IHub or Station. This restriction does not apply to Station Services.
51	english	 	 ALLIANCE VULNERABILITY TIMER SETTINGS	As many of you already know, the ability to set your Alliance default vulnerability timer has been available in game since the Carnyx release on June 2nd. So far this setting has only pre-loaded the value in the database in preparation for the next Sov release, but on July 14th it will begin applying to all Sovereignty structures belonging to your alliance. This means it is very important for every sov-holding alliance to choose an appropriate vulnerability timer before the 14th to ensure that their structures match their alliance’s primary time zone.	The setting can be found on Tranquility right now within the Corporation window, Alliances tab, and Home subtab. Characters with director roles in the Alliance executor corporation can edit the vulnerability timer by clicking on the cogwheel on the right. The image below displays where this setting can be accessed.	Sovereignty structures belonging to Alliances that have not chosen a default vulnerability timer will have their vulnerability windows automatically centered on 11:00 EVE Time (downtime).
51	english	 	 Single system Alliance Capitals	The one exception to the 7 day waiting period for Capital systems is that anytime an Alliance only has Sovereignty over one star system (as determined by TCUs) that one system will automatically become the Alliance capital. This means that Alliances taking their first system will not need to wait a week to gain the benefits of the Capital system defensive bonuses. It also ensures that when an Alliance is pushed to a final stand in its last system, that system will always gain the capital defensive benefits.	Any other changes to Capital systems will always require 7 days in order to take effect. This includes cases where an Alliance that controls multiple systems has lost its previous capital and is setting a new one.
51	english	 	 CAPITAL SYSTEMS	Quick Capital selection for the first two days after release	Starting immediately after the July 14th downtime, Alliances will be able to designate one of their systems as an Alliance Capital. In order to allow Alliances to gain the benefits of their capital quickly after deployment, we plan to make all capital system selection and changes apply very quickly (as close to instantly as possible given server limits) for the first two days after deployment. This means that between downtime on July 14th and downtime on July 16th Alliances will be able to set their capitals and change it as often as desired with no waiting period. Once downtime on July 16th has passed, changes to Capital system settings will require 7 days to take effect.
51	english	 	 Sovereignty Blockade Units	SBUs do not play a role in the new system, and will begin to be phased out this month. During the patch downtime all SBUs in space will be destroyed, and SBU blueprints will be rendered inert. Any new SBUs launched into space after patch day will explode one minute after appearing in space.	At the same time, we will begin the process of phasing out SBUs and their blueprints from the game. NPC buy orders will appear for SBUs and un-researched SBU blueprints so that players can choose to recoup some of the value of their SBU stock at their own pace. After a few months of voluntary buyback we plan to convert all SBUs to TCUs, SBU blueprints to TCU blueprints, and remove the legacy market entries for these types.	Excess Territorial Claim Units and Infrastructure Hubs in Space	Under the new system, only one TCU and one IHub will be allowed in space per system. As part of this transition, on the patch downtime any TCU or IHub that is in space but not in an online state will be destroyed. This will ensure that only one TCU and one IHub per system will remain. We advise all Alliances to ensure that their IHubs are online before the release downtime on the 14th.	Structures that are reinforced or vulnerable as the patch downtime begins	In order to prevent unnecessary confusion and complication on patch day, all Infrastructure Hubs, Stations and TCUs that are in reinforced, vulnerable and/or damaged states will be reset to full health and full owner control over the patch downtime. This means that a sov structure that has a reinforcement period straddling the patch downtime will no longer be reinforced after the patch deployment is completed. If the structure’s normal vulnerability period (as determined by the combination of your Alliance’s vulnerability timer and the system’s Activity Defense Multiplier) extends over the time of the server startup, the structure will begin in a vulnerable state with 100% control by its owning alliance. Otherwise the structure will begin in a secure state and become vulnerable at the beginning of its next vulnerability period.	Any stations that are owned by corporations outside of an Alliance during the patch downtime will immediately enter a Freeport reinforcement period for approximately 48 hours from the server startup point.	In order to keep the disruption for ongoing sovereignty warfare to a minimum, we are not currently planning any other “sov invulnerability period” after the patch (beyond the one time removal of reinforcement states over the patch downtime).
52	english	 	 2018-02-13 - BY CCP FALCON	Patch Notes For February 2018 Release
52	english	 	 These changes consist of:	A significant decrease in the spawn rate of direct Nullsec to Nullsec wormhole connections (which are not the primary method of WH roaming travel but are some of the hardest connections to counter with defensive play).	Small decreases in the spawn rate of random Null -> C5 and C5 -> Null connections. This change does not affect static connections.	A decrease in the lifetime of Nullsec WH connections to 16 hours (most were previously 24 hours).	We are also making some slight tweaks to the Quantum Flux Generator system upgrade in our July 14th release. These are intended as a slight buff to anyone who uses Quantum Flux Generators for PVE daytripping, while also addressing concerns expressed by some CSM members. With these changes we still don’t expect that most alliances will find the Quantum Flux Generators to be extremely valuable, but hopefully their PVE value should increase somewhat.	All of the July 14th PVE changes are available for testing on our Duality test server right now! They’ve actually been there for a while but we felt it was a pretty safe assumption that nobody was going to spend their time ratting on the test server without being informed about the changes first.
52	english	 	 NULLSEC AND LOWSEC INCURSION CHANGES	Back in the Hyperion release last year, we made some changes to Vanguard Incursion sites in Nullsec and Lowsec. We increased the maximum number of pilots allowed in the fleet before hitting diminishing returns by 50%. These changes were intended to help stimulate activity in Nullsec (and by association lowsec) incursions by allowing pilots in the more dangerous space to bring more DPS ships to compensate for their less blingy hardware. At the time we said that we’d be watching how those changes were received and re-evaluating down the road.	Well we’ve received positive feedback about that change from Nullsec and Lowsec Incursion runners, and we’re now ready to extend that same change to Assault, HQ and Mothership sites in Nullsec and Lowsec. This means that Nullsec Assault sites will take up to 30 players before diminishing returns, HQ sites will take up to 60 pilots, and Mothership sites will take up to 120.	We hope that these changes will be well received by Nullsec and Lowsec Incursion runners, and that more Nullsec and Lowsec pilots will give this challenging group PVE content a try.
52	english	 	 While also:	Ensuring that increases in ISK faucets stay within acceptable ranges for the overall EVE economy	Ensuring that different quality levels of Nullsec systems remain distinct and that Alliances see value in attempting to take better space	This is a tricky balance, and we will need to watch the results of our changes very carefully and be ready to make adjustments as needed. We’ve also been consulting with CCP’s research and economics experts to make use of their expertise and give us the best chance of getting this right.	In this release, we are increasing the number of guaranteed anom spawns provided by each Pirate Detection Array level from 4 to 7. This means that a fully upgraded system will have 35 anomalies instead of the current 20 (a 75% increase). This allows more pilots to operate at their current levels within the same solar system, increasing potential population density.	The types of anomalies added serves as the method by which we are compressing the difference between higher truesec and lower truesec systems. The new anomalies added to the best systems will be of similar quality to the ones that already spawn there. However the new anomalies added to the lower quality systems will be significantly better on average than those available now.	As an example, a fully upgraded -1.0 system will gain the following 15 anomalies in addition to those that spawn there now:	+2 Sanctums, +3 Havens, +2 Forsaken Hubs, +4 Forsaken Rally Points, +2 Forlorn Hubs, +1 Hub, and +1 Forlorn Rally Point.	These additions allow for more players to engage in their PVE activity in the same system, but doesn’t significantly skew the average anom value.	In contrast, a fully upgraded -0.1 system would gain the following 15 anomalies in addition to those that already spawn there now:	+3 Havens, +1 Forsaken Hub, +3 Forsaken Rally Points, +2 Forlorn Hubs, +2 Hubs, +2 Forlorn Rally Points, +1 Port, and +1 Hidden Rally Point.	These new anomalies do not match the average quality of those available in the best systems, but that are much better than the average quality of the anomalies available in current -0.1 systems.	We believe that these changes have a good chance of hitting the correct balance for Nullsec without causing undue disruption to the economies in other areas of space.
52	english	 	 PIRATE DETECTION ARRAY CHANGES	By far the most important of the Sovereignty Infrastructure Upgrades is the Pirate Detection Array. This upgrade provides a constantly respawning supply of combat anomalies full of pirate NPCs to fight. These sites are a key part of the Nullsec economy, and form a huge part of the greater EVE economy. A very large proportion of the ISK that enters the EVE economy every day consists of the bounties obtained from these anomalies.	This makes the Pirate Detection Array one of the most powerful tools for adjusting Nullsec PVE opportunities, and also means that we must act with utmost caution when changing these upgrades.	For our July 14th release we are making a series of significant changes to the effects of the Pirate Detection Array upgrades, in the form of added anomaly spawns.	The goals of these changes are to:	Increase potential population density of upgraded systems	Compress the gap in system quality between higher and lower truesec systems so that lower value systems become more attractive than they are currently
52	english	 	 COMING ON JULY 14TH	On July 14th we will be deploying the next big set of Nullsec and Sovereignty changes as the second part of the Aegis release. By now most of you will be familiar with the changes to the Sovereignty capture system that are coming on the 14th (if not, check out some of the handy dev blog links at the top of this blog). We’re now unveiling another set of changes to Nullsec PVE and infrastructure upgrades coming with this July 14th release.
52	english	 	 LOOKING BACK AT MOSAIC	At Fanfest this year we announced the last round of Nullsec PVE and infrastructure updates, which were then deployed in our Mosaic release on April 28th.	These changes focused on the construction and deployment of infrastructure upgrades, as well as mining yields and values in Nullsec space.	We reduced the volumes of Infrastructure Hubs and their upgrades significantly to allow them to be deployed more easily, as well as enabling deployment of structures from fleet hangars. We also replaced NPC sell orders for Infrastructure Upgrades with blueprints that allowed capsuleer industrialists to produce the upgrades themselves, including producing them in their own Nullsec space for easier logistics.	We made three connected changes for Nullsec, Wormhole and Lowsec mining, doubling consumption of Zydrine and Megacyte, rebalancing the mineral content of the Nullsec and Lowsec ores, and completely revamping the content of the mining anomalies generated by the Ore Prospecting Array system upgrade.	We also made some tweaks to the rate of index accumulation for the Military and Industrial Sovereignty Indexes, in preparation for the Activity Defense Multipliers kicking in this July.	All the details of these Mosaic changes can be found in this previous dev blog.	We’re still keeping a close eye on mining rates and ore values in Nullsec, and the results so far are very promising. In the 10 weeks since Mosaic, approximately 20% more ore by volume has been mined in Nullsec than in the 10 weeks before Mosaic. In the same timeframe Lowsec mining has also risen by approximately 11%. So far prices for Nullsec ores are remaining robust and the Nullsec share of all mining done in EVE is approaching record levels.	At this stage it appears that these Mosaic updates have done a good job of improving the value of Nullsec mining gameplay and easing infrastructure logistics bottlenecks without causing serious problems in other areas of space. This is a balance that we are hoping to hit with our July changes as well.

Anyone attacking their structure when it is being deployed, or in its vulnerability phase will need full 30 minutes to win the entosis link contest.	For being the owners of the structure and defending it, the Daring Tartiflette Expedition™’s members will only need 10 minutes of entosis linking to defend it, or to fully remove its contested status.	Please note that if the Daring Tartiflette Expedition™ was to attack a structure belonging to another corporation in their wormhole, they would have to go through a 30 minutes entosis link timer themselves.
53	english	 	 Wormhole space
53	english	 	 The process is as follow:	A structure that is successfully attacked by an entosis link during its vulnerability window goes into reinforcement. If it was being deployed, or if that was the last vulnerability window it was capable of withstanding, the structure is destroyed instead.	A structure that is partially contested with an entosis link will delay the vulnerability or deployment timer indefinitely, until such time where the owner uses his own entosis link to remove the contested status, or an attacker chooses to fully attack it. The duration will however count toward the vulnerability or deployment timer – a structure that needs 4 hours to be deployed, but is stuck in a contested state for 5 days can be immediately deployed if the owner removes this particular status with his own entosis link.	The entosis contest time will vary depending on the location where the battle takes place and if you are attacking or defending.	High, low-sec and null-sec with full indexes
53	english	 	 ENTOSIS LINK CONTEST	Entosis links are needed to be able to attack (or defend) a structure during its deployment or vulnerability window.

53	english	 	 VULNERABLE 2 AND 3	This type of vulnerability window does not appear in a regular operation state, and is a reactionary state appearing once the structure has been set into reinforcement at least once.	Those windows automatically appear after the structure comes out of a reinforcement period.	This vulnerability window lasts indefinitely, until an attacker or defender wins the contest by using entosis links (see “entosis link contest” further below).	Except for their duration, they work exactly the same than the vulnerable 1 phase.
53	english	 	 The Mighty Bouillabaisse Conglomerate™ has a Citadel XL structure in null-security space, with full occupancy and indexes. The vulnerability window thus lasts 21 hours a week, which has been assigned by the structure owner (yellow duration below).	If a party attacks the structure with an entosis link during the vulnerability window at 15 GMT on Saturday (red box below), the reinforcement timer, which lasts 15 vulnerability hours, will end at 20 GMT on the following Tuesday (green part below).	The Citadel XL structure will thus enter its second vulnerability window at 20 GMT, next Tuesday after the initial attack. When the structure goes into reinforcement, the timer will display that date for everyone instead of doing complex math with vulnerability hours.
53	english	 	 REINFORCED 1, 2, AND 3	Structures that are successfully attacked through entosis links during their vulnerability windows go into an invulnerable mode for a specific amount of time, at the end of which another vulnerability window may occur.	Reinforcement periods exist to pause the assault and give both attacking and defending parties time to prepare for the next phase, especially if they do not operate within the same timezones.	They also serve to give penalties to the structure owner. A structure entering its first reinforcement window cannot have its fittings altered – players will still be able to refuel its various bays, fit ammunition to the various defense systems or take items in or out of its hangars, but will unable to add, remove or change fitted structure modules in any way. A structure entering its second reinforcement window will cause all industry jobs to be paused and services to go offline on top of the previous penalty. Those penalties will exist until the structure goes back into its normal operation mode (thus until defenders successfully entosis it).	Reinforcement will not require Strontium Clathrates to operate, and will be a functionality that’s always available on all structures for free.	Reinforcement timers last for a specific amount of vulnerability hours:	Unlike existing Starbase reinforcement timers, those reinforcement timers are based on vulnerability hours to operate. This is to ensure the reinforcement timer always ends during a vulnerability window, when defenders are online and committed to defend it.	Reinforcement duration may change depending on the structure type and size – larger structures may have a reinforcement timer set to half the vulnerability window, while smaller ones may have longer reinforcement timers to give owners more time to react.	Example:
53	english	 	 84 hours
53	english	 	 High-sec, low-sec, Null-sec with full occupancy	3 hours
53	english	 	 24 hours
53	english	 	 12 hours
53	english	 	 Null-sec without occupancy
53	english	 	 42 hours
53	english	 	 12 hours
53	english	 	 6 hours
53	english	 	 Wormhole space
53	english	 	 21 hours
53	english	 	 6 hours
53	english	 	 Example 2:	The Alluring Baguette Syndicate™ is a large alliance that just deployed a Citadel XL structure in null security space with a 21 hours of weekly vulnerability window (they have full occupancy and indexes). Confident of its manpower and general resources, the structure owner sets the vulnerability window to cover 3 hours each day of the week.	Current numbers for the weekly vulnerability window are set as follows and varies based on location or occupancy. Those numbers will most likely change with time.
53	english	 	 Example 1:	Soft Croissant Incorporated™ is a small 5 man corporation having a Citadel L structure in high security space with a 6 hours of weekly vulnerability window. Not being a hardcore gamer, the structure owner decides to set the vulnerability window 2 hours during Tuesday evening and 4 hours on Saturday.
53	english	 	 In more details that means:	Structures may only be attacked by entosis links during their vulnerability windows.	The duration of a vulnerable 1 window is a mandatory timer expressed on a weekly basis, whose length varies depending on the structure size, location and role.	This phase happens periodically while the structure is working normally and has not be set into reinforcement yet.	Players owning the structures set the vulnerability time themselves (if they have enough roles) – this can be done in advance, before deploying the structure.	Attacking a structure in high-security space without a war declaration is a bad idea and thus gives you a criminal flag. It is like trying to add pineapples to a pizza (which is one of the many barbaric traditions a Frenchman must endure in Iceland).	How players assign weekly vulnerability hours is entirely up to them, as long as they fill the quota. You could assign all hours consecutively if you dispose of enough manpower, or you could spread them out over multiple days. Hours have to be spent whole however, no weird split minute shenanigan is allowed.
53	english	 	 VULNERABLE 1	A structure that is successfully deployed then enters normal operation mode. Players may use its services, dock, man the defenses or do whatever else is allowed by them. The structure also becomes vulnerable to attack during specific times.
53	english	 	 Please note those do not require downtime to proceed, unlike existing outposts. It is also important to remember that scooping a structure will cause an immediate and full vulnerability window to begin. If a vulnerability window was already underway, it will refresh the duration to its maximum value. A structure going through a reinforcement timer cannot be scooped until it comes out of it.
53	english	 	 4 hours
53	english	 	 2 hours
53	english	 	 1 hour
53	english	 	 Citadel deployment timer
53	english	 	 Corporation members with enough roles to do so will have full information on vulnerability, reinforcement, capture timers. Notifications will be sent for those particular states to make sure people can respond and defend their structures in a timely manner.	Any external party to the corporation will only be able to see the timer related to the current state. For example, a scout may learn the structure is in reinforced state 2, with 5 hours left on it by going to the solar system where the structure is located. However the same scout will not be able to guess how the vulnerability window is weekly set. In the same manner, we want to avoid automation for this particular information, which means not displaying it in the API, since we want people to actively scout, or infiltrate spies in the target entity they wish to disrupt instead of relying on external tools to do the job for them.	Structure brackets are going to be visible in space and in the overview if:	The user can interact with the structure in question. A structure set to accept neutral parties will be displayed publicly for such pilots. Another structure set for alliance use only will not appear to any neutral pilot at all.	The structure itself disrupts the user in any way. An Observatory Array having adverse effects on a pilot ability to probe or scan will appear to anyone.	On top of the points above, all structures, no matter their size or role, will have warpable signatures like cosmic combat anomalies. None of them will need to be probed to be warped to, even if the user doesn’t have direct access to them. This will ensure pilots can quickly see what’s happening in their surroundings without having to use probes, and thus not having to give their position away to the inhabitants.
53	english	 	 We also want to make sure all the previous states and phases are properly represented in the game.	As such:
53	english	 	 4 hours
53	english	 	 2 hours
53	english	 	 1 hour
53	english	 	 Citadel deployment timer
53	english	 	 All structures will have a deployment time, which will vary depending on the structure size and type. The larger or more impact on the surrounding the structure has, the more time is going to be needed in an effort to give various parties more time to react.	A new structure that is being deployed is totally vulnerable to entosis links, and any third party can come to disrupt it (for high-security space however, a war declaration is required not to suffer the wrath of CONCORD). The exact details on the attack process are explained under the “entosis link contest” below.	Current numbers to deploy Citadels, our first batch of structures, are:
53	english	 	 CAPTURE PROCESS	As mentioned in Shake my Citadel, new structures are going to use mechanics similar to the revamped Sovereignty system, with a twist to fit our own needs. This naturally implies vulnerable and reinforced states.	All Citadels, no matter their size, will have 3 vulnerability windows. They are supposed to be the safest structures around, and thus provide the longest defense buffer available to owners. Please note this will not be true of all structures. Observatory arrays may have only 2 for example, since they are supposed to be more fragile.	Also, there will be no Command Node spawning under this system – CSM feedback showed it was quite counter-intuitive to fit big guns to your massive structure only to have the fight take place somewhere else.	With the chart below, we are going to go into details how each phase is going to work.
53	english	 	 And that’s it regarding asset safety. We do hope that by now you have a clearer picture on how new structures are going to work. There is still much we need to talk about, like structure price, acquisition, exact defensive capabilities, fittings, fuel, services or bonuses, so expect more blogs incoming as we flesh details out.	Fly safe, and may the odds be in your favor.
53	english	 	 The structure turns into a wreck. A percentage of the 15 billion ISK materials used in its construction are moved back into the wreck. They can be recovered through salvaging.	Structure module and defenses drop as loot for anyone to take it. Some of it may be destroyed as that follows the same exact rules than for ship loot.	Structure rigs are lost forever, which is a 85 billion ISK loss.	A percentage of the materials used to build the titan will drop as loot. Blueprints are not affected. This again follows the same rules as standard loot mechanics.	All items located in the corporation hangar divisions are impounded. Items are kept inside containers but lose password protection and are saved for a person with sufficient roles within the Tasty Fougasse Republic™ to deliver.	All players that were docked in the structure are podded. Mrs. Madeleine Truffade loses her implants and is moved to her medical home station, Duripant VII – Moon 6 – Federal Navy Academy. All items located in personal hangars are saved for their owners to claim. This includes Madeleine’s Megathron. A notification will be sent to Madeleine explaining what happened.	To reclaim the corporation items, someone with sufficient roles can:	Pay 20 billion ISK (10% fee of 200 billion ISK) to have corporate items moved to Anin, the closest 0.4 solar system with NPC stations. The exact station picked will be the closest one to the destroyed structure. Items can be selected on a one by one basis if the person doesn’t want or cannot pay the full 20 billion ISK fee. Furthermore, a 6 days delay is imposed before items are moved to the destination. The Nyx will not be moved however, as it is a supercapital ship and is not eligible to be moved to a NPC station. It can only be recovered with the option below.	Build another Citadel in EC-P8R and reconnect it to the lost assets. No fee will need to be paid in that case, but a minimum time delay of 5 days will still be in place. Note that by doing so, all corporation members will also be able to deliver their own personal items without further hassle. The Nyx can only be delivered if the new Citadel structure is of an XL size, as it would not fit in a M or L class.	Please note the Tasty Fougasse Republic™ cannot tamper with Madeleine Truffade’s personal hangar items or deliver them on her behalf. Those are hers and hers alone.
53	english	 	 Since that’s a lot of information explained in a blog, let’s use an example to make sure everyone grasps the fine details of this feature.	The Tasty Fougasse Republic™ is a corporation that operates a Citadel XL structure in EC-P8R. It has the following properties:	Let’s hypothetically say the structure is worth 15 billion ISK in materials to build, and has rigs worth another 85 billion ISK. It is also fitted with structure modules and defenses.	5 jobs are running, 1 is a titan being manufactured, the rest are related to blueprint research.	It has ships, items, blueprints located in the corporation hangar of the Citadel XL structure worth 200 billion ISK (calculated from average market value), which includes a Nyx being stored there.	It has many players docked, some of them inactive, but with items stored in their own personal hangars. Let’s take a guinea pig, Mrs. Madeleine Truffade, who has 1 billion ISK stored in assets in her personal hangar at that particular Citadel XL structure. She is docked in the structure in a Megathron, and has implants plugged in her brain.	All goes well in the life of the Tasty Fougasse Republic™ until a rival corporation, the Wild Fish’n’Chips Warband™ comes along and destroys the Citadel XL after 3 vulnerability cycles.	The following will happen:
53	english	 	 A notification will be sent for each destroyed structure the player (or corporation) had items in.	A notification will be sent if the player was podded for being in a structure that has been destroyed.	A proper tab will be added to personal / corporation asset window when items are impounded and available for delivery.	Impounded items can also be displayed on the Star Map under the “my asset” filter.
53	english	 	 Just like for capture and protection mechanics, we also want this feature to have proper visualization in the game.	As such:
53	english	 	 All items:	Are automatically delivered as a single package which has to be opened, like courier contract plastic wraps. This is done not to overwhelm, confuse or mix items that are being delivered with ones already in place in the hangar.	Owners can pick one item at a time to extract from the package if they so wish. In that case, pricing will be calculated on selected items. This done to allow users to get separate items out if they cannot pay the fee for the whole batch if items are delivered to a NPC station.	Items with exclusive sizes will have restriction on delivery, which mainly includes capital and supercapitals. For example, a titan that was lost inside a Citadel XL structure cannot be delivered to a NPC station or any other Citadel size than XL. Furthermore, a capital or supercapital ship cannot be delivered to high-sec.	When the structure is destroyed all items stay inside containers, but lose password or lock protection.	Corporation hangar items need proper roles to be delivered. Due to the nature of the recovery it is critical access is properly filtered to avoid thefts.	That leaves us with player docked inside the structure when it was lost:	The player is podded with all normal rules applying for such a case (implants are lost) and moved to his or her medical station. If the medical clone was set to the structure that just blew up, it will be moved to a medical NPC station.	Player ships are safely impounded and saved, along with all their fittings and rigs. We considered destroyed the active ship as well, but that would only lead to further hassle where players would always have to remember to exit their active ship when docking at one of those new structures.	As an optional feature, we are investigating having frozen player corpses docked inside the lost structure to appear near the wreck, or be able to be salvaged through the wreck.	Another option is to have all livestock goods be wrecked and appear as frozen meat when delivered through this feature (example: exotic dancers, fedos, liverstock etc..). Yes, bad things happens to perishable products when delivered in such a fashion.	Please note asset recovery can be done remotely. There is no need to be in the same solar system, or even docking access to initiate the process to recover your assets. In the same vein, the station owner(s) will never be able to tweak or remove items from other character personal hangars. They will only be able to tamper with corporation hangars and their own character hangars. This works the same way for jobs, or even market orders that are started by an individual. This rule exists to prevent asset appropriation in structures that will be open for public use.
53	english	 	 MORE DETAILS	Of course, there is going to be more conditions based on circumstances.
53	english	 	 RELOCATE MY STUFF	So, what happens when players successfully attacks one of the new structures and blows it up?	All items fitted on the structures are lost, and can drop as loot (just like ships). To all the clever people out there, remember it is not going to be possible for owners to remove fitted structure modules when the reinforced 1 timer starts.	All rigs fitted on the structure will be lost. While the price for M rigs will not that expensive, X-L rigs will have the same price magnitude than outpost improvement and upgrades, so they are not something to be easily dismissed.	Some of the input materials used in manufacturing or science jobs will drop as loot. This does not include blueprints, which will always be safe from greedy attacking raids, except if they would otherwise be consumed as part of the job (invention for instance). We will add more incoming sources as we are migrating starbase functions. For instance, reaction materials could drop in the future. Market orders will not be available as loot and are going to remain safe from raiding, since they are based on player hangars.	The structure will turn into a wreck that will contain a certain percentage of the minerals and components that were needed to build its base hull (not the modules nor rigs).	Items located in personal or corporation hangars will be impounded and saved from destruction.	There are two different ways of recovering impounded items:	Have items delivered to the closest NPC station. For high-security dwellers, this will be the closest high-security station available. For low and null-security structures, that will be the closest low-security NPC station. Please note the exact destination will be picked automatically to minimize potential for abuse.	Build another Citadel in the same system to replace the one that has been lost, and deliver the items there. This option will be working the same way for all locations, and will be the only way to recover items out of wormhole space. In case there is more than one structure available to deliver the items to, a selection list will be provided.	There are going to be sinks involved to be able to recover impounded items:	In cases where items are delivered to a NPC station, players will need to pay an ISK fee based on a percentage of moved item market value (numbers we are considering are around 10% price fee).	A minimum recovery time, based on the distance between origin and destination, calculated in light years. There will be a minimum time enforced, even if items are recovered within the same system: current number is 5 days minimum, up to 20 days for the longest distances. A choice doesn’t have to be picked after the recovery time has elapsed, players may wait more before picking a recovery option. If the chosen destination structure is blown up before the recovery time has elapsed, it will not reset – a new structure can be picked after the remaining time is gone.	Please note that the recovery time will automatically start counting down as soon as the lost structure has been blown up. As such, users will not have to wait after coming back from a break or if they forget to press a confirmation box.
53	english	 	 This gives high staging value to building outposts since they can never be removed.	As time passes space becomes more and more saturated with outposts, decreasing logistics risks in null-security space, and reducing the need to build more outposts in the first place.	So, we quickly decided that our new structures would need to be destructible, especially since they are going to be available everywhere from high-security to wormhole space. However, this introduces another problem: we want our structures to be used, but one of the deterrents against that goal is the fact they compete against existing NPC stations and player outposts (before we nuke them that is). As such, we have to accept the fact no one will want to store items or minions (if you are an alliance leader) in one of the new structures if they can be destroyed and lost on a whim.	And that is how asset safety was born.
53	english	 	 Before we get started, let’s explain why we even need to consider this particular feature in the first place.	One of the core philosophies of EVE Online is that acquired resources can be lost. This in turn keeps the economy in check, gives a risk versus reward in the game, and promotes conflict and bragging (who doesn’t love those juicy killmails?). However, while this principle is in place for most of the structures in-game (starbases, customs offices, deployables), it does not apply to player built outposts.	This leads to several problems:
53	english	 	 The Daring Tartiflette Expedition™ is a corporation having a Citadel L deployed in a random wormhole.	Anyone attacking their structure when it is being deployed, or in its vulnerability phase will need full 30 minutes to win the entosis link contest.	For being the owners of the structure and defending it, the Daring Tartiflette Expedition™’s members will only need 10 minutes of entosis linking to defend it, or to fully remove its contested status.	Please note that if the Daring Tartiflette Expedition™ was to attack a structure belonging to another corporation in their wormhole, they would have to go through a 30 minutes entosis link timer themselves.
53	english	 	 Wormhole space
53	english	 	 The process is as follow:	A structure that is successfully attacked by an entosis link during its vulnerability window goes into reinforcement. If it was being deployed, or if that was the last vulnerability window it was capable of withstanding, the structure is destroyed instead.	A structure that is partially contested with an entosis link will delay the vulnerability or deployment timer indefinitely, until such time where the owner uses his own entosis link to remove the contested status, or an attacker chooses to fully attack it. The duration will however count toward the vulnerability or deployment timer – a structure that needs 4 hours to be deployed, but is stuck in a contested state for 5 days can be immediately deployed if the owner removes this particular status with his own entosis link.	The entosis contest time will vary depending on the location where the battle takes place and if you are attacking or defending.	High, low-sec and null-sec with full indexes

Please remember most of this is subject to change based on feedback and time, even if we’re are starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel. We would also like to thank the CSM for their time reviewing this particular feature with us. As mentioned at the beginning, our next blog is going to focus on asset safety, or what’s happening to your stuff when a structure blows up.	In the meantime, happy hunting and may the odds be in your favor.

Notifications will be sent for those particular states to make sure people can respond and defend their structures in a timely manner.	Any external party to the corporation will only be able to see the timer related to the current state. For example, a scout may learn the structure is in reinforced state 2, with 5 hours left on it by going to the solar system where the structure is located. However the same scout will not be able to guess how the vulnerability window is weekly set. In the same manner, we want to avoid automation for this particular information, which means not displaying it in the API, since we want people to actively scout, or infiltrate spies in the target entity they wish to disrupt instead of relying on external tools to do the job for them.

54	english	 	 THE FIRST THREE DESIGNER SKINS
54	english	 	 Greetings capsuleers!	Various designers across the universe have secured contracts to create new SKIN lines, meaning licensed Designer SKINs are soon heading out to hangars all around New Eden. Their bold new looks, inspired by the sunsets on Caldari Prime, the mythology of the brave Matari warriors and more, isn't the only unique thing about them. Each line is created by independent designers that are not shackled to the traditional palettes of each of the four major Empires. Hence some of these designs will have SKINs that are available across multiple factions regardless of hull composition, such as the Blue Tiger line seen below.	The first of the below Designer SKINs, The Raata Sunset line, will arrive with Galatea on 25th August and the rest will follow shortly after.
55	english	 	 FINAL WORDS	We do hope this new attack system will fulfill player needs more closely than the last version, while bringing more interesting fights and interactions around the new structures. Keep in mind this is still subject to change based on relevant feedback.	Our next blog will deal on how to build those new structures and which consequences this will have for your average industrialist or market trader out there.	Until then, may the odds be in your favor.
55	english	 	 STRUCTURE HP NUMBERS	As further iteration from the previous attack mechanic, we would like structure assaults to take around 30 minutes to complete, no matter where the structure is deployed. This ensures a unified experience and prevents confusion as a whole.	Based on the damage mitigation numbers above, we end up with the following HP and resistance profiles for Citadels:
55	english	 	 Number of Dreadnoughts* to reach damage mitigation	1	2-4	10-20	*Assuming current damage numbers for Dreadnoughts, which may change with the planned capital rebalance
55	english	 	 Number of Battleships to reach damage mitigation	5-15	15-45	75-225
55	english	 	 Number of Cruisers to reach damage mitigation	10-20	30-60	150-300
55	english	 	 60,000 DPS	Number of Frigates to reach damage mitigation	10-20	30-60	150-300
55	english	 	 12,000 DPS
55	english	 	 4,000 DPS
55	english	 	 Damage mitigation
55	english	 	 DAMAGE MITIGATION	Even if they’re not going to be directly involved any longer, we do believe Entosis Links promote beneficial gameplay in the sense they do create a more level playing field between various player entities: using an HP metric as an attack system alone strongly encourages blobs to pile up on structures. This in turn encourages us to create structures with lots of HP to make sure blobs take time to bring them down. Which removes any incentive for the smaller gangs to engage in structure assaults, thus reinforcing large blob attacks.	This is a vicious circle we intend to break while singing dirty French limericks and wielding a garlic-infused baguette. How? By introducing damage mitigation on structures.	The way damage mitigation is going to work is pretty simple:	We set a maximum limit on a structure, say, 4000 DPS	Every time damage is applied to that structure, we check all cumulated damage done before that within a specific time frame – let’s say 30 seconds	If cumulated damage on the structure would exceed 30*4,000 = 120,000 then any further incoming damage is reduced, or negated to preserve that amount over the last 30 seconds	Mitigation is counted after shield, armor or hull resistances are applied to incoming damage	Not all structures are going to have the same damage mitigation. That is going to vary depending on the structure size and role. Here are the numbers we have so far, along with some very rough calculations on how many ship types would be required to reach the indicated damage mitigation for each size (yes, those are very rough, no nitpicking).
55	english	 	 For unanchoring:	Unanchoring may only be started if the structure has full shields and is not within a repair timer. This is to prevent some early bail-out should it be attacked	Once the unanchoring process has started, the structure will become invulnerable for a specific amount of time	Once the invulnerability timers runs out, the structure will be vulnerable for damage yet again, with having a repair process identical of what’s been mentioned above. This time however, shields, armor and hulls will be fully available
55	english	 	 For anchoring:	The structure goes into a 24 hour invulnerability timer. No damage can be done during that time and the owner cannot cancel this action once it has been confirmed	The structure will come out of the invulnerability timer with only its hull layer active and vulnerable to attack (enters the vulnerability states above).	As usual, any damage done to the structure while it is vulnerable will cause the repair time to start. Please note however that in this case the structure will only have hull layer available – it is not a fully operational battle station yet, and as such is even more susceptible to damage than usual. Which means if attackers can take it to 0 hit points it will be destroyed on the spot, there will be no further invulnerability phase.
55	english	 	 ANCHORING OR UNANCHORING A STRUCTURE
55	english	 	 60 minutes	Be aware that we are actively seeking to prevent types of hit and run tactics that would allow the attacker to apply damage without committing to the battlefield (we are looking at you, Stealth Bombers). If you want to attack someone’s assets, be ready to commit your fleet to it.
55	english	 	 30 minutes	Null-security space, owner has no index
55	english	 	 Low-security and W-space
55	english	 	 15 minutes
55	english	 	 REPAIR STATE	Any damaged structure that is in a vulnerable state will automatically try to repair its shields, armor or hull after a specific amount of time. Unlike regular ship shields, this is not an on-going regeneration process – it’s like a shield booster or armor repairer that would instantly restore all hit points after a specific cycle time has passed. Please note this will not happen if the structure is invulnerable.	It will not be possible to accelerate the process using any kind of remote repair modules – we do not want to favor static fleets of logistics or carriers sitting near the structure and preventing incoming damage to be applied. In the same vein, we do not believe requiring players to sit for hours repairing a structure manually after a fight to be interesting gameplay.	This repair timer will automatically be paused whenever damage is being applied to the structure. This gives attackers a chance to take the shields, armor or hull layer down before the structures repairs itself.	As such, the attacker goal is to maintain a presence near the structure to keep applying damage over a specific amount of time until either the shields, armor or hull hit points reach 0.	As explained above, if shields reach 0 hit points, the structure enters an invulnerability phase, at the end of which armor will become vulnerable for attack	If armor reaches 0 hit points, the structure enters another invulnerability phase, at the end of which hull will become vulnerable for attack	If hull reaches 0 hit points, the structure is destroyed, its assets taken care by the asset safety feature	Adversely, the defender goal is to remove attacking ships doing damage to the structure before the HP layer is depleted (shields, armor or hull) – this can be done by assuming direct control of the structure, and / or by using your own fleet to repel the attackers (without the part where we give you a quick access route to the structure power core to blow it up with a few torpedoes, sorry).	As mentioned above, the repair damage stops whenever damage is applied. It will resume counting down 10-30 seconds after the structure stopped receiving incoming damage. When the repair timer hits 0, the structure fully repairs its shields, armor and hull	The repair timer will vary depending on where the structure is deployed, and if the structure owner has any kind of Sovereignty index	Repair timer for all Citadel sizes	High-security space and null-security space with full indexes
55	english	 	 Invulnerable state duration:	Shields will be invulnerable all the time, except if the structure is within one of the weekly vulnerability window mentioned above	When vulnerable and attacked, if shields hit points reach 0, the structure will become invulnerable for a specific amount of time (this is the equivalent of the old reinforcement timer). Exactly how this is going to last is still up for debate. We are discussing various options, like a fixed time on existing Starbase reinforcements, or the system we had in the previous blog. More details as we get them	This process is repeated for hull: when armor reaches 0 hit points, structure will become invulnerable for a specific amount of time after which hull will become vulnerable to attack
55	english	 	 INVULNERABLE STATE	The structure cannot be attacked through any means when in this state. It serves to protect the owner assets, pauses gameplay and gives a chance for all players within different time zones to interact with each other.	It is the most common structure state, encountered when a structure is operating normally, being anchored or unanchored, or after a successful attack by external parties	Unlike existing Starbases, the new structures will not use fuel when invulnerable. In fact they will not use fuel at all by themselves. Fuel consumption has been moved to service modules, which will use a new type of fuel blocks, made of the materials from all existing fuel blocks, plus strontium clathrates. This will be explained further on a separate blog on Structure acquisition and composition materials
55	english	 	 Example from the last blog in case people missed it:	Soft Croissant Incorporated™ is a small 5 man corporation having a Large Citadel structure in high security space with 6 hours of weekly vulnerability window. Not being a hardcore gamer, the structure owner decides to set the vulnerability window 2 hours during Tuesday evening and 4 hours on Saturday. During that time the structure will be vulnerable to damage (a war declaration is still needed to shoot a structure in high-security space).

Keep in mind this is still subject to change based on relevant feedback.	Our next blog will deal on how to build those new structures and which consequences this will have for your average industrialist or market trader out there.	Until then, may the odds be in your favor.
55	english	 	 VARIATIONS, GENERAL NOTES AND YOU	There is a certain number of special cases we wish to tackle specifically in this blog, to avoid the recurring questions we’ve had in the past.	The current plan is for those structures not to have auto-defenses. This is still left to be debated, but we do believe existing auto-defenses on Starbases are nothing but a false promise to safety, since they are so easily abused and bypassed by attacking parties. They just give the owner a feeling of safety where none actually exists, like having a completely out-of-date firewall and anti-virus on your computer.	We revaluated our position on Wormhole space asset safety from our “I feel safe in Citadel city” blog. Structures destroyed in wormhole space will see all of their assets lost when destroyed and subject to the magical loot fairy rules that would normally apply for ship cargohold.	We are aware that the long process of sieging a Citadel (up to one week) is considerably longer that what’s currently in place in Wormhole space. We do know that controlling traffic in Wormhole space to be a taxing activity, which is why we are considering having further variations in place there so that the total siege doesn’t exceed 48 hours there.
55	english	 	 If the structure is invulnerable, a timer will be shown counting how much time left before it is vulnerable again	If the structure is vulnerable, it will display for how long it is going to be before becoming invulnerable again	If the structure is being repaired, a timer also will be shown before it fully regenerates – if the timer is paused due to incoming damage this particular condition will also be displayed
55	english	 	 We want the various timers and states to be visible to the owners and players partaking in structure attack, as such:	Owners with sufficient roles will be able to see the full weekly vulnerability window calendar. Corporation members without roles, or external parties will not. This information will not be publicly available throughout the API: we want people to actively scout or infiltrate the target corporation to know the most favorable moment to attack	Proper notifications will be sent whenever a structure state needs attention	As mentioned in the previous blog, all structures will have warpable signatures like combat anomalies. They will also show up in space / overview whenever the player can dock inside them	Timers related to the current state, or next available state will always be visible on the structure icon, in a manner very similar with the existing deployables. Of course, players not belonging to the corporation owning the structure need to be on grid to see them	Some examples:
55	english	 	 As a side note, there won’t be hull, armor or shield hardeners, or anything that increases structure EHP since we do not want attack time to drag on forever. There may be modules that switch the resistance profiles however, from, for instance, 20% EM / 20% thermal / 20% kinetic / 20% explosive to 0% EM / 80% thermal / 0% kinetic / 0 explosive.

55	english	 	 MIGHTY CITADELS	The new Citadel structures will be at the heart of the next expansion. You already know a lot about them from the dev blogs we have been publishing in the last months, but in addition to three sizes of Citadels and all new service modules, the expansion will bring big news and a big role for capital ships. We are hard at work on finalizing all of our plans, and you can expect the full reveal of what the expansion will be at EVE Vegas.
55	english	 	 EXPANDING AGAIN	Yes, I said expansion. We want to give you EVE Online expansions with a more epic feel to them again, but in a new form.	In the summer of 2014, we started delivering updates to EVE in a new way: instead of two expansions per year, we switched to a more rapid way of releasing features, doing about 10 releases per year.	Here's what we’ve liked about releasing updates almost every month:	Small and medium features get to you quicker	We can give you stuff early and continuously develop features with more feedback from the whole community	We can take on more ambitious projects because the timelines are more flexible	Here's what we think hasn’t worked so great with this new release cadence:	It encouraged us to take bigger changes that should really belong together and chop them up into multiple releases once each part was done – which has created a disjointed experience in some cases	We put a lot of responsibility on you players to figure out what's coming and when, and what the future of EVE is, instead of us packaging big changes together and telling you about them all at once	We have gotten a lot of feedback along these same lines from you players, so we are going to change to a hybrid release model that hopefully brings together the best of both worlds:	We will continue to release features on a regular five-week schedule, especially things like quality of life changes, ship balance changes, visual upgrades, new ship skins, storyline developments, and other content. Some of these features will be surprisingly big and some relatively small but still important.	So for the most part, we'll continue with the style of releases you have seen since Kronos in 2014. The next two are Vanguard and Parallax, bringing you things like multi-buy, new burner missions, alterations to the new sovereignty system, changes to jump fatigue, and a whole mess of graphical improvements.	But we will also bring back expansions. What's then the difference between a release and an expansion in this hybrid form? First, an expansion will be a set of big, connected features that both make impactful change on EVE, and make a statement about what kind of game EVE is. Second, there won't be a fixed number of them per year, but rather we will announce when we have one in the making and what the main features are. While we will have a timeframe in mind for the release of the expansion and tell you about it, the exact date won’t be pinned down until we are confident that the state of all the connected features are in a good place.

This still represents a specific amount of hours that have to be assigned on a weekly basis, during which the structure will be vulnerable.

What has changed however, is that the vulnerability window will not vary based on Sovereignty indexes anymore, as this we realized it would cause management nightmares when trying to apply vulnerability hours while Sovereignty indexes are changing.

56	english	 	 SOME TECHNICAL DETAILS	There are some challenges in maintaining an application that needs frequent updating, as the EVE client does. On Windows, the regular install location is under the Program Files folder (or C:\Program Files (x86) to be more precise). With UAC enabled (as it is by default), this folder is protected and you have to allow programs to make changes.	The new launcher downloads the binaries into the same location as the resources - the shared cache. The binaries for each server you connect to are then staged in individual folders under the shared cache folder and run from there. The shared cache has to be in an unprotected location, of course, so that the launcher (and the client) can download resources as well as binaries.	Even if you install the launcher under Program Files, the EVE client(s) it launches will not be run from there. How does the old launcher get around this? It actually changes the permissions on the installation folder - a method that is not recommended by Microsoft (see //msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb530199.aspx for a discussion on patching methods).
56	english	 	 What about the Mac?	The Mac version is not available in this first pre-release, but we are working on it.
56	english	 	 What about my settings?	As of yet, we do not provide a path to migrate settings to the new setup. We do plan on developing a simple tool to help with migrating settings, though, so do not despair.
56	english	 	 WHEN CAN I TRY IT?	Right now! Download it from here: //binaries.eveonline.com/EveLauncher-969236.exe	To begin with we'll offer this new launcher as an alternative to the current one. It is still in an early state and we want your feedback before we commit to switching over. The current launcher will continue to be offered until we are fully confident that the new launcher provides a better experience for all players.
56	english	 	 Client logging	You can select to run clients with logging, making it easier to gather logs for bug reports.
56	english	 	 It supports launching multiple instances	You can set up logins to multiple accounts, and then launch multiple clients with one button click. The logins can be remembered between sessions if you want.	The launcher also keeps track of clients it has launched so you won't accidentally launch on an account that is already logged. You can switch focus to any running client from the launcher, or close it down.	It has functionality to maintain the shared resource cache	Verifying, purging extra files and downloading the full resource cache are all handled by the launcher. You can also move the cache to a different location.
56	english	 	 It supports multiple settings profiles	For each client you launch, you can select a settings profile. This is somewhat simplistic, though - really all that is happening is you are selecting a settings folder to use for the client.
56	english	 	 It checks the status periodically	You can leave it running past TQ downtime and it will refresh automatically - not just on startup.	It supports launching against test servers	No more separate installs to run against Sisi or Duality. The binaries are downloaded in a very similar way to how the resources are downloaded on demand in the client, using the same sort of CDN setup and the same shared cache. A lot of the binaries and resources are the same between different servers so there is very little overhead in keeping binaries around for multiple servers.
56	english	 	 The patching mechanism is simpler	This should result in fewer cases of failed patching. We no longer rely on HTTP 1.1 and ranged gets - files are simply downloaded as a whole. We are also planning on doing more diagnostics in the launcher to help identify connection issues.
56	english	 	 HOW IS IT DIFFERENT?
57	english	 	 Well now you can!	There’s not much more to explain here - this image tells you everything you need to know.	That’s the latest round-up from Team Five 0. Thanks for reading, and some of us will see you in Vegas! :-)
57	english	 	 Scoop to Fleet Hangar	Does your ship have a Fleet Hangar? Have you ever wanted to scoop items in to it?
57	english	 	 Preparing to Count your Kills	Hopefully by now you’ve watched this video, as seen on the EVE Updates site.	With the Parallax release, we are adding the necessary behind-the-scenes kill tracking for individual ships. This is in preparation for the availability of Kill Marks coming to ships in a subsequent release.	There are going to be a few restrictions about what type of kills will count towards a ship’s Kill Mark tally. Here are the current rules about which targets will be scoring:	Only player ship types will count. Shuttles, Capsules and Rookie ships are excluded, as are drones, NPCs, structures, cans, wrecks.	Ships must be owned by player characters. Ships owned by characters on trial accounts will be excluded. Ships owned by NPCs (or with no owner) will be excluded.	Ships must be piloted at the time of death. Unpiloted ships will be excluded.	Killing your corp-mates’ ships will not count.	Only the ship with the final blow can earn a point for a kill. If a drone, missile or bomb kills a target, the parent ship will count as the killer.	So start warming up those guns.
57	english	 	 Jump Fatigue Reductions	We are reducing the maximum fatigue cap down to 5 days (from 30 days). This means the effective maximum jump cooldown timer is now 12 hours (down from 2 days 22 hours). During the Parallax deployment downtime we will update any characters with jump fatigue higher than 5 days, or jump cooldown higher than 12 hours, to bring them within the new limit.	This isn’t the final iteration on Jump Fatigue, and you can expect to see more tweaks in the future.
57	english	 	 A FEW MORE THINGS…	Whilst we have your attention, we have a few other additional changes that we want to highlight. All the changes mentioned in this blog are already on the Singularity test server, awaiting your evaluation.
57	english	 	 Following on from configurable infrastructure upgrades, another requested feature was the ability for corporations to manually remove their own sovereignty structures without having to have a different alliance come along and complete a multi-day capture process. We are now adding a Self-Destruct option to Infrastructure Hubs and Territorial Claim Units. This will provide a quicker way for an alliance to tear down their assets in a solar system.	The self-destruct option requires Director roles, and will trigger a countdown similar to self-destruct on a normal ship. However this countdown is longer - it will take 20 minutes to complete. Initiating a self-destruct will send a notification to the owner alliance, which includes details on the responsible character. Any other Director within the corp can travel to the structure and cancel the self-destruct, provided he does so before the countdown completes.	As with ship self-destruct sequences, a server down-time will automatically cancel any ongoing countdowns. This is intended to mitigate out-of-game issues such as unpredictable patch times from interfering with the ability of owners to abort a self-destruct.
57	english	 	 Command node325x 0.4098 (neutral starting point)*	* An unattended capture node event will self-complete in < 196 minutes (assuming all solar systems in the constellation have been visited by at least one player since downtime)	Command Nodes linked to the same parent structure will regenerate independently of one another. When one Command Node is being manually captured, any other related idle node will still continue to regenerate by itself. Any command node that completes 100% regeneration will count as being captured by the defenders, and award them 5% progress to the overall campaign as normal.	Command Nodes associated with a free-ported station will not have any defensive regeneration, as there is no defender alliance in this scenario.	Manual Online/Offline Control of Infrastructure Hub Upgrades	For those not familiar with Infrastructure Hubs and their associated Infrastructure Upgrades, the upgrades are items that can be installed in an IHub in order to provide some kind of bonus or ability within a solar system. These include extra pirate/asteroid spawns or the ability to anchor certain restricted starbase structures such as Cynosural System Jammers or Supercapital Ship Assembly Arrays. Infrastructure Upgrades are similar to rigs in that once installed they cannot be removed. Some upgrades also add to the weekly upkeep bill that the owner of the IHub is required to pay. This means that an IHub can become quite expensive to run if it includes upgrades that are only required on a temporary basis.	Prior to the release of the new Sovereignty system in the Aegis release, one workaround for this forced billing cost was to use multiple IHubs. An alliance would launch two IHubs in a system, one fitted with the high-upkeep upgrades and one without. They could then offline one and online the other, letting them switch between different billing levels according to their current circumstances.	With the Aegis release the mechanics of activating IHubs changed, such that only a single IHub could ever be launched in a solar system at a time. The only way to switch to a new IHub would be to destroy the old one. This obviously makes it extremely cost (and time) inefficient to swap out IHubs just to avoid paying upkeep for an upgrade module that isn't currently required.	We are therefore introducing the ability to switch Strategic Upgrades on and off once they are installed in an IHub. (Strategic Upgrades are the only type that increase the weekly IHub bill)	When a Strategic Upgrade is switched off, any starbase structures dependent on it will immediately go offline. These structures cannot be put back online without first switching the Upgrade back on. If the structure is currently running any industry jobs, these jobs will be immediately paused for as long it remains offline. When the next weekly IHub bill is generated, any disabled upgrades will not count towards the bill value.	We've also added a new 'Weekly Cost' label to the IHub management UI that shows you the next billing amount for the current upgrade configuration. This label will update as you switch upgrades on or off.	If you have a keen eye for details, you might now be thinking that you can save some ISK by switching off an upgrade just before the next bill is generated, and then switch it back on just after. I'm sorry to disappoint you, but this is already accounted for: When installing a new upgrade, or switching on an existing upgrade, you will now be required to pay an upfront activation cost. This cost is equal to the weekly upkeep for that item, and must be paid by the character performing the action.	Given the strategic importance of some upgrades, switching them off can only be done by a character with Director roles in the corporation owning the IHub. Installing a new upgrade or switching on an existing upgrade requires the Station Manager role. EDIT: This previously incorrectly stated a requirement of Configure Starbase role	Sovereignty Structure Self-destruct

57	english	 	 IHub595x 0.2050
57	english	 	 Station595x 0.2050
57	english	 	 For structures with daily vulnerability intervals, when the structure has completely re-secured itself by defensive regeneration, it will be able to enter an invulnerable period as normal.	If any ship begins capturing a structure with an Entosis Link module (after the module has completed its warm-up cycle), the defensive regeneration is disabled. If a ship stops capturing the structure for any reason, the structure will immediately resume the defensive regeneration.	As a defender, manually re-securing your structures (or capturing your Command Nodes) with an Entosis Link module will always be faster than relying on the defensive regeneration. It does mean however that you aren't always forced to re-fit in order to undo a small amount of capture progress by an uncommitted attacker once you’ve chased him off. Just keep the area secure from further interference and the structure will take care of itself.	Note that if a Station Service Module has been completely disabled by an attacker, it will not have any regeneration and will need to be manually re-enabled by the defender. However an enabled Station Service Module that has partial attacker progress but was not fully disabled will be able to regenerate back to fully secured.	The following table shows the regeneration times for each type of item. (Values are unchanged from the previous blog)	 Base capture time (sec)Regen Speed MultiplierRegeneration time (min)	Station service235x 0.0498
57	english	 	 Defensive regeneration on Entosis targets	All structures that can be captured by Entosis Link modules will now have the ability to automatically regenerate towards defender control. This applies to Infrastructure Hubs, Territorial Claim Units, Conquerable Stations/Outposts, Station Service Modules, and Command Nodes. If one of these structures has a defender alliance, then the structure will slowly capture itself on behalf of that alliance whilst it is idle. The rate of defensive regeneration is fixed for each type, and is unaffected by any modifier such as the Activity Defense Multiplier.

57	english	 	 SOVEREIGNTY – PARALLAX EDITION	Some of these changes were previously covered in our last dev blog “NEXT SET OF SOV AND CAPITAL MOVEMENT ITERATIONS”. Most of the details from that blog are still valid, but I’ll cover them here again with the latest updates as appropriate. Let’s start with…
57	english	 	 A MODERN HOME	TQ started in a hosting center called Cable and Wireless in London, then moved across the street into Telecity in February 2006. Now, about a decade later, it is time to move to a new data center (opened in 2014) with the latest design in the data center industry.	For couple of months we will have both sites operational in parallel. Then, when we are ready, we will swap over with the goal to have as short of a downtime as possible.	We aim to have TQ Tech III up and running in very early 2016.	Then we will relocate what is soon-to-be-known-as “Old TQ” back home to Iceland to another data center with Verne Global (which is powered by mysterious geothermal volcano power).There we will host all the test servers like Singularity (Sisi), Multiplicity, etc with the best bits from Old TQ, plus some upgrades.	Starting then, we will begin replicating New TQ’s database from London to Iceland so we have a secondary site capable of taking over in case Ragnarök happens and is centered in England. 	You can expect another blog in beginning of November with pictures of the hardware being installed in Reykjavík and a progress report. 	 We in the Operations department are truly excited and proud of the TQ Tech III and what it means for EVE Online and its players.	That's enough writing it for now. Time to get back to the project!	CCP Gunshow, on behalf of the CCP Ops Team
57	english	 	 THE SEXY TQ DATABASE MACHINE	Let’s take a deeper look at the cluster, starting with TQ's database machines.	The 4x Microsoft SQL Database machines will have a whopping 768GB of RAM each running on 1866MHz. They have 2 Intel E7-8893 v3 - 3.2GHz CPU's with 4 cores (8 hyper-threaded) and 45MB cache which are ideal for database-intensive workload.	To go into little bit more detail on the DB side, here are some notes from the Database Administration team.
57	english	 	 THE MAHALANGUR HIMAL	Today we have one server which we call the “Everest” node. It  is assigned to all the most prolific high–load EVE situations, typically the biggest fleet battles in all of gaming. 	With TQ Tech III there will be 6x Everest Nodes.	That leaves a lot of potential for a lot of spaceships to explode at the same time. It also means that certain alliances can forget to pay several crucial bills at one time if they so choose!
57	english	 	 Isn't she a beauty?	You can see a lot of redundancy in the internal components, which is planned so we can maintain TQ by swapping a whole chassis out of rotation while EVE players continue to battle, trade, chat, manufacture, explore, and scam on the other 5. 	The servers are connected to the storage via 2498-F48 IBM SAN 16Gbit Switches with everything cross-connected so there is no single point of failure.
57	english	 	 THE NEW SERVERS	Since day one, EVE has been operated by IBM blade servers. For the upgrade we chose the next generation of IBM servers called IBM FLEX.The above picture demonstrates 1x FLEX Chassis connections to its storage 	The FLEX concept is similar to the blade centers in that there is a chassis which has power and cooling and you can have up to 14x nodes in each chassis.	In comparison, the current TQ blade centers run on 4x 1Gbit network connections then each of the 14x blade has access to 2x1GB as they have 2x network cards.	The new IBM Flex chassis will have 4x 10Gbit network connections, giving each flex node access a total of 2x 10Gbit throughput.	For the current way that EVE runs this is an overkill but having this in place allows for our engineers to test out interesting new ways to scale TQ and architecture performance, that will take time of course but the immediate benefit is that our deployment times will speed up a lot!	Also this will drastically improve our virtual server environment for example when we live migrate Virtual Machines across physical hosts. 	Oh yeah, we will have 6x chassis btw :D
57	english	 	 ADDED REDUNDANCY	TQ’s storage is mirrored and redundant. The storage array has always been redundant but now we’ve added more failsafes.	There will be a full SAN mirror so that we can both maintain TQ and failover live, replicating a copy of the TQ Database across the ocean to Iceland, land of fire and ice.	From the storage side this is how TQ will look once we're done:	What you see here are 2x IBM SAN volume controllers which govern and control 2x IBM V5000 controllers which store all the data with 3x expansion shelves that house 9x800 GB SSD's with a grand total of 83x 1.2TB 10K SAS disks. 	Remember this is all mirrored so double these disk numbers for the full picture!	All this lightning fast and redundant storage has to talk to servers...
57	english	 	 CCP Lucca and CCP Skylark
57	english	 	 PLAYER CONNECTIVITY	We are not just replacing old hardware with new, but also looking at what more can be done to improve the player experiences with regards to connectivity. As part of that effort, we will be deploying a new Intelligent Routing Platform to optimize BGP routing. This system will automatically test both latency and packet loss to every single player upon connection to TQ, running tests simultaneously over each of our connected providers and peers back to the player's ISP (Internet Service Provider).It will also non-disruptively switch each connection to the best available path.	Active connections get tested every few hours. This system has proven to be able to seamlessly bypass many problems and blackouts that regularly afflict the rough seas of the Internet. The excellent reporting will also allow us to tailor our selection of providers to the ones that perform best for EVE players.	On our tests, as you can see on the charts above, the Intelligent Routing Platform was able to improve on connections to over 7,000 ISP networks worldwide, eliminating packet loss in 91% of connections to TQ where packet loss existed, and bypassing blackouts on internet routes in 59% of cases. Latency is also much improved, with reduction of at least 20% in more than half of the high-latency connections. Those are the types of metrics we love to see!	Finally, we will continue to expand our peering with LINX, the London Network Exchange, which allows us to peer directly with a large number of ISPs. That way, players connecting via those ISPs can reach TQ directly, without crossing any additional networks on the public internet, cutting down on the number of hops and offering a much more stable connection.	We would love to tell you all about the specs of these new boxes in mind-numbing details (we can talk about that endlessly, believe me!), but our security specialists tell us that we must keep most of that secret. But, but, but, if you come to the OPS discussion roundtable at the next EVE Fanfest, we promise to share with you glimpses of this wonderfully new and improved world of Internet spaceship networking.
57	english	 	 NETWORK UPGRADE	At this stage, we have talked a lot about fast servers with a ton of fast storage. But something needs to connect that all together and then to the place with all the funny cat pictures (the Internet). Otherwise EVE Online is not so much... online.	Over to our Network Team for more info.	At the network edge, our trusty Cisco 7606 routers have served us well since 2009. We peer with over 20 providers and get full BGP tables from five of them, making for a total of over two million path attribute entries that get compiled into the half-million global BGP best-path route table on each edge router. These venerable beasts of the routing world have been handling all of that without breaking a sweat.	Still, technology has moved forward in leaps and bounds during the last six years, and it's time to retire those old routers and replace them with a new generation. In order to best serve you, the glorious pilots of New Eden, we are once again investing in the best and the greatest. TQ deserves nothing less!	The new boxes are a whole order of magnitude more powerful, offering throughput of 120Gbps and more than double the memory, allowing us to peer with more providers. The extra RAM also allows them to keep pre-calculated backup BGP routes in memory for every active route, so that a failed path may be switched to a secondary path in a matter of few milliseconds. That means that if a directly-connected provider fails, most players routed via that provider get switched to a new provider without being disconnected. The new routers will allow us to provide better connectivity while opening a whole new universe of possibilities with their new features, doing so with expanded memory and processing power.	Other fundamental part of TQ’s current edge network are Cisco ACE 30 load-balancers. As quirky as those boxes have been to configure, they have a special place on our technology-loving hearts here at CCP as they have allowed us to rapidly deploy major changes to TQ and have proved to be rock-solid.	However, a couple of years ago Cisco pulled out of the load-balancing market and left the ACE as a moribund platform dying a slow death. Since then we have been testing different platforms and are excited to have found a great replacement that brings improved performance as well as a whole new bag of tricks.	In performance terms alone, with New TQ we are increasing throughput from 16Gbps to 30Gbps and maximum concurrent connections from 4 million to 24 million. The new load-balancers have gotten all of us, not only in OPS but also in EVE Development, rubbing our hands with glee like a capsuleer who just got their hands on their first Titan.

57	english	 	 The real benefit comes into play when (or if, but more likely when) one of these physical hosts needs hardware maintenance or needs to be taken offline for some reason.  At this point, in a typical two-node physical cluster we would be forced to run on only one cluster node and have fingers crossed that our now-single-point-of-failure does not fail. Lots of soulful Amarrian prayers would be required.	With our virtual direction, we could simply vMotion the passive cluster node from its dedicated ESXi host to another ESXi host (the one hosting the 2nd cluster’s passive node)...and Bob’s yer uncle!  Sure that one host with two passive nodes will now be over-allocated, but we would have to lose two more hosts before that becomes an issue!	This means that not only are we redundant on the SQL Instance level by using Windows Failover Clustering, but we'll now be able to survive more than one hardware failure as well!  We have a lot of testing to do with this but for the most part this is all proven tech, so really, what could possibly go wrong?! 	Yours always!
57	english	 	 VIRTUALIZE ALL THE THINGS!	Before we go further, keep in mind that this is a proof of concept that we have yet to test. It is entirely possible we'll ditch this and just go with plain normal clusters (that still happen to be running on insanely UltraMegaShiny hardware from the heavens).	 Our plan is to create a 4 node ESXi cluster farm with the 4 monster nodes.  On top of the hypervisor we'll build both of our SQL Server clusters with one cluster node per ESXi server - as if they were physical.  No real change there!  	But...
57	english	 	 THE DATABASE CLUSTERS	Currently we have three main production DB clusters:	TQ (2x cpu w/ 32 Hyper Threaded cores)	Web (2x cpu w/ 24 Hyper Threaded cores)	Account Management and Payment (2x cpu w/ 24 Hyper Threaded cores)	All three are on very different types of hardware, spanning multiple generations of architecture, and mostly held together with Minmatar duct tape, soulful Amarr prayers, the naïve and hopeful Gallente spirit, and low-grade mass-produced Caldari chicken wire from upgrades over the years.	With our New TQ cluster, we're looking to consolidate and free up physical space so we'll be combining Web and Account Management and Payment clusters while we keep TQ separate.	For CPU's we are upgrading from ancient 5 year old X7560's @ 2.26 GHz to brand spanking new E7-8893 v3's @ 3.2 GHz. That's a 45% increase in clock speed alone, and on top of that we get a huge 75% increase in memory bus speed by going from 1066 to 1866!!  Make no mistake, we need all that extra memory speed as we go from 672GB of RAM to 1.5TB, yes you read that right - 1.5 TERA bytes of RAM!  That’s how we roll these days, we count our TQ hardware memory in terabytes!	Keep in mind these numbers are just from active nodes, so the New TQ DB cluster total is double this when we factor in the secondary / passive nodes. 3 TB of RAM for our 2 production DB Clusters--mmmmm, tasty!	 While we had discussed having a single two node Active-Active cluster, we decided against this for various reasons. For example,  with one cluster.exe crash the whole shebang could go down.  Having the TQ DB cluster isolated gives us great peace of mind across the whole system.	With that said, we have 4 amazingly powerful DB machines to host our two clusters and have come up with a very interesting plan in an attempt to maximize redundancy.

59	english	 	 The targeting skills of the Titan pilot are much more important. So are the piloting skills of any target.	Doomsday Codename: Sickle	Using the new UI, a Titan pilot can select two points in space and a powerful energy beam will slash from the Titan to the first point and then move to the second damaging any ships unlucky enough to intersect with the path of the beam.	The energy requirements of this weapon are so great however, that before firing the Titan neutralizes any ships unlucky enough to be close to it before checking to ensure it has enough capacitor and firing. The Sickle does not differentiate between friend or foe, damaging anyone in its path.

The number and types of squadrons a carrier or super-carrier can launch will be limited.	Management of fighters ready on the launch decks will be an important consideration for carrier pilots. It takes time to swap one squadron of ready fighters out for another, or re-arm your Heavy Fighter Torpedo squadrons.	Abilities	Each fighter squadron can have up to three abilities. These are similar to modules on ships, however there is no fitting for fighter squadrons.
59	english	 	 CARRIERS, SUPER-CARRIERS & FIGHTERS	We are completely re-imagining fighter game-play. 	Squadrons
59	english	 	 Supercarriers will also have stronger fighter squadron compositions and abilities than Carriers. We feel that the new fighter squadron gameplay and the projected Electronic Warfare Abilities go hand in hand.
59	english	 	 We are looking at expanding this line...think very localized and short term Wormhole effects. However there are some technical challenges to overcome here...so watch this space.
59	english	 	 Tracking Disrupting Debuff	Sensor Damning Debuff
59	english	 	 Target Painting Debuff	Stasis Webifing Debuff
59	english	 	 Super-carriers won't be left out however! Fighters by their nature can be fighting hundreds of kilometers away from their upercarrier. The super-carriers special weapons compliment this. Building on the Remote ECM Burst, supercarriers will be getting a whole range of remote EWar AOE weapons. The exact details of these weapons aren't finalized, however we're exploring a bunch of option for these, such as:	Energy Neutralizer Effect
59	english	 	 Utilizing advanced new technology, this weapon destabilizes the capacitors on a ship. After a short period of time (10-15 seconds) any charge on capacitor rapidly discharges...like a smartbomb. The more capacitor the ship has, the more damage it does to itself and nearby ships.	Projected Electronic Warfare
59	english	 	 Similar to the Sickle, instead of slashing though space this beam is stationary. It neutralizes capacitor, then fires along a path, pulsing every second and doing damage to anyone who stays in its effect radius.	Doomsday Codename: Hand of God	Utilizing Jump Drive technology, the Hand of God will generate an anomaly in space. After a short period of time, anything that isn't a structure or capital class ship will be teleported, together, to a random location in the same system away from the Titan, while the titan stays put. While the effect isn't powerful enough to teleport capitals, it will disrupt their warp and jump drives for a period of time.	Doomsday Codename: Cap-Overload
59	english	 	 Lastly, it takes a while for the Sickle to warm up. During this period it becomes obvious where the beam will slice, giving ships time to get out of the way if their pilots are paying attention.	Doomsday Codename: Pike
59	english	 	 Capital Warp Disruptors & Scramblers	The new capital scramblers and disruptors will offer higher scramble strength with no bonuses to range. Existing officer disruptors and scramblers (which are capital modules) will keep their current roles as longer range capital tackle.
59	english	 	 Local armor repairers
59	english	 	 Remote hull repairers
59	english	 	 Remote energy transporters
59	english	 	 Remote shield transporters
59	english	 	 Remote armor repairers
59	english	 	 New: High Angle Weapon Batteries
59	english	 	 NEW CAPITAL MODULES	All existing capital sized modules will be getting a full set of Meta, Tech 2, and Faction variants. Yes, this includes Tech 2 guns (and the skills for them). We're also introducing a bunch of new modules -	All existing XL guns and XL launchers
59	english	 	 High Angle Weapon Batteries	New rapid firing anti-sub-capital weapon batteries are specifically designed to fire at sub-capitals. However their damage will be considerably lower than current XL weapon systems (in the 1 to 2k DPS range on a Sieged Dreadnought). They are short range guns, and their tracking will probably be somewhere in the battleship gun range.	Capital Armor Plates & Shield Extenders	This forms a large part of the HP balance. While traditionally a large part of a sub-capitals EHP came from plates or extenders, there are no capital equivalents. No longer! The choice on what to fit (plates, the most powerful guns, capital neutralizers, etc) will be a very important decision post Citadel expansion.
59	english	 	 Existing Guns & Turrets	These will be re-balanced to the new Capital EHP levels. They will also have their effectiveness on sub-capitals greatly reduced.
59	english	 	 New: Capital Capacitor Batteries	New: Capital Warp Disruptors & Scramblers	All of these modules, HP and damage will be re-balanced in accordance with structures. We're not ready to release any figures yet, but watch for more devblogs full of graphs and spreadsheets! A few quick notes...
59	english	 	 New: Capital Energy Warfare Modules	New: Capital Cap Boosters and Charges
59	english	 	 New: Capital Microwarpdrives
59	english	 	 New: Capital Shield Extenders
59	english	 	 New: Capital Armor Plates
59	english	 	 New: Local hull repairers
59	english	 	 Local shield boosters
59	english	 	 Total Hit Points	All titans, supers, carriers and dreadnoughts will have their HP re-balanced. The Hel and Nidhoggur will no longer be the black sheep of the family, and will have equivalent HP statistics. Titans and supercarriers will be receiving a cut to their total EHP. The current scale between ship classes currently looks something like this:	After the Citadel Expansion, it will be a little flatter. However, capital pilots will have more options to increase their EHP.
59	english	 	 GENERAL BALANCE CHANGES	We have a vast range of balance changes to go with all of this. First and foremost...	Effective capital-based remote repair will be limited to Triage only	Remote-Repairing Carrier & Super-Carrier fleets will be a thing of the past. The N+1 nature of these tactics encourages enormous blobs and currently the best counter is to bring an even bigger group of your own capitals. The more carriers and super-carriers you bring, the more your entire fleet can tank. Under the Citadel expansion’s capital changes, the bar to killing capitals is limited to what a single Force Auxiliary in Triage can tank. If you can kill that, eventually you can kill the entire capital fleet...assuming you can stay alive and keep them tackled (smile)	You will be unable to refit while you have a weapons timer	The incredibly talented and endlessly creative players of EVE Online have taken combat refitting to its extremes. With some capsuleers refitting during combat from maximum shield resists, to max armor resists, and finally maximum hull HP to ensure they last as long as possible. Currently if you're shooting at carriers in a large group, which evercarrier you're shooting will refit to maximum tank to ensure that the remote repairs of its fleet-mates are most effective, while the other carriers fit to provide maximum remote repairs. Bring jamming support to counter this? They will refit ECCM on the fly. The Swiss-army knife nature of refitting capitals makes trying to balance them impossible. Anything you bring to fight them can be countered in seconds.	After the Citadel expansion, no ship will be able to refit while it has a weapons timer. The fittings you chose before the battle began become a lot more important and counterable. It is not impossible to refit...but you will have to wait out your weapons timer and, effectively, be out of the battle while you do so. We're considering adding a weapons timer to triage & siege modes...but we'd like your feedback on that.	No capital will have complete electronic warfare immunity	Yes, titans can be tackled by enough Rifters, or jammed by enough Falcons. We've got some interesting mechanics for this and I'll go through them one by one -	Warping: Supercarriers and Titans will have an innate warp strength of around 20 to 50. We haven't locked these numbers in and we'd love to hear from you on what you think is appropriate. Heavy Interdictors with a focus point will work as they do now, as will bubbles.	ECM / Tracking Disruptions / Sensor Dampeners / Target Painters: We're introducing a new attribute 'Electronic Warfare Resistance'. If your ship has 50% Electronic Warfare Resistance, any electronic warfare modules will be 50% less effective on the target. In the specific case of ECM, this takes effect before the roll against Sensor Strength is done. So it is possible to Jam / Disrupt / Damp a Titan...but for best results you should use bonused ships. Force Auxiliaries going into Triage and Dreadnoughts going into Siege could have their Electronic Warfare Resistance attribute set very high, but they won't be un-counterable.	Stasis Webifying: We're introducing a new attribute 'Webifying Resistance' and it works the same as Electronic Warfare Resistance.
59	english	 	 FORCE AUXILIARY CAPITALS	Four brand new massive internet spaceships! Force Auxiliary Capitals will take over the remote repair role from Carriers. They will be the only class able to fit the Triage module and the only capital class with bonuses to remote repair modules. They will have limited combat abilities of their own, being unable to fit any guns or launchers. However, we will be giving them a drone bay for self defense. They will never be the damage dealers of the fleet, but instead, they will become the new logistics backbone.	Force Auxiliary Capitals will also have Fleet hangars Ship hangars, and refitting abilities to all their fleet mates like any other capital.	We understand that a lot of capsulers purchased their carrier as a logistics platform. We don't have defined plans for a transition between existing Carriers to the new Force Auxiliaries, but I can assure you it is on our radar, and we'll be announcing the transition plan with plenty of time for everyone to get ready.
59	english	 	 The ability to provide refitting abilities to their fleet-mates	We want both Dreadnoughts and Carriers to be a valid choice for 'My First Capital'. We're going to split off the remote repair role from the Carrier and instead they will focus on fighters and support abilities.	Their repair role will go to a brand new set of capital ships.
59	english	 	 Ship Hangars
59	english	 	 Fleet Hangars
59	english	 	 Time to reimagine and clarify capital roles. Currently, players choosing 'My First Capital' almost always chose a Carrier. They provide more utility than a Dreadnought through the use of fleet hangars, ship hangars, damage, and repair abilities.	We are going to level the playing field.	All capitals will now get:
59	english	 	 Obtaining and mastering capital ships, as well as fighting and destroying them, should be a compelling aspirational goal for players.	Capital ships are the premier weapon for killing structures.	Capital ships should be effective in most combat situations without completely dominating the battlefield and without invalidating other ship types.
59	english	 	 Before we started looking at details, we wanted to firmly fix the goal of the design for capitals	Provide interactive, meaningful, gameplay.
60	english	 	 FUEL BLOCKS	As mentioned above, new structures are going to use a new type of fuel block, which will be required to manufacture the various hulls, modules and online service modules.	As a consideration for players living in null-security space, we are investing coming up with more ways to build such fuel block to reduce the logistic hassle to haul four types of isotopes around. For example, we are considering adding 4 more blueprints to build the new fuel block with one racial isotope instead of 4, but increasing the amount to compensate.
60	english	 	 Tech I rig blueprints will be available from the market through NPC sell orders. Tech II rig can be invented or found in sites as BPCs. Prices are going to be 100m ISK for a Tech I Medium Structure rig blueprint, 500m ISK for a Tech I Large Structure rig blueprint and around 2.5b ISK for an X-Large Structure rig blueprint.
60	english	 	 STRUCTURE RIGS	Except from the hull themselves, rigs are going to be the most expensive piece of equipment to acquire. That is because they are going to offer great bonuses to the installed hull, and overtake the upgrade system currently in place for Outposts. Again, we’ll save the exact bonuses for the next structure blog not to overwhelm you guys all at once.	Rigs are entirely made from existing and regular salvage. Since we are going to have both Tech I and Tech II variations, they will be built in a similar manner to ship rigs, but with a much more expensive cost. We are aware such requirements will increase the demand for salvage, and increase rig price as a result. We will monitor how the market evolves and take additional measures if need be.	Below is an overview on the various rigs we want to release in the first batch:	The rig names we have above are generic categories to show their building costs. Exact rig types are much more numerous. Their associated effect and bonuses will be further explained in our next blog.	Blueprints:
60	english	 	 SERVICE MODULES	Service modules are more similar to structure hulls than the other modules. While they do not require Structure Components to build, they do require a mix of PI materials, minerals and the new structure fuel block.	Again, this is not the exhaustive list of all service modules that are planned for structures, but just the first batch.
60	english	 	 STRUCTURE MODULES	The modules fitted into new structures are fairly simple to build. They only require Tech I minerals and the new structure fuel blocks. If and when we release Tech II or faction modules the material build-up will be properly modified to match. Please remember the list below is not exhaustive of all the modules we will release over time, but only represent the first batch we intend on delivering.	Structure module blueprints are again worth 10 times the value list above. Exact details are available below.	The most observant people among you may notice defensive modules we didn’t list in our previous blog on the topic which warrants a quick explanation.	Repulsor Field: this is an AoE module that pushes everyone away around the target location. Exact bumping speed depends on the mass and velocity vector the victim(s) had at the time.	Ship Tractor Beam: tractors the target along a certain vector back to the structure. This will affect the velocity vector of the target, so while it will not warp scramble the target directly, it may prevent it from aligning.	Multi-spectrum ECM: an ECM module that can be loaded with different scripts / ammunition to change its racial sensor strength.
60	english	 	 Regarding the blueprints themselves:	Like all Tech I blueprints, they will be seeded from specific NPC corporations through various areas of space, including high-security areas.	The price tag will be ten times the hull cost, thus 6b ISK for a Medium Citadel, 70b ISK for a Large Citadel and 700b ISK for an X-Large Citadel.	We want the prices to be that high to keep a long term goal and investment for industrial players, while making sure there is gameplay involved with selling blueprint copies to third parties. Please note the Citadel Hulls and their associated blueprints are the most expensive structure set due to the importance regarding asset safety and home defense. Other structures will vary in price based on their role and intended persistence.	Details on the Citadel blueprint themselves are available below:	On a similar note, we will most likely rename the Outpost Construction skill to Structure Construction, since Outposts currently are following the same evolution trend than dinosaurs.
60	english	 	 Exact details are available below:	Which thus give us this build layout for the Citadel Structures:	The picture above doesn't show that we may add janitors, exotic dancers or other types of personel to be required in the final product manufacturing as well. After all, these structures aren't going to clean themselves.	Which may be compared to Outpost composition on Tranquility there:	Or if you prefer, here are the total PI, mineral and fuel block composition for the new structures versus existing Outposts:	Structure hull volumes are set so that:	A Medium structure hull may be deployed from an Industrial, Large and X-Large require a freighter. Yes, we do are aware this make things more complicated to deploy a Large or X-Large structure in low class wormhole space. This is intended.	The hulls will not yield materials when being reprocessed to avoid compression shenanigans.
60	english	 	 STRUCTURE HULLS	We had a look at how various structures were currently built right now and we came up to the following conclusion:	New structure hulls are going to replace Starbases, Outposts and Deployables over time (please refer to the end of this blog for more details). Most of those require Tech I materials and it would thus be illogical to introduce new material types to build their replacement, especially if the new structures themselves are going to have a Tech I level to start with.	Deploying outposts through intermediate platforms (nicknamed the “eggs” by our playerbase) is an unnecessary and quite cumbersome step we wish to avoid. If anything we would like those new structures to work like Deployables: drag and drop them in space, and voilà, your delicious structure Soufflé is in the oven. No container to fill with materials, no extra downtime shenaningans. You just need to wait a few hours for it to deploy.	We want to cover a very broad price tag with new structures. While the medium structures should be similar to a fully fitted Starbase, we want the X-Large to be quite an expensive goal to achieve. This should require significant effort to complete, not something easily achieved by just anyone.	With all of this in mind, we came up to the following:	Medium Structure hulls will cost around 350-700m ISK in materials to build.	Large Structure hulls will cost around 3-7b ISK in materials to build.	X-Large Structure hulls will cost around 30-70b+ ISK in materials to build.	To do this, we are going to overhaul and use Station Components currently required to build Outposts.	We are renaming them from Station to Structure Components	Their composition of Planetary Interaction materials and minerals will change quite a bit to be more consistent.	We are adding a new Structure Fuel Block type to manufacture Structure Components. More on how to build those will be explained later in this blog.	We are adding 3 new components to fill our needs. They are: Structure Advertisement Nexus, Structure Telescope Lens and Structure Acceleration Coils. We are considering adding those around December to give players time to acquire and research them before the introduction of Citadels.
60	english	 	 OVERALL PLAN	Let’s have a look at the global plan and explain the various item types that can be acquired before going into details.	The Structure Hull: the most obvious piece to the feature, a structure hull works on the same manner to a ship hull by having various slots, attributes and bonuses tailored to a specific purpose. For example, Citadels, the first type of structures to be released, are specialized into defense and various corporation support roles.	Modules: these are structure modules that fit into a structure’s high, medium and low slots. Similar to their ship module counterparts, they require powergrid and CPU to be properly fitted. Active modules also require capacitor, fuel, or both depending on the circumstances.	Service Modules: these are unique modules for structures which give them capabilities you would expect on regular stations like manufacturing, research, reprocessing and market for instance. These also are going to require powergrid and CPU on top of requiring fuel to be activated. The structure hulls, unlike Starbases, will not require fuel block to be operational -- this is being moved into service modules.	Rigs: again similar in functionality to what’s currently available for ships. The Tech I structures we are going to release are all going to have 3 rig slots, with 400 calibration. Fitting rigs consume calibration and require the matching hull size. For example, one cannot fit a medium rig into a large citadel. Rigs also give unique bonuses to activities installed through service modules. More details on that specific point will be unveiled on our next blog which will cover structure fittings and bonuses.	With this in mind, let’s go over them one by one.
61	english	 	 This has been a fairly long time coming but it is finally here and already we are seeing amazing things created with it. A huge thank you to all of the third-party developers out there creating these awesome applications. We cannot wait to see what you do next. 	CCP FoxFour on behalf of Team Tech-Co
61	english	 	 CREST DOCUMENTATION	If you would like to work with the CREST fittings you will need to understand how our SSO works along with the CREST fittings resource.	The SSO documentation can be found here: //eveonline-third-party-documentation.readthedocs.org/en/latest/sso/intro/	While the CREST documentation isn't perfect, we have started trying to gather the documentation here: //eveonline-third-party-documentation.readthedocs.org/en/latest/crest/characters_fittings/	The documentation is hosted on a GitHub repo and we encourage everyone to help contribute to it.	Conclusion
61	english	 	 SECURITY CONCERNS	However great this is, it obviously has some pretty great security concerns. You can read an article on our support page about how to verify some of these security concerns here: //support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/articles/205381192-Single-Sign-On-SSO-	The main points to take away from this are:	Ensure you are actually on the CCP web site before entering your credentials	Ensure you have selected the correct character	Ensure the application is not requesting any permissions it should not be or that you are not happy with giving it	There are two permissions specific to fittings that players should be aware of. A web site or application can request:	characterFittingsRead: This allows the application full access to see all of the fittings for the selected character.They cannot however create new fittings or delete fittings with just this.	characterFittingsWrite: This allows an application to create and delete fittings. It however does not allow the application to see any existing saved fits.	If you ever feel like your information has been compromised, you can revoke an application or web sites access to your information from our site: //community.eveonline.com/support/third-party-applications/
61	english	 	 RANDOM NUMBERS	As of the writing of this dev blog on Monday November 9th at 14:00 there have been 2,969 requests made to the new fittings resource in CREST. 1,323 (45%) of them to create a new fit, 926 (31%) to get a characters fitting, and 720 (24%) requests to delete a fit. In graph form it looks something like:
61	english	 	 Here you can see Pyfa asking which character you would like to export the current fit to.	Pyfa now also allows you to import fits from EVE easily. Great for those times when you don't have EVE installed and want to play around with a saved fit from one of your characters.	Being as awesome as they are the Pyfa team even allows you to select between using Singularity or Tranquility.	You can get the newest release put together by Sable Blitzmann of Pyfa from their GitHub releases page here: //github.com/DarkFenX/Pyfa/releases	zKillboard	Ever been browsing zKillboard and found that one fit that blew your mind as being not complete shit in your opinion? Well guess what, Squizz Caphinator has been kind enough to update zKillboard so that while browsing zKillboard, not on company time, you can easily click one button and have the fit saved to your character.	To try it out just visit any kill from zKillboard: //zkillboard.com/
61	english	 	 Fleet-Up is a web site where you can share ship fittings and doctrines with others. It allows you to create private groups for your corporation or public groups such as the RvB Ganked or Spectre Fleet groups. Once you have a group with some saved fits others can come along view your fits, see if their skills allow them to use it, and then also if browsing from the in-game browser (IGB) they can open the fit in game.	With the release of the fittings resource for CREST in Parallax fleet-up now lets you save the fits to your character from any browser without having to open the client at all. Here are some screen shots from Wacktopia of Fleet-Up:	In the above you can see Fleet-Up asking you to give them permission to view and save fits for your character.	Fleet-Up allows you to link multiple characters to a single Fleet-Up account so here you can select which character to import the fits from.	After selecting a character Fleet-Up will show you all of the fits for that character and then you can easily import those fits into Fleet-Up to be shared.	Wacktopia has said he is working on adding the ability to also export fits from Fleet-Up to EVE however it wasn't ready to be released at the time of writing this dev blog. If you would like to try Fleet-Up you can go to //fleet-up.com/	Pyfa	Pyfa is a fitting tool that lets you play around and experiment with fittings without needing to open the client, own the modules or ship, and before you have the skills. One of its greatest uses is the ability to have a very large number of fits and compare them to each other. Now once you're happy with a given fit and want to actually use it in EVE you can easily save it to the EVE server. The nice advantage of this new method over the existing method of copy the fit to clipboard and save that into the game is that you don't have to have the EVE client open on the same machine as Pyfa. You could in theory (and I would never advocate you do this) have Pyfa installed at work, mess around with fittings, save some fittings to EVE, and then when you log into EVE at home (because you wouldn't do that at the office would you?) the fits would already be available to your character.

62	english	 	 KEEP YOUR EYES PEELED!	That’s not all you’ll see from the Art team in this release.  Also be on the lookout for modified cynosural field graphics, enhanced local repairer effects, impressive new flames issuing forth from your engines, 13 new ships, and improved logos on every ship and station. All in all, New Eden has never looked better!	We recommend taking a moment to reflect on your favorite ship.  Fly around for a few days and reminisce about the great times you’ve had crushing your enemies, seeing them driven before you, and hearing the lamentation of the crewmen.  
62	english	 	 KILL MARKS	The final blow is more than simply a moment when danger ebbs because the number of enemies has decreased by one. It’s not just a decluttering of the overview. The final blow is one of the most satisfying events in EVE Online. Accordingly, we think that delivering a final blow should have an impact beyond the UI. Destruction of a capsuleer-piloted vessel should be a badge one can wear with pride. The Kill Mark feature reflects that belief.	For every capsuleer opponent slain in space, the vessel responsible for delivering the final blow will acquire a special mark which appears somewhere on the hull.  Any offensive weapon can be used in the killing blow.  Drone, bomb, missile, turret of any kind; if it destroys a piloted ship, it will generate a mark.	These marks represent an active tally and appear in three sizes reflecting their representative values: 1, 10, or 100. When a ship has acquired nine marks of one level, earning another will result in a single mark on the next tier.  In this way, up to 999 kills can be recorded on a ship, using just 27 marks. If you see someone with 26 marks, contact your nearest Logi.	The style of the marks themselves is determined by the manufacturer of the ship; Amarr ships display Amarr-themed kill marks and so on. Pilots can see all the different types of marks by succeeding in combat while flying hulls from each branch of the ship tree. ORE kill marks are particularly delightful.	Naturally, there are some rules about how these marks are earned. Ships do not get a mark for indirect kills. That means damage assists, logistics support, and EWAR combat garner no credit; it’s a kill shot or nothing. To those who fleet up with known opportunists: be on the lookout for kill mark ninjas. Ships don’t get a mark for destroying “lower tier” targets, either.  The destruction of Pods, Shuttles, Rookie Ships, and unmanned vessels represents very little accomplishment to an established combat veteran, and won’t generate a mark. And capsuleers won’t be chalking up hulls with structure, can, wreck, drone, or NPC kills. They may matter, but they don’t count.	In an effort to keep trophy hunters from skewing the numbers, killing players on trial accounts will also not create a mark. And to keep the farming to minimum, no intra-corporate kills will decorate any hull. Seek battle beyond your organization for maximum kill mark adornment.
62	english	 	 The V5++ shaders and textures introduced in the PBR Project gave us the ability to set a dirt level for ships. Initially, we were happy to have that level be uniform across the board. For the past few months, every ship in New Eden has been sporting a fine patina of grease and grime.	Now, however, a new ship will start clean and accumulate dirt over time. The curve from spotless to soiled is gradual, but definite. Players will notice the difference, but everything won’t be covered in soot overnight. The accumulation is linked directly to the initial boarding date of a ship.  The clock starts for any given ship when a capsuleer first makes that ship active. 	We’ve never recorded that date before, so faced with the problem of either generating artificial age data for hulls that have been around for years or starting from scratch, we opted for the latter. With the introduction of this feature, every ship in New Eden shall be fully refurbished to a new, clean state.	Of course, clean ships are gorgeous, and not everyone will want to give up that sparkling New Ship™ gleam.  We’ve included a method by which fastidious pilots can always automatically reset the dirt level on a hull to 0.  In the left-hand panel of the fitting window, below the Ship Skin information, capsuleers will now find a button labelled “Clean Ship.” Clicking that button removes all traces of dirt, as if the ship were newly assembled. One warning: this is an irreversible process, so if you value the visual signs of aging, be careful in the fitting window! And beware of repackaging, which will also reset the dirt level to zero.	Provided that a pilot never clicks “Clean Ship,” and never repackages the hull, dirt will accumulate and dinginess will increase over time, even when a vessel is stored in a hangar or ship maintenance array. We have left the option open for future developments that modify the accumulation curve according to actual events (mining, combat, hours in space, gate/wormhole jumps, etc.) and the graphic programmers are interested in investigating some of those options in future releases.  But for now, days active since the last ship cleaning means dirt accrued. No exceptions.	To keep those ships sparkling, you’ve got to use a little elbow grease.
63	english	 	 (click to enlarge)	On Friday December 4th @ 15:00 GMT a test server called Solace which is running on the TQ Tech III hardware will be available through the new launcher, so if you have not already downloaded the Beta version you should do so. 	We'd like you all to come and try out the new hardware with us so that we can gather some information on how smoothly it's running. All we need you guys to do, is be yourselves! Fly around, shoot eachother in the middle of the face, have some fun and enjoy some spaceship violence. We'll do the rest.	As part of the fun, when we bring Solace online for testing, we've decided that we're going to seed the market in a similar way we do with Singularity, and give you all maxed out skillpoints to play with during the test. We hope to see as many of you there as possible for some fun!	We think a massive fleet fight would be a pretty good test for this, so get your ships ready! We hope you'll join for a massive fight on Friday so that we can see how the new hardware runs!	Please bear in mind, however, that any characters or accounts created after 09:30 UTC on November 30th will not be accessible on Solace, as this is when the mirror from Tranquility was taken. We will not be reactivating any accounts that were inactive on Tranquility at the time the mirror was taken. Additionally, if you changed your password on Tranquility since that date, please use your old password.	Oh, and what's better than closing this Dev Blog with a picture of the new Tranquility Tech III hardware in our testing racks here in Reykjavik?	On a final note, the next blog in this series will be when we are setup and ready in London.	Expect that blog to be published late January 2016. Thanks for all the comments on the first blog! Reading the threads on the forums and on Reddit thread warmed our hearts and I can safely say this hardware is equally arousing to us:	Fly safe guys, we hope to see you shooting at eachother on Friday!

63	english	 	 HOW YOU CAN HELP TESTING!	Some of our eagle eyed players have noticed that there's two test servers that have appeared in your new Beta Launchers: Solace, and Quantum. CCP Falcon had responded to questions about this on the forums, and now this is the Dev Blog that was promised!
64	english	 	 (click to enlarge)	Please be aware that you can also get hold of these SKINs in-game as part of the loot drops from Operation Frostline.	Finally, for those capsuleers who are on a hiatus from flight, we have a couple of seasonal reactivation offers in the works too, so be sure to pay attention to the news for Operation Frostline reactivation offers over the course of the next few days!	As well as all these offers and events, there’ll be the usual host of Festival Launchers, fireworks, snowballs and festive trinkets appearing in the redeeming systems of all capsuleers over the course of the holidays. Be sure to watch out for news for more information on when these will be added.	If you do need assistance with how to redeem items to your characters, then you can check out this knowledgebase article from our friendly GM Team.	We hope you all have as much fun with both the December release and Operation Frostline as we’ve had putting it together, and from everyone here at CCP Games, we’d like to wish all our capsuleers Happy Holidays and best wishes for 2016!	Team Murder Services & Team Astro Sparkle
64	english	 	 (click to enlarge)	Please be aware however that these offers are time exclusive, and these SKINs will be available through other means in future if you wish to get hold of them without purchasing PLEX.	There will also be a number of deals on Aurum that include Serpentis skins for the Catalyst and Brutix. You can check out the packages by hitting the Aurum Store.

64	english	 	 (click to enlarge)	As you can probably imagine, the Serpentis Corporation are a little angry about their operations being exposed, so when you warp to these locations, be sure that you’re adequately prepared to take on several waves of angry Serpentis frigate and cruiser pilots.	Oh, and watch out for other opportunistic pilots like yourself looking to claim the spoils of the firefight, because things could get a little messy.	Leaked manifests suggest loot from these vaults including apparel, synth-grade boosters, ship blueprints, all manner of high and low value modules, implants and Nexus Chips, so there’ll be plenty of trigger-happy pilots looking to make a quick profit from grabbing some of the more exotic salvage.	Also, please be aware that the loot drops will be changing over the course of the holidays to add in even more content, so be sure to keep your eye on the news for more information.	In addition to this, we will be actively monitoring the Twitter hashtag #frostline for cool stories, artwork and pretty screenshots, so be sure that if you’re tweeting screenshots of your escapades during Operation Frostline, than you remember the hashtag for the chance to win a few more prizes including PLEX and signed copies of EVE: The Art Of New Eden.
64	english	 	 HOW DO I GET INVOLVED?	Numerous sources corroborate that sometime within the next 24 hours, Mordu’s Legion Command will publicly release coordinates and details of Serpentis Corporation storage sites located across New Eden.	With permission from the Upwell Consortium and Outer Ring Excavations, as well as with authorization from CONCORD, Mordu’s Legion will declare these sites open season for capsuleer assault, with attacking pilots entitled to any loot that survives the onslaught.	These Serpentis sites will appear globally on the overviews of all capsuleers without the need to scan them down, and will be labeled as “Operation Frostline Target” for ease of identification.

65	english	 	 (click to enlarge)	Any off grid bookmarks may now be on grid bookmarks. They will still be the same distance from the gate, station or asteroid belt you made them around but they will now be visible from that location. 	You can see ships warping in from further away. This is a big one and we have actually wanted to change this for a while, because of the long time interval between when the server updates the physics and interest graph, particularly fast ships can look like they suddenly appear instead of approaching from a direction. Larger grids give us more room to have ships landing from warp, and it also leaves room for us to further tweak warp deceleration curves which we ran into problems with last time we changed warp speeds.	Some locations may have slightly moved in space such as wormholes and faction warfare structures, so bookmarks near these locations will need to be adjusted.	The distance between rooms of missions separated by acceleration gates has increased slightly but hopefully not in any noticeable way.	We have been doing a lot of challenging old assumptions of late, and often with delightful results. Just because something is doesn't mean it should be, and the 2016 spring Citadel expansion is doing plenty of challenging old assumptions which we can't wait to put it in your hands next year. For now though, enjoy more space in your space and the rest of the December 8 release.

66	english	 	 AND FINALLY...	Come join us at the Annual Luminaire Snowball fight, hosted by Commander A9 on December 20th at 21:00 EVE Time, where there'll be a few CCPers ready to have some fun with snowballs and fireworks. You can find out more about the snowball fight, the light shows and the planned secret Santa event by heading on over to this forum thread.	There'll be more information next week on additional Holiday offers, as well as another blog from Team Murder Services. Until then, we've got pirates to hunt down...	o7
66	english	 	 CHRISTMAS COLLECTIBLES!	It's been an interesting year for New Eden and what better way to commemorate it with a set of collectibles trinkets that have a little fun with both player and non-player backstory.	On December 24th, each active EVE Online account will also receive a set of 20 collectible special edition commodities that poke a little fun at some of the adventures and mishaps that have occured over the course of the last year. These will also appear in your redeeming system on character selection.

67	english	 	 Patch Notes For February 
67	english	 	 2018-02-13 - BY CCP FALCON
67	english	 	 The CSM whitepaper has been updated. You can find the new version here. The biggest change has been done to the actual formatting of the whitepaper, information has been put into separate and shorter sections, which should help with finding what you need faster.	This does not mean that no changes were made to the CSM structure and rules though. Here is a quick overview of major changes and a brief explanation of why we have made said changes.	Age restriction has been lowered to 18 years. After trying this out during the last election, we’ve decided to keep the age restriction at a lower mark of 18 years. This provides more opportunities for our younger players who wish to try out a little bit more of space politics and contribute to the development process of EVE Online J	Privacy. Again, after seeing the feedback from the candidates and voters after CSM10 election, we decided to remove the requirement of sharing your real life name publicly if you wish to run for the Council seat. We feel like this is an unnecessary requirement and we would rather let people decide if they want to share their real life information publicly or not.	4 permanent attendee seats. We are increasing the number of permanent seats for the Council because we want voters to have more power over who should attend the summits. As we now bring up to 10 members of the Council to each summit, this is a fairer split.	Replacement mechanism. It’s been a while since we first tried replacing resigned or removed CSM delegates. Now this process has been formalized and is included in a whitepaper. The reasons behind this are very simple. By leaving an empty chair on the Council we are not utilizing the full potential of STV based voting. Besides, having more delegates equals more feedback, so running short is not always the best option. This lets us re-use all votes that were cast during the election. So please pay attention when you vote.
67	english	 	 THE PROCESS	If you are familiar with how we usually run CSM elections you will have noticed that both the candidacy and voting periods were extended. This has been done after considering the amount of applications that were submitted too late in previous years. On top of that, we decided to make people’s lives easier by leaving more time between to make sure that all required security checks are done thoroughly and also to leave some time for all of those amazing player-organized interviews like CSM Watch, Crossing Zebras and Vote Match.	Another big change is the timeline itself, we begin the process earlier and for a good reason. As it often happens, a lot of potential CSM delegates attend Fanfest, however, you should bear in mind that the first CSM summit will be hosted a lot earlier than normally – at the start of CSM11 term, which means, that if you are planning to run for CSM11 you should make sure that you are able to travel to Iceland almost right after Fanfest. There are no solid dates as of now, but we are aiming for May, 2016. Please note, that while the summits are usually 3 to 4 days, selected delegates spend up to 7 days in Iceland around the summit.

68	english	 	 CCP Scarpia	PS: Don't forget to check out our Project Discovery Website!
68	english	 	 PLEASE GIVE US YOUR FEEDBACK	We would really like to hear your thoughts on this feature. Please give it a go on Singularity and if able please show up for the masstest on January 28th at 17:00 UTC (EVE time).	On behalf of the many contributors to Project Discovery
68	english	 	 SISTERS OF EVE	Project Discovery is a classified research program founded and run by the Sisters of EVE. Their project lead, Professor Lundberg, will recruit you and provide you with a basic tutorial to be able to recognize specific patterns in biological samples already classified by experts. As soon as you graduate from the training program, you and other graduated contributors will be tasked with analyzing unique images fresh from the lab. To start you off you are tasked with increasingly difficult tasks which already have a solution, when you have finished with those you will get tasks that don‘t have a solution. Once enough contributors have reached a statistically accurate consensus on a task which has no solution, you will receive a boost to your Project Discovery accuracy rating. For every task you solve, the SoE will reward you with ISK and LP, as well as Analysis Points which contribute to your Project Discovery rank.
68	english	 	 HOW IT WORKS	Many endeavours in scientific research require substantial amounts of human processing on enormous sets of data. Examples of such processing include annotating images to indicate where anomalies are present (e.g., finding stars in an image of the night sky) or classifying images into one of several categories (e.g., to identify which proteins are present in an image of a cell). Performing such tasks computationally is very difficult, but non-experts can learn to do so proficiently with only minimal, example-based training.
68	english	 	 AIM OF THE PROJECT	Together with Swiss startup company Massively Multiplayer Online Science and Reykjavík University, CCP has been working on bringing real world scientific research into the EVE game experience. For the launch of Project Discovery we are collaborating with The Human Protein Atlas (HPA), a swedish research group that builds and provides a public database of human proteins that gets used by thousands of medical research groups. By participating in Project Discovery you will be helping HPA to analyze new protein images to expand their database and in turn contributing to the wellbeing of future patients being treated around the world.
68	english	 	 SCIENTIFIC EVE COMMUNITY!	We are here to tell you about the next milestone for Project Discovery which is arriving on the test server Singularity. Those of you who‘ve followed news about this feature may have seen our presentations on it at EVE Fanfest and EVE Vegas last year. If you haven‘t but are interested in the design philosophy behind it, we recommend you watch them.

69	english	 	 NOW WHAT?	The fact that we’ve now finally unlocked the possibility of having special purposed cameras that we can easily switch between has already sparked a lot of very interesting ideas, so don’t be too surprised if you’ll see some more camera related improvements in the future. There are some crazy ideas flying around let me tell you!	While the new camera remains in opt-out Beta (which, again, will be for about a month) we’ll be extra focused on monitoring feedback and making changes/fixes accordingly, so please make sure to voice your opinions on the forum thread attached to this blog sooner than later.
69	english	 	 To accompany the new camera modes, we’ve cleaned up the camera settings section in the System Menu (ESC). We’ve unified all camera related settings under the one “Display & Graphics / Camera Settings” section, added settings for “Camera speed”, “Invert Y-axis” as well as options to disable the new Orbit Camera “Ship Speed Offset” and “Dynamic Field of View” as we recognize that the more dynamic behavior simply isn’t for everyone.	For those of you that don’t agree with us that the old camera needed a bit of work can simply turn off those two options, crank the camera speed up a bit and stick with the Orbit Camera, making the experience pretty much identical to the old setup.
69	english	 	 MARQUEE SELECT	Marquee select is simply the act of drawing a box on the screen using the mouse to select one or more things. It can now be triggered by holding down any of the combat command shortcuts (ALT for “Look At” or C for “Track”, etc.) and dragging with the left mouse button over the 3d scene. On releasing the mouse button, the selected command will be performed on the selected entity or entities. Even though this new feature is not strictly tied to the new camera modes, it ended up in this package as it allows you to apply camera commands such as “Look At” and “Track” within the 3d scene, hassle free, as opposed to relying on the overview or right-click menus. “Look at” is now implemented to work nicely even when you select multiple entities at once, essentially allowing you to drill down into large clusters of ships step by step.	The nice side effect is that marquee selection also works nicely with any other in-space command such as “Orbit”, “Approach” or “Warp”. One of the major reasons why it previously wasn’t practical to play the game relying mostly or only on the 3d scene was the near impossibility of picking those tiny brackets moving at lightning speeds. Marquee selection solves this problem quite elegantly as it’s much, much easier to draw a box around a handful of moving pixels than it is to click them. Oh, did I mention you can now use CTRL + Marquee to target multiple things at once? It’s pretty neat. We also added a new “Select” command to be used with marquee which is triggered by holding SHIFT.
69	english	 	 Fixed first person view with wide field of view	Military jet style roll and pitch indicators overlay for orientation	3 level stepped zoom
69	english	 	 FIRST PERSON CAMERA	The First Person camera (ALT+3) is probably the least practical (at least for now), yet most jaw dropping of the three. It is highly recommended that you try it out with the not-so-long-ago-introduced manual flight feature that is mapped to the keyboard arrow keys by default.	Features:
69	english	 	 Field of view is fixed at a wide angle and none of the cinematic shenanigans of the orbit camera is present.	Panning is done by dragging with the right mouse button.	Camera is attached to an object by Performing “Look At” and detached by panning	The Look at command preserves zoom distance, so we essentially just pan the camera. This way battlefield overview and awareness is preserved as well.	Tactical overlay is turned on by default, but can still be toggled on or off.	While detached, the camera zooms toward the cursor instead of the center of the screen making it possible to traverse the field easily using zooming only. While attached, zooming works the same way as for the orbit camera.
69	english	 	 TACTICAL CAMERA	The Tactical camera (ALT+1) is designed to be purely practical and works in a similar manner to Real Time Strategy cameras by allowing panning. Objects can be attached to by performing the “Look At” command, and detached from by panning away with the right mouse button. In this mode, we don’t have any of the cinematic effects of the orbit camera present.	Features:
69	english	 	 Dynamic Field of view (FOV), decreased as you zoom in, providing a much more epic sense of scale and a wider view angle when zoomed out for better overview of the action.	Ship position on screen is offset based on the speed vector of your ship, giving a much improved sense of speed and trajectory.	Smoother, yet faster zooming/orbiting, accompanied with a new camera speed setting in the system menu (this applies to all camera modes). Zooming now follows an exponential curve so you can zoom out all the way really quickly, while maintaining nice granularity close to the ship.	When looking at other ships, camera is allowed to drift slowly, making it very easy to set up super cool fly-by shots. Drifting can be temporarily disabled by holding down the left mouse button for a steady view when you need to take a closer look. When looking at your own ship, we allow an almost negligible amount of drift to achieve a subtle parallax effect as the nebula moves by ever so slowly.	Manual FOV zoom by holding ALT while zooming. Dolly zoom by holding CTRL while zooming.	Tracking now works in the same way as all other in-space commands work instead of having a special mode toggled on/off previously; you either click the new “Track” button in the “Selected Item” window, radial menu or right click menu. The shortcut key for Tracking is still the same though; C. The tracking camera implementation has also changed so that we now always keep the tracked object center-screen, while pushing the foreground object to the side as we zoom in.	New chase mode is activated by tracking the ship you’re already looking at, locking the camera straight behind your ship. This mode works amazingly well with manual flight! If you’re already looking at your own ship, this mode can be triggered by pressing the ship HUD Orbit Camera button again, or using the corresponding shortcut.	The “Look at” command is now also available for items far away, but instead of the camera travelling light years, we just rotate it in place so the object is centered at the screen, which is very handy for, say, directional scanning.
69	english	 	 ORBIT CAMERA	The Orbit camera (ALT+2) is active by default when you first enter the game and is fixed on orbiting around an object in space. You can switch to a new object by performing the “Look At” command on that object. This camera is designed to give the player a somewhat cinematic feeling and try to emphasize things like scale and speed while behaving pretty similar to the old camera in other regards.	Features:
69	english	 	 The video description contains time stamps to the various sections and features described below.
69	english	 	 I want to make it totally clear that my uncharacteristically careful phrase selection of “not suitable” to describe the old camera code is in NO WAY linked to the fact that it was originally written by our glorious, all-loving, all-knowing, dear CEO (that should be enough to keep my job).	Jokes aside, requirements and standards have changed quite a bit in the last 16 years, so even though the old camera did its job just fine when created and has had its share of fixes and improvements throughout the years, it was well overdue for a rewrite. What we have now is a system where multiple, special purposed cameras can happily live side by side to give you the best view possible of New Eden. As a result, we now have three different in-space cameras instead of the one before:

69	english	 	 UNBOXING THAT NEW CAMERA	Good day spaceship people. We have been actively working on a massive upgrade to the EVE in-space camera over the last few months. We initially released it to our public test server, Singularity in November and then moved it to opt-in beta on Tranquility last December, enabling us to collect a lot of great feedback. We’ve gathered a lot of data and made a lot of changes, fixes and improvements.	It is now time to take the next step, which is to turn the new camera on by default on TQ. Since changes to fundamental parts of core gameplay systems can be delicate, we’ve decided to keep the option of reverting to the old camera for about 1 month as of now. If, for whatever reason you feel it necessary revert, please us the forums to let us know why so that we’re able to squash any remaining issues before we pull the final plug on the old camera’s dwindling life support.	The initial driver for this substantial chunk of work was the identified need for a tactical camera that wasn’t necessarily attached to a space entity all the time—in preparation of the Capital rework and more coming in the EVE Online: Citadel Expansion. When we started digging into the code, we quickly realized that the old camera wouldn’t be a suitable foundation. During that digging we also found this:	/*************************************************************************************		EveCamera.h
70	english	 	 THE END	As usual please remember all the above numbers are still works in progress! Expect changes in the future based on feedback and iteration. We are planning to release the new structure skills and change the existing structure components as mentioned in the last Blog in March to give you guys some time to adjust before we release Citadels. We are also planning external playtests on our test servers, so keep your eyes peeled for updates.
70	english	 	 5 blocks / hour	We initially announced a new fuel block type that would be produced from all racial isotopes, but after much internal debate we’ve come up to the conclusion this creates a certain number of issues, one of which being too much hassle to import all the materials around.	As such we are going to allow the four existing fuel blocks to work with the Citadels for greater flexibility. Since Citadels don’t use Strontium Clathrates for their reinforcement mode, we will add this particular material into the composition of the four existing fuel blocks to maintain its demand. The current number we have in mind is 400 units of Strontium Clathrates for a batch of 40 fuel blocks.	As a side note, we are not going to require the use of the infamous Starbase Charters in high-security space as we feel it is an overkill requirement.

70	english	 	 FUEL USAGE	Unlike existing Starbases, new structures will only require fuel when service modules are online.	The fuel cost is split up in two:	One time cost for onlining, to discourage players from swapping service modules on and off to save fuel	A recurring cost, charged at the beginning of each new hour, not 60 minutes after the module was activated. This is made to simplify fuel calculation costs for the user when faced with multiple modules	Since fuel costs are tied to individual service modules, it will be possible to consume more than existing Large Control Towers, or less than Small Control Towers depending on which activities are available. Below is a list of the four service modules we intend to ship with the Citadels and their associated fuel costs.

70	english	 	 There may be exceptions to this – for instance the reprocessing rigs below do not follow this pattern as we want to preserve existing reprocessing differences between structure types.
70	english	 	 Co-Processor: increases structure CPU at the expense of powergrid	Signal Amplifier: increases structure maximum locked targets and scan resolution	Reactor Control Unit: increases structure powergrid at the expense of CPU	Rigs:	Structure rigs will work a bit differently from ship rigs. While they require calibration and a matching structure hull size to be fitted, it will not be possible to fit more than one rig that affects the same attribute twice. For example, while you could fit the Medium Missile Application I and Medium Missile Projection I from the list below, it is not possible to fit both a Medium Missile Application I rig and the Medium Missile Application II rig on the Astrahus, or even two  Medium Missile Application I rigs.	Another difference is that structure rig bonuses will vary based on the solar system security-status of the structure they’re in. As such, low-security, null-security and wormhole spaces will always receive better rig bonuses compared to high-security structures. This is made to preserve the various changes in gameplay in those different areas.	Finally, rigs of different sizes will offer the same bonuses, but will cover more or less attributes. For instance, while a Medium Missile Application I rig would offer 10% increase missile explosion velocity, the Large Missile Application and Projection I rig will still give a 10% increase to missile explosion velocity while also increasing missile velocity by 10% at the same time.
70	english	 	 Multi-spectrum ECM: equivalent to ship ECM in almost every way, except its racial strength can be changed through scripts	Remote Sensor Dampener: works in the same fashion as its ship counterpart	Stasis Webifier: works in the same fashion as its ship counterpart	Tracking Disruptor: works in the same fashion as its ship counterpart	Target Painter: works in the same fashion as its ship counterpart	Warp Scrambler: works in the same fashion as its ship counterpart	Low-slots	Ballistic Control System: increases Anti-capital, Anti-subcapital missiles and Guided Bombs damage and rate of fire	Guidance Enhancer: improves explosion radius and velocity of Anti-capital missiles, anti-subcapital missiles and Guided Bombs
70	english	 	 Anti-capital Launcher: launcher fitted with missiles dedicated at taking capitals and supercapitals down. Their large explosion radius and poor explosion velocity are not suited for shooting subcapital ships.	Anti-subcapital Launcher: launcher capable of using missiles made for shooting subcapital ships. Opposite of the Anti-capital Launcher listed above.	Guided Bomb Launcher: uses guided bombs, which combine the tracking nature of missiles with the damaging area of effect of bombs. Has three ammunition types, one aimed at taking battleships down, another focused on killing frigates, and the last one having a capacitor draining effect	Large / X-Large Energy Neutralizer: works exactly the same way than regular ship Energy Neutralizers. However, this specific module has a much larger amount of neutralized capacitor, capable of threatening capitals and crippling battleships	Small / Medium Energy Neutralizers: same effect as above, but aimed against smaller ships.	Point Defense Batteries: not to be confused with the flak missiles, this weapon generates AoE damage all around the structure, primarily to deal with enemy drones or frigates	Ship Tractor Beam: a variation of the standard tractor beam. However it pulls ships instead of wrecks closer to the structure. The Ship Tractor Beam does not warp scramble its target however, which may cause it to align faster or slower depending on the angle on which it is pulled	Arcing Vorton Projector: structure Doomsday module. Fires a beam of energy on the primary target, which then bounces on the five closest additional targets.	As a side-note, the various missiles shot from the structure launchers will either have high hitpoints or be invulnerable to attack to minimize firewall tactics. This will be decided during playtests. We are also going to increase all capital ship signature radius to at least 10km to account for the structure missiles listed above.	Med-slots	Bumping module: causes all ships around the target to be bumped away at speeds based on their respective masses. Imagine being bumped by several raging Machariels and you will have a good idea on how this module operates
70	english	 	 Service slots	Market Hub: provides Market service to the structure. Cannot be fitted on Astrahus. Market orders are region wide, except in Wormhole space where they are system wide	Cloning Center: provides medical and jump clone capabilities to the structure. Cloning Centers in Wormhole space structures will not allow players to jump clone back into the system, but can be used to swap clones around	Reprocessing Plant: provides reprocessing capabilities to the structure	Compression Plant: provides compression capabilities to the structure	High-slots
70	english	 	 MODULE AND RIG LIST	We have listed most of the structure modules and rigs that will be shipped in the first release in the “Building your Citadel, one block at a time” blog. Now is the time to give you more details on what those modules actually do.	As usual, please note all names and numbers are subject to change based on time and playtests.
70	english	 	 Service slots will use powergrid and CPU like regular modules.	Existing ship modules cannot be fitted into the Citadels, and vice-versa.	As mentioned on the “Citadels, Sieges and you v2” blog, the new structures automatically repair themselves during the repair state, as such there is no shield recharge rate on them.	The damage mitigation is a hard limit on incoming damage the structure can take in a specific amount. More details on the blog linked just above.	Citadels will be able to use fighter and fighter-bombers and their new mechanics tied to the capital ship overhaul also coming in the Citadel expansion.	It is likely that Citadel slots and fittings will not be fully used during first release. This is intentional as we plan to add more modules as time passes.	The new structures will be immune to most form of Electronic Warfare (EW) – specifically anything that can impede targeting, like ECM or Sensor Dampening.
70	english	 	 Some explanations:
70	english	 	 Since the Citadels have slots, they rely on standard ship fittings like powergrid, CPU, or even calibration to install modules.	Details are listed below:
70	english	 	 For Citadels, these will be:	25% bonus to all Citadel rig strength	25% reduction to all Citadel service fuel costs	25% bonus to all Structure Missile Launcher damage	Unlike ships, these bonuses are fixed and not dependent on character skill level. In fact, no existing skill will affect any of the structure hulls, modules or rigs. That means Engineering will not increase powergrid on any of the new Citadels for instance, and that none of the missile support skills will function for the structure missile launchers.	This decision was made on purpose to:	Prevent some poor soul from having to stay forever locked inside a Citadel to provide skill-level related bonuses	Narrow the gap between new players and veterans in terms of skill proficiency when assuming direct control of the new structures. We want all players to be able to competitively participate, not require dedicated alternate accounts	We are still going to require a few skills to operate the structures and give few bonuses, but their effects will be limited for the reasons mentioned above.	Structure Missile Systems: increases damage by 2% of all Structure Missile Launchers per level	Structure Defensive Systems: reduces capacitor need of all structure defensive modules by 2% per level (not listing specific modules here since most of them won’t make it in the first Citadel release)	Structure Electronic Systems: reduces capacitor need of Electronic Warfare, ship tractor beam, and bumping modules by 2% per level	Structure Engineering Systems: reduces capacitor need of the Doomsday Device and Capacitor Warfare modules by 2% per level	All of these skills have rank 2, train with Charisma and Willpower, and have very low skill requirements.	Please note the Starbase Defense Management skill will stay untouched until we remove Starbases, at which point it will either be repurposed or reimbursed.
70	english	 	 STRUCTURE BONUSES AND SKILLS	In the same fashion that a Caldari Raven battleship doesn’t have the same role than a Scorpion, not all structures are going to be alike. Structures will focus on different themes, each having specific strengths and weaknesses. Citadels focus on defense, logistics, and office capabilities, which make them naturally good as staging points. Other structures we will introduce with time will tackle other fields like industry, resource harvesting, propaganda, intelligence or even long distance movement.	What that means in practice is that, while most of the various structure rigs and modules that are going to be available can be fitted into any type of hull, some will be better suited than others at a specific task. For instance, while a Fortizar (large Citadel) could be fitted with manufacturing service module and rigs, it will not offer as good Material Efficiency and Time Efficiency rates as a dedicated Assembly Array structure fitted on the same fashion.	This specialization will be achieved through the use of specific bonuses available on each of the new hulls.
70	english	 	 FITTING SUMMARY	Fitting of the Keepstar during one of our internal playtests.	Let’s recap what we have already talked about regarding fittings in case you haven’t followed progress closely  since Fanfest 2015.	Unlike existing Starbases (also known as Player Owner Starbases or POSess), the new Citadels will not rely on deploying multiple structures to add more functionality to your little space castle. They will use a fitting system in a way almost identical to ships, with slots and modules to achieve customization gameplay.	These slots are sorted into different categories:	High slots: dedicated to active modules--primarily weapons but also remote assistance modules--like our new structure missile launchers	Mid slots: mainly aimed towards electronic warfare and electronic / remote assistance modules like ECM, Sensor Dampeners, or Target Painters	Low slots: primarily used by engineering and passive modules, like weapon upgrades or reactor control modules	Service modules: a new layer of modules designed to provide functionality currently offered by NPC stations or other in-game structures like Manufacturing, Research, Market, or even Cloning	Rigs: provide further specialization into a specific structure role. For example, you fit a Market service module into a Citadel to get the basic activity, but the rig will be the item giving you bonuses like NPC tax reduction. Of course rigs are destroyed when removed, which makes them quite an investment

71	english	 	 COMBAT REFITTING	As part of our work on capitals we have put together a capital focus group, comprised of some of EVE’s most experienced capital pilots. They are a great help to us. One of the hottest topics in that discussion group is the proposal we’ve made with the capital rework to restrict refitting in space whenever the pilot has a weapons timer. We are still planning to go forward with that plan and after a long talk on the subject we thought it made sense to include our reasons in this blog rather than just in the focus group.	Let’s talk about why we want to make this change. We feel that it’s essential to the fitting game, and all combat in the game, that you have to make commitment to decisions. These commitments scale depending on their impact (think ammo choice vs ship choice), but ultimately all of EVE is a about meaningful choices and their consequences.	Refitting in space removed an enormous amount of commitment, basically offering all possible fittings to any ship at any time, so long as they have a Capital/Nestor/Depot nearby. The addition of more refitting service options (Depots, Nestors) has brought this issue into sharper relief but the underlying design flaw has been in EVE for many years.	To provide an example of how important it is for competitive games to require some level commitment for certain key choices, imagine the same issue applied to a collectible card game where suddenly it was allowed to swap cards in your deck out for other cards at any time during a match. This would have a hugely negative affect on game-play. Deck construction (fitting design) goes mostly out the window and there’s no need to even bother trying to figure out what deck your opponent is running. Ship fitting serves many of the same design goals that deck construction, equipment choice and talent specs all serve in other games. To make choices truly matter we need some level of commitment and consequences, and as a result we feel we need to slow down refitting in space during competitive situations.	This is not simply about any one specific ship or fitting style. When we mentioned Slowcats at EVE Vegas we did not intend to imply that this change is aimed at that one issue. There are some gameplay issues that can be solved with a narrow scope: by targeting specific ships or modules. On the other hand, some issues represent core design problems that will continue sprouting new problems if we simply treat the symptoms rather than the core cause. We believe that instant combat refitting represents the latter class of issues, a core problem with the meaningful decisions and consequences the game presents its players.	It's not simply about carriers refitting from tank to damage and back, or Macharials swapping autocannons and artillery, or ships fitting warp core stabs mid-combat, or switching racial jammers, or capitals fitting shield, armor and hull tanks to vastly increase their EHP. All of these issues are simply symptoms of the same underlying issue and if we were to deal with each of them individually more related problems would sprout up in their place.	We are not married to any one implementation for enforcing commitment in fitting choices, and we are very open to hearing feedback from the community about how you think this problem should be solved. However we do believe that it must be solved. Our currently proposed solution is that you can’t refit with a weapons timer. Meaning, if you are aggressing a player, or assisting a player ship who is aggressing a player, you can't refit for 60 seconds.	Now, the problem that the capital focus group has raised, and reasonably so, is that combat refitting can add a lot of excitement and strategy to fights, especially for Triage pilots, and they would be very disappointed to lose that game-play. Makes sense. It’s active, it takes sharp thinking to figure out which fit is ideal depending on your situation, and it takes practice. Despite those good reasons, we feel that we can address the amount of mastery and excitement available to Triage pilots without the need for refitting in combat, and that’s exactly what we want to do.	New modules are the first part of our strategy and we listed a few of those above, but we don’t want to stop there. It is important to remember that Force Auxiliaries are new ships and can be tuned specifically for Triage gameplay in both mechanics and stats. We’re exploring a range of options and we’ll continue to work with the focus group as well as blog about any future additions, but ideally we end up in a place where Triage pilots have great ways to express their fitting knowledge before fights, and also plenty of options to flex their tactical mastery during engagements.	Thanks for reading, look for more on the Capital rework as we approach EVE: Citadel this spring,

71	english	 	 While we’re talking about Force Auxiliaries, we though you might be interested in some of the new modules that we’ll be releasing with the Citadels Expansion:	Capital Ancillary Shield Booster and Armor Repairer	Replicating existing Small, Medium and Large Ancillary Shield Boosters & Armor Repairers. The Shield Boosters will require capital sized Cap Booster charges, while the Capital Ancillary Armor Repairer will still use Nanite Repair Paste. The armor versions of these modules will be limited to one per ship just like their smaller cousins.	Remote Ancillary Shield Booster and Armor Repairer	Limited to one per ship, we're introducing Small, Medium, Large and Capital versions. Like the local versions they require Cap Booster charges or Nanite Repair Paste to operate. These modules should add a new aspect of optimization gameplay to repair ships of all sizes.	Capital Emergency Hull Energizer
71	english	 	 No More Force Auxiliary Skills	Our original plan was to introduce a new dedicated Force Auxiliary skill. After player feedback we've decided to go another direction. Force Auxiliaries will instead use a renamed Carrier Skill. If you've already purchased a Force Auxiliary skillbook, the purchase price and any skillpoints trained will be refunded.

It's important to remember that making predictions from unannounced test server details is always done at your own risk.	In particular we want to reassure wormhole players that the mass values for the Force Auxiliaries on our test servers are designed to be released alongside an increase in the maximum jump mass of the existing capital-capable wormhole connections. This per-ship mass limit increase is also designed to accommodate capitals fitting the new capital armor plates. Wormhole connections that currently allow Dreadnoughts and Carriers to pass through will continue to accommodate Dreadnoughts, Carriers and Force Auxiliaries, and will continue to disallow Supercarriers and Titans.	There will also be corresponding changes to the stats of capital remote repair modules and triage modules at the same time. For instance, don't worry about the loss of the range bonuses on the hulls as the range will be added to the base modules to compensate.

72	english	 	 Continuing our efforts to support third-party developers, we are incredibly happy to announce The EVE Online API challenge: Create a piece of software that primarily focuses on use of the CREST API.
72	english	 	 Sovereignty information	Wars	Incursions	Industry	Killmails
72	english	 	 Market information
72	english	 	 Alliance information	Inventory information (categories, groups, and types including a types dogma information)	Universe information including regions, constellations, and solar systems	Tournaments
72	english	 	 Read a characters current location	Dogma information (all dogma attributes and dogma effects)	The ability to set the clients autopilot waypoint
72	english	 	 WHAT DOES CREST OFFER	Here is a brief rundown of some of the things that CREST currently offers:	Read and write of character contacts	Read and write of saved fittings
72	english	 	 THE EVE ONLINE API CHALLENGE	For a long time, EVE Online has offered the ability for third-party developers to pull information from our database servers for use in other applications and websites. Over the years, this ability has spawned the growth of a substantial and active third-party developer community within the greater EVE Online community. As developers, we are constantly amazed by the things you create. We’ve seen everything: from incredibly comprehensive industry and mapping tools; mind boggling espionage and counter-espionage tools; to expansive killboards and so much more.	Over the years our offerings to third-party developers have gotten more substantial and our commitment to providing those services has increased as well. This year alone has seen incredible strides forward in what CREST offers with the addition of saved fits, contacts, and much more.
73	english	 	 No security blog without graphs, so here you go:	All that being said, we wish you a wonderful day in New Eden!	Your friendly neighborhood Security Folks
73	english	 	 ACCOUNT SECURITY	Since we have seen a slight increase in account hacking/hijacking recently, we also want to reiterate some of the good old advice that might help you keep your account safe.	Use strong passwords. Of course, passwords should not be easy to guess or brute-force so make them long and use numbers, lower and upper case letters as well as special characters to make them stronger.	Use Two-Factor Authentication (//community.eveonline.com/news/dev-blogs/two-factor-authentication/). This will make it significantly harder for baddies to steal your account and characters, tamper with your personal information on the account, and cause trouble for you and us in general. We know that Two-Factor Authentication is not fully effective yet (EVE Client Login without Launcher), but the new EVE Launcher (//updates.eveonline.com/date/2016-01-12/#32ebg) is one of the final steps to close this loophole.	Do not share your login information. This is some pretty basic stuff, really. If you share your login information with someone then said info is only as safe as his/her security may or may not be, you have no control over it whatsoever and if they get hacked you get hacked.  That is, if they don't just use your login info themselves to sell off all your things.	Do not use the same password for different EVE Online accounts. Also fairly basic - if one account is compromised then chances are that all accounts are compromised.	Never use your EVE Online username and password for social media, other gaming accounts or gaming forum access and the like. Sites get hacked all the time and it is even not unheard of that usernames and passwords lists are sold to unscrupulous individuals who then use them to steal your stuff.	Make sure your operating system is up to date. Critical security updates are no good if you don't have them.	Scan your computer. New viruses, key loggers, spyware and other malicious stuff is constantly being spawned, so regularly scan your computer with up-to-date antivirus software.	Don't click on dodgy links. Bad guys use fake login pages to harvest login info all over the place and websites with malware abound so be careful what you click on.  For millions of years, bad guys have sent people phishing messages that look legit and ask you to log into your account for one reason or another. We will not be sending you emails too often so be careful and contact us at security@ccpgames.com if you receive something suspicious.	Make sure your account contact information, including real name and email address, is correct in case we have to contact you or verify the account ownership for whatever reason. Also, if you need to reset your password it is important that your email address is correct.	Change your password and don’t store it on a post-it or in a text file. Change it regularly and frequently. If the hackers have old out of date login information then they can't steal your stuff. We also recommend that you use a state-of-the-art password manager.
73	english	 	 From whom you bought it	Proof of purchase – we’ll correlate with our own in-game logs. Usually your proof of purchase or receipt will include all of the 3 items above. 	For your honesty and cooperation, which is sincerely appreciated, you will not be banned. Other actions will be determined on a case by case basis.	We want to point out that this is not intended to encourage anyone to go and buy ISK – if you have already then you can come forward with actionable information and receive amnesty as described above. Repeat offenders who have previously utilized the amnesty program will of course not be viewed in such a positive light. 	We also want to draw attention to the “PLEX for Snitches” program which permits us to reward players with PLEX if they send us reliable and actionable information about security related issues.  For more details on this please go here.
73	english	 	 When you bought it

73	english	 	 Permanent ban	Effective immediately, we are also offering amnesty for ISK buyers who come clean by emailing security@ccpgames.com with actionable evidence of people selling ISK. Such information should include:
73	english	 	 6.B. Selling Items and Objects	“You may not transfer, sell or auction, or buy or accept any offer to transfer, sell or auction (or offer to do any of the foregoing), any content appearing within the Game environment, including without limitation characters, character attributes, items, currency, and objects, other than via a permitted Character Transfer as described in section 3 above. You may not encourage or induce any other person to participate in such a prohibited transaction. The buying, selling or auctioning (or any attempt at doing so) of characters, character attributes, items, currency, or objects, whether through online auctions, newsgroups, postings on message boards or any other means is prohibited by the EULA and a violation of CCP's proprietary rights in the Game.”	Since the collapse of the EVE Gate, humans in New Eden have longed for never-ending piles of ISK. CCP recognizes this demand, and provides PLEX – as a completely legal option for turning your real life cash into precious space bucks. 	We differentiate between those who sell ISK and those who purchase ISK through illegitimate methods, even if both are in violation of the same EULA clause above. This is because those who buy ISK are typically players. We like those.  	ISK buyers are also not in violation of the next EULA clause we’d like to highlight:	2. A. Establishing a New Account	“<…Accounts may not be used for business purposes. Access to the System and playing EVE is intended for your personal entertainment, enjoyment and recreation, and not for corporate, business, commercial or income-seeking activities. Business entities and anyone who is acting for or on behalf of a business or for business purposes may not establish an Account, access the System or play EVE.  Accessing the System or using the Game for commercial, business or income-seeking purposes is strictly prohibited.”	We cut some paragraphs here, and the highlighting is our own, because it is important. It essentially says that when you create an account, you are a person who intends to play the game for fun, and not as a way to make money.  	ISK sellers have always been permanently banned on first offense, which will continue.	ISK buyers have been handled on a two-strike policy, this will also continue:	7 day ban and removal of proceeds
73	english	 	 ISK BUYER AMNESTY INITIATIVE	New RMT initiative: come clean, receive amnesty	The struggle against Real Money Trading (RMT) continues unabated and we are now unveiling plans for a new push on that front, which you may find interesting.  This operation is aptly named “ISK Buyer Amnesty Initiative” and details are as follows:	Let us start with everybody’s favorite reading material, the EULA:
73	english	 	 EVE ONLINE, OVERLAYS, AND YOU	As we receive questions about overlays and EVE Online every now and then we want to use this opportunity to further clarify our Third Party Policy on the topic.	“We do not endorse or condone the use of any third party applications or other software that modifies the client or otherwise confers an unfair benefit to players. We may, in our discretion, tolerate the use of applications or other software that simply enhance player enjoyment in a way that maintains fair gameplay. For instance, the use of programs that provide in-game overlays (Mumble, Teamspeak) is not something we plan to actively police at this time. However, if any third party application or other software is used to gain any unfair advantage, or for purposes beyond its intended use, or if the application or other software violates other parts of the EULA, we may fully enforce our rights to prohibit such use, including player bans. Please use such third party applications or other software at your own risk.”	Let’s go over this paragraph and have a look at the meaning of the important sentences:	We do not endorse or condone the use of any third party applications or other software that modifies the client or otherwise confers an unfair benefit to players.	?**?**?In short: Do NOT use any tools/applications/modifications which either modify the client in any way OR provide you any kind of unfair benefit/advantage.	We may, in our discretion, tolerate the use of applications or other software that simply enhance player enjoyment in a way that maintains fair gameplay.	AS LONG AS it’s fair to everybody - neither you nor anybody else gets any unfair advantage – we are fine with it.	For instance, the use of programs that provide in-game overlays (Mumble, Teamspeak) is not something we plan to actively police at this time.	This is an example of something we do NOT consider unfair, for now. This also includes other in-game overlays which do NOT grant you any unfair advantage. We do not consider it an unfair advantage if you can see who is currently talking in your voice communication tool via the means of an in-game overlay. We also do NOT consider it unfair if you use other comfort overlays which do not affect how the game is played. This includes overlays for chat and IM applications, the Steam overlay, and Web-Browser overlays for example.	However, if any third party application or other software is used to gain any unfair advantage, or for purposes beyond its intended use, or if the application or other software violates other parts of the EULA, we may fully enforce our rights to prohibit such use, including player bans.	We do consider overlays using elements of a second or multiple other EVE clients to be against the rules. It changes the way the game is played and grants the player unfair advantages over other players. For example, having overviews from other EVE clients as overlays on one EVE client would allow a player to get real time intel from all those other game instances without having to switch to the other windows. Similarly, overlays using elements from a second or multiple other EVE clients to allow the player to activate modules etc. on those other game instances without switching to the other client windows are clearly in violation of our rules.	Please use such third party applications or other software at your own risk.	Please be aware of the fact that we do a lot of data analysis which grants us insight into behavior patterns and allows us to detect anomalies. In a lot of cases we do not need to know what you do on the client side because looking at the behavior in our very detailed event logs on the server side allows us to see if you have/had an unfair advantage over anybody else including the game environment. We don’t know all the tools out there and what they do exactly - and frankly we don’t care. If you get banned, then this is because the results of what you did and how you potentially gained from it manifested in our server-side logs.

74	english	 	 MORE ON THE FUTURE	Now that’s impressive on the server performance but we are not in any way done additionally looking forward with our new network setup we are very much focused on network latency and reliability.	Specifically we’re using the automated BGP network solution we ran as a proof of concept while TQ was in its old home, which actively looked for better routes in order to re-route connections through the interwebs if "the box" finds a better path for you. This all happens without socket closure of course.	Tests came in with excellent results. For example we decided to drop one of our Internet Service Provider and contracted another one instead.	Basically if the ISP's are not good enough for EVE players, we drop them and sign someone who has proven to be better and is up for the challenge. This automated BGP solution will go in full production any day now stay tuned for follow up blogs.	Related to that, we have much more powerful edge routers. Here is a message from one of our network wizards	"The EDGE Router in the new data center is now receiving a total of 2.9 million BGP routes from 23 peers. The highest CPU utilization when calculating the best-path BGP table and backup route tables on this new router has been 8% CPU, while using the old router in Telecity, any BGP table recalculation would take the router to 100% CPU. That is quite an improvement in performance!"	We now have our eyes glued to the instruments to see what’s running hot. With the flexibility of TQ Tech III we are in a lot of control to balance load, which is great considering the Citadel expansion is right around the corner with all those capital ship improvements and new structure capture and defend mechanics...	We will start tweaking even further and constantly target pain points to improve your experience flying in New Eden.	On behalf of the operations team I proudly and officially welcome you to TQ Tech III

74	english	 	 (click to enlarge)	The system was not on a reinforced node, and it is in low security space, meaning that a lot of extra calculations are needed on the node for the crime watch system, i.e. keeping track of aggressors, standings, gate guns, etc. Time Dilation can't go below 10% and if it stays at 10% the task queues start filling up and players will experience things like modules not cycling, etc. eventually leading to node deaths. Looking at this graph we can see that TiDi went all the way down to 10% a few times, but the only periods of it staying there only span about 2x ~5 minutes. This means that those of you who did experience issues outside of dilated time, most likely did so during these periods. While TiDi stays above 10% it means the node is successfully processing the task queues with help from the time dilation and here we can see that rather than flat lining at 10%, it managed to stay between 10-20% during the peak of the battle. 
74	english	 	 (click to enlarge)	To read into the last one, you can see how much more responsive you can expect markets to be in Jita for example. The changes not only improve overall responsiveness but also make large fleet fights more viable.	Here is a very interesting graph showing CPU load and Time Dilation (TiDi) on the node that Hakonen was mapped to during the big fleet fight on Mar 2:

Don't read too much into the numbers themselves, they are rather abstract and are there to provide a scale for reference. The average CPU time per user now is about 40% of what it was back before we launched BIAB. Following are subsets of this graph depending on gameplay around Empire Space, Wormholes, and Trading to take a few examples:
74	english	 	 PERFORMANCE CHANGES	Tech III combined with "Brain in a box"(BiaB) have dramatically improved EVE Server performance, but by how much exactly? To give you some sense of scale here and how these changes are likely to affect your gameplay, here are a few graphs to show how load has changed:
74	english	 	 TQ TECH III THUSFAR	A few days have now passed, and we already have had one brawl in Hakonen where 1500 pilots fought, which ran on one of the 25 “standard nodes” of TQ Tech III. The 6 reinforced nodes of TQ Tech III still remain to see proper action so we wait eagerly to see how they perform	We saw reports of both good positive and negative feedback which obviously helps us tweak and fine tune the hardware.	To illustrate the improvements here are graphs of wisdom from CCP Quant!
74	english	 	 (click to enlarge)	1.       This is where we thought everything was fine and man we were happy	About 90 minutes into the run we hit the 100% CPU and it was diagnosed as a stored procedure which hits a bad query plan.	We had seen this happen on TQ before but it’s ultra-rare so we pinned this as a once in a blue moon, and such bad luck it hit us on this day. We went on and took down TQ and started up again.	2.       Second run we were scared it would hit us again, so we pulled back a little bit on the celebration.	Again the launcher and websites did not like the influx of players,  but as time passed that calmed down like before	Again roughly 90min into the run this same symptom hit us again though a different set of stored procedures. Another bad query plan taking down the server with up to date indexes that should not be happening	We raised a code red and called all hands on deck and EVE Development came up with a proposed fix to the stored procedure problem, but they agreed with the Database team that this just didn’t make any sense	We went on and took down the server applied the hot fix.	3.       Shortly after the third startup we saw that the market was not loading correctly and more errors were raised very shortly after the startup--mostly the result of us trying to get the server up and running to fast. Took it down for more preflight checks.	4.       Now we are somewhat into the night and we see social media both understandably raging and opposing positive posts which which boosted morale … Thank you ;)	This is where we still confident that the hotfix would get us through	Here we also found performance draining setting related to the launcher and websites and we also pushed more resources to the web front end machines as we did not have these type of “sudden influx” problems	We watched a countdown timer set to 90 min as that was our longest run. I can’t describe the feeling when we hit 90 minute mark … and it blew for the third time with 100% CPU on the Database.	Since the proposed fix and other measures we did were not working we shortly entertained the idea of fallback but opted first to failover the SQL cluster to a passive node and changed settings with RAM allocation	Had to Shut down yet again and things were becoming very unsettling to say the least.	5.       Fifth Time’s The Charm	We reset our 90 minute counter and  thanks to CCP Seagull who showed up shortly after mid-night with much more Red Bull and treats :)	The waiting game now was getting very intense and next steps were going to be hard if we had to go into a roll back scenario	At 23:47 we were ready for the fifth startup and lifted VIP	We split up the team and some went home to be ready day after others went to sleep in meeting rooms to take shifts throughout the night	Then we watched as the counter went to 80 min …. 85 …. 88 ..... 90……… 91 …………….….92 and then time passed and we hit our 2 hour goal and 2.5 hour goal and finally at 3 hours of run time we felt we were in the clear! 	TQ ran smoothly that night, and within Operations we had set a goal when this whole project started to go live on the 29th and since the fifth startup lifted VIP before midnight we still claim we hit our high level plan.	Sadly, promptly at 09:00 GMT March 1st TQ took itself down which was due to one of couple of automatic downtime settings which were forgotten to set back to its regular 11:00 GMT setting. Just plain and simple human error at fault.	This was how that eventful Monday played through and I can tell you that going through a project of this magnitude over such a long time is extremely hard but also extremely gratifying when you see the fruit of your collective labor.
74	english	 	 CCP DeNormalized 
74	english	 	 The EVE Online Database cluster	So during the extended downtime we took a huge step towards our upcoming data center move. 	One of the main issues we had to overcome was how to get the 2.5 TB database from one data center to the other with minimal downtime.  Also, in addition to the move we need to upgrade both the OS and SQL version (from Windows 2008 R2 to Windows 2012 R2 and SQL 2012 Enterprise to SQL 2014 Enterprise).	Of these two issues, upgrading to SQL 2014 is the biggest concern.  Or rather, not so much the upgrade, but the fallback plan in case we have to revert.  You see, once you upgrade a DB from an older version of SQL you cannot move that database back to an earlier version.  The only way is a DB restore from the same (or earlier) version.	So we decided that the least risk would be to upgrade the TQ DB servers to Win2012/SQL2014 while still in our existing DC.  This meant that on the big move day we had so much less to worry about and we have an extremely familiar environment to work within in-case something went wrong. 	In addition to this, we identified our preferred method of getting the DB to the new Datacenter – SQL AlwaysOn replication.  We could not do this before as the machines have to be in the same Windows Cluster/same OS versions.	So the plan was to merge two separate two-node SQL failover instances into one Windows Cluster and use AlwaysOn to keep the data in sync.  This would give us the ability to fail back from the new DC to the old one if we wanted (which we don’t, but we could!!)!	Part of what took us so long was that we added a pretty amazing (or so we think) test step into the mix…	We started by evicting the passive node of our production DB cluster, re-imaging it with latest OS, and joining it to our existing Windows Cluster in the new Datacenter to create a new single node SQL Cluster.  Lots of stuff involved here in getting a Windows Cluster to span two datacenters--much thanks to the SysAdmin and Network guys!!  	Just as a note, running with no failover partner isn’t something we like to do, but it was necessary and would be for less than 24 hours.	So at 09:00 GMT we shut down everything and continued!  We did things like move the SQL Cluster IP from the ‘old’ cluster to the new single node cluster and copied the smaller DB’s to the new disks.  For the large DB’s just remapped SAN volumes and reattached the databases.	But this brings us to the DB upgrade step. If we attached the SQL 2012 DB to our new SQL 2014 instance it would run an internal upgrade, at which point it would become incompatible with all previous SQL versions.  If something didn’t work for whatever reason, we would have had no choice but to do a restore of the backups we took earlier in the morning.  We would not be able to simply move the volumes back to the old cluster (which was still running, just as a single node as our fallback)	Enter brilliant idea – prior to presenting the SQL 2012 volumes to the new 2014 Cluster we would take a SAN snapshot of those volumes.  We give the snapshot volumes to the new cluster, attach the databases from the snapshot disks, and let the upgrade happen.  We started in VIP to check out some stuff. Things looked good so we removed those DB’s – unmapped the snapshots, destroyed the snapshots, and gave the cluster the ‘real’ disks and did it all again after a reboot.	It took time which contributed to missing the initial target time, but we felt it was worth it!	We added disks to the cluster, setup mount points, attached databases, started Tranquility in VIP mode again.  Woohoo, everything looked great so we opened the gates!	Shortly after opening, we went back to the old cluster and stole its now lonely node.  This was added back into the new cluster and we’re redundant again!	For the most part everything went smoothly… We did have several issues with bringing disks online and it meant a reboot or two (each reboot is 15 minutes).  This cost us the over-extension but we are very pleased with getting to this stage.

75	english	 	 WELCOME TO EVE ONLINE!	When you take your first steps into the universe of New Eden, things may seem a little complex. If you ever feel lost or confused, fret not! The purpose of this Dev Blog is to arm you with the basic knowledge and links to the information that you'll need to thrive in EVE Online, so take a look at what's to follow and see if the answers to your questions are here!	We'd like to give you all a helping hand and try to ensure that you hit the ground running in what is considered by some to be one of the most rich, deep and complex virtual worlds in existence. It's good to know where valuable information is readily available to you, so below are some very good sources of information. Quite a few of them are provided by communities of other players who specialize in helping new pilots.	These sources range from those that are player created, to those created by Developers and Game Masters here at CCP.	Above: Clockwise from top left: Amarr - Impairor, Caldari - Ibis, Gallente - Velator, Minmatar - Reaper	As a rookie pilot, you'll be provided with one of the four basic ships shown above depending on the race of your character. If you lose this ship, don't worry! Simply dock your capsule at a station and the friendly insurance company will provide  you with a new one!	While you'll want to upgrade pretty soon (usually within the first few hours of gameplay), you can find more information on your rookie ship and how many new players use them on the amazing player run EVE University wiki here:	Impairor	Ibis	Velator	Reaper
76	english	 	 The EVE Online development team	A note about Time Dilation (TiDI)	If a 5,806 player battle without instancing sounds like a lot of work for a server to handle, that’s because you have a good sense for how much load that would require.	In EVE, we know that fights like this are a major deciding factor in large-scale warfare, so in order to support them the best we can we introduced a system called Time Dilation.  Its job is to give the server the means to control the amount of load an insane-scale fight like this causes.	The mechanism behind Time Dilation is reasonably simple – if the server cannot keep up with the load of simulation, it slows down time in the solar systems it’s managing.  For example, if there’s twice as much going on than the server can normally handle, it’s got the ability to run that heavy simulation at half speed, bring the rate of load back to something manageable.  Due to how we set up our universe, the effect of this slowdown is localized, often applying to just the problematic system and allowing the vast majority of other online players to continue on as happy as can be blowing up ships, mining, trading, exploring etc as long as they didn’t come near these massive fights.	With the length and intensity of this fight however, this slowdown was not enough to completely cover it, so it hit our limit of running the simulation at 10% of normal time.  It is designed to give players a fairer, more predictable experience (albeit slower) than would take place otherwise.	In anticipation of big fights players can use a Fleet Fight Notification form to request node reinforcement.
76	english	 	 That’s it…for now.	o7 in anticipation of the next thing EVE pilots will do in this great conflict and on behalf of what Kill Screen calls “the game science fiction warned us about.*”
76	english	 	 NEW TO EVE?	Consensus amongst players discussing the war is that right now is the best time in recent memory to start playing EVE. Not only do both sides have corps actively recruiting and set up to help new players, but the entire community is energized and helpful to those who are taking their first steps in the universe. Free trials are always available at www.eveonline.com.	We just recently (and thankfully) released an Updated Rookie Resources Dev Blog with tons of information on how to dive right into EVE.
76	english	 	 RECORD-BREAKING M-OEE8	The battle broke the record for the most Nullsec PVP kills in one day—the previous record was from November 30, 2014.	Peak in one system was 3436 in J-GAMP (6th highest of all time) and the peak population in the constellation was 4659, with a total of 5806 unique characters active in the constellation over the course of the battle (measured by gate jumps by unique characters in the constellation between 20:00 and 00:00).  All of this was hosted on EVE’s new Tranquility Tech III servers.	This makes it the second largest battle in EVE Online (and gaming) history, especially juicy when considering all the active parties involved on both sides bringing in the heavy hitters.	Each one of these dots is a solar system within the EVE Universe. The M-OEE8 system is glowing because the map is set to show recent kills.	With more war to come in the next months, and the Imperium consolidating closer to their tactical reinforcements, it is entirely possible larger battles involving super capital ships (as in the Bloodbath of B-R5RB) will happen over chokepoints and staging systems and perhaps even headquarter systems.	Twitch streamers, war correspondents, podcasters, bloggers, propagandists and more are at the ready to capture the action. With EVE Fanfest on April 21-23 and the next major expansion EVE Online: Citadel coming April 27th, it will be extremely interesting to see how the conflict morphs to adjust to an entire supercapital rebalance, the introduction of new Force Auxiliary Capital ships and doomsday weapons, and of course, the strategic warfare capabilities of new, and massive citadels.
76	english	 	 Edit: For clarity, CFC = The Imperium, they rebranded to Imperium to increase cross-platform marketability (so to other games).	Edit 2: Holy hell, my first gold is for an Eve post, thank you kind stranger!!!!	Here’s another great video recap by Hendrick Tallardar:	And another video from Northern Coalition. with players reacting to the Circle of Two leaving the Imperium. Each one of those colored icons is a player in a spaceship involved in the battle, and the fight is shown from a tactical view of the videocapturer fighting in the battle.	Even the in-game SCOPE news agency has since reacted to conflict and highlighted them in this new report.	For a wider, comprehensive look at the politics and history behind the conflict, this article by TheMittani.com explains things in great detail.	Propaganda for the war is hitting hurricane levels, particularly on the /r/EVE subreddit.	Here’s an amazing player-made piece by Pandemic Legion.
76	english	 	 Original post: //www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/4c5r7q/what_the_hell_is_going_on/d1ff5om

76	english	 	 Big War.
76	english	 	 The largest coalition in the game decided to take a poke at the numerically inferior Low Sec alliances. Instead of crumbling as expected to the superpower, they banded together and pushed them back out of their area of space, taking all of the big coalition's income in the area as they did.	Once people saw it was possible to beat this super-coalition, most of the player groups in the game decided to band together, with encouragement from the enormously rich I Want Isk (IWI) gambling organisation who have grievances with the super-coalitions's component alliances.	Today marked a major victory in taking the strategically important staging system of one of the super-coalition's player groups which caused that group to flip sides to the attackers.	~Very TL;DR~
76	english	 	 Update 2:	So the leader of the CFC, The Mittani, released their version of events from the M-O fight in a soundcloud recording which you can find HERE.	The gist of it is they felt it was at least a partial victory for them, as they were falsely lead to believe that the whole point of the iHub fight was to trap and kill their super capital fleet (neither side fielded their extensive super capital fleets in this conflict). Note the iHub is a structure which grants control of the system (ownership if you will) and allows upgrades of the system, and thus is essential to controlling the system. Edit for clarity: The iHub doesnt give specific control, but is one of many structures that does this in differing ways. Taking the iHub in this situation however gave the Allies enormous leverage over Co2, and takes away all upgrades previously in the system.	Supercap fleets contain the most powerful ships in Eve, Titans and Super Carriers, neither of which can be docked and must generally always be piloted (thus tying up that pilot whilst the individual owns the ship), resulting in added cost on top of their already enormous build costs (for titans, this number is in the thousands of dollars range).	It is worth noting that the iHub timer is considered important because it allows the Allies to control M-O, which is an important stepping stone to the northern regions, where the CFC has retreated to. Whether they remain ignorant of the system's importance, or merely do not consider it to be important is unclear.	Thus you have the two sides of the conflict spinning this massive fight two different ways, with both claiming victory of different objectives.
76	english	 	 Update 1:	As of a few hours ago, the allies / money badgers / whatever won a major strategic victory, successfully taking control of Co2's (a member of the cfc) primary staging system. This is significant because it was defended by the full CFC, lacking only their capital fleet due to their suspicions of a trap (which was actually them reading more into Co2 evaccing than anything).	This was the first major test, and the timer was won whilst inflicting enormous losses from the CFC's subcapital forces, with several fleets being wiped out to a man.	Importantly, M-O is traditionally the bottleneck for accessing the space of the Northern Empires of the past, as it allows access for the allies into the northern regions (where the core of CFC live).	Following the victory, Co2 have declared they will no longer support goons, and it is assumed they will now be supporting the Allies in the hopes of having their space returned to them.
76	english	 	 THE WAR THUS FAR	Rather than recap it ourselves, we’ll let the players do so, as this conflict is entirely player-driven. This great writeup was posted on Reddit by ShadowPhynix. Skip to the TL-DR for the quickest overview.	WTF is going on? The Answer.	So I've been seeing a bunch of wtf is going on posts from travelers or people not fully aware of the war going on in Eve, and I got a few messages to post my writeup on the reddit rather than as a comment. So, without further ado:	The political structure of Eve before the war was CFC, a super-coalition of 40,000 members+ having total dominance in the north of the map, in an area called null sec (or 0.0 space, it's lawless and can be player owned). The hallmark of CFC is enormous numbers of people in generally cheap doctrines (doctrine being a set of ships and tactics) to outnumber an enemy. They were considered to be totally unassailable, possessing manpower and resources far beyond even the most powerful of entities in Eve.	Low Sec (0.1 - 0.4 space) is another area of space, and has some laws (not many though). The LowSec entities (known collectively as LSV) are constantly fighting over "moons" (a way of passively generating income for a player group), and their hallmark is obscenely expensive and skill intensive doctrines, to make up for comparatively very small numbers of players.	CFC, the big group up north, have been stagnating because no one wants to fight them (they're known for making fights not fun, by intentionally lagging servers, avoiding fights and when they do fight, bringing so many people they can't possibly lose). To counter-act this, they declared war on LSV to take their moons (the passive income thingys) and force them to fight.	This didn't work. Instead of steamrolling the LSV groups with minimal preparation and effort, they got crushed in pretty much every engagement. By this I mean they'd lose full fleets and kill only one or two ships in return. Gradually they got a little better, but they almost never did "well," almost always losing, and continued to be demolished by fleets that at times were a quarter their size or less.	To counter-act this, they prepared better and got more numbers. In response, the LSV entities put aside their constant squabbling and war mongering to band together into what is affectionately known as "Forming Voltron." (thus the name, Low Sec Voltron – LSV). LowSec Alliances might constantly fight and war with their rivals, but they all hate one thing above all others, and that’s outsiders. The same thing happened again, with CFC losing fights, but on a much larger scale with fights involving thousands of pilots.	After not only defending all their own moons, the LowSec entities proceeded to wipe CFC out of LowSec, taking all their valuable moons in the process. While this was happening, one of the larger Alliances in the CFC (who are a coalition of alliances) pissed of a group called I Want Isk (IWI), and enormously rich and powerful gambling organisation. Something about theft and betrayal, but regardless, they decided to pay these low sec groups to get revenge against the CFC for them (and is likely a major catalyst in them forming together so quickly).	Having successfully expelled CFC from Low Sec, LSV looked for future targets, and with likely direction from the IWI (gambler guys) and Tishu's BLOPs (battleships with a very long range jump drive to attack farming ships) campaign in Fade, set their sights on the north. With the assistance of virtually every major entity in Eve, who answered the call to arms from either being paid by IWI or the glory of the next major war, the new Coalition (who have yet to decide on an official name, although Money Badger Coalition (MBC) seems to be a front-runner) have begun an invasion.	Spread across numerous regions and hundreds of systems, MBC have begun to systematically drive out CFC from their homes. Currently most of the alliance sin the CFC are in full retreat, after having lost several regions that were previously thought to be impregnable. As it currently stands, a large portion of the CFC have been ordered to withdraw to the far north, the home of Goonswarm, the leaders and core of the CFC. A recent address by the leader of goonswarm indicates they intend to use the north as a base to harass the allies as they grind the regions in order to control them totally. As the allies begin to grind out the regions which are increasingly being left undefended, the last few pockets of resistance such as the Co2 Alliance are gradually being worn down.	It is assumed that at some point the allies will move further north, once their latest conquests are secure, to take the fight to Goons. If this happens, you can be almost certain that we will see another battle such as that of B-R5RB several years ago (you can look that up, CFC won that one), which resulted in hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of assets being lost.	In other words, it’s the war of a century in Eve, with pretty much the entirety of the PvP groups in the game all allied against a single super-coalition. Regardless of who wins, it's going to be a really cool time to be in the game.

77	english	 	  CONCLUSION	Overall this contest was a huge success. Not only did people have fun participating and some people got sweet prizes but there are now some amazing new tools out there for the community to enjoy. We want to seriously thank everyone who participated in this contest and we hope they all enjoyed spending time on something a little different. 
77	english	 	 Better define the judging criteria	One of the things that came up during the judging was how we all defined the criteria differently in our heads. This lead to a lot of instances of us having to discuss things that should probably just have been defined better. Things like should technical difficulty be how difficult of a task the application is trying to solve or should it be how much of CREST the application is using since the contest was about CREST. While we were able to resolve this in the end we should have had all of this defined better up front. The other part of this was how slow we were to get into the judging as we all sort of had different ideas of how to do it. For the next challenge we hope to answer all of these questions internally before we announce the contest.
77	english	 	 THINGS WE LEARNED	Setting up/Compiling/Running many projects in different languages and platforms is hard	One of the things we under estimated was how much time we would have to spend trying to get every project to run. While some projects had demo web sites running or pre-compiled binaries/setup files we wanted to be able to run the entries locally where possible to ensure the version we were judging is what was submitted. We tried to run most of them in Vagrantfiles but even then simply understanding how each of the different languages and frameworks works was not a small task. In the future I think we will require that entries include a version we can run out of the box. For web applications this will probably mean a Vagrantfile or Dockerfile and desktop applications needing a compiled version we can just run.
77	english	 	 HONORABLE MENTIONS	MarketBot: God we love and hate the developer of this. We love him for creating such an amazing application that some of us now have installed our phones and hate him for not including the MIT license and therefor being disqualified. If you have an Android phone we highly recommend checking MarketBot out.	Reset: For those that fly on NPSI roams this would be a really useful tool. It fetches a list of corporation and alliance contacts and then sets them all to neutral for your character and since character contacts override corporation and alliance you can now go on an NPSI roam without fear of shooting blues! When you're done the website resets your contacts back to how they were before and you get to hope your alliance and corporation diplomats agree that shooting blues is how New Eden life is meant to be!	Dynamic Exploration Route Planner (DERP): This was a great little entry. It targets a specific task and makes a minimal but very complete tool to solve the problem. Definitely something a few of us at the office will be actively using. This is the first project the author has distributed to the public, and definitely one to be proud of.	EVE Online Atlas: Atlas uses a really cool technique based on chatlog scraping to allow users to control a browser based information dashboard using chat commands inside the EVE client. This one generated a lot of buzz around the office, and definitely takes the prize for "most awesome hack"!	pizza-auth-3: This stood out as one of the entries which implemented a planned feature ahead of time, out of client. In this case, the contact groups system. By itself that wouldn't be all too impressive, but it also combines this with the location API to provide location+group aware notifications, as well as providing a LDAP authentication layer for use with other alliance services. It is a highly technical entry, the scope of which would only be useful to a select few who run their alliance IT infrastructure. But if you happen to be one of those people, this app could really tie your alliance services together. 	EVE Fitting Bot: Ever been on your corporation or alliances chat service outside the game and had someone request a fit for a ship? If you were in the game you could just link them the perfect fit you have saved but what about out of game? That is where this bot comes in, if you're using Discourse that is. It allows you to quickly and easily get a list of your fits from game and display them as an EFT fit right in chat.	OSXNeocom: Neocom is an awesome little OSX app for managing your characters skill queues, PI installations, looking up prices on the market, and a fitting tool. The way the fitting tool splits up modules by slot type is really intuitive, and the way it uses CREST to store and send fittings to the client makes it easier than ever to share/modify fits between your characters. This app has a ton of polish and is definitely worth checking out if you have a mac.	For a full list of all entries see this spreadsheet.

77	english	 	 CCP Seagull: Contact management was one of the first read-write APIs we got working internally with CREST years ago, and we've had test implementations of contact management running internally for a long time. That we have been able to now actually release these APIs on Tranquility and can see the kind of good looking and nicely featured contact management utility app like the EVE Online Contact Manager realized and accessible to players, to me represents one small victory for the vision we had for CREST. That's why this app gets my special price - having this kind of app created by actual third party developers on a fully functioning CREST and authentication stack, instead of internally by us on test infrastructure not actually usable outside CCP - that's what makes this special for me, as I have been involved with CREST development from the very beginning.

77	english	 	 OUR PROCESS	The first step for us was to fork all entries so that we could ensure we were looking at code submitted before the deadline. With all of the repositories forked and pushed to //github.com/eve-online-api-challenge it was easy for us to browse the code online and share it with everyone involved in judging. From there we went through and eliminated all entries that didn't conform to rules such as not including the MIT license and having been worked on before the contest started. Fortunately (or unfortunately if you are one of us who had go through all of the entries) this only removed a few entries from the list. From here we went through all of the entries and began the more serious judging which involved trying to get each entry running locally. After a first pass of judging we were able to sort all of the entries by a rough rank. This let us trim the list down to about 15 entries from which we began taking a more serious look at. Finally we sat down as a group and had a number of discussions about the handful of entries we thought were at the top until we had our top three entries in ranked order.

79	english	 	 WHY CHANGE THE EVENTS?	We received a lot of positive feedback about the past year's events at Fanfest 2016 and at the CSM Summit, but this was tempered by concerns about event visibility. We've been relying on social media, web pages, emails, SCOPE videos, and word of mouth for the events so far, but that has still left some pilots frustrated by missing the call to arms. We want to fix that for Shadow of the Serpent!	Previously, if you wanted to take part in one of these larger events you would have to check EVE social media pages or find a link to the event page (e.g. //www.eveonline.com/thehunt/). After this you'd need to roam between systems hoping to find the event content. We think this put too high a barrier on participation for the new content and was particularly troublesome for getting your friends or new players involved!  We also want to ensure we can keep the events feeling fresh and exciting.  For the past few events we have released 1-2 new sites but we wanted to create a framework for supporting more playstyles and also experimenting with new types of PvE through events.  This new UI gives us a great opportunity to do that; we will be able to experiment with new types of content and release them through the Scope Network in events for eager capsuleers.;	Good luck capsuleers! We are looking forward to hearing your thoughts on the Shadow of the Serpent event coming to New Eden on June 28th and your ideas for future events!
79	english	 	 HOW DO YOU PARTICIPATE?	When the June release goes out you can log in and check out the available challenges in the Scope Network window.  The Scope Network will offer you several optional challenges that they are distributing to capsuleers - if you complete them they will offer you new challenges, and if you leave them be they will expire after 3 days.	As you complete challenges, you will see your points total increasing and how many remain until you unlock the next reward. Your progress on challenges will be logged so you can take a break whenever you like and pick up again when you return. For the Shadow of the Serpent we will also have special rewards for the capsuleers with the most points earned during the event!	Remember, the challenges in the images are just prototypes - we don't want to spoil the surprise!  We are excited to see how the Shadow of the Serpent goes and will be eagerly awaiting your feedback so we can work with the Scope Network to try new things for the future!
79	english	 	 WHAT’S THE TWIST?	The Shadow of the Serpent earns its name from the hidden Serpentis arms race we will see happening over the next few weeks.  Naturally, many organizations within New Eden are pretty unhappy with the Serpentis creating new, advanced tech with an intention to distribute and will do anything to put a stop to this and they want your help!	With so much happening in New Eden lately, the major corporations and factions are overwhelmed with work and will reach out to the newly independent Scope Network for help.  The Scope Network will use this opportunity to start up a new business venture, as a broker service between the major organizations of New Eden and the real powerhouse; the capsuleers!  To help the Scope Network succeed in this venture, we have been working on a prototype framework for a new way to display events happening in-game.	The available activities displayed on this prototype are not Shadow of the Serpent challenges and are just for testing purposes, but it will still give a good idea of the look and feel of the new events UI.	When an event is happening, you will be able to see event specific challenges in your character selection screen. These will also appear in the new Scope Network window in-game, which you can access via the Neocom.  Over the course of the event, which will run for 6 weeks, you will notice a much wider variety of available challenges including roaming Serpentis and Angel Cartel pirates and 9 new event themed sites complete with loot and bounties.  On top of that, each time you complete a challenge listed on your Scope Network window you will earn points towards small, medium and large Scope Network prize containers. These containers will contain some very nice rewards, a selection of which will be available for the first time during Shadow of the Serpent.

You'll also take shifts in the commentary booth providing live commentary on the matches themselves. You need to know your PvP and you need to know how to keep on talking! Finally, you’ll be helping us create some extra videos about the tournament and the teams participating during the week between the two final weekends.	Alliance Tournament XIV will broadcast for two consecutive weekends starting on Saturday, October 8 and ending with the grand finale on Sunday, October 16. Flights (from all Icelandair destinations) and accommodations are supplied by us. All you need is a little spending money.	Are you interested? The next step is to check this short list and make sure you match what we're looking for!	Can you come out and play? Selected players will need to hold a valid passport (we will require scans to confirm this at a later stage) and be available to fly to Iceland on Wednesday, October 5 and return home on Monday, October 17.	A sense of humor is a must. Commentators will need to be sharp-witted, knowledgeable, presentable and comfortable with talking on camera and into a microphone. To increase your chances of getting through, we highly recommend submitting any pre-made or purpose filmed video you have of yourself (link to a YouTube clip!) as part of your application. Samples of you commentating e-sports matches are even better!	You need to know your PvP: We don't despise industrialists, mission-runners and miners but as this is a PvP tournament and you need to be well versed.	You must be 21+ in order to apply.	If you are interested in taking part, please email us at evetv@ccpgames.com by 23:59 UTC (Eve Time) on Sunday July 11th, 2016 with the following information. Those lucky enough to be selected for the second round of eliminations must be available to attend voice chat interviews on Saturday July 16th, 2016. The chosen commentators will be announced on the following o7 Show.
81	english	 	 Bans are done in 1 – 2 – 1 order. For example: Team A will take the first ban, Team B will take the second and third ban, and Team A will finish the banning phase with the fourth ban.	Each ban has a time limit of one minute; if no ship is selected within that timeframe the ban is forfeit.	Once the bans start, a drop down menu will appear where you select the ship to ban. You can type the name of the ship to speed up the process.	Please be aware that banning a ship will not remove it from the list. Selecting the same ship type twice is a wasted ban.	Each ban targets a specific ship type and not a ship class or other hull. For example, banning the Harpy would not exclude the Hawk or frigates in general.	Teams should endeavor to have multiple ship setups available as bans may impact your primary team setup. No additional time will be given if teams do not have eligible ships available.	During the final day of competition, some matches will require teams to be ready within 15 minutes after the completion of banning. We expect that many teams will find this time limit challenging. The best teams in New Eden will be the ones that can adapt quickly.	All bans apply to both teams equally.	New to EVE? Start your 14-day free trial today.	Returning pilot?

Flagships must still follow all non-metalevel based fitting restrictions, including any restrictions that ban module types or limit the number of a certain module that can be fitted.	A flagship costs the same points value as for a normal ship of its type.	You are under no obligation to field your flagship in any given match.	If your flagship is destroyed, it may not be fielded again during the tournament.	Victory Conditions	During a match, a team scores points for each enemy ship it kills, equal to the tournament points value of that ship. The team that has scored the most points at the conclusion of the match, or that destroys the entire opposing team, is the winner.	If a team chooses to field less than 100 points, non-fielded points count towards the opponent's score.	If a fight is tied after 10 minutes, time dilation will be used to progressively speed up the tournament solar system and encourage a prompt end to the match.

81	english	 	 There are eight beacons in the system which serve as start off points. Four beacons are marked for Team 1 and four marked for Team 2. Teams will be moved to the beacon of their captain's choosing. Once the teams are in system, all instructions will be given by the referee in local chat. You must keep an eye on that channel at all times once in system.	Once word is given, teams warp in to the arena beacon specified, at a range of their choosing, up to a maximum of 50 km. Team members are allowed to warp in at different ranges.	The arena will measure 125 km radius around the central beacon.	The arena contains nine Mobile Micro Jump Unit structures, one placed in the center and eight placed 87km away from the center in the direction of each of the eight team beacons. These outer structures form a cube around the center of the arena with sides approximately 100km in length. These Mobile Micro Jump Units are indestructible and usable by all.	The host will begin a countdown. When the countdown ends, the host will break target locks of all ships in the arena.	If a player warps out/leaves the arena, his/her ship will be destroyed. This includes disconnection emergency warps. This rule is in effect before and during the match.	Warping within the arena is NOT allowed.	Boarding a ship during the match is NOT allowed.	Deploying cargo containers, anchorable items, upwell structures or mobile structures into space is NOT allowed. Dropping regular jettison containers is allowed.	The following restrictions are in place after teams have warped to the arena beacon, until the match begins:	Locking players before the match starts is NOT allowed.	Activating aggressive or targeted modules before the match starts is NOT allowed.	Launching drones before the match starts is NOT allowed.	Moving before the match starts is NOT allowed.	Beginning the activation cycle of a Micro Jump Drive or Mobile Micro Jump Unit before the match starts is NOT allowed.	Ships & Points	Each team has 100 points with which to select their ships.	Each team may have up to 10 ships on the battlefield.
81	english	 	 Captains must be online and available 45 minutes prior to the match to make their ban choices. Further details on bans can be found in the subsection Ships and bans.	Participants should be prepared, in their chosen ships, and in a fleet 20 minutes before their scheduled fight time. Teams will be brought by a GM to a solar system in uncharted space and designated as Team 1 and Team 2. If you are not ready within this time allocation, you will be disqualified from this match and the opposing team will be given an automatic win.
81	english	 	 Ban from competing for the remainder of the tournament, and/or any future tournaments	The referees can call a match null and void or declare a result if they believe that one of the teams is not competing. This tournament is designed to showcase the talents of pilots and should be entertaining.

81	english	 	 SEEDING THE BRACKETS	This year, we will be seeding the brackets in a similar way as to AT XIII with a few small changes:	Teams will be seeded into a standard 64 team double elimination bracket	Any teams that used a buy-in for placing in the top 14 will be seeded in the order they were placed in Alliance Tournament XIII. For example, if 13 teams buy in and the 9th placed team does not, the teams that came 10th place and lower would all be seeded from 9-13 in the order of their placing in Alliance Tournament XII.	Teams selected through the random draw and secret auction will be randomly seeded in all remaining positions through a second draw	If you’re interested in commentating but haven’t submitted your interest yet, we’re still accepting applications until July 11th. Check out the earlier announcement blog for more details.	As always, we hope you’re as excited for the tournament this year. If you have any other questions you can feel free to ask them in the comments thread, or come visit us in the EVE Alliance Tournament Discussion forum.	And remember: the best ship, is Championship.	On behalf of the Tournament team
81	english	 	 Signups are open as of this dev blog, and prospective teams can have their alliance executor fill out this form. Signups are open until the 22nd of July at 23:59UTC. We will be offering positions in a similar way to last year: the top 14 teams will be offered an option to buy into the tournament directly, 42 positions will be available in the random draw, and the remaining 8 will be offered in a secret auction. This gives a total of 64 teams. Entry fee for teams buying in directly and the random draw is 5 PLEX, and the secret auction will again only be open to teams that have already entered the random draw. Any positions allocated for the Top 14 buy-in that are not used will be added to the andom draw. The draw will take place on the 26th of July with the results announced the same day, and the auction will take place between the 27th and the 29th of July.

82	english	 	 THE THUNDERDOME PROVING GROUNDS	Unlike previous years, we will not be providing support for teams practicing on Singularity or Duality. Instead, we now have a dedicated events server called Thunderdome that will be made available only to participating teams for practice usage. This server is hosted on dedicated hardware rather than Virtual Machines, and will allow teams to practice at their own leisure using the same tournament tool the tournament is run under. More details about server and how practices will work will be coming at a later date, so make sure you keep watching the EVE Alliance Tournament Discussion section	With rewards like this for those that find glory, we’re excited about the many matches between competing teams as they compete to claim the blood soaked prizes on offer. As always, if you have questions, feel free to head on over to the Alliance Tournament Forum.	On behalf of the Tournament Team
82	english	 	 RULE UPDATES	We’ve also made a few changes to the rules since their release.	Teams may field no more than one unique special edition ship at any given time. The current list of unique special edition ships includes: Apocalypse Imperial Issue, Armageddon Imperial Issue, Megathron Federate Issue, Raven State Issue, Tempest Tribal Issue, Guardian-Vexor, Mimir, Adrestia, Vangel, Etana, Moracha, Chameleon, Fiend, Rabisu, Stratios Emergency Responder, Gold Magnate, Silver Magnate, Freki, Utu, Malice, Cambion, Chremoas, Whiptail, Imp, Caedes	Heavy Interdictors have increased in points cost by 1 to 13

82	english	 	 SECRETS AND AUCTIONS	As the draw has now concluded, we move on to the Secret Auction. Beginning tomorrow, 27th of July after downtime, the remaining teams that were not selected in the draw may have either their Alliance Executor or Team Captain EVEmail CCP Logibro a PLEX bid. The minimum bid is 5 PLEX. The same character that mailed the bid must also place the same number of PLEX in the redeeming system. All bids must be submitted before downtime on the 29th of July. Any bid without the respective number of PLEX in the redeeming system at the close of the auction will be considered invalid.
82	english	 	 THE DRAW DECIDED	This year a total of 92 valid entries were received. Of those, 12 were from teams in the previous year buying in directly, and 80 were entries into the random draw.	Congratulations to those that were drawn, and good luck in the secret auction to those that were not. If you wish to see the video of the draw being performed, you can find it here.
82	english	 	 Alliance Tournament Edition Blood Raider SKIN	As with Alliance Tournament XIII, we will be offering a ship SKIN that can be applied to any of the Blood Raider ships to give them a unique visual style. We will be awarding 10 copies of this SKIN for each series won by a team. This includes the single match series that make up the bulk of the tournament. This should provide an additional incentive to try and win every match you can. Again like last year, these skins will be handed out later than the rest of the prizes at a yet to be determined date.

82	english	 	 Alliance Tournament Medals	In previous tournaments, we have given ingame Alliance Tournament Medal inventory items for the teams that places first, second and third in the tournament. The number of medals granted was the same number as the maximum pilots that could be fielded in that tournament. We will be continuing to do this for Alliance Tournament XIV.	However, like Alliance Tournament XII and XIII, we will also be giving out medals to every character that was a member of the participating alliances on the first day of the tournament. These will appear on the character sheet, exactly like a medal awarded by a corporation. There will be medals for Tournament Competitor, Top 32, Top 16, Top 8, 4th, 3rd, 2nd, and 1st. Each character will receive only the highest medal that their alliance earned.	Remember, the medals will only be granted to characters in a participating alliance on the first day of the tournament (October 1st).
82	english	 	 The Alliance Tournament Cup	The Alliance Tournament Cup is an ingame inventory item of which only one copy may ever exist. Every year we edit the description of the item to reflect the complete list of former tournament winners and move the item to the possession of the most recent winners.	The Alliance Tournament Cup was given to the Pandemic Legion alliance in the most recent Alliance Tournament XIII, and after the conclusion of Alliance Tournament XIV it will be taken from wherever it resides at that time and given to the AT XIV champions.
82	english	 	 THE BLOOD SOAKED RICHES	With Alliance Tournament XII, we introduced a prize structure that had several goals:	To provide strong and unique rewards that match the epic levels of passion, training and mastery displayed by our competitors	To ensure that teams feel they have a good chance of being rewarded if they put in the effort to field a competitive team	To reward the entire alliances behind each team, since in the Alliance Tournament there are often hundreds of players providing support for each team member that you see flying in the matches	As this structure found great success in AT XII and XIII, we’ll be using it again this year. As for the actual prizes, here’s what you’ll be fighting to claim this year:

83	english	 	 FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS	Earlier we mentioned that we aim to reduce our first reply time for all tickets to within 36 hours. We have some upcoming changes to Customer Support over the next few months, some of which will be visible to EVE players and some of which are internal to the department.	Most of the improvements needed to provide better support are on us to complete. But there are some things that you can do to help us out:	Provide all the basic information you think may be useful to a GM. We regularly get tickets from players who want a reimbursement for a ship loss. But they don’t include the name of the character who lost the ship or the ship type. This means that instead of being able to investigate the loss the GM has to ask for the information, which means a delay in resolving the ticket. 	Please don't submit duplicate tickets about the same issue. We genuinely understand that if you don’t hear back from us then the natural inclination is to ask for an update, sometimes through submitting another ticket. Submitting more than one ticket about the same issue can impact reply times for you and other players. We humbly ask that only one ticket about an issue be submitted.	If you have an issue which affects multiple members in your corporation or alliance, then please get a representative (preferably a director or CEO) to contact us on behalf of the affected players rather than having all affected players submit a ticket. Generally, we have to speak to a director or CEO anyway when dealing with corporation or alliance issues so it just makes sense for one person to contact us.  	Bumping tickets does not improve a ticket reply time. We just wanted to mention this because we do see players regularly send replies to their ticket with the intention to ‘bump’ it to the top of the queue. This effectively does nothing to the tickets place in the queue.	Finally, on behalf of every GM in the department, we just wanted to thank you the players for making the game what it is. We look forward to talking to you via tickets or in person at Fanfest or one of our awesome player gatherings.
83	english	 	 'HIRE MORE GM'S!'	When talking about reply times with players we often get asked why we cannot simply hire more GMs when reply times get too high. EVE is a beautiful, vast and challenging game for players and GMs alike. It simply takes time to find the right GM for each position we want to fill. This is especially true for non-English language support. Its further complicated in that we would generally need a new employee to relocate to a barren, volcanic rock in the middle of the north Atlantic, or Iceland as its more commonly known. 	For other games a new GM may be fully trained after a few weeks, whereas with EVE it takes around six months to fully train a GM and expect them to operate with any degree of independence. This means that if the ticket queue suddenly spikes we can’t just hire a dozen more GMs to handle the load.  Hiring 100 extra GMs is just not viable – ultimately we are a business and we need to try to maintain a staffing level that provides the support we want to give you guys but is cost effective.	With that being said we have recently expanded our team both in Iceland and abroad. Indeed, at the time of writing this blog we expect to welcome a couple of new GMs to the team next week.
83	english	 	 (click to enlarge)	The approach we are aiming towards is that players will receive the first reply to their ticket within 36 hours of the ticket being submitted. By aiming towards this goal we remove the need to provide what would likely be inaccurate estimates for reply times. 	Below you can see on average for July 2016 of how long a player waited before they received the first reply to their ticket. The 0-1 hours reply typically relates to those tickets which are handled in the queue mentioned earlier which deals with time sensitive or easily resolved issued. Getting the average first reply time down to 36 hours is going to be tough to achieve and it won't happen overnight but we feel that its attainable and a level of support that you deserve.
83	english	 	 TICKET REPLY TIMES	One of the most common points of feedback from players is that we need to be more transparent on how long a player can expect to wait before their ticket is replied to. We would love to be able to say to a player that they can expect a reply to their ticket in 'x' hours, but this is simply not possible with how our support system works and because there are too many factors to consider when estimating reply times. 	One factor which affects reply times is how many tickets we receive. It should be simple in that the more tickets we predict to receive the greater the reply times will be. However, predicting the amount of tickets we expect to receive is not that simple. With our new system we can get a fairly good estimate of how many tickets we will receive in an average week. With EVE though there is rarely such a thing as an average week. The graph below shows daily tickets received from July 2015 to July 2016. As you can see there are frequent spikes in tickets submitted each of which would throw off any estimate of reply times we could provide to players. 	Some spikes represent expansions, which we can take into account because they are planned, but some spikes in ticket submission spikes come pretty much out of the blue. The two biggest spikes we saw in the last year came from issues which we did not expect to cause a huge number of tickets. For instance, one issue relating to players encountering a black screen when logging in was completely unexpected.
83	english	 	 QUEUE STRUCTURE	Perhaps it would be a good idea to give a quick overview of how the Customer Support ticket queue is setup before we go any further. Players submit tickets which are filtered into various categories Billing, Gameplay and Technical being the three main ones with each category having sub-categories. It’s not a case of all tickets being in one big queue and then handled on a first come first served basis. We can't adopt a 'one big queue' approach with all GMs working out of it because different GMs have different training and specializations. Also some tickets are more time sensitive than others and they need to be addressed as soon as possible.	All tickets are important to us but we do filter some tickets into a queue in which a GM will reply to the ticket is less than an hour--usually within 15 minutes.  In this queue we handle the aforementioned tickets which are time sensitive such as offensive behavior, player harm reports (broadcast for reps), stuck characters, and some tickets which can be quickly solved with the click of a button such as agent mission issues.  	We also tend to handle most account information tickets in this queue. The reasoning behind this is that if a player wants to come back to the game and does not remember his account details then we want to be able to provide them as quickly as possible rather than have him wait for a few days during which time the urge to rejoin may fade or when they might not have time set-aside to make their grand return.
83	english	 	 Player Submitted Art	Last March the Operations and IT team expanded their territory and erected a new wall between themselves and Customer Support team. The bittersweet moment of the final part of the wall going up left us with a sense of loss (<3 the ops team) but also a whole lot of blank wall to cover. Despite our best efforts to decorate the wall it was decided that a couple of cat meme pics just weren't going to be good enough. So we asked you, the players, to create some art for us to hang on the walls. You responded admirably and the winning art was printed out and now proudly hangs for all Game Masters (GMs) and visitors to see. 
83	english	 	 CSM X Summit	For the second year in a row we scheduled a session to meet with the CSM during their summit here in Reykjavik.  One of the major concerns they raised was transparency with regards to what is and what is not an exploit. Because of this feedback, the Known and Declared Exploits article was produced. It's one of the most 'liked' articles and we aim to keep it updated as much as possible. We're looking forward to meeting with CSM XI in September.
83	english	 	 New Ticket System	Last June we went live with a new ticket system, a much needed improvement on the old system which had been in use since EVE launched back in 2003. We got to play with lots of new tools which help track ticket submissions metrics, measure reply time averages (more on this later) and lots of other fascinating stuff which quite probably only the Lead Game Masters find interesting but which ultimately benefit you, the players.	Perhaps the most obvious benefit to players of the new system was the Help Center which contains around 190 articles and gets over 5000 views per day. We love communicating directly with you all, but I think you would all agree that it is preferable if a player can have his question answered without the need to submit a ticket.
83	english	 	 A YEAR IN REVIEW	Before we talk about ticket reply times, queue status and address some of your feedback, we want to highlight some of the events since last we spoke.
84	english	 	 A: No.	Q: Will there be things I used to get as part of my subscription that I will now have to pay separately for?	A: No – if you are subscribed to EVE Online, you will have all the same benefits and resources available to you as you always have as a subscriber.	Q: Will customer support work the same for Alpha and Omega states?	A: We are creating and implementing concrete plans to make sure we can provide the same level of support for all of our players.	Q: Will Alphas be allowed on test servers?	A: Not most of the time, but possibly for certain events.	Q: What happens if my subscription ends while I'm logged in, will I be converted to Alpha in the middle of a fight?	A: In these cases, you will remain an Omega until the next time you log out. We won't ever turn skills off during the middle of a session.
84	english	 	 Questions about accounts and payment:	Q: Will you start charging for expansions or other new content?	A: No, we will continue to develop and release expansions and features for free as we always have.	Q: Will the price of subscription change? 
84	english	 	 Questions about design choices:	Q: Why are Alpha skills limited to the character’s faction?	A: We feel that it's important to keep the allowed skills list from getting too large but would rather there was depth within their chosen faction than broad options to cross into other factions. This also reserves pirate faction ships as an Omega only option, which fits considering their power and complexity. Finally, we think focusing on one faction for new characters will help lower the early game complexity.	Q: Why are Alpha skills limited to Cruisers and lower?	A: We think this set of ships gives you the chance to have a meaningful impact on almost every activity and environment in the game without causing any problems in the ecosystem. Bigger and more advanced ships could easily lead to various forms of farming and abuse that would harm the experience for subscribed EVE players. That said, we expect to make changes based on feedback and on activity once the feature is released.
84	english	 	 Questions about abuse:	Q: Won’t suicide ganking using free characters be a major problem?	A: We don’t think clone states will have much impact on suicide ganking or other harassment in high-sec. But, we will be paying very close attention and if this becomes an issue we can pursue options to improve the situation such as turning safety’s on for Alphas in high sec or making changes to the allowed skills list.	Q: What about botting? Won’t it get out of control?	A: Botting and multiplexing are a violation of the EULA and will be investigated and persecuted as usual under these changes. We don’t expect a significant increase in this kind of activity but we will be amping up security to make sure we don’t have problems.	Q: What about farming on free alts using systems like industry?	A: We’ve deliberately tried to limit this behavior using the skills allowed in the Alpha list. It should be very hard to scale alt farms in a way that hurts the ecosystem. But, this is something we need your help on though so if you see the potential for abuse please let us know.	Q: Won’t lag be a huge problem?	A: We are confident that we can handle a significant increase in activity, so hopefully not. We are prepared to make design changes if this does become a problem, and as always we will continue investing in our hardware and our code base.
84	english	 	 Questions about returning players:	Q: If I used to play EVE, do I need to do anything to activate Alpha State?	A: No, any unsubscribed account will automatically be set to Alpha State.	Q: What happens if I log in as an Alpha but I’m in a ship with required Omega skills?	A: You will be allowed to fly the ship until the next time you dock, but any ship bonuses or attributes will not gain the benefits of Omega skills.	Q: What happens if I log as an Alpha but I have modules fit that require Omega skills?	A: Those modules will be set offline when you log in.	Q: What happens if my training queue contains Omega skills but I am in Alpha State?	A: We will pause your training queue and it will need to be manually restarted once the Omega skills are removed or the subscription is renewed.
84	english	 	 Questions about how it works:	Q: Where can I see what skills Alphas will be allowed to train and use?	A: The full list is at the bottom of this page. Note that it is a work in progress and we will be adjusting the list based on your feedback.	Q: If I upgrade my account to Omega does it affect all my characters?	A: Yes, all the characters on an account share a clone state. Note that you can still only train one character at a time, per account (unless you have a multiple character training certificate).	Q: Can Alpha clones inject and extract skills?	A: You can Inject skills regardless of your clone state. Currently, we are planning to require Omega state for skill extraction and also not allow the extraction of skills in the Alpha set.	Q: Are there restrictions on simultaneous log on for Alpha Clones?	A: We have not decided whether the simultaneous log on restrictions from the current trial system will apply to Alpha Clones. The decision will partly depend on your feedback, as well as our technical investigations over the coming months.	Q: Can other players see my clone state?	A: No, only you will be able to see your clone state. We think that seeing the clone state of other players would provide too much strategic value to make it public.
84	english	 	 QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:
84	english	 	 Team Size Matters, on behalf of the EVE Online Development Team
84	english	 	 Many players coming back to check EVE for free will have played before and they might have last logged out in any number of situations which an Alpha could never have found itself in, like behind the wheel of a Titan for instance. Again, check out the Q&A for more detail, but our general approach in these situations is going to be very hands off. We won’t be moving ships around or cancelling your jobs and orders. Instead, benefits from skills that require Omega state won’t be applied and modules requiring those skills will go offline.	The design we're describing is based on the combined effort of all of us here, but we need your help to make sure the Alpha experience is the best it can be. We need to hear how you think Alpha state will get used, especially if there’s obvious problems. We need to get the set of Alpha state skills tuned very carefully. And we also need to know what we can do to support you as a wave of new players come to the game looking for a home.	The CSM heard about this concept just a couple days ago--basically the same time you are, but we are communicating now specifically so that they can help gather your feedback and bring it to us for the summit in September, where we will be flying out the entire CSM for the first time. If you would rather talk to us directly, the forum thread for this blog is a great place to start and we will be opening up other channels, such as a Reddit AMA, in the coming weeks.	We are extremely excited about the Clone States feature. Soon, New Eden will be inundated with a flood of wide-eyed capsuleers eager to explore the world we've been building together for the past 13 years. And you will be able to shape their experiences. Are you going to help them fit a PVE destroyer? Or maybe have them point that destroyer towards the waiting ranks of a rival alliance? Or might you perhaps share a few rounds of that famous low sec hospitality? The choice is yours. 	Clone States are coming this November. What will they mean to you?	Signing off,
84	english	 	 (click to enlarge)	![](//content.eveonline.com/www/newssystem/media/70491/1/CLONE_STATES-INVENTORY.png)
84	english	 	 CLONE STATES – IN DEPTH	First of all, accounts won’t be changing much. Every account has three character slots. One of those slots at a time may be used to train skills. One of those characters may be logged in at a time. Account services such as PLEX, Multiple Character Training, and Skill Trading will be completely unaffected.	As described above, any account with an active subscription (paid directly or via PLEX) will have all its characters upgraded to Omega state. Omega can be summed up in a very simple way: It works exactly like subscribed accounts always have.	Alpha State, on the other hand, will be much different. The most important thing to know about Alpha clones is that they may only use a specific set of skills and skill levels. To begin with, we are planning that the Alpha skill set will be focused on using tech one Frigates, Destroyers and Cruisers. Alpha clones will only be able to use ship and weapon skills native to their faction. If you have skills trained on a character in Alpha State, which are not part of the Alpha skill set, those skills will be locked and unusable until Omega state is reactivated. Characters will start the game with the same 400,000 skill points as they do now and will be able to train freely within the Alpha list. A fully trained Alpha will have roughly 5 million skill points. You can find the full Alpha list in the Q&A below the blog.	Additionally, we are changing some of the existing skill pre-requisites:	Increase skill requirement for Entosis Link I module to Informorph Psychology II (was Infomorph Psychology I) to allow Alphas to use jump clones we must also make this change to prevent Alphas from using Entosis Links.	By specifically selecting skills in this way, we can ensure that the EVE ecosystem and the value of Omega state are both protected, while still providing a wide-ranging, exciting EVE experience for Alphas. The clone state prevents access to powerful skills like Cynosural Field Theory and Cloaking, and limits farming through skills that control scaling and efficiency. We are also able to react to unexpected issues by refining the Alpha clone skill list further, should the need arise. Of course, Alphas also have enormous freedom. They will be doing everything from rampaging null sec in Caracal fleets to exploration sites in high sec to playing a major role in faction warfare.	Along with all the system changes described above, we want to make sure that the game itself does a good job showing where skills, items, certificates or activities require a certain clone state. For that reason, we are doing a hefty update to the skill section of the character sheet as well as adding new iconography across the client to let you know exactly what each state can do. Here’s a work in progress shot of the new skill window and an Alpha looking through an inventory with some Omega required items:

85	english	 	 Hey there. If you took the option of skipping here from the beginning, I’d like to welcome you to the end of the blog! If you have the time later I highly recommend reading the rest at your leisure.	The short version of all this is:	In the November expansion mining support gameplay is getting a huge revamp	Fleet boosts (including mining boosts) are becoming AoE buffs that only work on-grid	There’ll be three mining foreman ships: the new inexpensive Porpoise, a buffed Orca and a buffed Rorqual	Each Mining Foreman Ship will be able to fulfill three roles at once:	Help fleetmates mine more effectively
85	english	 	 Slightly improved hitpoints and agility	37.5% reduced mass to match ORE’s commitment to improved wormhole utility	23% more capacity for the Bowhead’s Ship Maintenance Bay
85	english	 	 Contribute with powerful mining drones:	The new Excavator drones give the Rorqual its own tiny mining fleet at its fingertips. Even without the Industrial Core running the Rorqual is the strongest solo mining ship in the history of New Eden. With the Core running this massive yield is multiplied 6x, making the Rorqual the ultimate belt destroyer. When the Industrial Core is running, each of the Rorqual’s 5 Excavator drones will individually pull in the ore yield of an Exhumer	The Rorqual isn’t a small investment and the risk of using the Industrial Core in dangerous space can be significant, but in the hands of a wise pilot supported by friends and allies the Rorqual will be one of the most effective ships in the game. We’re very interested in hearing your feedback on these changes, and we’ve opened up a specific feedback thread here for discussion of the Rorqual and its modes.
85	english	 	 PULSE ACTIVATED NEXUS INVULNERABILITY CORE	The Pulse Activated Nexus Invulnerability Core (P.A.N.I.C.) is a new defensive superweapon available exclusively to the Rorqual. It allows the Rorqual to make itself and its allies invulnerable for a short time. This ability also prevents any of these ships from warping for the duration of the effect. This can allow time for the allies of the mining fleet to arrive and defend the fleet from danger.	The P.A.N.I.C. module is a powerful situation effect that can be used whenever the owning Rorqual sees the opportunity for advantage and avoided in situations when it isn’t advantageous.	This new module requires a new rank 8 skill called Invulnerability Core Operation that requires Tactical Shield Manipulation level 5 and Capital Shield Emission Systems level 3 to train. The module only requires Invulnerability Core Operation level 1 to operate, and the skill increases the duration of the P.A.N.I.C. effect by 10% per level. This means that Rorqual pilots can strategically train the Invulnerability Core Operation skill to whatever level they wish and ensures that the Rorqual pilot and its fleet have more information about when the effect will end than the attackers do.
85	english	 	 Defend the mining operation:	Thanks to 125 mbits of drone bandwidth and a full sized drone damage bonus, the Rorqual can deal battleship-level damage. The addition of the Industrial Core doubles that drone damage and also adds a drone speed bonus to help the Rorqual’s deadly heavy drones chase down their targets	On its own the Rorqual has the ability to fit capital-sized remote shield boosters with a massive 400% range bonus. With the Industrial Core active those remote shield boosters cycle much faster for more repairing and nimbler support of allies. When the Core is running the Rorqual is second only to Force Auxiliaries in remote rep potential	If enemies realize they can’t break through the remote reps and decide to attack the sieged Rorqual directly they’ll be in for another surprise as the Industrial Core provides the Rorqual with one of the strongest local tanks in the game: on a similar scale to that of a Force Auxiliary.	The Rorqual is tied with Caldari and Minmatar Command Ships for the most powerful Shield Command Bursts in the game, allowing it to provide max-strength defense boosts to its whole mining operation	Finally, if the Rorqual has friends coming it can choose to pause the fight using the P.A.N.I.C. module and wait for the cavalry to arrive
85	english	 	 Help fleetmates mine more effectively:	Even without the Industrial Core active the Rorqual has the most powerful mining foreman bursts in the game thanks to a 5% per level strength bonus and 50% range role bonus. With the addition of the core for up to an additional 30% strength and 200% range the Rorqual gains the ability to supercharge its mining fleet across entire belts	+900% survey scanner range makes allows the Rorqual to scan asteroids up to 225 km away, gaining valuable information on remaining asteroid volumes to help coordinate its fleet	Capital tractor beams and a buffed ore bay make the Rorqual the ultimate ore collecting machine	The Rorqual can allow its fleet mates to refit while also carrying multiple mining ships in its Ship Maintenance Bay
85	english	 	 -75% scan resolution	Mining remains unaffected so ships can continue to mine as normal while under the protection of the P.A.N.I.C. module.	We are interested in hearing what the community thinks about cyno restrictions for ships affected by the P.A.N.I.C. module. We are currently leaning towards allowing cyno lighting and watching closely to see if this causes problems. If needed, we can change the effect to prevent cyno lighting and prevent ships with an active cyno from receiving the P.A.N.I.C. effect.	The Rorqual represents the ultimate mining foreman vessel, providing the best possible bonuses with commensurate increases in investment and risk. The base Rorqual and all its modes provide the most complete expression of all three of the mining foreman pillars:
85	english	 	 -50% velocity	Prevents warp, cloak, jump, dock, tethering (if already tethered do not apply)
85	english	 	 +100% Mass
85	english	 	 +99.99% Shield Resists	-90% Shield recharge duration (increases passive shield regen rate)	All turret, missile, drone and smartbomb damage set to 0
85	english	 	 Bonuses to all affected ships:
85	english	 	 200 km range	Applies to all mining and industrial ships within the same fleet, except other Rorquals	Runs once and then burns out	Limit of one module per ship
85	english	 	 P.A.N.I.C. Module:	Requires Invulnerability Core Operation skill level 1	Duration: 5 minutes base, up to 7.5 minutes based on skills
85	english	 	 -80% Drone ice harvesting duration	As you can see, the Industrial Core is now gaining a huge number of bonuses covering all three mining foreman pillars. It is receiving local tanking bonuses even more powerful than triage modules, and remote repair bonuses that are second only to triage. It is gaining ECM immunity and increased lock speed to help it support its allies. It is also gaining massive bonuses to drones that turn it into a combat powerhouse and a mining operation all on its own when used alongside Excavator Drones.	We expect that individual Rorqual pilots will make decisions about when to use their Industrial Core modules based on the danger in their local environment and the amount of support they can receive from allies. Due to the massive benefits of the Industrial Core on one hand and the increased risk of locking yourself in place for 5 minutes on the other, there won’t be one universal “right answer” for when the Industrial Core should be used.

85	english	 	 THE INDUSTRIAL CORE MODULE	(Click image for a larger, animated version)	The Industrial Core module will continue to be the most important unique module for the Rorqual, and in November it is gaining powerful new bonuses in addition to those it already possesses.	The Industrial Core deploys the Rorqual into a temporarily immobile mining support platform and magnifies all three of the mining foreman pillars.	In addition to the new bonuses provided by the industrial core, a new Tech 2 version of the core will be added in November, bringing it up to par with the similar Siege and Triage modules.	The stats and bonuses of these modules are:
85	english	 	 Drone Damage and Mining Bonuses:
85	english	 	 -60% Local shield booster duration	-75% Remote shield booster duration and cap use	+120% Remote shield booster optimal and falloff range
85	english	 	 Tanking and Remote Repair Bonuses:	+140% Local shield booster repair amount

85	english	 	 Rorqual Feedback Thread	The Rorqual-class Capital Industrial Ship is the premier mining foreman ship in New Eden. This once great ship has fallen into disuse as its formerly unique functions were slowly added to other ships and structures. It’s time for the Rorqual to get a full revamp from the ground-up and that’s exactly what is happening this November.	The Rorqual represents the most powerful version of all three mining foreman pillars by itself; capable of providing strong Mining Foreman Bursts, repairing allies and fighting off enemies, and vacuuming up ore faster than any other ship in New Eden.	Beyond its built-in functionality, the Rorqual has the ability to use two unique modules that allow it to enter specific modes for extra capabilities.	The Industrial Core module deploys the Rorqual into a fixed mining foreman platform and shares many of the same powerful features of the Triage and Siege modules.	The Pulse Activated Nexus Invulnerability Core is a new defensive superweapon that makes an entire mining operation invulnerable for between 5 and 7.5 minutes if desired	These modes are intended to be powerful but situational, and the best Rorqual pilots will know when to use them and when not to use them.	Whether these modes are running or not, the ability to field 5 ‘Excavator’ Mining Superdrones will make the Rorqual the greatest mining vessel in the history of New Eden.	There are a huge number of changes coming for the Rorqual in this patch, and the full stats can be seen below. Changes from the old stats will be in brackets. Since they might be easy to miss in the rest of the changes I want to bring special attention to the three extra slots, reduced mass (allowing the Rorqual to travel through the same wormholes as Freighters), and increased jump range to 5ly base (10ly with max skills, the same as Jump Freighters).	**Rorqual:**

Thanks to ORE’s tireless work advancing hull materials technology to reduce mass, the Porpoise is light enough to travel through small-ship wormhole connections.	This new ship should be perfect for mining operations in more dangerous space where lower cost ships minimize exposure to loss for the operation. It’s improved agility and warp speed also make it the best choice for providing coverage of mining groups at multiple locations with one ship.	**Porpoise:**

85	english	 	 MINING FOREMAN SHIPS	In the November expansion we are planning huge buffs to the existing Orca and Rorqual mining foreman ships, as well as adding a new inexpensive and mobile Industrial Command Ship to fill out the lower-end of the progression. Each of these ships hits a different price point and have significant differences in mobility and access to different areas of space.	As you’ll remember from the start of the blog, we’ve divided the Mining Foreman ship progression into four stages:	The new affordable and mobile Porpoise-class Industrial Command Ship	The Orca-class full-sized Industrial Command Ship	The Rorqual-class Capital Industrial Ship – without the Industrial Core module active	The Rorqual – with the Industrial Core module running	I’ll cover each of these ships individually in the following section, with specific focus on how each ship fulfills each of the three pillars of mining foreman gameplay.
85	english	 	 MINING DRONES REVISITED	Mining drones have been a part of New Eden since the earliest days of EVE Online, but were generally eclipsed when Mining Barges and later Exhumers were added, increasing the mining yield baseline. The mining foreman ships will be receiving significant bonuses that make mining drones excellent options on those ships, and this has provided us an opportunity to flesh out the line of mining drones and mining drone skills.	In the November expansion we will be adding several new mining drones (including the first ever ice mining drones) and some new mining drone skills to go with them.	Let’s start with the new skills! We’re adding three new Mining Drone skills in November, which both enable the new line ice harvesting drones and allow players to more meaningfully specialize in mining drone gameplay.	Mining Drone Specialization: 2% bonus to the mining yield and max velocity of drones requiring Mining Drone Specialization per level.	This skill enables greater specialization in drone mining for pilots who wish to become the best mining drone operators possible.    	Mining Drone Specialization is a tier 5 skill.	Mining Drone Specialization requires Mining Drone Operation level 5 in order to start training.	In the November expansion, only two new drone types (‘Augmented’ Mining Drones and ‘Excavator’ Mining Drones) will require and gain benefits from Mining Drone Specialization. At a later point after players have had ample time to train it, we plan to eventually add Mining Drone Specialization level 1 to the skill requirements of the Mining Drone II which will extend the benefits of this skill to those drones.	Ice Harvester Drone Operation: 5% reduction in ice harvester drone cycle time per level.	This will be the first tier skill for the new ice harvester drones that are being introduced in the November expansion.	Ice Harvester Drone Operation is a tier 2 skill.	Since it reduces cycle time instead of increasing yield this skill is a bit more powerful than Mining Drone Operation.	Ice Harvester Drone Specialization: 2% reduction in cycle time and bonus to max velocity of drones requiring Ice Harvester Drone Specialization per level.	This is the second tier specialization skill for the new ice harvester drones.	Ice Harvester Drone Specialization is a rank 5 skill.	From day one all advanced ice harvester drones (T2, Augmented, and Excavator) will require Ice Harvester Drone Specialization and therefore gain its benefits.	To go along with these new skills, we are also fleshing out the lineup of mining drones themselves!	(Click image for a larger, animated version)	The Mining Drone I will be receiving a 25% buff to mining yield, to help shrink the gap between T1 and T2 drones to a more reasonable level	The Mining Drone II will remain largely unchanged in November, as it represents the current baseline for drone mining. In a future release after November we will be adding Mining Drone Specialization level 1 to its skill requirements (which will allow it to receive the benefits of that skill) but we’ll be giving some time for interested capsuleers to train the skill before making that change	The rare Harvester Mining Drone will be receiving some buffs to position it as an expensive but useful faction version of the normal mining drones. It will keep very low skill requirements and gain buffs to speed (remaining slower than T1 mining drones, but faster than today), hitpoints and mining yield. We will also be re-introducing a new way of obtaining these drones so that their supply can begin to slowly increase to a sustainable level. They will be very rare drops from a new set of NPCs that will be announced in the near future	We are adding a new set of ‘Augmented’ Mining Drones in the November expansion. Like the existing ‘Augmented’ combat drones, these will be special rogue drone versions of the drones that are both faction and T2. They will be manufactured using blueprints and components looted from rogue drones. They will require the Mining Drone Specialization skill and gain its benefits. The base stats of the ‘Augmented’ Mining Drones will also be very powerful, gaining about 9% more mining yield than T2 mining drones. They’ll also benefit from improved speed and hitpoints	The new ‘Excavator’ Mining Superdrones are the ultimate culmination of drone mining technology. These giant drones (pictured above) are the result of secretive ORE research into rogue drones. They can only be used by Rorqual-class capital industrial ships. By themselves a set of ‘Excavator’ Superdrones make the Rorqual the most powerful mining ship in the game, and when boosted by an active Industrial Core module they each individually gain the yield of an Exhumer. These Superdrones use the drone system (they are not fighters) and function just like normal mining drones. They require the Mining Drone Specialization and gain its benefits	The new Ice Harvester Drones will come in Tech 1, Tech 2, ‘Augmented’, and ‘Excavator’ versions and follow a similar progression as the normal mining drones. They receive cycle time bonuses rather than yield since ice comes in such large blocks. The Tech 1, Tech 2, and ‘Augmented’ versions of these drones have volumes of 50 m3 and use 50 mbits of bandwidth. To avoid any major danger to the ice mining market, these drones rely heavily on the bonuses provided by mining foreman ships to be competitive (but they can be used by any ship that has 50mbits of bandwidth available)	To support the new Ice Harvesting drones, we are adding functionality to the whole line of Drone Mining Augmentor rigs. They will now also reduce Ice Harvesting Drone cycle time by 10% (15% for the T2 rigs).	It’s worth noting that we are not adding any Mining Foreman Bursts that impact mining drones at this time. The drone mining bonuses on the mining foreman ships are extremely strong and we believe that extending the impact of the Mining Foreman Bursts would potentially take them too far.	Now that we’re covered the new Mining Foreman Burst and Mining Drone changes, let’s get to the details of the ships that will be using them!

Then we’ll go over all the potential bonuses individually. You’ll notice that in several cases we have combined the effects of multiple old warfare links into one Command Burst.	Ammunition types for the Mining Foreman Burst:	Name	Effects
85	english	 	 500 units of Isogen	This means that the cost of an individual burst charge should land between 200 and 500 ISK, with the mining burst charges costing a bit less than the combat ones.	Command Burst modules will also require a moderate amount of capacitor to activate.	When activated, the Command Burst will apply bonuses to all fleetmates within range of the boosting ship in a sizable sphere. Imagine a smartbomb that buffs your friends instead of damaging ships and you’ll get the idea. Activating a Command Burst will generate a weapons timer and therefore prevent the boosting ship from jumping through gates or docking for one minute. The area covered by the burst is clearly indicated by their visual effect:	When a fleetmate is hit by the Command Burst, their ship will receive a timed bonus lasting between 60 and 130 seconds that continues to operate even if they move out of range, or if the boosting ship dies. The bonus persists through warps within a system, but does not persist through docking and undocking or through system changes. The bonus is applied to the ship rather than the character, so swapping ships in space leaves the buff on your unpiloted old ship rather than having it follow you to the new ship. Since the burst that applies the timed bonus is instantaneous, any ships that enter range after the burst goes off will need to wait until the next cycle to receive their bonus.	Command Bursts will not apply their bonuses to any fleetmates that are tethered to a structure (like a Citadel or Engineering Complex) or within a starbase force field, and ships cannot activate their Command Burst modules if they themselves are within a force field.	Fleet hierarchy does not matter for these new bonuses, so any fleet member can provide bonuses to any fleetmate that is within range. All existing bonuses that use fleet hierarchy will be removed in the November expansion. This means that passive bonuses provided to entire fleets from skills, implants and ship hulls will be removed and replaced with this new active module system.	There will be restrictions on what ship types can fit Command Bursts and how many Command Bursts can be fit to any individual ships. We are planning on converting Command Processors (the module that allow a ship to fit more links) into a rig, which should go a long way towards addressing a current source of imbalance between armor and shield tanked boosting ships.	If a ship is allowed to fit multiple Command Bursts, they are welcome to fit multiples of the same type of Burst module or mix and match Burst module types. So if an Orca pilot wishes to provide three types of Mining Foreman boosts to its fleet at the same time it will be welcome to fit three Mining Foreman Bursts and load each module with a different ammo. Or it could fit two Mining Foreman Burst modules and one Shield Command Burst module and swap ammo on the fly to provide whatever bonuses are most appropriate to the situation.	Like existing warfare links, multiple copies of any given Command Burst bonus do not stack on top of each other. The Command Burst system will only apply the bonus from the strongest version of each Command Burst effect that is applied to any given ship. However, Command Burst bonuses do stack on top of bonuses from other sources (such as modules and implants) and this interaction may be subject to diminishing returns (stacking penalties) depending on the attribute being affected.	Our plan for skill requirements in the new system is:	Tech 1 Mining Foreman Bursts will only require Leadership level 1 and Mining Foreman level 1	Tech 2 Mining Foreman will require Leadership level 5 and Mining Director level 1	All Command Bursts modules (including Mining Foreman Bursts) share these common stats:

85	english	 	 MINING FOREMAN BURST DETAILS	If you’ve read the previous dev blog and forum thread covering the Command Burst system, you’ll already be familiar with most of the information this section. In that case feel free to skip to the next section most of this will be repeated information. However, we want to include a quick refresher on the basic information so that people who just want to learn about mining foreman gameplay can get everything they need in one blog.	Command Bursts are high-slot modules that can be fit on the same classes of ships that can currently fit Warfare Links and will be replacing their functionality. There will be five types of Command Burst modules at launch, one for each of the existing fleet boost groups: Armor, Shield (formerly known as Siege), Information, Skirmish, and Mining.	These modules must be loaded with ammo in order to activate, and the ammo choices determine which bonus the module will provide to nearby fleetmates. Ammo can be swapped in the field to change bonuses as the situation changes, although a reload time of between thirty seconds and one minute means that choosing the right time to swap bonuses is important.	The ammunition for Command Bursts will be compact, inexpensive and manufactured by players primarily from the raw materials of ice products.	The burst charges themselves are planned to have a volume of 0.01 m3, and the modules themselves will have a capacity of 3 m3. This means that if you don't want to change ammo types you can boost for 5 hours continuously without reloading.	The blueprint originals for each of these charge types will be sold by NPCs, just like other T1 charges.	The current plans for material requirements for batches of the burst charges are as follows (base values for an unresearched blueprint):	Batch size for all burst charges is 500.

85	english	 	 Contribute with powerful mining drones:	The new Excavator drones give the Rorqual its own tiny mining fleet at its fingertips. Even without the Industrial Core running the Rorqual is the strongest solo mining ship in the history of New Eden. With the Core running this massive yield is multiplied 6x, making the Rorqual the ultimate belt destroyer. When the Industrial Core is running, each of the Rorqual’s 5 Excavator drones will individually pull in the ore yield of an Exhumer	The Rorqual isn’t a small investment and the risk of using the Industrial Core in dangerous space can be significant, but in the hands of a wise pilot supported by friends and allies the Rorqual will be one of the most effective ships in the game. We’re very interested in hearing your feedback on these changes, and we’ve opened up a specific feedback thread here for discussion of the Rorqual and its modes.
85	english	 	 PULSE ACTIVATED NEXUS INVULNERABILITY CORE	The Pulse Activated Nexus Invulnerability Core (P.A.N.I.C.) is a new defensive superweapon available exclusively to the Rorqual. It allows the Rorqual to make itself and its allies invulnerable for a short time. This ability also prevents any of these ships from warping for the duration of the effect. This can allow time for the allies of the mining fleet to arrive and defend the fleet from danger.	The P.A.N.I.C. module is a powerful situation effect that can be used whenever the owning Rorqual sees the opportunity for advantage and avoided in situations when it isn’t advantageous.	This new module requires a new rank 8 skill called Invulnerability Core Operation that requires Tactical Shield Manipulation level 5 and Capital Shield Emission Systems level 3 to train. The module only requires Invulnerability Core Operation level 1 to operate, and the skill increases the duration of the P.A.N.I.C. effect by 10% per level. This means that Rorqual pilots can strategically train the Invulnerability Core Operation skill to whatever level they wish and ensures that the Rorqual pilot and its fleet have more information about when the effect will end than the attackers do.
85	english	 	 Defend the mining operation:	Thanks to 125 mbits of drone bandwidth and a full sized drone damage bonus, the Rorqual can deal battleship-level damage. The addition of the Industrial Core doubles that drone damage and also adds a drone speed bonus to help the Rorqual’s deadly heavy drones chase down their targets	On its own the Rorqual has the ability to fit capital-sized remote shield boosters with a massive 400% range bonus. With the Industrial Core active those remote shield boosters cycle much faster for more repairing and nimbler support of allies. When the Core is running the Rorqual is second only to Force Auxiliaries in remote rep potential	If enemies realize they can’t break through the remote reps and decide to attack the sieged Rorqual directly they’ll be in for another surprise as the Industrial Core provides the Rorqual with one of the strongest local tanks in the game: on a similar scale to that of a Force Auxiliary.	The Rorqual is tied with Caldari and Minmatar Command Ships for the most powerful Shield Command Bursts in the game, allowing it to provide max-strength defense boosts to its whole mining operation	Finally, if the Rorqual has friends coming it can choose to pause the fight using the P.A.N.I.C. module and wait for the cavalry to arrive
85	english	 	 Help fleetmates mine more effectively:	Even without the Industrial Core active the Rorqual has the most powerful mining foreman bursts in the game thanks to a 5% per level strength bonus and 50% range role bonus. With the addition of the core for up to an additional 30% strength and 200% range the Rorqual gains the ability to supercharge its mining fleet across entire belts	+900% survey scanner range makes allows the Rorqual to scan asteroids up to 225 km away, gaining valuable information on remaining asteroid volumes to help coordinate its fleet	Capital tractor beams and a buffed ore bay make the Rorqual the ultimate ore collecting machine	The Rorqual can allow its fleet mates to refit while also carrying multiple mining ships in its Ship Maintenance Bay
85	english	 	 -75% scan resolution	Mining remains unaffected so ships can continue to mine as normal while under the protection of the P.A.N.I.C. module.	We are interested in hearing what the community thinks about cyno restrictions for ships affected by the P.A.N.I.C. module. We are currently leaning towards allowing cyno lighting and watching closely to see if this causes problems. If needed, we can change the effect to prevent cyno lighting and prevent ships with an active cyno from receiving the P.A.N.I.C. effect.	The Rorqual represents the ultimate mining foreman vessel, providing the best possible bonuses with commensurate increases in investment and risk. The base Rorqual and all its modes provide the most complete expression of all three of the mining foreman pillars:
85	english	 	 -50% velocity	Prevents warp, cloak, jump, dock, tethering (if already tethered do not apply)

It is also gaining massive bonuses to drones that turn it into a combat powerhouse and a mining operation all on its own when used alongside Excavator Drones.	We expect that individual Rorqual pilots will make decisions about when to use their Industrial Core modules based on the danger in their local environment and the amount of support they can receive from allies. Due to the massive benefits of the Industrial Core on one hand and the increased risk of locking yourself in place for 5 minutes on the other, there won’t be one universal “right answer” for when the Industrial Core should be used.

85	english	 	 Rorqual Feedback Thread	The Rorqual-class Capital Industrial Ship is the premier mining foreman ship in New Eden. This once great ship has fallen into disuse as its formerly unique functions were slowly added to other ships and structures. It’s time for the Rorqual to get a full revamp from the ground-up and that’s exactly what is happening this November.	The Rorqual represents the most powerful version of all three mining foreman pillars by itself; capable of providing strong Mining Foreman Bursts, repairing allies and fighting off enemies, and vacuuming up ore faster than any other ship in New Eden.	Beyond its built-in functionality, the Rorqual has the ability to use two unique modules that allow it to enter specific modes for extra capabilities.	The Industrial Core module deploys the Rorqual into a fixed mining foreman platform and shares many of the same powerful features of the Triage and Siege modules.	The Pulse Activated Nexus Invulnerability Core is a new defensive superweapon that makes an entire mining operation invulnerable for between 5 and 7.5 minutes if desired	These modes are intended to be powerful but situational, and the best Rorqual pilots will know when to use them and when not to use them.	Whether these modes are running or not, the ability to field 5 ‘Excavator’ Mining Superdrones will make the Rorqual the greatest mining vessel in the history of New Eden.	There are a huge number of changes coming for the Rorqual in this patch, and the full stats can be seen below. Changes from the old stats will be in brackets. Since they might be easy to miss in the rest of the changes I want to bring special attention to the three extra slots, reduced mass (allowing the Rorqual to travel through the same wormholes as Freighters), and increased jump range to 5ly base (10ly with max skills, the same as Jump Freighters).	**Rorqual:**

85	english	 	 MINING FOREMAN SHIPS	In the November expansion we are planning huge buffs to the existing Orca and Rorqual mining foreman ships, as well as adding a new inexpensive and mobile Industrial Command Ship to fill out the lower-end of the progression. Each of these ships hits a different price point and have significant differences in mobility and access to different areas of space.	As you’ll remember from the start of the blog, we’ve divided the Mining Foreman ship progression into four stages:	The new affordable and mobile Porpoise-class Industrial Command Ship	The Orca-class full-sized Industrial Command Ship	The Rorqual-class Capital Industrial Ship – without the Industrial Core module active	The Rorqual – with the Industrial Core module running	I’ll cover each of these ships individually in the following section, with specific focus on how each ship fulfills each of the three pillars of mining foreman gameplay.
85	english	 	 MINING DRONES REVISITED	Mining drones have been a part of New Eden since the earliest days of EVE Online, but were generally eclipsed when Mining Barges and later Exhumers were added, increasing the mining yield baseline. The mining foreman ships will be receiving significant bonuses that make mining drones excellent options on those ships, and this has provided us an opportunity to flesh out the line of mining drones and mining drone skills.	In the November expansion we will be adding several new mining drones (including the first ever ice mining drones) and some new mining drone skills to go with them.	Let’s start with the new skills! We’re adding three new Mining Drone skills in November, which both enable the new line ice harvesting drones and allow players to more meaningfully specialize in mining drone gameplay.	Mining Drone Specialization: 2% bonus to the mining yield and max velocity of drones requiring Mining Drone Specialization per level.	This skill enables greater specialization in drone mining for pilots who wish to become the best mining drone operators possible.    	Mining Drone Specialization is a tier 5 skill.	Mining Drone Specialization requires Mining Drone Operation level 5 in order to start training.	In the November expansion, only two new drone types (‘Augmented’ Mining Drones and ‘Excavator’ Mining Drones) will require and gain benefits from Mining Drone Specialization. At a later point after players have had ample time to train it, we plan to eventually add Mining Drone Specialization level 1 to the skill requirements of the Mining Drone II which will extend the benefits of this skill to those drones.	Ice Harvester Drone Operation: 5% reduction in ice harvester drone cycle time per level.	This will be the first tier skill for the new ice harvester drones that are being introduced in the November expansion.	Ice Harvester Drone Operation is a tier 2 skill.	Since it reduces cycle time instead of increasing yield this skill is a bit more powerful than Mining Drone Operation.	Ice Harvester Drone Specialization: 2% reduction in cycle time and bonus to max velocity of drones requiring Ice Harvester Drone Specialization per level.	This is the second tier specialization skill for the new ice harvester drones.	Ice Harvester Drone Specialization is a rank 5 skill.	From day one all advanced ice harvester drones (T2, Augmented, and Excavator) will require Ice Harvester Drone Specialization and therefore gain its benefits.	To go along with these new skills, we are also fleshing out the lineup of mining drones themselves!	(Click image for a larger, animated version)	The Mining Drone I will be receiving a 25% buff to mining yield, to help shrink the gap between T1 and T2 drones to a more reasonable level	The Mining Drone II will remain largely unchanged in November, as it represents the current baseline for drone mining. In a future release after November we will be adding Mining Drone Specialization level 1 to its skill requirements (which will allow it to receive the benefits of that skill) but we’ll be giving some time for interested capsuleers to train the skill before making that change	The rare Harvester Mining Drone will be receiving some buffs to position it as an expensive but useful faction version of the normal mining drones. It will keep very low skill requirements and gain buffs to speed (remaining slower than T1 mining drones, but faster than today), hitpoints and mining yield. We will also be re-introducing a new way of obtaining these drones so that their supply can begin to slowly increase to a sustainable level. They will be very rare drops from a new set of NPCs that will be announced in the near future	We are adding a new set of ‘Augmented’ Mining Drones in the November expansion. Like the existing ‘Augmented’ combat drones, these will be special rogue drone versions of the drones that are both faction and T2. They will be manufactured using blueprints and components looted from rogue drones. They will require the Mining Drone Specialization skill and gain its benefits. The base stats of the ‘Augmented’ Mining Drones will also be very powerful, gaining about 9% more mining yield than T2 mining drones. They’ll also benefit from improved speed and hitpoints	The new ‘Excavator’ Mining Superdrones are the ultimate culmination of drone mining technology. These giant drones (pictured above) are the result of secretive ORE research into rogue drones. They can only be used by Rorqual-class capital industrial ships. By themselves a set of ‘Excavator’ Superdrones make the Rorqual the most powerful mining ship in the game, and when boosted by an active Industrial Core module they each individually gain the yield of an Exhumer. These Superdrones use the drone system (they are not fighters) and function just like normal mining drones. They require the Mining Drone Specialization and gain its benefits	The new Ice Harvester Drones will come in Tech 1, Tech 2, ‘Augmented’, and ‘Excavator’ versions and follow a similar progression as the normal mining drones. They receive cycle time bonuses rather than yield since ice comes in such large blocks. The Tech 1, Tech 2, and ‘Augmented’ versions of these drones have volumes of 50 m3 and use 50 mbits of bandwidth. To avoid any major danger to the ice mining market, these drones rely heavily on the bonuses provided by mining foreman ships to be competitive (but they can be used by any ship that has 50mbits of bandwidth available)	To support the new Ice Harvesting drones, we are adding functionality to the whole line of Drone Mining Augmentor rigs. They will now also reduce Ice Harvesting Drone cycle time by 10% (15% for the T2 rigs).	It’s worth noting that we are not adding any Mining Foreman Bursts that impact mining drones at this time. The drone mining bonuses on the mining foreman ships are extremely strong and we believe that extending the impact of the Mining Foreman Bursts would potentially take them too far.	Now that we’re covered the new Mining Foreman Burst and Mining Drone changes, let’s get to the details of the ships that will be using them!

Alternatively, there will be toooltips if you are already in the Omega Clone State, buy missing skill books, or train required skill levels if you already have the right skills injected.	We hope that we will eliminate a metric ton of mouse clicks and help you focus on the task at hand—making your capsuleer better, faster, and stronger!

88	english	 	 REWARDS AND MINI SKILL INJECTOR	We have also created a new rewards structure for new players. One of our goals was to use rewards to teach players more about the game mechanics and also to set them up for success by teaching them ways to earn their own ISK or build their own items rather than just gifting everything as direct rewards.  For example, ISK rewards come from NPC bounties rather than just being gifted at the end of the mission and one of the tasks also requires new players to build their own data analyzer.  	We have also created a new 'Mini Skill Injector' to gift to new players during the first few hours of their Inception experience.  This Skill Injector cannot be bought or sold on the market, can only be used on characters with less than 750,000 skill points, and it will give new players 80,000 unallocated skill points. It is also used as a training opportunity to bring characters from Frigates 3 to Frigates 4. 	We highly encourage all existing players to try out the Inception NPE on the Singularity test server next week, where we will make sure all new characters get a crack at it.  You will need to create a new character to play through the storyline. Please hop on and let us know what you think!
88	english	 	 Hidden Drifter Zenith	These sites will be used to help create the unfolding storyline for the new player and to help them master piloting a starship.  As Inception is all about working with your Empire, the Research Facility, Assembly Point and Hidden Drifter Zenith are different for each of the 4 major factions.  We have created new environments for the sites and the Hidden Drifter Zenith also features NPC AI with a large battle happening between Empire and Drifter fleets.

88	english	 	 OPERATIONS AND TASKS	With Inception, we are shifting from the current Opportunities NPE to Operations and Tasks. We are using these Operations and Tasks to create a storyline driven experience for players where the mentors will give context and backstory about the operations and Aura will deliver the tasks to complete. This is just the first chapter of a much larger system coming out in a later release.
88	english	 	 UI HIGHLIGHTING	We have improved the UI highlighting tool to help it fit more with the visual style of EVE and also add extra functionality.  Aura will now be able to use the UI Highlighting for the majority of the tasks she gives. This should really help new players understand where things are located on the UI and how to find items both in space and in the overview.  
88	english	 	 Additionally, you will be accompanied by your friendly onboard AI, a new and expanded Aura, that will also be voice acted and will walk you through how to achieve your tasks and learn the game. Aura will have a powerful triple guidance system of voice, text and highlighting that we hope will improve initial guidance in the game. Not to mention that Aura is a delight to hang out with.  Here is a glimpse of Aura in action:

88	english	 	 THE EMPIRES	We are placing the Empires of New Eden at the heart of Inception. We believe the choices you make are important and where better to start than with your choice of faction?  You will be accompanied by a voice-acted Empire mentor that will get you up to speed on who the Drifters are, what has happened to the rest of your fleet and what is expected of you. The mentor is a strong character, archetypical of the empire you choose, and will deliver a different emotional flavor to your experience depending on your empire selection.  We would like to introduce you to the new mentors:
88	english	 	 WHAT IS INCEPTION?	Inception is the first phase of a storyline driven campaign that teaches new players the foundations of becoming a capsuleer while immersing them in a storyline with an unravelling mystery to solve. This campaign sees players participate in numerous excursions for both the Empire and the Sisters of EVE (SOE) and ends in a battle where they get to fight alongside their empire against the Drifters.

89	english	 	 HOW DO COMMAND BURSTS WORK?	Command Bursts are high-slot modules that can be fit on the same classes of ships that can currently fit Warfare Links. There will be five types of Command Burst modules at launch, one for each of the existing fleet boost groups: Armor, Shield (formerly known as Siege), Information, Skirmish, and Mining.	These modules must be loaded with ammo in order to activate, and the ammo choices determine which bonus the module will provide to nearby fleetmates. Ammo can be swapped in the field to change bonuses as the situation changes, although a reload time of between thirty seconds and one minute means that choosing the right time to swap bonuses is important.	The ammunition for Command Bursts will be compact, inexpensive and manufactured by players primarily from ice product raw materials. We are planning for very large ammo capacities on the Burst modules themselves, so boosting characters will not need to reload often unless they are changing boost types. Command Burst modules will also require a moderate amount of capacitor to activate.	When activated, the Command Burst will apply bonuses to all fleetmates within range of the boosting ship, in a sizable sphere. Imagine a smartbomb that buffs your friends instead of damaging ships and you’ll get the idea. Activating a Command Burst will generate a weapons timer and therefore prevent the boosting ship from jumping through gates or docking for one minute. The area covered by the burst is clearly indicated by their visual effect:	When a fleetmate is hit by the Command Burst, their ship will receive a timed bonus lasting between 60 and 130 seconds that continues to operate even if they move out of range, or if the boosting ship dies. The bonus persists through warps within a system, but does not persist through docking and undocking or through system changes. The bonus is applied to the ship rather than the character, so swapping ships in space leaves the buff on your unpiloted old ship rather than having it follow you to the new ship. Since the burst that applies the timed bonus is instantaneous, any ships that enter range after the burst goes off will need to wait until the next cycle to receive their bonus.	Command Bursts will not apply their bonuses to any fleetmates that are tethered or within a starbase force field, and ships cannot activate their Command Burst modules if they themselves are within a force field.	Fleet hierarchy does not matter for these new bonuses, so any fleet member can provide bonuses to any fleetmate that is within range. All existing bonuses that use fleet hierarchy will be removed with this release. This means that passive bonuses provided to entire fleets from skills, implants and ship hulls will be removed and replaced with this new active module system. Titans will be receiving a special new Effect Generator capability that replaces their current passive bonuses (more details about Effect Generators later in the blog).	There will be restrictions on what ship types can fit Command Bursts and how many Command Bursts can be fit to any individual ships. We are planning on converting Command Processors (the module that allow a ship to fit more links) into a rig, which should go a long way towards addressing a current source of imbalance between armor and shield tanked boosting ships.	If a ship is allowed to fit multiple Command Bursts, they are welcome to fit multiples of the same type of Burst module or mix and match Burst module types. So if a Claymore pilot for instance wishes to provide two types of Skirmish boosts to its fleet at the same time it will be welcome to fit two Skirmish Command Bursts and load each module with a different ammo. Or it could fit one Skirmish Command Burst modules and one Shield Command Burst module and swap ammo on the fly to provide whatever bonuses are most appropriate to the battlefield situation.	Like existing warfare links, multiple copies of any given Command Burst bonus do not stack on top of each other. The Command Burst system will only apply the bonus from the strongest version of each Command Burst effect that is applied to any given ship. However, Command Burst bonuses do stack on top of bonuses from other sources (such as modules and implants) and this interaction may be subject to diminishing returns (stacking penalties) depending on the attribute being affected.
89	english	 	 GOALS OF THE NEW SYSTEM	There are a number of goals that we consider crucial for the design of this new system -- many of which are not being met by the current warfare link and fleet bonus system.	Fleet boosting should represent a distinct and valuable support role that allows skilled players to shine	Force multipliers are a huge part of EVE gameplay, and we always want to ensure that there are engaging and valued roles for players who enjoy providing support to their allies. Many other dedicated fleet support roles such as logistics, command destroyer, interdictor, and interceptor piloting all involve tactical decision making and allow the best pilots to stand above their peers.	The old warfare link mechanics leave something to be desired in this area (language warning). By building the new Command Burst system around specific areas of effect and enabling booster pilots to swap bonuses during combat, the new system will provide much more engaging and active gameplay.	Fleet boosting should allow counter-play by enemies and involve risk appropriate to its power	Although probing down and catching off-grid boosters under the current system is possible and can be very powerful, it requires support that is not always available to small fleets or solo players. Bringing all fleet-affecting gameplay into visible range ensures that players have the ability to interact with all relevant elements of their opponent’s fleets.	Under the old fleet hierarchy system, this vulnerability would have become an undue burden on fleet commanders as reshuffling fleet positions as your booster ships die would involve unreasonable micro-management. Under the new Command Burst system fleet, hierarchy no longer matters for boosting, allowing Command Burst redundancy in the same way fleets already build logistics and interdictor redundancy.	Fleet boosting should provide clear feedback so all players involved can understand what’s happening	The existing warfare link system has a serious feedback problem. A small checkmark is the only way to see if your boosts are working, and pilots memorize the effects of certain boosts on certain stats to keep an eye on their bonuses. For opposing players the situation is even worse, as there is no way to detect that an opponent is boosted by warfare links and passive fleet bonuses. This can be especially frustrating for pilots flying in small groups or solo, as it strongly impacts the capabilities of your opponents without providing discernable feedback.	In the new Command Burst system we are ensuring multiple layers of feedback so everyone involved can understand the situation. Command Bursts will have a clear visual effect indicating the area in which ships have received the buff. Command pilots will receive a combat log message that indicates how many allied ships have been impacted by each burst, so they can more accurately judge their positioning. Pilots that are receiving the bonuses will see new icons in the “effects bar” above their HUD that indicates what bonuses they are receiving and how long those bonuses will last. Opposing pilots can see the visual effects trigger when boosts activate and a new subtle visual effect that can be observed when a ship becomes affected by a burst.
90	english	 	 PS: If you're further interested in the design of ESI, check out the corresponding blog Introducing the ESI API.
90	english	 	 There's a new API coming to EVE, called the ESI. It's based on the OpenAPI Specification, is fully documented and will make your life easier if you choose to develop an application for EVE Online. It's been ramping up for a few months, and is currently serving up to 4.5 million requests a day.	If you're not a third party developer, over the next year or two you can expect to see the apps you use start moving away from api keys and towards EVE SSO logins. This brings security benefits, and reduces the complexity of authorizing an application.	It's already being used in the new EVE mobile app, as well as by some third party developers. You can check it out for yourself right now, it's live at //esi.tech.ccp.is/	Questions, comments, concerns? We'll be monitoring the threads both on the EVE Online forums and Reddit, or hit up anyone from Team Tech Co on tweetfleet slack (@ccp_snowedin, @ccp_bartender, @ccp_aquarhead, @ccp_chimichanga), we're almost always around in the #devfleet channel. Also, we've opened up a new channel specifically for ESI discussion and help, also on the tweetfleet slack, channel name #ESI.	To the glorious future!

90	english	 	 Squizz Caphinator	The EVE Swagger Interface combines the usability of the XML API with the features of CREST while introducing documentation as an official feature. CREST's crawlable type system enabled people to do some great things with dynamic languages, ESI closes that gap for those of us using statically typed languages; providing much stronger interface definitions and improving on the usability aspects of CREST. I believe that this project is the perfect follow-up to improve on CREST, modernize the XML API, and make EVE development easier for newcomers.
90	english	 	 Steve Ronuken	ESI is a solution to a problem that CCP has had for several years: the inability to quickly and easily update the API for 3rd parties. Over the last few weeks the devs I have worked with have demonstrated that ESI is adaptable and have demonstrated the ability to implement new features quickly. I know many 3rd party developers will not be happy about having to rewrite many of their tools, I am one of them, but this is the price for the technical debt we have incurred. CCP is looking to move past technical debt and bring us a modern approach. EveWho.com is already utilizing ESI and I’m quite happy with the results so far.
90	english	 	 EARLY ACCESS	Over the past month or so, we've been working closely with several active members of the third party developer community, including:	Steve Ronuken, CSM member and creator of fuzzwork.co.uk	Lucia Denniard, prolific #devfleet poster and pizza-auth/timerboard.net developer	Squizz Caphinator, creator of zkillboard.com and evewho.com	We coordinated with this team, similar as with a focus group, to gain feedback on the early development cycles and some initial design decisions. Here's what they have to say about their experiences so far:	The introduction of ESI, while a new API, is similar enough to how CREST works, that conversion should be relatively simple. It also solves one of the huge bugbears of EVE API development. A lack of documentation and examples. The use of Swagger makes this a lot easier to work with, and some inconsistencies are being cleaned up as development happens. Finally opening up the ability to send EVEMail, as well as receive it, is a major deal, allowing for some automated services which couldn't otherwise be done.

90	english	 	 MORE SAND IN THE SANDBOX	We know that starting in with the release of EVE Online: Ascension this November, corporations, alliances and coalitions from across New Eden will put these structures to amazing use. These new Engineering Complexes can serve them well as a fundamental part of their industrial operations, alongside the administrative and logistical functions that citadels already provide.	We’d love to hear your feedback on Engineering Complexes, so feel free to discuss what’s coming in the comments thread for this Dev Blog. We’ll be reading all the comments there and making adjustments thanks to your insights.

Thanks to the greater generalization of larger rigs, there will be a total of 64 available M-Set Engineering Rigs, 34 L-Set Engineering rigs, and 8 XL-Set rigs to choose from (including both T1 and T2 variations).	If you’re itching to see all the granular details, we have a chart with the current draft of stats for all of these Engineering Rigs at the end of the blog.
90	english	 	 Standup XL-Set Laboratory Optimization I
90	english	 	 ENGINEERING RIG SIZE SCALING	Like existing Upwell structure rigs, Engineering Rigs provide the same strength of bonuses at each size category. The primary benefit of upgrading to larger rigs (on larger structures) is that larger rigs are more generalized in their bonuses and smaller rigs are more specialized. This allows larger structures to gain bonuses to more types of industrial activity than their smaller brethren.	For example, a corporation can potentially rig their Medium Raitaru Engineering Complex to receive the maximum possible Material Efficiency (ME) bonuses for constructing small and medium T1 ships, and significant cost reduction to invention jobs by filling its three available rig slots with:	Standup M-Set Basic Small Ship Manufacturing Material Efficiency II	Standup M-Set Basic Medium Ship Manufacturing Material Efficiency II	Standup M-Set Invention Cost Optimization I	If that corporation upgraded to a X-Large Sotiyo Engineering Complex they would be able to get the exact same ME bonuses to production of small and medium T1 ships, while also receiving rig bonuses to a larger variety of industry jobs by installing:	Standup XL-Set Ship Manufacturing Efficiency II
90	english	 	 The Sotiyo is a behemoth of a manufacturing facility, able to produce everything a corporation, alliance, or indeed a coalition needs. From the ground up it is designed to support manufacturing on the largest scale and has the ability to act as a fleet shipyard, churning out capital and supercapital class vessels and serving as a vital node in an alliance or coalition’s sphere of industrial operations.

90	english	 	 THE AZBEL-CLASS LARGE ENGINEERING COMPLEX	The next step up from the Raitaru, the Azbel class Engineering Complex will perform the same functions as the Raitaru on a much larger scale, and even offers the option of being able to construct capital vessels.	Named after Li Azbel, a Gallente scientist who pioneered the first breakthroughs in faster than light communications, this massive structure would make a worthy home for a large industrial corporation or alliance.	The Azbel is larger and better defended than the Raitaru, offering more sustainability and flexibility. Typically designed to be used a large scale manufacturing center for research, copying, invention and manufacturing, it gains the generalization benefits of large sized engineering rigs to allow individual structures to provide a greater variety of bonuses.
90	english	 	 At current market prices this represents a build cost of approximately 700 million ISK (price is subject to capsuleer market fluctuations).	We believe that the Raitaru will represent an extremely popular form of structure for all kinds of activities. It will be the cheapest Upwell structure ever released up to this point and can therefore be used as a starter structure for relatively new corporations looking for a home of their own. It also matches the best structures in New Eden for targeted ME and cost bonuses thanks to the structure engineering rigs so a savvy corporation that picks its niche carefully can use these structures to break into many profitable markets.

90	english	 	 THE RAITARU-CLASS MEDIUM ENGINEERING COMPLEX	The namesake of former Ishukone weapons researcher Tyma Raitaru, who pioneered the invention of modern day missile, the Raitaru is the smallest of the three Engineering Complexes and is comparable to the Astrahus in size and scale, offering facilities to manufacture anything except for capital and supercapital class hulls.	Similar to the Astrahus, the Raitaru will be able to accept all sub capital ships into dock, along with the Orca, Bowhead and freighter class hulls. Anything larger (capital or supercapital) however, will not be able to dock. This medium sized engineering facility provides an inexpensive way for corporations to build their own base of industrial activities.
90	english	 	 WHAT IS ESI TO US?	Over the last few months, we've been using and developing the ESI framework to build a new API from the ground up. The ESI API is a RESTful, SSO authenticated, documentation first, buzzword compliant, horizontally scalable, read/write API. It's currently backing the EVE Mobile app and running on a Kubernetes cluster in Google Cloud (Kubernetes is awesome btw). What the devil does that all mean?	RESTful and SSO authenticated means that you interact with it largely the same way you do with CREST. You'll use HTTPS requests with bearer authorisation tokens if the endpoint requires auth. If you've ever done CREST development this will be like sitting down in a comfortable armchair for you.	Documentation first means that internally, we use the Swagger spec to generate our APIs. Step one of creating or updating an endpoint is creating or updating the spec, that defines all our internal data structures for processing incoming requests to that endpoint, and that means the documentation is always up to date because it's an integral part of coding an endpoint, guaranteed. Don't look now, but we might have solved this documentation gremlin. Additionally, the Swagger spec allows the third party community to use code generators to create native code interfaces for the ESI API in their language of choice. Large amounts of engineering time that have been spent laboriously hand-constructing interfaces for CREST and the XML API can now be freed from this boilerplate work. (We're replacing you with robots, sorry.)	Buzzword compliant means we're using industry standard tooling. The custom glue holding this ship together is as minimal as possible, and we swap out the custom stuff for off-the-shelf open source technology when solutions become available. No EVE API has ever been this maintainable or scalable, and this provides new capabilities we've never had before. Minor patches can go from a developers computer to live production in minutes, and if need be can be rolled back just as fast with zero downtime in either direction.	Horizontal scalability is a neat capability we get from Kubernetes. Because all ESI code that doesn't specifically need to be running inside Tranquility is both stateless and running in Google Cloud, we can manage load by spinning up new ESI containers on a per endpoint basis as needed, and shut them down again when they are no longer needed.	Read/write, of course, means we're planning on making writeable API endpoints just like CREST, including some of the ones that have been problematic until now, like sending mail. Basically, it's like CREST, but better.
90	english	 	 MEANWHILE, IN THE WIDER INDUSTRY...	In the last few years, the rest of the software industry has been busy making various APIs and considering their designs. Out of the chaos of custom made nonsense arose the JSON schema standards, and from that, the Swagger specification. This is a core concept of ESI, and the Swagger Specification has this to say about itself:	Swagger™ is a project used to describe and document RESTful APIs.	The Swagger specification defines a set of files required to describe such an API. These files can then be used by the Swagger-UI project to display the API and Swagger-Codegen to generate clients in various languages. Additional utilities can also take advantage of the resulting files, such as testing tools.	Swagger is a widely adopted API description standard, and is backed by quite a few reputable organisations, which gives us confidence in its longevity and support for client libraries, user interfaces and other tooling. Choosing to adopt the Swagger specification (now known as OpenAPI) removes a bunch of work from our plates, and gives a clear reference point to build any custom integrations against.	It is on this foundation that we've chosen to build the EVE Swagger Interface, a framework which aggregates partial specs from multiple Kubernetes services into a cohesive front facing spec, while also handling the routing, authentication, input/output validation, and more. The EVE Swagger Interface (ESI for short and pronounced "easy") uses Flask and Python 3.4+  internally, and should be generic enough to power any oauth-backed (or unauthed), multi-tenant API running in a Kubernetes cluster. There are also options for running ESI locally with either Docker or directly with local Python.
90	english	 	 When the XML API was first released, it was ground breaking. No video game had ever provided such extensive access to its data, and you did some amazing things with it. EVEMon and EFT are legendary tools that have been supporting EVE for years, and they are joined by a forest of novel and powerful solutions created by our players on the back of the XML API. But the XML API was limited, only capable of exposing certain data, read only and at times slow to react to events in game. Critically, its documentation was a nightmare, forever lagging behind real development and with essentially no discovery.	So we introduced CREST, and that too was ground breaking. It brought a cleaner data format, a RESTful interface and faster access to live simulation data. Eventually, it paved the way for writeable endpoints, which again were all but unheard of in the gaming industry. Some of the work that's been built on top of CREST is just staggering, and we're always hearing about new and novel ideas that make the very most of what can be done with its powerful capabilities.	CREST also pushed an ideal about being self-documenting. A combination of automatically generated options calls and a paradigm of linking from the root of the API was to provide a fully self documenting API. This was a partial success, and crawling the CREST API is certainly a good way for users to learn about it. However, there are hairline cracks showing. Large sections of the tree cannot be crawled unless certain in game conditions are met, such as having the correct corp roles or owning a citadel, and not every resource is correctly linked. It can be hard to tell why you can't access a thing. CREST developers still routinely refer to third party documentation for full descriptions of the API. It was a bold attempt, but it fell a little short.	CCP has always been at the forefront of API development in the games industry, and we're sure not going to stop here and rest on our laurels. We've taken the good that CREST and the XML API created, we've critically examined the bad, and it's time to modernise! Read on...
91	english	 	 Happy fitting!	@CCP_karkur on behalf of Team Five 0
91	english	 	 DRONES, FIGHTERS AND CARGO ITEMS	Once in simulation mode, Drones can be added to a fit, either by double clicking them in the module browser or by dragging them to the drone icon on the lower left side of the ship in the center. To add more than one drone, you can hold down Shift when dragging a drone to the drone icon to get a pop up to specify how many you are adding or alternatively modify the number of drones after they are added by clicking on the quantity text of the drone.	When drones have been added, they can be marked as being active by clicking on the drone icon, and check the checkboxes on each of the drone types. This allows you to see how your damage output changes with different drones. We have also added a tooltip to each of the drone types, give you important information about the drone, taking your skills into account.	In order to allow you to save fits with charges, fuel and fighters, you can add them in the same way as drones, except by dragging them onto the cargo and fighter icons in the fitting window.	During the development of the fitting simulation, a number of other changes and improvement were made to the fitting window, and they can be found in the Ascension patch notes.	For years now, more experienced players have enjoyed awesome 3rd party tools such as PYFA, EFT, Osmium and EVEHQ to help them with their fits. Those fitting tools not only have great and advanced features, but can also been used while at work or when without access to EVE Online. We hope our fitting simulation mode will be nice addition to the options players have when it comes to planning and tinkering with fits, and will help introduce players to how much fun it can be!
91	english	 	 Total resources (default): Filters out all modules that given current rigs and skills, will never function on the hull you are working on. This will help filter out modules that you can fit, but don't have enough CPU or powergrid output on the hull to ever online.	Remaining resources: Filters out any module that requires more CPU, powergrid or calibration than the simulated hull has available, based on its current fit. This should help out when you're designing a tight fit.	Skills	When on, it will filter out all the equipment you do not have the skills to use. While in an Alpha clone state, this will filter out any modules that require Omega state	.
91	english	 	 This filter is on by default, helping narrow down the options for the hull you are working on	Resources	Filters out modules based on their CPU, powergrid and calibration requirements. This filter relies on simulating each of the modules to get accurate values, and is therefore only available while in simulation mode. The first time it runs, it may take a few seconds to complete, but after that it should be near instant until hull, rigs or skills change.	This filter has 2 modes: Total resources and remaining resources, and you can switch between the modes through a right click option.

91	english	 	 The Hulls & Fits browser will allow you to browse all the ships and structures available to you. It also includes all your fittings for each of the hulls, and by activating the personal and corporation fittings filter at the top of the list, you can choose to view only those hulls you have saved fittings for.	The Hardware browsers helps players find and discover modules available on the market and easily preview how they impact the hull by simply hovering the mouse over them. When a module is previewed, the stats in the fitting window are updated and colored green or red, depending on whether the change is positive or negative.	At the top of the browser there are several filters that will help you narrow down your options when searching for equipment for your hull. Some of them are rather self-explanatory, but other could do with bit of explanation	Low slots
91	english	 	 FITTING CHARGES	Once you have fitted a module that uses any type of charge, a filtering button for that module type will be added in the charge section of the Hardware tab. Activating that filter will display only charges that fit in that module. There are a few ways you can fit charges:	With the module filter activated, double click a charge in the charge browser to load it into all the modules of that type	Drag a charge to the center of the fitting window, and it will be loaded into any of the modules that can use that charge.	If you prefer to add charges to only one of the modules fitted, you can drop a charge onto that module slot.
91	english	 	 FITTING AND SIMULATING MODULES	Once you have loaded a simulated hull, you are ready to start experimenting on it! You can simulate pretty much any module in EVE, as well as testing out and removing simulated rigs without having to destroy them.	There are a few ways to add a simulated module:	Double click a module in the 'Module' browser	Drag modules from nearly anywhere you can find them (for example: Module browsers, market, info, asset, inventory windows) and drop them in the center of the fitting window or an appropriate slot in the fitting window	SHIFT drag a module that has already been added to the simulated hull onto another slot to add another one in that slot	To unfit simulated modules, simply drag the module from the slot and drop it onto any of the browsers in the left panel of the window, use the 'Unfit' button associated with the slot or the slot's 'Unfit' right click option.	Once you have added some modules to the hull, you can click on them to cycle through their states	Offline ? online ? active ? overheated ? offline	With each state change, the stats in the fitting window will update to reflect the module's new state.	You can also reverse the cycle by holding down SHIFT while you click the module.	Offline ? overheated ? active ? online ? offline	There are also 3 radial menus that allow you change the state of all the modules in a rack at once.
91	english	 	 LOADING HULLS	There are several ways to load a simulated hull in the fitting window:	Click on the 'Simulation mode' button	Right click on your real hull in the fitting window and select the 'Simulate my ' option.	Drag the hull from the simulation mode button to the center of the window. 	Drag any hull or structure from the 'Hulls & Fits' browser to the center of the fitting window or click on the little 'Simulate' icon on the entry. This will start simulation on an empty hull	Click on a saved fitting in the 'Hulls & Fits' browser	Click on the 'Simulate' button in Fitting Management window of a fit you were linked	Drag any assembled ship you own, whether it's from ship hangar, contracts or asset window, into the center of the fitting window to simulate that ship and its fit. Please note that if you drag any ship you do not own, only the empty hull will be simulated
91	english	 	 FITTING SIMULATION MODE	Once you open the fitting window, you'll notice that a few things here and there have changed. One of them is that on the upper right side of the hull model is a new button with a picture of your hull's hologram. This button allows you to switch the fitting window between simulation mode and normal mode. Once you click that button and enter simulation, your hull will be swapped out for a cool looking hologram representation of the hull type.	In this simulated version of your hull, you can experiment as much as you want, change modules, activate weapons, try different charges, swap out rigs ... all without any changes being made to your real hull!	If you find a fit you are happy with, you can save it to your personal fittings or even corporation fittings if you have the necessary roles. If you are working on the same ship type as your real ship, you can also apply that fit directly to the ship. If you happen to be working on a fit for a ship type that is different from the one you are currently sitting in, clicking the 'Fit Ship…' button will open up the recently added Multifit window, allowing you to assemble 1-30 ships with that fit.	Pro tip: If the Multifit window indicates there are any missing items, mouse over the red text to get a tooltip that lists what's missing and a handy 'Buy All…' button.

92	english	 	 Email Verification For Existing Accounts
92	english	 	 CLARIFICATIONS ON MESSAGING	With EVE Online Ascension, we cleared out the list of safe locations in order to enable this new system, which resulted in all pilots receiving an initial request for a verification code. Unfortunately, there was some confusion regarding the new system due to the fact that a significant number of pilots received emails that mentioned the optional authenticator service, leading them to believe that we had made this mandatory. This is not the case, and the authenticator is still an optional feature that pilots can utilize at their own discretion.	In addition to this, the call for pilots to verify their email addresses came just a week or so before the deployment of these new features for internal reasons, and not everyone was able to verify or update their email address in time.	We should have communicated these changes way earlier and with several warnings before launching this change, and we should have given you a blog like this explaining the changes up-front, not after the fact. We apologize for any confusion or any inconvenience that these communication issues might have caused, and have now rectified the text in the emails that are sent out with verification codes in them when an account is logged in from a new location.	There is also some outdated terminology that is being used on our account management webpages that we will be rectifying in an account management update early next week to further clarify these new systems.	Our customer support team is working hard to resolve cases related to these new security systems, and we have drafted in a significant number of extra staff to assist. We hope that we’ll be able to reach every affected pilot very soon and resolve any login issues that pilots are still experiencing. We will also compensate missed Omega clone state time for anyone locked out that they are assisting.	We urge anyone having issues with logging in to EVE Online to check the following Help Center articles to see if they can be of any assistance.	Creating & Validating A New Account
92	english	 	 ADDITIONAL SECURITY – AUTHENTICATOR	An optional feature that pilots can also utilize to provide an extra layer of security is the ability to activate the Authenticator via account management, which overrides the location based verification system described above.	The authenticator allows pilots to utilize their mobile device to receive verification codes via Google’s Authenticator app, instead of them being sent to their account’s verified email address. 	When using this system, a verification code is requested every time a log in is attempted, unless the pilot marks the device they are logging with as safe using the “Don’t ask for codes again on this computer” checkbox when entering a code.	Any other device which is not marked safe in this manner will request a verification code every time a log in is attempted in order to increase account security.	Additionally, if a pilot misplaces their mobile device and has the optional Authenticator enabled, there is the option to receive Authenticator codes via email to prevent a pilot from being locked out of their account and allow them to disable the Authenticator service until they locate their device or replace it.	Emails for this type of code will have the subject line “Your Verification Code For USERNAME” so that they can easily be identified.
92	english	 	 ACCOUNT SECURITY IMPROVEMENTS	Before the release of EVE Online: Ascension, pilots would face a character name request after successful log in from a new location or browser, in order to verify that they were the owner of the account that they were trying to access. 	This presented a number of issues that included returning pilots not remembering which characters were located on which account, or not being able to recall their character name after having not logged in for some time. In order to smooth out the process of logging into an account, we have made some changes to this process.	As of EVE Online: Ascension, a verification code sent to the email address attached to the account has replaced this request for a character name, and the system has been refined to only request a code when an account is logged into from a new geographical location for the first time.	This means that any pilots who have an internet service that provides them with a dynamic IP address will not need to enter a verification code every time their IP address is updated by their service provider.	Emails for this type of code will have the subject line “Your Verification Code For USERNAME” so that they can easily be identified.	Once this verification code has been entered once from the new location, it will be marked safe and there will be no further requests for verification.
92	english	 	 EMAIL VERIFICATION	With the release of EVE Online: Ascension, all EVE Online accounts now need to be attached to a valid and verified email address for account security purposes.	When creating a new account, pilots are guided through steps to verify their email address as part of the process of creating their account and downloading the EVE Online client. Similarly, if a pilot returns to the game and does not have a verified email address attached to their account, as of the deployment of Ascension they will be prompted to verify their email address when they log into the EVE Online launcher before they can continue through into character selection.	Please bear in mind that there are certain combinations of email address that are not considered valid for verification. These include mails with prefixes such as “info@” “admin@” and “mail@” and other generic inboxes, as well as some privately hosted email servers that pilots may have set up themselves.	It is also recommended that pilots add eveonline@service.ccpgames.com to their address book, trusted senders list, or safe contacts list to prevent email delivery issues with some services.	Emails sent to complete email verification will have the subject line “EVE Online Email Verification For USERNAME” so that they can easily be identified.	For more information on verifying email addresses, pilots can take a look at this help center article on e-mail verification and this help center article on creating and validating a new account.	Once an email address has been verified with CCP, the account it is attached to will be able to log in from the location that the email address was verified from without further security challenges in the future, as the location will be marked safe.	Please note that while a pilot can verify one email address with multiple accounts, each account must have the email address verified against it individually.

93	english	 	 THE SIEGE OF M-0EE8	The final timer for the Keepstar saw the assembled attackers once again assail the Keepstar, though this time, it seems that the defending force had surrendered the field, choosing to instead evacuate what they could and leave the Keepstar to draw as much blood as it could in its final hours. With the attackers using battleship fleets en masse, and additional pilots from all over New Eden flying in to try and leave a mark on the kill report of the first battle-ready Keepstar, the system saw a staggering peak concurrent pilot count of 5337. This new record bested the previous record of 4920 set in Nisuwa on 2014-09-05 during an event to kill a rare Revenant-class Supercarrier. A total of 4078 pilots were registered on the kill report, a copy of which can be seen here.	The Keepstar itself finally fell just before midnight at 23:49 UTC, with pilot Vlulvik Hrapruk claiming the final blow. The defenders didn’t walk away empty handed though, as they successfully ambushed an incoming fleet in the solar system of Obe on the star gate to Hakonen in addition to racking up close to 250 billion ISK in damage with the Keepstar during the campaign.

This earlier battle saw a total of 1634 different pilots engage the Keepstar over the course of 5 hours, with a peak concurrent total of 4510 pilots in system.	Despite the overwhelming forces arrayed against them, Circle-Of-Two, alongside Test Alliance Please Ignore and various other allies, managed to extract a solid toll from their opponents. Combined, more than 250 billion ISK (EVE’s currency) was lost in the battle that set the stage for the final showdown a week later.

94	english	 	 Team Psycho Sisters
94	english	 	 Including this one where you want to ignore a signature but you have another one selected.
94	english	 	 100% and warpable - Green 
94	english	 	 75% to 99.9% - Yellow
94	english	 	 We are also going to show the progress of the scan in the actual scene when you are scanning specific signatures. When you select a signature in the probe scan window, a circle will appear in the solar system map to show which signature is selected and the progress of the scan. Your selection in the probe scanner window will be maintained in the solar system map.	When a scan completes, the site icons in the scene will animate to their new estimated location, instead of just popping there. We hope this makes it much easier to realize what happened.	We have also added a new colored state to the scan progress to address some defects we had about a signature showing green 100% but still not being warpable.	The color range will now be as follows:	0% to 24.9% - Red	25% to 74.9% - Orange
94	english	 	 One of the biggest changes we are making to the visibility of probe scanning will be the introduction of icons for each specific site in exploration and the display of the corresponding ship icon in combat scanning. Only when your scan results are at or above 25%, these are only going to be exposed - by then, you already know the according Group.
94	english	 	 Here is a picture from the current scanning system live on our game server Tranquillity:	There are lots of things going on in a busy scene and the intensity of some items, and the color of others makes it quite hard to see what you are actually trying to do. This represents some of the biggest areas of feedback as to why people are still using the old scanning system. 	To increase visibility of the important items, we have reduced the visual intensity of a number of items in the scene, such as:	Spheres in the scene including scan probes and signatures	Sun	Solar System rings
94	english	 	 WHAT ARE THE CHANGES?	Visibility
94	english	 	 We’ll be adding a couple UI elements to the Directional Scanner window	An icon column should hopefully help newer players	The buttons for "Show Scan Cone" and "Align with Camera" have been moved from the Solar System map header to the Directional Scanner window	We are also working on improving the use and feedback of the scan cone and camera inside the Solar System map.	We noticed with the CSM that when people had the "Align with Camera" option enabled, but then went to do something else and did not realise "Align with Camera" was still enabled it would seem like the camera was broken. We are going to change how this works so when you pan the camera or click on a bracket the "Align with Camera" will be disabled.	The scan cone appearance when "Align with Camera" is enabled has had a little touch up to improve the overall appearance and visibility when using it. 	We have changed the color of the directional scan shape from blue to green.	Defect Fixes	Along with all the changes listed above, we have also been working on cleaning up as many probe and directional scanning related defects as possible.
94	english	 	 Hopefully we can answer most of your questions with accurate and informative tooltips added to the Probe Scanner and Directional Scanner windows.	We are adding “?” tooltips to the Probe and Directional Scanner windows. These will include brief descriptions of the purpose and functionality of the two systems including links to the basic items required to perform either action.	For players discovering a data, relic, gas site for the first time and not having a clue what that means, we have added some basic tooltips to each signature in the Probe Scanner that should give a brief description of what each site is and if they require specific modules to interact with.	Directional Scanner	The directional scanner (aka dscan) is in a pretty good state but there are a couple of issues we have seen in feedback while working on the feature that we are going to resolve.
94	english	 	 Not too much detail on this at the moment because during the CSM playtest the most common question was "What do these things mean?". We took this as a pretty obvious sign we should probably take another stab at how to visualize this.	Tooltips and Discoverability	How do I scan? What is the difference between Probe Scanning and Directional Scanning? What do all the things mean?!?
94	english	 	 These will show the player's base values taking into account any bonuses they are receiving from Skills, Ships, Modules, Rigs, and Implants.	We hope that by exposing these we can increase a player’s ability to discover how they are able to improve their scanning potential.	Scanning Difficulty	As an attempt to improve usability, we’ve introduced the concept of scanning difficulty. This should hopefully help new players understand why they simply cannot pin down a very difficult site, as well as creating a nice reveal moment that can also help with deciding if it’s worth proceeding with the scan or not as difficulty roughly correlates with the value and risk of the site.
94	english	 	 Recalling your probes. We are keeping this away from the Analyze btton so there are no accidental recalls	The middle section has not changed too much, but we have added the icons in a new column and the new color states.	The bottom section now has the controls for altering the formation of probes, the size of the probes, and the Analyze button. We think this flows better for scanning. Launch formation, change size, analyze, change size, and analyze!	We have hidden the ignored section until you actually ignore a signature.	There will now be some more informative text in the Probe and Directional Scanner windows when there are no results. The probe scanner will tell you if there are no signatures or anomalies in the system, it will also tell you if there are no results being shown because you have filtered or ignored all of them.	Exposed Scan Strength, Deviation, Duration	As part of the effort to improve the scanning user experience we have added the players Scan Strength, Scan Deviation and Scan Duration to the probe scanner window. These can be seen here
94	english	 	 We have tweaked the layout of the Probe Scanner so everything should flow a little better.	The top section should include all the information about your probes:	How many are launched?	The strength, deviation, and duration of the scan.
94	english	 	 Individually resizing each probe through right-click menu in the solar system map	We are adding 2 buttons to quickly change the camera angle between a top and side view. This will also be bound by default to a double click anywhere in the solar system map that is not a bracket or the probe object.	The goal here is to make manipulating probes easy, accessible, and not frustrating.	Window Management and Layout	We are maintaining the window states that were introduced with the “new” scanning system and building on them. You will still have the options for full screen, dock left, dock right, and floating. With the changes you will be to dock the Probe Scanner and Directional Scanner windows within the Solar System map view. You will still be able to open both windows without having the solar system map open.
94	english	 	 Let’s start with moving your probes. Have you ever had this issue where you want to pick the cube, but a bracket is in the way?	That should no longer be an issue, as the cube should always get the mouse click sent down to it, even through other brackets	What about this one? You want to pick the front of the cube but instead you grab the front arrow.	Problem Solved! We are removing the arrow pointing towards the camera when you reach a certain angle.	Ever wondered why we let the arrows go flat to a point you could not actually select them? So did we.	For resizing the probes, we are going to remove the way you click from the edge of the probe spheres and replace it with a slider in the Probe Scanner window. We found the current implementation to not be accurate enough and with other brackets enabled it caused too much opportunity for unintentional item selection.	This means for resizing probes there are 4 available methods:	New Slider in the Probe Scanner window	Alt + Mouse wheel	Dedicated shortcuts set through the Shortcuts tab in the Settings window
94	english	 	 Our aim with all these changes is to improve the overall visibility in the solar system view so it is always clear which signatures you are scanning.	Probe Manipulation	Positioning your probes is kind of a big deal when scanning, so we decided to address some of the pain points that both systems, old and new, have been causing for people.
95	english	 	 NEVER ASSUME	EVE Online is almost 14 years old now and has seen many battles during its lifetime, and one can say the code base is thoroughly battle tested. However, that doesn't mean sneaky bugs might not be hiding there, but finding a bug in such a fundamental function was surprising, to say the least. I guess we can never assume that any part of our code base is absolutely 100% correct. CCP karkur and others have spent a considerable amount of time tracking this issue down so we had high confidence in the higher level code. This allowed me to go into this investigation on the assumption that Sleep was broken, being stubborn until I found this rare edge case.	We have reason to believe that a few other bugs are symptoms of the same underlying issue - the overview not updating, for example, or the shield, armor and structure bars not updating. These bugs have always been nearly impossible to reproduce but nevertheless are reported occasionally, especially after mass tests or heavy fights on Tranquility.
95	english	 	 THE EUREKA MOMENT	When a channel object is deleted, its memory is now free and available for reuse. This implies that a tasklet that goes to sleep on the same tick as a tasklet is killed exactly when it wanted to wake up can get the same channel pointer as the killed tasklet. RemoveSleeper will in that case remove the wrong tasklet (the one that just called SleepWallclock) from the heap, kill it's channel, leaving it in a non-scheduled, non-blocked state.	The fix is simple - move the Py_DECREF calls into SleepWallclock. This ensures that channel objects are not recycled prematurely, and in my opinion is actually cleaner, keeping the reference counting localized in one function.
95	english	 	 Again, it all looks alright - the tasklet is removed from the heap and the channel is released. Note that it is not an error if the tasklet can't be found on the heap - it could have woken up and been scheduled on the same tick as it is being killed, but in that case the channel will have been released in Tick.	Let's examine this a bit further, though. Keep in mind that Py_DECREF frees the memory if the reference count goes to zero. The PyChannel_New call in SleepWallclock returns a PyChannelObject with a reference count of one. There are no references added, so the channel object is deleted in Tick when it calls Py_DECREF.  This should be fine, as there are no references to the channel in SleepWallclock after the receive call. Except...	In RemoveSleeper, which is called after a tasklet has been killed we're comparing channel objects. There should always be a one-to-one correspondence with tasklets and channels so we're effectively looking for a tasklet here, but since we needed to keep track of channels to wake them up, we just use the channels. I added a reference to the tasklet in the Sleeper object so that I could verify it here, and lo and behold, when running the scripts from CCP karkur I got a discrepancy - a tasklet was determined to be in the heap based on the channel, but the tasklet didn't match.
95	english	 	     if (mWallclockSleepers.front().due > now)
95	english	 	 while (mWallclockSleepers.size()) {
95	english	 	 //gather sleepers for wakeup	std::vector sleepers;
95	english	 	     return ret;	}	The SleepWallclock function creates the channel, stores it in the Sleeper object, puts the Sleeper object in the heap and calls receive on the channel. The receive call returns after Synchro::Tick has called send on the channel. That unblocks it, causing it to be scheduled. The tasklet could also be killed, in which case receive returns a nullptr. Let's take a look at a snippet from Synchro::Tick:
95	english	 	     // Go to sleep and wake up! *(the sender releases the channel)	    PyObject *ret = PyChannel_Receive(sl.channel);	    if (!ret) {	        //we were killed, so lets try and find us in the queue, to release resources.	        RemoveSleeper( mWallclockSleepers, sl );	    }
95	english	 	     Sleeper sl;	    sl.channel = PyChannel_New(NULL);	    if (!sl.channel)	        return 0;	    PyChannel_SetPreference(sl.channel, 0); //just make runnable on wakeup	    sl.due = due;	    mWallclockSleepers.Insert(sl);
95	english	 	 SHOW ME THE CODE	I had a hunch that killing tasklets might be a factor in this, but I couldn't see anything wrong with the code around that. Nevertheless, I couldn't convince myself that the reference counting of the channel was correct, so I decided to clean up the code a bit. It felt awkward how it was done.	PyObject* Synchro::SleepWallclock(int ms, const int64_t &due)	{
95	english	 	         Py_DECREF( sl.channel );	    }	}
95	english	 	     }	    if( it != sleepers.end() )	    {	        //Ok found us.  Let's delete us.	        sleepers.Remove( it );
95	english	 	         {	            break;	        }
95	english	 	     for( it = sleepers.begin(); it != sleepers.end(); ++it )	    {	        if( it->channel == sl.channel )
95	english	 	     SleeperIt it;
95	english	 	         Sleeper &s = sleepers[i];	        if (PyChannel_GetBalance(s.channel)) {	            int res = PyChannel_Send(s.channel, Py_None);	            if (res)	                PyOS->PyError();	        }	        Py_DECREF(s.channel);	    }	}	This all looks correct - the channel could not pulled out from under the tasklet until after the Send call. What happens when a tasklet is killed?	void Synchro::RemoveSleeper( Heap &sleepers, Sleeper &sl )	{
95	english	 	     for(unsigned int i = 0; i < sleepers.size(); i++) {
95	english	 	     Be::Time nnow = BeOS->GetActualTime();
95	english	 	         break;	    sleepers.push_back(mWallclockSleepers.Shift());	}	if (sleepers.size()) {
95	english	 	 SOME BACKGROUND	Tasklets (see Stackless Python for more information) are run in PyScheduler::Run, by calling PyStackless_RunWatchdogEx. This method takes in a timeout value and runs any scheduled tasklets until the given time has passed. When a tasklet is created, it is scheduled and so will run when the PyScheduler::Run is called. When a tasklet sleeps, it calls Synchro::SleepWallclock, which is implemented by creating a channel and calling receive on the channel. This blocks the channel until somebody sends something on that channel. Synchro maintains a heap of sleepers - a sleeper is a simple object that holds the due time when the tasklet should wake up, and the channel. Synchro::Tick pulls sleepers from the top of the heap and sends a value on the channel. This in turn unblocks the tasklet and schedules it.	My first idea was that there might be a bug in the heap code. It's our own code, it's old and there are no unit tests for it. I considered writing some tests for it, or even finding a suitable replacement, but then I realized the symptoms didn't match with the tasklet never being pulled from that heap. If that were the case, the tasklet would simply remain blocked forever. It's still on my to-do list to add tests for this code, though.	My next idea came from looking at the documentation of PyStackless_RunWatchdogEx. It can return a tasklet, that should either be killed or rescheduled. That turned out to be a dead end - this only applies when running in preemptive mode, where a tasklet can be interrupted.
95	english	 	 HOW IT ALL BEGAN	A little while ago CCP karkur asked me if I could help with an issue she had been looking into with the drone window, where it sometimes would stop updating when drones are being recalled. Her investigation did not uncover any bugs in the code related to drones or the UI. Over the course of a few hours, she managed to repro the drone bug 3 times, each time adding more logging where the problem seemed to lie. After the last repro, it became clear that it was failing at the least expected line of code - the drone window simply started updating, then went to sleep for a bit, but never woke up again -  it seemed that tasklets were on occasion simply not returning from their sleep.	The original bug was quite difficult to reproduce, but CCP karkur put together a script that generated 500,000 tasklets that simply sleep for some given time, with some tracking to identify tasklets that never finish. With this script, we've been able to reproduce this sleeping disorder somewhat reliably. This script identified the tasklet that didn't wake up, and upon inspection it was clear that the tasklet was neither scheduled nor blocked - it was in some sort of limbo.	My first attempts at reproducing the bug with CCP karkur's script were not successful - I was running in Jessica (our authoring/debugging tool) without the client and didn't seem to have any luck. Later I tried in the client with better luck, so it seemed there was more to it than simply having lots of tasklets. I started reading through the relevant C++ code to try to come up with theories.
96	english	 	 HANDY FAQ!	Q: When will this feature launch?	A: We don’t have an exact date yet, but this feature is in active development now, and you can expect more detailed information on the launch timeline at EVE Fanfest in early April.	Q: What will happen to existing market orders for PLEX when the feature launches?	A: We will cancel all orders and repay fees, as usual when we make a major type conversion.	Q: Will market histories reflect the change in PLEX value?	A: New PLEX will be a new item type, getting its own graphs and history data starting from day one and leaving old PLEX data unaffected.	Q: Can I still buy Aurum?	A: Yes! All current Aurum packages will be available until near launch of these changes, after which we will close Aurum purchasing completely.	Q: Can I still buy PLEX?	A: Yes, until launch of these changes PLEX will continue to work exactly as today, and be offered from CCP at same rates and packages. Any PLEX you own on launch of these changes will be converted to 500 of the new PLEX.	Q: Why are you only converting Aurum balances above 1000?	A: A large portion of the total Aurum stockpile is in small balances left over from past giveaways and by not converting those small balances we mitigate risk of oversupply in the PLEX market	Q: For balances over 1000, will the entire balance be converted or only the amount exceeding 1000?	A: The entire balance will be converted. For example, a balance of 1050 Aurum would be converted into 150 PLEX.	Q: Will prices change in the New Eden Store?	A: Prices may change after the conversion from Aurum to PLEX as not all prices will be possible to convert at even numbers. Overall this change to PLEX is not made with the intention to change the price of products such as Skill Extractors in the New Eden Store, and we will define new pricing in PLEX to match the current pricing in Aurum.	Q: With smaller PLEX, will I be able to buy less than 30 days of Omega time?	A: We currently we have no plans regarding smaller game time packages.

More details will emerge over coming months as we take on feedback and continue to nail down specifics. We’ve included a Q and A below to try and address some common questions, let us know if we miss anything!
96	english	 	 WHAT ABOUT AURUM?	Aurum had its run but we are excited to move forward with PLEX only. On launch day for this feature we will convert all existing Aurum balances above 1000 Aurum to the new PLEX. Today you get 3500 AUR for every PLEX you convert to Aurum, and this is the same rate we will match to convert Aurum to the new PLEX. This means that if your Aurum balance on launch day is 1000 Aurum or more, it will be converted in its entirety and you will get 1 PLEX for every 7 Aurum.
96	english	 	 THE NEW NEW EDEN STORE	With a much smaller PLEX, we can easily set up the New Eden Store catalog in PLEX prices rather than Aurum and let you use PLEX from your vault to buy things there. The coexistence of PLEX and Aurum has always been a heavy burden on anyone who wanted to buy something from CCP. Whether you just wanted a SKIN or you wanted to buy the smartest item to trade with other players to get ISK, you had some math to do. With Aurum out of the picture and PLEX taking over in the NES, buying should be much less confusing.
96	english	 	 THE PLEX VAULT	We also want PLEX to be easier to find and understand. To make it easier for players to find out what PLEX is and what it can do, we are introducing the PLEX Vault. The Vault is an inventory location, shared across all characters on an account, that stores PLEX and shows common actions you can take with it, as well as how you can get it.	Like any other inventory location, the Vault will appear in the list of locations to the left and you can drag PLEX in and out of the Vault to any other inventory you have access to. PLEX is the only item that can be kept in the Vault. When you purchase PLEX from CCP, it will go straight to your PLEX Vault instead of the Redeem queue.	It will look something like this (work in progress):	The PLEX Vault will allow you to move PLEX safely throughout the universe rather than having to move it in a ship. It will still be possible to carry it in a ship like any other item if you want, so if you have an urge to fill a shuttle full of PLEX and tour low sec just drag PLEX out of the vault and into your cargo and you’re good to go.	We know how much you love it when ships blow up with piles of PLEX inside, we even might understand why, but, we also don’t want new PLEX users to be losing their PLEX before they can trade it because they didn’t know how to get to market safely.
96	english	 	 SMALLER PLEX	The first component of our plan is focused on making PLEX more flexible. Currently, PLEX is rather large. By always existing as a one-month chunk of subscription time, PLEX can be cumbersome to buy and trade. We think it would be great if it could be broken into smaller units that fit your needs rather than always being bound to the size of 30 days. With that in mind, our first planned change is to convert every existing PLEX into 500 PLEX. After the change, anything you could get for 1 Plex from CCP will instead require 500 Plex. This new PLEX granularity will allow us to sell smaller PLEX packages, and allow you to trade whatever amounts you like with each other.
97	english	 	 Team Size Matters
97	english	 	 FEATURE TIMELINE	Speaking of the release date, there was a lot of interest in hearing when we expect to go live. While we still can’t give a specific day, we know it’s important for you to have a ballpark so you can get your ducks in a row. Our current target is for shortly after Fanfest, in late Spring or early Summer. Delays are always possible but for those of you worried it would be Q4 or later, rest assured.	Thanks very much for all the input, we hope these updates find you well.
97	english	 	 BROKERS FEES FOR PLEX ORDERS	Last week we mentioned that active market orders for old PLEX would have their brokers fees refunded during the conversion. The CSM was kind of enough to remind us that in Citadels, brokers fees are paid to the Citadel owner, meaning that if we refund fees in Citadels we create a nice ISK printing machine for wealthy players. While following up on this, our team discovered that we don’t actually have the ability to refund fees at all. In EVE, fees are paid as a transaction when an order is placed and not tied to the order itself. This is one of our team’s first “type” conversions and we were simply confused. Sorry for that. Hopefully, with adequate warning, orders can be set up with release date in mind to minimize wasted fees.
97	english	 	 AURUM TOKENS	One more tiny detail for Aurum which has not been mentioned so far: we will be removing Aurum tokens from the game. Many of you might not even know they exist, as you haven’t been able to create them for years, but, there’s still a few around so if you have some get them converted back to Aurum currency before we make the switch to PLEX.
97	english	 	 AURUM BALANCES UNDER 1000	Next up: Aurum conversion for players with Aurum balances of 1000 or less. The goal behind the initial plan was to minimize devaluation of PLEX at launch due to Aurum stockpiles entering the market, which is still a big priority, but, we hear you loud and clear that leaving some balances to not be converted is not a good enough solution.	After several days of looking at alternatives, we now intend to delay conversion for small balances rather than not converting at all. On feature release, we will convert Aurum balances greater than 1000 to PLEX immediately, and then, 3 months later, convert balances under 1000 Aurum. This should mitigate impact on the PLEX market and give us a good window to look at activity and adjust if needed.	Along with the change to conversion, we want to reiterate that we are going to be running offers in the in-game New Eden Store up until a few days before release so that spending those leftover balances is easy and rewarding. Specifics on those deals are still in the works but we want to make sure you have good options leading up to the day we convert.
97	english	 	 30 DAYS AT A TIME	First, we want to emphasize that there are currently no plans to sell game time in portions smaller than 30 days. We noticed that some of you made the fair assumption that because PLEX was becoming granular, it would mean subscription time would be granular as well. This is not the case. Our current plan is that PLEX will only be redeemed for game time in 30 day chunks, just like now. If you were worried about seeing cyno alts subbed for 3 hours at a time, don’t worry.

98	english	 	 WE WANT YOUR INPUT!	To help keep our roadmap responsive to the needs of all of you in the community we have prepared a special survey asking about your experiences with Upwell Structures and asking for your opinions on what we should be prioritizing for our next steps. We have already asked the CSM for additions to the backlog and then for their individual priority rankings of a similar set of potential changes and now we want to hear from the community as a whole. This survey has been emailed directly to a large number of EVE players to ensure responses from a wide cross-section of the community, and it can also be found at this link directly.	We do want to make clear that since many of these changes require wildly different development time commitments we can’t commit to completing all of them and the feedback we receive from this survey will represent one of several inputs into our internal roadmap. However, we do believe that this list represents a lot of potentially beneficial improvements to Upwell Structures and we really want to see what you folks in the community think about the relative importance of different changes. We encourage you to fill out the survey and we want to thank all participants in advance.	Thanks for joining us for this dev blog today, and we hope that all of you will be able to find time to complete the survey so we can incorporate your feedback into our prioritization! Now that we’ve discussed the wider world of Upwell Structure features, the sister dev blog in this one will drill down (pun intended) on the next set of Upwell Structures in development: Refineries. These new structures will be the one-stop shops for resource collection and processing in New Eden, and will usher in major changes to moon harvesting and reactions as well as providing the cluster’s best reprocessing services. You can check out that blog here.	We welcome community feedback on the contents of both of today’s dev blogs. You can get in touch with the members of Team Five O on the official forums as well as social media and in person at Fanfest! EVE Online is a constantly growing and evolving work of science fiction and the community is absolutely crucial to choosing its direction.

98	english	 	 THE SCOPE
98	english	 	 With the release of Refineries, reactions will be moved from starbases to a special set of service modules exclusive to Refineries. These service modules will enable reactions as a new type of industry, using the same interface as manufacturing and research. These new service modules will have the same security status restrictions as the existing starbase structures, meaning that reactions will be limited to lowsec and below. Like other industry, the new reactions system will not have hard limits on the number of jobs per structure, and will have per-character limits that can be increased with a new skill.	The existing reactions will be converted to new blueprints that enable the reaction process in the new system, and new reactions will include small amounts of ice products in each run to compensate for the lower number of starbase towers needed for advanced industry.	Thanks for joining us for this look ahead at the work-in-progress Upwell Refineries! A big reason for releasing early dev blogs like this is that we want to hear from all of you, on the forums as well as in person at Fanfest!	If you haven’t already done so, I highly recommend checking out the companion blog to this one that covers the past and near-future of Upwell Structures and includes a survey so you can have your say in our prioritization of changes.	Everything in this blog is subject to change as we respond to feedback and adjust designs and get closer to release. We’ll be keeping you up to date on these and other structure changes through more blogs as well as our official forums.	Fly safe and happy building!	-Team Five O	alt
98	english	 	 With all this new activity around the moons of New Eden, the corporations claiming the moons will need new tools for tracking what’s going on in their territory. The mining ledger is the new open-ended tool for Refinery owners to keep track of who is mining in their belt.	Each Refinery structure with an active moon drill will keep track of all the mining done in its associated belt, logging the character, corporation, ore type and amount mined. This will allow Refinery managers to share profits or request fees as they see fit, allow mining operations to more easily organize themselves, and allow corps and alliances to see who has been ninja-mining their fields without permission.	The ledger will be available in the client, exportable to spreadsheets, and obtainable through an API for those who wish to build advanced tools. It will not update fast enough to provide a real-time warning system against ninja miners, but it will allow owners to look back at what happened in the past and plan their revenge or negotiations as they see fit.	All moon drilling refineries will log mining activity in the moon asteroid fields they generate, and we are also investigating opening up the option of tracking entire solar systems worth of mining for Refineries that are also owned by sov holders.	Reactions	Refineries will also bring changes to the system for reacting moon materials and gasses into more advanced materials. Reactions are a key part of the resource processing chain for Tech-2 items, Tech-3 ships, and boosters, and we believe that the current reaction system using starbases has a lot of room to improve in user experience and quality of life.
98	english	 	 Moon mining is an area of gameplay that will be receiving very significant changes with the release of Refineries. The old moon mining system in starbases has been untouched since the early years of EVE and we believe that there’s a lot of room to make a system that provides better gameplay for many kinds of players.	The key goals of the new moon mining system are to create a new form of active group gameplay that organized corps and alliances can aspire towards and compete for. The new system must support gameplay for many different types of players, involve strategic choices, and reward players who can cooperate well.	Those of you who have been following the community discussions around moon mining over the last several years probably won’t be surprised by the key parts of this design, as we are building on a foundation of ideas that have been brought up and discussed many times from many sources.	Here’s a walkthrough of the process currently planned for the new moon mining system:	A refinery that is deployed close enough to a moon can fit a special moon drilling service module. Fitting of this module will only be an option if no other drills are fit to other Refineries around the same moon, so only one structure can mine each moon at a time. This service module gives the owners the ability to designate how large of a fracking operation they wish to begin, with larger chunks taking longer time to prepare.	The moon drilling module begins blasting a chunk of the moon away from its surface and dragging it towards the structure. This process takes between one and several weeks depending on the choices made by the structure owner. Observers can watch the chunk move through space as a way of estimating when it will reach the Refinery.	Once the chunk of moon rock has completed its journey into space, the Refinery can use its drill module to detonate the chunk into a minable asteroid field. The exact time of the detonation is controlled by the owners of the Refinery within limits. If the chunk is left unattended long enough it will disintegrate into the asteroid field on its own.	The new asteroid field that appears with the explosion of the chunk will contain new types of valuable ores that will yield moon minerals when reprocessed. The composition of the field will depend on the composition of moon materials available in the moon. The field will generally remain far enough away from the Refinery structure that you won’t be able to effectively mine it from docking range but close enough for a pilot controlling the Refinery to be able to cover the friendly miners and/or attack uninvited guests.	Once the chunk has exploded, the drilling module can begin fracturing a new part of the moon to start the process again.	The time scale for this whole cycle will be controllable by the owners of the Refinery, within constraints. Longer cycle times will mean more ore generated in each explosion.	To be clear: Refinery structures themselves will be deployable anywhere that other Upwell structures can be deployed. However only Refineries deployed near minable moons will be able to fit a moon drill service module. The deployment UI for Refineries will clearly show whether the structure is in a location suitable for moon mining before deployment is confirmed.	We’re still in the process of determining how much or little we may need to adjust distribution of moon minerals, and announcements in that area will come later once we’re a little closer to release. However, for this first release we are not currently planning on expanding moon mining to areas of space where it is not available today (highsec and wormholes). Although this gameplay has the potential to be interesting and fun in any area of space we want to be careful not to dilute the regional value of tech two resource collection too much.	Since the time between events will be fairly long, we are expecting this group mining event to be a special high-value occasional event where your corp’s usual miners can turn their attention away from their normal belts and clusters for a few hours and players who only mine once in a while can pull out their barges and join in. In many ways these events will be like mining incursions that are partly controllable by the structure owner. The income from mining these asteroids will of course vary based on market forces and demand for different moon materials, but we expect mining the fields generated by good moons to be very valuable with higher isk/m3 than the high-end ABC (Arkonor, Bistot, Crokite) ores.	The Mining Ledger
98	english	 	 Reprocessing will be the simplest and most universal of the initial Refinery roles. Refineries will receive bonuses when using the existing Standup Reprocessing Facility service module, and the existing reprocessing rigs will be rebalanced to go along with these new bonuses. On patch day we will automatically unfit existing reprocessing rigs that are fit to Citadels and Engineering Complexes so that structure owners can have the option of either fitting their rigs right back on to the same structure or moving those rigs to a Refinery if they wish.	Since Refineries will not have an XL version, the rebalance of reprocessing rigs will include improved generalization for the L and M sized reprocessing rigs and a reduction in cost for the XL reprocessing rigs. We will be issuing appropriate compensation for owners of any rigs that have their build costs reduced.	Moon Mining
98	english	 	 DRILL DOWN TO THE DETAILS!	Refineries will come in medium and large sizes with prices between that of Engineering Complexes and Citadels. Like the earlier Upwell Structures they will have docking and tethering ability as well as the whole suite of standard structure features like storage, fitting, insurance, repair and corp offices. They will be able to fit the same set of basic Standup modules as Citadels and Engineering Complexes. As we continue to add more features to the basic Upwell framework both before and after the release of Refineries they will gain those upgrades as well. The benefits of the larger sized Refinery will primarily come from increased defenses, more generalized rigs and increased docking capabilities, with all the core Refinery functionality available in both Medium and Large versions.	Refineries are intended to be the hub of resource collection and resource processing operations. At launch these operations will largely revolve around reprocessing ore, mining moons, and reacting advanced materials together to create composites. In the future we will continue to look for opportunities to tie more resource collection and processing functions to these structures. For instance, mining buffs and support roles provided by the structure are not out of the question over the medium-term, and we are interested in investigating the possibility of shifting the sov mining upgrade role from Infrastructure Hubs to Refineries eventually.

99	english	 	 FACTION VARIANTS	There are also initial plans to introduce advanced faction variants of the Organic Mass Granulator once the standard version has been rolled out. These plans will initially include variations of the deployable for the four empires, plus a special edition, before being followed with variants for each of the pirate factions.	In addition to performing the standard refining of biomass explained above with a 15% increase in output, the faction variants of the Organic Mass Granulator will include an additives bay, in which you can deposit additional materials to further enhance the output of your Granulator.

99	english	 	 BUT WAIT, THERE’S MORE!	Not only will the Organic Mass Granulator collect corpses. Once it’s full, it will also process the corpses it collects into useful raw materials.	The raw materials it will extract from the unfortunate biomass it collects are Sodium Chloride and Lacrimix, both of which are found in high concentrations throughout capsuleer corpses after a ship and pod loss.	Above – The results of processing a single unfortunate soul.	These raw materials can either be sold on the market for substantial profit, or used in the production of a new breed of combat boosters.

99	english	 	 We’re talking about these:	Above – The common Human Corpse (Meatus Popsicullus).	With the introduction of the Organic Mass Granulator, for the first time capsuleers will be able to recoup the cost of their cloning contracts, along with the cloning contracts of those unfortunate enough to be located on the business end of their weapons.	After a battle, you’ll be able to deploy an Organic Mass Granulator on the battlefield alongside your Regular Mobile Tractor Unit, and it will tractor in and collect all the unfortunate souls who were unlucky enough to be pod killed during the melee.	In addition to this, we realize that biomass collection can be quite the hobby for some capsuleers. If you already have a significant collection of unfortunate pilots, you can simply deploy an Organic Mass Granulator in space, jettison your collection on grid with it, and it will collect old biomass in the same manner as the fresh stuff (so long as they’re within 100km of the unit).	Above – An artist’s impression of the Organic Mass Granulator (Special thanks to CCP PointyBits).
99	english	 	 THE BASICS	The Organic Mass Granulator is designed as the big brother counterpart to the Mobile Tractor Unit, a deployable loved by capsuleers across the cluster for making the collection of loot significantly faster.	However, after listening to the community for a number of years, we’ve come to realize that all that glitters is not gold. After a major engagement, there are far more valuable things in space to collect than salvage and modules.

100	english	 	 UPGRADING TO SQL 2016	When I was drafting this blog we hit another massive milestone and something we really pushed to achieve before Fanfest: upgrading the SQL Engine for TQ to SQL 2016	We had been running EVE in SQL 2012 compatibility mode. But before the Fanfest rush and while the ops team is now all hands-on deck setting up as this blog is published, we were able to hit this objective on Monday April 3rd!	Quoting our friends at Microsoft … “SQL 2016 its just faster.”	That’s what we want to see happen of course.	Now the current status is to finish Fanfest (and get over the massive non-virtual hangovers) then emphasize back on the hardware side of things, since we can now easily scale our DB nodes and compare metrics where EVE benefits the most. Questions like whether having 1.5 TB of RAM helps a lot or is 768GB the right amount? Should it be 2x CPUs with more cores or lower core count and 4x CPUs essentially duplicating NUMA domains and cache etc. etc.?	Loads of options to improve the experience for you , there is always something …	I really encourage those who are coming to Fanfest and like to talk about hardware and operations related topics to check out our roundtable on Friday at 17:00 UTC in Rima B	I promise we will take the discussion to the next level at pub crawl ??

101	english	 	 A beta version of Color Blind Mode is set to go live on Tranquility as party of the June release.	alt
101	english	 	 CAN I TRY?	Well of course you can! From the EVE launcher, switch from Tranquility over to the test server Singularity and give it a shot. If you do, we’ve cooked up a survey to collect all that sweet feedback:	//www.surveygizmo.com/s3/3552574/2017-04-EVE-Online-Color-Blind-Mode-Survey
101	english	 	 THE APPROACH	Deuteranopia is not only a very hard word to pronounce, but also the most common form of color blindness (red/green). Protanopia is the second most common form (red/green, like Deuteranopia) and Tritanopia the third most common (blue/yellow). Our original plan was to add one mode for each of those and call it a day. We have a handful of colorblind devs at the CCP Reykjavik Office whom we ruthlessly used as guinea pigs and one of the biggest findings during those sessions was that the forms of color blindness don’t seem to be quite as clear cut as those in the 92.001% originally assumed. As a result of our testing, we ended up with two preset modes and one custom mode that allows you to toggle any of the 6 main hues to be included in a resulting color palette. To turn on color blind mode, simply open the ESC menu / General Settings / Color Blind Mode and play around with the settings.	Some games that offer color blind modes simply replace all color on the screen using the selected color blind hue mapping, but as it seems people don’t really care too much for that approach since it makes the game world look weird for no good reason as it’s only color used for indication of state that causes problems. Instead, we only apply the color-blind hue mapping to UI highlight colors, meaning that it’s mostly icons and text that get affected and not background color, the 3d scene, or graphical images like items. There are a couple UI areas where color blind mode does not work for the time being (most noticeably the scanning 3d scene), but it is our hope we’ll get all those areas covered in the future.

The goal of the group will be to provide CCP feedback from a smaller group than the general EVE community for faster discussion with improved clarity.	The logs of the channel will be automatically published to the public on this website for transparency. Everyone can see what is being discussed, but only focus group members and CCP devs can actually talk in the channel	We opened up applications for the focus group last week in this forum thread, and we want to thank everyone who put their name forward for the group. Unfortunately we can’t accept everyone or else we would have a group too large to be functional.	The players we have selected for the initial round of this focus group are:
102	english	 	 Thanks again and fly safe!
102	english	 	 We highly encourage all players who will be flying T3 Cruisers at the time of downtime on July 11th get themselves into a safe location such as a friendly starbase or docked within a station/structure before the downtime begins. This will ensure that they do not get caught in a dangerous situation with some of their modules offline when they next log in.

102	english	 	 LET’S SET A DATE	We are now at the point where we can announce the tentative schedule for releasing this rebalance. Currently these changes are scheduled for release on July 11th, 2017.	Since these changes to Strategic Cruisers will be very significant in scope, existing ships and subsystems will go through a dramatic transformation on patch day. We want to start warning people now about the impacts of this transformation and will continue communicating it over the next two months to ensure that players are not caught by surprise.	Existing subsystems that are not fit to a Strategic Cruiser will be directly transformed into their closest functional equivalent under the new system.	Strategic Cruisers with subsystems fit to them will have their subsystems converted into new ones directly, and will receive one extra subsystem placed in their cargo hold (to ensure that players have the same number of subsystems before and after the patch).	This means that although all fitted Strategic Cruisers will continue to have a valid set of subsystems after the patch, some of their modules may go offline as fitting and even slot layouts may change.	We highly encourage all players who will be flying T3 Cruisers at the time of downtime on July 11th get themselves into a safe location such as a friendly starbase or docked within a station/structure before the downtime begins. This will ensure that they do not get caught in a dangerous situation with some of their modules offline when they next log in.

104	english	 	 VARIATION AND EXPERIMENTATION	Then came the next problem: the design had changed, and trying to recreate some of those early ideas from the 2d concept on this new hull just didn’t look right. I wanted the Muninn and the Broadsword to be even bulkier to reflect their extra tank bonuses. But the base hull we now had, was already so bulky we couldn’t just start adding a ton of mass without interrupting firing angles or covering up what was making the hull interesting. The hollow gun bay also meant we’d used a lot more polygons than we originally wanted, so we were limited by what we could afford from a performance standpoint. From talks with the CSM and players we’ve got a guide line that the Tech-1 hull has to stay conservatively close to the original design, but when we come to our Tech-2 hulls we can go as crazy as we want with deviation.	I spent a few days playing with some really goofy simple 3d additions, trying to find something that had the right character for what I wanted from the Muninn.	We had to incorporate Brutor curved sails somewhere, and came up with the idea of having one long hanging sail along the front a bit like a bayonet. I also had this idea that i wanted to play off the ship’s role as a ship optimized for long range artillery. While we can’t just make the guns bigger, we can play with some simple shape recognition to get across these ideas. The ship already looked somewhat like a pistol, so we exaggerated that a bit and placed another larger shape on the front like a barrel as well as some extra sensors and targeting equipment. We flattened this shape to give it some fragility, and the high surface area kind of implied it was some over-sized piece of fire control equipment using advanced sensors like the SAAB TP100 AWAC.	We also moved the bridge further down as the new sensors and sails would have blocked any attempt to look out of the previous one.	During this time, we also played with adding on some larger plating. But with the other additions the front began to become way too busy visually. I liked the hanging, spaced armor idea though, so we added these plates to the base t1 which helped visually distinguish it from the t2s.	This plating that we added to these ships needed to serve a more ambiguous role than say, with Amarr. Minmatar ships can be used with shields or armor tanks generally, so behind these armor plates I added lots of texture detail that implies some shield generation or projection role as well. Depending on what the capsuleer fits, it was conceivable these large defense plates could be serving both roles, either as reinforced plating to mitigate incoming damage, or as a large projection surface for reinforced shielding.	Then came the Broadsword. This one was oozing potential for functional elements and plating to reflect it’s incredibly tanky nature. I wanted the front to be entirely composed of an eccentric looking series of generators that would create the warp disruption field that defines the role of interdictors. We made it blockier, and in texturing gave it lots of small, thicker plating to look well defended like a tank. Some of the side-skirt plating came from looking at lots of kitted up Panzer tanks. We also went pretty wild with animations, giving it lots of techy stuff that flips open and unfolds, with two large aggressive tusks at the front that serve to channel and project the warp disruption field.	The Rupture is a bit unique in that it has a unique faction hull variant, the Mimir which was given out for Alliance Tournament 7 winners. We also updated the look of this variant, using the Muninn heavy assault cruiser’s hull and adding the characteristic sails of the ATVII ships as well as an extra pair of boosters.	And finally, to celebrate Tribal Liberation day, the Rupture hull will be launching with the brand-new Firewall Breach skin, sporting the design of the Khumaak, once a symbol of Amarrian power subverted into the most powerful symbol of Minmatar liberation.	We hope everyone will enjoy these new designs once you get your hands on them in the July release.
104	english	 	 DESIGN SPACE	There was a recurring problem both with this design and the Bantam redesign over the blurry lines between Minmatar and Caldari design spaces. Both use large, flat shapes and live dangerously close together, so this was an opportunity to think about what our goals are for Minmatar and how to contrast that with all our new Caldari redesigns.	During the Rupture redesign process, we added lots of exposed scaffolding. The gun ports being exposed added the concept of using lots of negative space as a design element. I began looking at spaced armor on tanks and vehicles, and from there my reference folder was full of older World War 2 photos of vehicles. This accidentally became the defining decision process on making sure we didn’t step on Caldari design shoes, as all their ships are based on sleeker, cutting edge modern day and future military tech. Everything is enclosed into a sleek and uniform shell, with very few exposed electronics.	With Minmatar, we’ve gone the opposite way--everything should be on display. The Rupture hull would be broken up into chunky plating, with rugged functionality exposed to the space outside the hull and dark gaps in the armor exposing structural beams. The ships would be bulkier, but, unlike Gallente, most of that bulk would be composed of empty spaces rather than voluminous hull and structure. Despite being a big ship in terms of dimensions, it could still conceivably be light and fast compared to its Caldari counterparts due to the stripped down, hollow look we were going for. The oversized engines helped sell this even more.	The Rupture’s original transom rear gave us room to add large galleries of windows of generous size, compared to Caldari’s utilitarian and sparse windows. The orange glow and dark spaces gave a nice feeling that the interior of the ship was warm, playing into a recent theme of Minmatar tribal fire pits we’ve been playing with for FX. We tried to add a homey kind of glowing feel to the windows on the ship to help convey that Minmatar ships are generally more crowded with crew than other races. We also added a dedicated bay just under this area for launching drones and other small craft that a cruiser may need.	After this back and forth, we ended up with a model that was pretty final
104	english	 	 ITERATIVE PRODUCTION	When we finally got the go ahead to enter production for the redesign, we had a pretty solid basis to go on. I did some very messy blockouts early on that identified lots of issues with the designs that are hard to identify in 2d. There were so many shapes that we couldn’t easily transition from one to another, and once in 3d after merging conflicting angles together, we felt like the design was looking a bit too much like a busy Caldari design. CCP BunnyVirus began doing his own blockout that was a bit cleaner and blockier, and from there we began to better work things out.	Our biggest initial problem was that, despite being happy with what was generally going on, a lot of our decisions meant that we’d lost some subtle angles of the original Rupture and made the sides too flat. Our art director had the idea that the gun bay should be visible, with players able to see the tucked away turrets inside of an armor plating. The complexity of making this work had massively inflated the size of the hull around the gun ports, which resulted in this very flat side as you can see above. From the side the ship looked great, but when viewed directly from the front and top it felt too monolithic.	I looked a lot at the original Rupture’s silhouette, and we tried to add in very subtle changes that wouldn’t interrupt the ship’s firing angles or require us to clumsily add in tertiary turret locators. We also slightly angled the gun port covers to add a downward slant, which helped break up the 90-degree angle when viewed from the front, exaggerating the ship’s inverted pyramid shape.
104	english	 	 WHY DO WE DO REDESIGNS?	EVE is a vast and beautiful universe, yet it was designed in the early 2000s by a very small concept art team in a very different and still fledgling world of 3d graphics. Concept art at the time, like much of the industry, was still done on paper and scanned. During that time EVE was also in a formative state fueled by CCP’s large ambition. It was impossible to know what designs would get cut, what would get repurposed, and how the style would evolve even during those early production days.	Over the years, CCP has grown and evolved to adopt more modern workflows, disciplines have changed to reflect industry practices, and our art style has shifted due to advances in graphics technology. Originally a dark, foreboding universe without complex materials on ships, EVE embraced these limitations with a dark, cyberpunky dystopian art direction. Space was cold and empty. Limitations on texture sizes, reduced polygon counts, and a simple lighting engine meant ships could be incredibly ambiguous with shapes and details, allowing user imagination to take over and fill in the details of these starships. Like many games at the time.	Reimagining this universe and keeping it visually up to date, both in terms of actual asset quality and art direction, has been an ongoing challenge. Since inception, EVE has been a visually stunning game, causing business partners and journalists of 2003 to disbelieve that screenshots were done in-client. Beginning with the Trinity expansion (2008), in which we overhauled our graphics engine, updated our texturing approach to lay the ground work for modern shader techniques, and reworked every new ship design we’d released, our older ships began to show their legacy. They haven’t quite fit in with the new design languages we’d adopted or they suffered from poor conversion during shader model updates.	Ships that have been left behind in these conversions, needs to be updated. Which brings us to the point of this blog – how do you reimagine designs that have been iconic to players and fans for over a decade?

105	english	 	 WAIT? NO MORE ANALYSIS KREDITS?	Yup, that’s right… but no cause for concern!	Project Discovery has now found a new and permanent home with the CONCORD Assembly. Going forward, Analysis Kredits will no longer be awarded as part of the rewards.	While you’ll no longer be able to earn AK, you’ll still be able to spend it in the same way you currently can, so no pilot will lose out on any rewards from phase one of Project Discovery.	The only difference that will occur is that with the start of phase two of the project, the display of AK balance will be removed from the Project Discovery interface. You will however still be able to see which phase one rewards you can and cannot afford in the Sisters of EVE loyalty point store as usual.	The idea with this change is to both show solid and measurable progression through Project Discovery, and simplify the issue of rewards so that they’re place directly into your redeeming system and are easier to collect.
105	english	 	 We all know that capsuleers love doing science, however we also know that they are also dirty capitalists. With this in mind, CONCORD is offering various rewards for your efforts in assisting with their research.	Rather than using Analysis Kredits (AK) in the same way as the first phase of Project Discovery, CONCORD will be awarding points for each analysis of a light curve that’s completed with the added bonus that the more accurate your analysis is, the more points you’ll receive.	These points will let you level you up in Project Discovery. At each level you’ll receive a container that holds an exclusive Project Discovery SKIN for a randomly selected hull from one of the four main empires.	As you reach specific milestones of level 10, level 25, then every 25th level up to 200, you’ll receive tiered rewards which contain character apparel exclusive to Project Discovery, as well as BPCs and stunning new SKINs for the CONCORD Pacifier class frigate and Enforcer class cruiser.	All these rewards will be placed directly into your redeeming system.	Here’s a sneak peek at some of the ships, SKINs, and apparel that will be a part of the rewards.	(click the images to enlarge them!)
105	english	 	 (click to enlarge)	Once you’ve identified a potential transit event, you’ll be able to submit your findings to CONCORD, and they’ll be shipped off to the University of Geneva for further analysis by scientists there.
105	english	 	 (click to enlarge)	As part of the analysis, you’ll be given tools that will allow you to fold the luminosity curve of over time, and chop the curve into pieces of a given length so that you can overlay them across each other. This can make it easier to define periodic drops in luminosity, as they’ll line up if the graph is folded to the same frequency.	You‘ll also have a detrending tool at your disposal, which attempts to filter out large scale events caused by the star itself rather than a transiting object. Pilots can set the granularity of the detrending tool so that it will only filter out events that take longer than the set time span (options are 1 hour, 5 hours, 10 hours and 24 hours).
105	english	 	 (click to enlarge)	When playing Project Discovery, you will be presented with a light curve graph representing a star’s luminosity over time, which you’ll analyze primarily by looking for regular dips in luminosity. 	These dips can indicate the transit of a substantially large celestial body between the star being measured and the telescope here in Earth’s orbit. Generally, the only object large enough to cause such dips are exoplanets or other stars.
105	english	 	 DOING SCIENCE!
105	english	 	 THE HARDCORE SCIENCE	One of the most fruitful methods we have of finding exoplanets is transit photometry.	This method uses long term measurements of the luminosity – or brightness – of a star. With these measurements, we can note systematic changes in apparent luminosity of the star which allows us to track celestial bodies in its orbit.	This is where you guys start doing science!	Pilots will be presented with light curves that belong to any one of the 160,000 stars that the CoRoT telescope is monitoring, and will be tasked with identifying transitional planets – planets that are passing between the star and Earth – by highlight drops in the star’s luminosity.	To do this, pilots will be equipped with in game tools to filter out variations in the star’s luminosity that do not resemble transiting events, as well as a tool to confirm that these transits are regular and periodic.	When our pilots have reached a consensus, the data will be transmitted to scientists from the University of Geneva, who will then study the results and confirm your findings.

106	english	 	 PATCH DAY COMETH	With the arrival of such a massive Strategic Cruiser revamp comes a very significant patch-day transition process.	A lot will be changing on patch day and we want to reiterate that we highly encourage all players who will be flying T3 Cruisers at the time of downtime on July 11th get themselves into a safe location such as a friendly starbase or docked within a station/structure before the downtime begins.	All characters that have the Electronic Subsystem Technology, Amarr Electronic Systems, Gallente Electronic Systems, Caldari Electronic Systems, and/or Minmatar Electronic Systems skills trained will receive the skillpoints from these skills as unallocated skillpoints as well as isk reimbursement for the NPC cost of the skillbooks.	Any skills or datacores associated with Engineering Subsystems have been renamed to refer to “Core Subsystems”	Existing subsystems that are not fit to a Strategic Cruiser will be directly transformed into their closest functional equivalent found in the same subsystem slot under the new system.	Strategic Cruisers with subsystems fit to them will have their subsystems converted into new ones directly, and will receive one extra subsystem placed in their cargo hold (to ensure that players have the same number of subsystems before and after the patch).	Thanks for joining us today for this dev blog! We are excited to get these newly rebalanced Strategic Cruisers into all your hands with the July release. Thanks again to all the players who have provided feedback on these ships over the years and a special thanks to the focus group members.
106	english	 	 ALL THE NUMBERS!	We have posted the most up to date version of all the new Strategic Cruiser and subsystem stats and bonuses in a megathread over on our new forums. Rather than paste all 2500 words here, we will direct everyone to that thread for the specifics and stick to a general highlights list on this blog.	All four Strategic Cruisers now have the ability to unfit rigs without destroying them	All four Strategic Cruisers have gained a new dedicated 120m3 subsystem bay	All four Strategic Cruisers have had their Scan Probe Launcher CPU reduction bonus moved from their old probing subsystem onto the hull itself, making it available no matter your configuration	New overheating bonuses have been added through multiple subsystems to go alongside the pre-existing Strategic Cruiser heat bonuses. These include a reduction in nanite repair paste consumption and improved benefits for overheating repair modules, hardeners, propulsion modules and electronic warfare in various appropriate subsystems.	The former command burst and remote repair roles have been combined into one subsystem in the offensive slot. This subsystem includes range bonuses for remote repair modules, focused on falloff in a similar fashion to the bonuses currently enjoyed by Logistics Frigates.	The Legion missile and drone offensive subsystems have been combined into one extremely powerful brawling platform that enjoys full strength bonuses to both missiles and drones alongside an ample 200m3 dronebay.	Bonuses from both of the old Tengu ECM subsystems have been combined into one subsystem in the core slot that provides bonuses to both ECM strength and range	The Proteus Drone Synthesis subsystem has been upgraded to include bonuses to drone damage, hitpoints, velocity and tracking speed	The Loki defensive subsystems now provide their full-strength bonuses to both shield and armor tanking, providing unprecedented flexibility	The old Loki Hardpoint Efficiency subsystem has been replaced with a truly dedicated missile subsystem in the offensive slot, providing full support for missile-focused Minmatar pilots	Several changes have been made to the industrial requirements for building Strategic Cruisers. All the details can be found here in the forum thread.
106	english	 	 We will be keeping the focus group open for the foreseeable future so that they can pass along feedback and issues that they see cropping up after the release.
106	english	 	 THE STRATEGIC CRUISER FOCUS GROUP	To help us determine how to reach the appropriate goals for the Strategic Cruiser revamp, we decided to spin up a topic-specific community focus group. The focus group concept has proven valuable before as a way of gathering community feedback with more clarity and fewer distractions. We put out a call for volunteer applications in a forum thread, and selected a group of players with a diverse set of expertise and backgrounds that have demonstrated the ability to provide clear feedback.	Like all the CCP Focus Groups, the logs of our discussions have been available for public viewing to ensure transparency. We highly encourage players who are interested in this topic to take a look at those logs to see how the discussion progressed.	We at CCP want to thank all the players who participated in this focus group and contributed greatly to refining and improving the Strategic Cruiser designs:

107	english	 	 SUMMARY & BENEFITS	Captain's Quarters is scheduled for removal in the August release and Twitch Integration in the September release. The retirement of these features hands back a substantial number of man hours to the development team that can be spent on other aspects of gameplay in New Eden.	While some of these man hours will go into producing new content, a large proportion of them will be dedicated to new engineering efforts that will improve and advance the technologies that we use, bringing better visual fidelity EVE Online client and allowing the team to build on technologies that improve its performance and reliability.	One of the first things that we want to investigate is to release a 64-bit EVE client to better utilize your available system memory when playing. Compiling a 64-bit client has been held back by the outdated middleware that was needed by captain’s quarters.	As always, we’d love to hear your feedback on this and clear up any queries or concerns you guys have!	Please feel free to dive into the comments thread for this blog!
107	english	 	 WHAT ABOUT TWITCH INTEGRATION?	In a similar vein to captain’s quarters, the usage of integrated Twitch streaming was also recently reviewed, and with a negligible number of our pilots utilizing integrated Twitch functionality, we’ve also decided to discontinue support for this as of the September release.	Obviously, we still have 100% support for our streaming community and the incredible (and often entertaining) streams and initiatives that they run, however all our major streamers generally shy away from utilizing Twitch integration. This is purely because third party packages such as Open Broadcaster Software allow for levels of visual customizability that out integrated service could never hope to compete with, such as the ability to use custom overlays and censor parts of the screen for opsec purposes.
107	english	 	 THE FUTURE	Taking usage metrics and development time need for maintenance into account, along with the fact that captain’s quarters uses older middleware and technologies that slow down or block discussion of future engineering efforts, we have decided that the time has come to retire captain’s quarters with the August release.	Retiring captain’s quarters frees up a significant amount of development time that can be used elsewhere to focus on preparing the EVE Online client and the graphics technology used within it for a long and visually stunning future. This allows Team TriLambda to dedicate more of their time to the core of gameplay in New Eden – spaceships, and space.
107	english	 	 The following graph shows the account setting of users that logged in over the course of the last 30 days, and whether they default to hangar view, or captain’s quarters view on login:	The next graph shows the usage statistics over the course of the last two years, which notes a steady decline from 10% usage to 3% usage by the start of January this year.	This graph does of course show a spike in Captain’s Quarters usage around the release of EVE Online: Ascension where a substantial number of new players entered New Eden and defaulted to the captain’s quarters view, before the trend continued into 2017.	An interesting point to note from this graph is also the activity around the release date of EVE Online: Citadel and the several months afterwards, which shows a gradual – rather than drastic – increase in the number of pilots reverting to hangar view rather than captain’s quarters.	This indicates that many of the pilots who chose to move into citadels as homes, where captain’s quarters are not available, were already in the position where they were using hangar view instead.	This graph also correlates with the percentage of game time logged in and docked that our pilots spend in captain’s quarters versus hangar view:	It is of course important to note that while use has been falling steadily over time, part of the reason for further decline recently has been a change in the default view that occurs when a character docks in a citadel, which doesn’t offer captain’s quarters and switches the account setting to hangar view.
108	english	 	 Patch Notes For February 
108	english	 	 2018-02-13 - BY CCP FALCON
108	english	 	 NEW ORES	The new types of valuable ores mentioned above represent another major change to the whole process of moon resource harvesting. Currently a moon harvester collects the moon materials (such as Hyrocarbons, Titanium, Cadmium, Technetium, or Dysprosium) directly in a form that is ready for reacting into intermediate materials and eventually composites for T2 construction. In the new process, the moon chunk will explode into new ores that can be mined by normal capsuleer mining ships and that must be refined into moon materials using a standard reprocessing facility.	These new ores will yield more than one output material when reprocessed, just like most existing ores. We are currently planning for the addition of 20 new forms of ore that will be obtained through this process. Each of these 20 new ores will have a primary moon material that makes up a large percentage of its total value, as well as a few other materials that make up smaller percentages of the value. These secondary materials will often be other moon materials, but will also sometimes be normal minerals.	For example (names are not final): “Placeholderite Ore” might yield quite a bit of Vanadium as its primary material, with some Cobalt and Evaporate Deposits in the mix as well. “Moongooium Ore” might get most of its value from the Dysprosium it yields, but also contain a fair amount of Silicates and Mexallon.	These new ores will have five tiers of rarity just like the existing moon materials, with the rarest moon materials coming from the rarest ores. To facilitate the reprocessing of these ores (and to allow use of new mining crystals) we will be introducing five new moon ore processing skills: one for each rarity tier. These new processing skills will work much like the existing ore processing skills with a 2% bonus per level to the yields gained from reprocessing, except that each of them will apply to four ore types instead of one.

108	english	 	 IMPROVEMENTS TO MOON SURVEYING	Due to the radical changes to moon composition and the upcoming opportunities for moon surveying, we are also releasing significant user experience upgrades to the moon survey process.	Moon surveying is a lesser known form of EVE exploration that uses a special probe launcher to investigate the materials available in moons. This process has changed relatively little over the past several years and there are multiple areas where we saw opportunities to improve the UI and feedback.	The basics of the moon scanning process are:	Fit a Survey Probe Launcher module to your ship. Covert Ops ships are especially well suited for this task as they have a bonus to improve the survey speed. There are three types of probe to choose from, with different survey speeds, volumes, and skill requirements.	Fly to a spot near a moon in Lowsec or Nullsec space and start flying in the direction the moon.	Open the moon analysis window that is available from the scanner radial button when you have a Survey Probe Launcher fit.	When you launch a Survey Probe it flies in the direction that your ship was travelling (like bombs launched from stealth bombers). Probes fly through space for a few minutes and then scan the moon that is directly ahead of them. If you missed the moon then no results will display. If the moon does not contain any minable materials then no results will display.	With our new improvements to the moon scanning system there will be an improved moon analysis window that displays the remaining time for each of your probes with the moon they are attempting to scan. If you have missed the moon entirely then the destination column will show as “Unknown”, clearly indicating that a new probe will need to be launched to obtain the correct results. The moon analysis window will then display the full percentage compositions of the moons once the scans complete.	This set of changes will also include vastly improved discoverability of the moon survey process, some tweaks to the moon probe physics themselves to make them feel more realistic, and a sanity cap on the maximum range from which you can scan a moon.	This new UI will actually be arriving on Tranquility separately before expansion brings the Refineries and the moon distribution reset. With a feature as big as Refineries we have been working hard to complete many of the aspects early to give them lots of testing and feedback time. The new moon scanning UI will be arriving on the Singularity test server in the coming weeks and will be released to Tranquility in our August release. In the time between the August release and the Winter Expansion with Refineries the new UI will continue to display units of quantity for each moon material present on the moon rather than percentages.	This early UI release is just one of several aspects of the Refinery feature that are being completed early as we work hard to produce a great Winter Expansion for all of you. We have already silently released the server-side code that allows the upcoming Mining Ledger to track each pilot’s mining activity, and we will be releasing more information soon about the first rounds of early SISI testing for the Refinery structures themselves.	For anyone looking for a TL;DR here’s your convenient summary:
108	english	 	 20% Bistot	20% an extremely rare new moon ore	The second moon would be considered significantly more valuable than the first. Under this system the difference between moon quality will be much more granular than it was previously, allowing organizations to choose what priorities they want to focus on when claiming moons.	Would your corporation or alliance prefer a moon that has a small quantity of an extremely valuable ore that you would cherry pick and then ignore the less valuable ores in a short play session? Or would you be looking for a moon with a wider distribution of strong ores that enables more total income per month but requires more mining time to take full advantage?	Alongside this rework of moon composition will be a complete reset of the current moon material distributions. We will be running a new randomized algorithm that will create the material compositions of moons across Lowsec and Nullsec space in this new percentage form. This reset of the distribution will happen in the same expansion patch as the introduction of Refineries.	We will be testing this new distribution on test servers over the coming months, including Singularity. We want to make it clear that the distributions that will eventually show up on SISI will not use the same random seed as what will be applied to the main Tranquility server on patch day.	This reset of moon composition distributions will allow a fresh start for the moon mining system, enable the conversion to the new percentage compositions, and will also be an excellent opportunity for smart and diligent prospectors to gain profit in the scramble for resources.
108	english	 	 35% Spodumain	25% a moderately common new moon ore
108	english	 	 While another might show:
108	english	 	 45% Scordite	40% a very common new moon ore	15% a moderately rare new moon ore
108	english	 	 COMPOSITION AND DISTRIBUTION	With this new moon harvesting technology will come a new way of looking at the composition of moons themselves and a new distribution of harvestable resources across the moons of New Eden. Currently each moon can have a presence of certain moon materials that indicates the ability to mine them with a moon harvester. It’s possible for moons to have zero, one, or many moon materials and the moon harvesting process allows the owner to choose which materials to harvest.	In the new moon mining paradigm, each moon will have a composition of a few ores, with each ore representing a percentage of the total moon composition. This composition can include both new moon ores and existing ores, and will always add up to 100%.	So, for instance, surveying one moon might show that it consists of:

109	english	 	 NEW MOON SURVEY PROBING UI	We are also deploying a set of improvements for the moon survey probing system this August. All the details of these changes can be found in this dev blog, and are another step preparing New Eden for the arrival of the new Upwell Refinery structures later this year.	We want to extend our thanks to those players who have already passed along their feedback on the moon survey probe changes. In addition to the previously announced changes, we can also announce that the August release will include a buff to the Tech Two version of the Survey Probe launcher, giving it a flat 10% bonus to the speed of moon probing.	We hope that you all enjoy the changes coming this release, and our whole team wants to reiterate our thanks to all the players who are passing along your feedback on Upwell structures through our survey, the forums, bug reports, the CSM, and many other avenues.	All the changes described in this blog are available for testing on the Singularity test server that can be found in your EVE launcher, and we highly encourage people to try them out and let us know what you think.
109	english	 	 CORPORATION INSURANCE IN UPWELL STRUCTURES	Corporation insurance is a feature that allows a corporation to insure a ship before distributing it to one of their members, which then sends the insurance payout to the corporation if the ship is destroyed.	This is a longstanding feature of the insurance system in normal stations and outposts, but we were initially unable to add it to Upwell structures due to some technical differences between corporation hangar systems in different structure types. Recent improvements we have made behind the scenes have had the additional benefit of allowing us to add corp insurance to Upwell structures in August. This is another step towards full feature parity between stations/outposts and Upwell structures and will be especially useful to large corporations.
109	english	 	 IMPROVED USABILITY FOR FUELING STRUCTURES	The job of keeping your structure fueled can be a challenging one that is made more complicated by the fact that allowing a player to fuel a structure currently requires a huge amount of trust in that individual. In the August release, we are expanding the fueling ability in a secure way by allowing anyone with the "Assume Structure Control" access control list to place (but not remove) fuel in the structure fuel bay without requiring any corporate roles.
109	english	 	 Structure Anti-Subcap Missiles	Increase the damage of the ASML-SD missile by 33%	Increase the damage of the ASML-MD and ASML-LD missiles by 20%	These changes are available for testing on our Singularity test server now and we encourage all of you to give them a try and to let us know what you think in the comments thread for this blog.
109	english	 	 Structure Guided Bombs	Reduce the rate of fire of the Structure Guided Bomb Launcher from 20 seconds to 40 seconds	Reduce the area of effect of Guided Void Bombs from 40km to 20km	Reduce the area of effect of AS and AM Guided Bombs from 40km to 30km	Reduce the neut amount per second of the Guided Void Bomb by 25%	Increase the DPS of the AS and AM Guided Bombs by 25%	Reduce the velocity of the Guided Void Bomb by 20% (increasing flight time to keep the range the same)
109	english	 	 BALANCE UPDATES FOR STRUCTURE WEAPONS	This August, we are deploying a set of iterations to structure weapons with a special focus on the Standup Guided Void Bombs. These bombs have been a major topic of discussion in the community and we agree with the majority of you that they need to be toned down. Void bombs being the most powerful part of structure defenses has the significant downside of reducing the fleet composition choices available to attackers.	Our goals for these weapon tweaks are:	Reduce the pressure to limit fleet composition choices when attacking Citadels (caused by the extremely powerful void bombs)	Make the counterplay for structure guided bombs more clear and accessible	Compensate for the nerfing of void bombs with small buffs to damage bombs and single-target anti-subcap damage so that structure defenses remain viable	The changes we are proposing here reduce the area of effect and energy neutralizer amount per second of Guided Void Bombs while also reducing their rate of fire and movement speed to make counterplay more accessible.
109	english	 	 Improved usability for fueling structures	The addition of the corporation insurance feature to Upwell structures	The phase-out of legacy starbase industry bonuses	The introduction of the new moon scanning UI in preparation for Refineries
109	english	 	 Balance updates for structure weapons	Improved UI feedback for structure deployment
109	english	 	 PREVIOUSLY ON “STRUCTURE DEV BLOGS”	Earlier this year we released a dev blog describing our three-pronged approach to continued Upwell structure development:	Bug fixes, performance improvements, UI polish to make existing Structure features more reliable and easier to use	Adding new universal features to all Upwell Structures, such as the addition of automatic capacitor/shield recharge functions and customizable public structure descriptions earlier this summer	Preparing the next batch of structures and service modules: Refinery structures with moon mining and reaction services	All three of these tracks are still advancing and all three will be represented in the August release. We want to once again thank all the players who participated in our Upwell structure survey earlier this year as we are continuing to use your community feedback to inform our priorities in structure work.	As CCP Seagull announced in one of our recent Development Update videos, we are in the process of refocusing more of our ongoing structure update resources to the topic of structure defenses and siege mechanics. This design area has been one of the major topics we’ve been hearing about from the community over the past few months, and the August release includes some of the early fruits of our increased focus in this area.	The changes coming in August include:

110	english	 	 2018-02-13 - BY CCP FALCON
110	english	 	 NEW NPC STANDINGS UI 	NPC standings are an important part of EVE. They govern which missions you can do, your ability to join faction warfare, and when you will be attacked in NPC controlled parts of space to name a few. With this in mind, we’ve been working on a way to show you when these things either become available to you or when you will lose access to them.	Without further ado, let us introduce the new NPC Standings UI:	Starting at the top, we are introducing a bar to represent your current standings with the selected NPC Faction, Corporation or Agent ranging from -10 on the left to +10 on the right. As you move in either direction you will be able to see exactly when you will gain access to or lose access to missions, epic arcs, and faction warfare. We hope this will allow you to learn and understand the standings system and the potential impact your actions can have.	On the left is a list of all the NPC Factions, Corporations, and Agents that you have encountered. For new players, this will just include their starting faction. Selecting one of these entities will populate the rest of the standings window.	On the right, is your standings history with the currently selected entity. This is already in the client but it takes about 6 clicks and 3 different windows to access. 	We are also adding some new notifications for when your NPC standings change. When you gain or lose standings with a Faction, Corporation or Agent you will receive a notification to inform you of the change. Clicking the notification will open the standings panel and highlight the standings that have changed. These can be configured in the Notification settings.	We are also changing the standings tab in the Show Info window for Factions, Corporations, and Agents. Instead of having double entries for each entity, we will now have a single line conveying the same information.	For the Agents tab in the Corporation Show Info window, we are adding a filter for the agents so you can now filter by levels I – V. We hope this will help players to find agents they can speak to.	We are also adding a new NPC standings tab in the Standings tab of the corporation window. This will show you each corporation members standing toward NPC factions including the corporations overall standing with the faction, corporation, or agent.	We have added a conversation bubble icon next to agents that shows you whether or not you are able to receive a mission or not with the agent. As it currently stands, you start a conversation with the agent only to be told that they have nothing for you. We hope players will now quickly be able to distinguish if they are able to receive a mission or not without suffering such a rude reply!

110	english	 	 BETA MAP CHANGES 	We ended up with our head in the Beta map code for some of the work we have planned for later in the year. I would like to emphasize we are not working on removing the old map at this time, the changes are focused on increasing the performance and usability of the Beta map.	We have been tweaking the usability of the Beta map, mainly focusing on camera interaction and system/constellation/region navigation.	Here are some of the changes we are making for August:	Improved Beta map performance when zooming and rotating the map, especially when down at the constellation or solar system level.	The map camera is now pitch constrained so it cannot go below the map plane.	The introduction of a breadcrumb style label that shows the selected region/constellation/system and the corresponding faction (if any). Clicking a location will zoom and pan to it.	Ctrl+clicking a solar system will now set it as destination and Ctrl+shift+click will add it as a waypoint.	Hovering over a solar system will now show how many jumps away it is.
110	english	 	  
110	english	 	 Persisting Cosmic Signature scan results	Adding the signature ID to the front of bookmarks when using the save location option in the Probe Scanner	From the August release onwards, scanning progress will be stored until you restart your client. The results will no longer be cleared when docking, jumping wormholes, or doing basically anything else that would have previously caused a session change and cleared the list.	This will only be for Cosmic Signatures. Anything located with combat scans will not persist, such as ships, citadels etc	Another quality of life improvement we have seen players ask for is the addition of signature id when saving locations from the probe scanner. This will not change any behavior of bookmarking, so you will still have to warp to a wormhole to bookmark the actual wormhole if you want to warp at 0. In this situation, you would have to manually add the signature ID.
110	english	 	 SCANNING CHANGES 	We have seen lots of players asking for some quality of life improvements in the scanning system.	In August, we will deliver two of these little gems for explorers, wormholers, and hunters:

111	english	 	 2018-02-13 - BY CCP FALCON
111	english	 	 Reactions in Refineries can be taxed by the owners of the structure, and the level of tax will be defined by them through Access Control Lists. This tax is independent of other activities being performed in the Refinery.
111	english	 	 NEW REACTIONS SYSTEM COST INDEX	Reaction jobs will contribute to their own System Cost Index when calculating the cost of installing the job. This System Cost Index will use the same formula as current industrial activities:
111	english	 	 INTRODUCING REACTION FORMULAS	When a Reaction Service Module is fitted and onlined in a Refinery, it will make the service available in the Industry window. Reactions will use Reaction Formulas, similar to other Industrial activities which use blueprints. These will act the same way as Blueprint Originals (BPOs) in that they have infinite runs but they cannot be researched or copied.	After the Winter release date, Reactions will work like other Industrial activities: X amount of resources, processed alongside a Reaction Formula, provide Y amount of product.	In this new system, Reaction jobs will need to be set up and started like other Industry jobs. Although Reaction Formulas have an infinite number of runs (like BPOs), they will need to be set for a limited amount of runs, based on the Input resources available. As with other Upwell Services, the job will be paused if the Service Module is offlined either through loss of fuel or going into an Armor Reinforced state, but the job will resume when the module is onlined again. Unfitting or destroying the Service Module will cancel all Reaction jobs that are running. 
111	english	 	 NEW REACTIONS RIGS	Alongside the new Reactions Service Modules will be Reactions Rigs, designed to affect the duration and efficiency of running Reactions in the new Refineries. These rigs are size specific (either Medium or Large) and follow the same fitting rules as other Upwell Structure rigs. They will affect Efficiency (material efficiency of reactions) or Time (duration of reaction process). Medium Rigs will improve one variable and Large Rigs will improve both variables.
111	english	 	 NEW REACTIONS SERVICE MODULES 	Three types of Service Modules for Reactions will be introduced, substituting five modules from Starbases (POSes)	Standup Composite Reactor I performs both Simple and Advanced Reactions (Tech 2)	Standup Biochemical Reactor I performs both Biochemical and Medium Biochemical Reactions (Boosters)	Standup Hybrid Reactor I performs Hybrid Reactions (Tech 3)	Service Modules require fuel to online and to run (like any other Structure Service Module)

111	english	 	 RELEASE DAY FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS	Q: What will happen to my current Reaction jobs at Downtime on Release Day?	A: They will continue to run until Downtime on Release Day, but will be stopped at this point. They will not be able to be restarted in a POS array.	Q: What will happen to my current POS array?	A: POS Reactor arrays will remain anchored in space but will be offline after the Release. Your Reactor Arrays will not be able to be onlined again. No new arrays will be able to be manufactured and no new arrays can be anchored. Any jobs to manufacture arrays that are running at the time of the release will continue to run (will not be paused or cancelled) and the arrays will be delivered to the manufacturer once the job has completed. It will not be possible to anchor or online these arrays.	**Q: _What do you plan to do with this defunct equipment in the future?**_	A: As we have done previously, a compensation plan will be put in place in the future to reimburse the investment capsuleers have put into this equipment.	That's all for now. Be sure to add your feedback to the Comments section of this devblog. Fly safe!
111	english	 	 NEW REACTIONS SKILLS 	All characters will be able to run Reactions, including those in an Alpha state, but only Omega pilots will be able to improve their operating efficiency in this area. New skills that determine their ability to run Reactions efficiently and effectively will be introduced prior to the Winter release, to allow pilots time to train them up in time. The effects of these skills are exclusive to Reaction activities. They will not affect a character's ability to perform other industrial activities such as Manufacturing or Invention, and other Industry skills will not affect their Reaction activity.	Reactions: Speeds up reaction jobs by 4% per level	Mass Reactions: Allows one additional Reaction job per character per level	Advanced Mass Reactions: Allows one additional Reaction job per character per level	Remote Reactions: Each level increases the distance at which Reaction jobs can be started. Level 1 allows for jobs at a range within 5 jumps, and each subsequent level adds 5 more jumps to the range, with a maximum of a 25-jump range

113	english	 	 Next Steps	We hope this pass, while not addressing every balance issue, sets a good tone for the kind of changes we want to make. We haven’t nailed down the next set of changes in detail, but we are looking at Tech I Battlecruisers and Battleships, Pirate and Navy faction ships, and Tech II classes like Assault Frigates and Heavy Assault Cruisers all as potential candidates. We’ll keep you up to date as we progress and hope to have consistent, incremental changes like these coming at a quick pace alongside long-term reworks and totally new ships.	We look forward to your feedback,
113	english	 	 -100 PG
113	english	 	 +88,000 Mass	Vexor	Like the Tristan, the Vexor is extremely popular due to its versatility. In the case of the Vexor we do feel that it is too easy to fit an enormous tank without sacrificing much damage due to all the free fitting room afforded by drone warfare not requiring high slot weapons. We are going to bring the power grid down to put more pressure on big tank fits.
113	english	 	 The Stabber has always gotten a pretty bad rap and that's reflected in its popularity. That said, it's a solid support killer and shows very high kill efficiency among those pilots who do use it. After considering a few options we are going to go with the Tempest treatment rather than change the slot layout. Frigate Pilots beware!	+2.5% Rate of Fire bonus per Minmatar Cruiser level (7.5% per level total)	Tristan	The Tristan is quite the little monster. It offers extreme versatility and power in many configurations. We don't think it needs massive changes though, as we are happy to see a ship where so many fitting strategies and gameplay styles are viable. A small increase to mass will slow it down slightly, giving other pilots a little more hope of catching up and pinning it down.
113	english	 	 +125 Capacitor	+39,000 Capacitor Recharge Rate (cap/s stays the same as before)	Stabber
113	english	 	 +15 CPU
113	english	 	 +75 PG
113	english	 	 The Omen seems to come up a bit short on fitting and capacitor in many situations, even though the ship has a lot of potential. We're going to bump the fitting room up and give it a larger capacitor pool to give cap boosterless fits more time space to work with.
113	english	 	 +20k Lock Range	Omen
113	english	 	 +40 CPU
113	english	 	 +75 PG
113	english	 	 The Bellicose is is much the same position as the Arbitrator, as the sole representative for secondary weapons systems in the Minmatar tech one cruiser lineup. It will also receive more fitting room so that it becomes better suited to an all around combat role, as well as increased lock range to be able to put its ewar bonuses to better use.
113	english	 	 +20k Lock Range	Bellicose
113	english	 	 +1 Launcher Slot
113	english	 	 +45 CPU
113	english	 	 +120 PG
113	english	 	 The Arbitrator is in the strange position of being sole the representative for secondary weapons systems in the Amarr tech one cruiser lineup, while also being in the ewar category. We are going to give the Arbitrator fitting room so it can be used more easily as generalist combat ships alongside its ewar support role. We are also going to bump lock range so they it a more realistic shot at putting those ewar bonuses to use. The Arbitrator is going to pick up an extra launcher slot as well to make missile focused fits stronger.
113	english	 	 +50 shield HP	Arbitrator
113	english	 	 Not to be rude, but the Corax is a bit on the heavy side. We're going to lower its mass significantly and it is still going to be 50,000 kg heavier than the second heaviest destroyer. The added speed and agility should make the Corax feel much better to fly. We're also going to turn that burn into beef where it counts by giving the Corax some more shield HP.	-150,000 Mass

114	english	 	 APIS, EXPORTS AND YOU	The information in both the Personal Mining Ledger and the Corporate Mining Ledger is being presented in this simple format as we know that each individual and individual group will have their own needs and ways of using this information. Group size, organizational structure and internal tax policies are just a few aspects that affect how this information can be used. Rather than restrict this use through formatting, we are presenting this to you as openly as possible in order to give you the chance to make the most of your mining. 	The information in the Personal and Corporate Mining Ledgers can be exported to your Clipboard or reached through the API endpoints due to be published shortly. We are looking forward to the tools that our very talented 3rd Party Developer community creates in this regard. More about some of their already released projects, can be found here.	The specifications for these API end points have been released and details on their scopes can be found here.	That's it for this installment. Thank you and fly safe.	o7
114	english	 	 CORPORATE MINING LEDGER	Keeping the books straight and your members in line is the eternal work of all BPM gurus. The Corporate Mining Ledger grants information on who exactly has been mining your moon ore, both friend and foe.	The Corporate Mining Ledger is tied to mining activity around Refineries. Once a Refinery has extracted a moon chunk from its nearby moon and exploded this chunk into a field of moon material asteroids, capsuleers can mine these asteroids through normal mining activity. Who mines these asteroids, what corporation they belong to and how much they mine, is tracked in the Corporate Mining Ledger. This information is available to capsuleers with the Accountant, Director or CEO role in the corporation that owns the structure when the asteroid is mined. 	It is worth noting that this information is not available in real-time and corporations must be vigilant in their guarding against those who may wish to steal their precious ores. 
114	english	 	 PERSONAL MINING LEDGER	We know that a vast majority of you love graphs, and so we've made sure your personal mining activity is represented in ways you like best: lines and bars - with filters to boot! 	The Personal Mining Ledger tracks all of the mining activity done by a character, anywhere in New Eden. It allows pilots to see the types of ores, gas and ice they’ve collected, the areas of space they frequent, and of course their activity over time. As a pilot mines, the mining information is collected and batched into days in order to create a personal mining history.	We have been gathering the mining data of each individual pilot in New Eden since the June release to allow miners a glimpse into their activity history when the ledger is released.	The ledger can be accessed through the Business section of the Neocom and is available to all pilots in all areas of space. Just like other tools, the Ledger can be dragged from this section to your Neocom, so that it is always readily available. For more details about customizing your Neocom, check out this great Eve University page about all the functionalities available.	To try out the Personal Ledger before the Lifeblood Expansion on October 24th, login to the Singularity test server to try it for yourself.
114	english	 	 SPREADSHEETS IN SPACE	When we first began discussing plans for the new Refineries structures and the changes to Moon Mining with the Council of Stellar Management, the rationale of increasing the amount of information available to both individuals and corporations gained more weight and importance. There was a clear call from the CSM for corporations and alliances to be able to track who is mining the materials cleaved from moons by refinery structures, and the developers saw a strong need for all pilots to be able to track their own individual mining activity. Out of these discussions the Personal and Corporate Mining Ledgers were born.

115	english	 	 STANDUP MOON DRILL I	The Standup Moon Drill I Service Module is installed as a regular service module in a structure, taking a Service Module slot, but it is exclusive to Refineries that have been deployed in a valid Moon Mining location. Once they have been fitted, they grant access to the Scheduler (described below) from which Moon Mining extractions can be controlled. Fitting this module requires the same access as any other structure fittings, and like other service modules, it requires fuel to Online and to run.
115	english	 	 REPROCESSING RIGS AND THEIR BLUEPRINTS	With the release of Refinery Structures that are bonused to reprocessing, we are planning some changes to the existing reprocessing rigs that were released with Citadels in the Citadel Expansion. As Refineries are only available in the Medium and Large size, unlike Citadels and Engineering Complexes which also have an Extra Large version, we have had to make some changes to the value of the XL rigs. The following changes will then be made on the day of release:	All reprocessing rigs are receiving upgrades to the breadth of ores that receive their bonuses. Existing M reprocessing rigs will be consolidated into one variant that applies to all standard ores and one variant that applies to all ice. A new variant that applies to moongoo ore will also be added, reducing the total number of M reprocessing rigs from 4 to 3. Existing L reprocessing rigs will be consolidated into a single rig type that applies to all forms of ore and ice	Since L reprocessing rigs will now provide exactly the same benefits as XL reprocessing rigs we are reducing the cost of XL reprocessing rigs to the same level as L rigs	The strength of the reprocessing bonuses provided by all reprocessing rigs will be reduced slightly (a 1% absolute reduction in the base highsec yield for both T1 and T2 rigs)	All reprocessing rigs (M, L and XL) will be unfitted from their current locations and placed in the Corp Deliveries hangar of the structure in which they are located. The owners of the structure will then be able to decide if they wish to keep them in their current location or move them to a new Refinery once it has been built	All XL reprocessing rig items (and their corresponding blueprints) will be duplicated to compensate for the change in build requirements and value. All duplicate blueprints will hold the same levels of research as the ones currently owned. Extra rigs and blueprints owned by characters will be placed in the owner's personal Item Hangar in their home station. Extra rigs and blueprints owned by a corporation will be placed in the Corp Deliveries hangar in the corp HQ station

115	english	 	 With the release of the Upwell Refineries, Reactions (of all types) and Moon Mining will become exclusive to these new structures and they will no longer be performed in Player-Owned Starbases (POSes). Details about the changes to Reactions and the Service Modules that will perform these functions can be found in this devblog.	Moon Mining will be exclusive to Refineries when they are deployed in the Moon Mining Location around a viable moon. Full details about this process were listed in this devblog, but to summarize, here are the key points:	Refineries can be deployed in all regions of New Eden, including High Sec and Wormhole space. All Upwell Structures are built and deployed in the same way, with the same deployment location restrictions (not allowed in certain newbie or trade hub systems, must be placed at least 1000 km from other Upwell structures). However, the Moon Mining Drill Service Module cannot be fitted in a Refinery that is not in a valid Moon Mining location.	Every viable moon (every moon in Low Sec and Null Sec space with a few exceptions for the very large moons) now has a specific Moon Mining location. These locations are a new warpable option in the right-click and radial menus for moons: "Warp to moon mining location"	Only one Refinery can be deployed within 250km of the Moon Mining Location and extract moon ores from that moon 	When deploying a Refinery, the UI will inform you if you are in a valid location, if you are in a valid location but cannot moon mine, or if you are in an invalid location:	When the designs for Refineries were first being fleshed out, we knew that tying a single structure to a single moon would amplify some of the combat issues that face other Upwell Structures. With valuable input from the CSM and the feedback they have sourced from the Community, we will be using the introduction of these structures to make a change to the vulnerability of ALL Upwell Structures:	When an Upwell Structure is first deployed, it will enter an initial 15-minute vulnerable state (with the same repair timer mechanics and damage caps) before entering the 24 hour Anchoring state. 	Once anchored, the vulnerability of the structure will match the Vulnerability windows set by its owners.	This will mean that keeping control of the area in which you are planning to deploy your structure is paramount.	Further changes to the Vulnerability and Combat systems of all Upwell Structures are now underway and some early details about these upcoming changes can be found in the EVE Vegas Keynote.	As with all Upwell Structures, the new Refineries will be able to fit all the standard Standup Service Modules, allowing their occupants access to services ranging from Clone Bays to Manufacturing and the other basic services this line includes. 
115	english	 	 The Extraction Scheduling window allows:	Setting a Ready date by manually entering a desired time and date, or through manipulating the slider	Determining when an extraction will be ready in conjunction with when the Structure will be vulnerable	Estimating the volume of ore that the moon chunk will hold, for better organization of your mining fleet needs	Ability to add the Extraction event to your Corporation Calendar, to inform your members when to assemble for the harvest	Once a Moon Extraction has been set, the Moon Drill will fire at the moon and begin to draw a chunk of the moon towards the Refinery. This process will take several days, and during this time the chunk cannot be disrupted, except by those with the Station Manager role (who are able to stop the drilling process), or if the Moon Drill Module is offlined or the structure is destroyed. If this happens whilst an extraction is in progress, the chunk will be destroyed and a new extraction will have to be started from the beginning.	Ratios/types/volumes reflect not the final stats in-game	Once the extraction time has passed and the chunk of moon has been pulled into position next to the refinery, the next stage of the process can begin.	Once a chunk is ready, the structure controllers will fire the Moon Drill laser at the chunk to explode it into an asteroid field of mine-able asteroids comprising the moon ores. Miners in the vicinity can then mine these asteroids as normal to receive the riches within them. All asteroids mined from this field will be logged in the Corporation Mining Ledger of the Refinery owning corporation and details about the ledger can be found here.	Please note that if no one detonates the moon chunk once it is ready, it will automatically explode into a field after 3 hours (or longer if the appropriate rig is fitted). This could happen if no one fires the laser, or the Moon Drill runs out of fuel after the extraction has finished, or if the structure has been reinforced.	Once a chunk has been shattered into asteroids, the Moon Drill can be used to start another extraction. A new extraction can be started before all of the asteroids have been mined out. The moon ore asteroids are also not perpetual and will decay approximately two days after the chunk is fractured. Miners are free to mine the choicest of rocks, leaving those less suitable to their needs to the ravages of the harsh vacuum of space. This decay lifetime can be extended up to four days with rigs, but asteroids will always expire before the next chunk can be fractured.
115	english	 	 SCHEDULING YOUR EXTRACTIONS	All pilots who have access to Take Control of a Structure will be able to Schedule and initiate a Moon Mining Extraction. However, only those pilots with the Station Manager role will be able to cancel an ongoing extraction.	Through the Scheduler, Structure Controllers will be able to determine how long they wish an extraction to take and to find a time that suits them and their miner buddies to gather for the harvest. The amount of time chosen will determine the size of the moon chunk being extracted on a linear scale. Extractions can be set at any period between 6 days and 56 days to complete.	Ratios/types/volumes reflect not the final stats in-game

115	english	 	 STANDUP MOON DRILL I	The Standup Moon Drill I Service Module is installed as a regular service module in a structure, taking a Service Module slot, but it is exclusive to Refineries that have been deployed in a valid Moon Mining location. Once they have been fitted, they grant access to the Scheduler (described below) from which Moon Mining extractions can be controlled. Fitting this module requires the same access as any other structure fittings, and like other service modules, it requires fuel to Online and to run.
115	english	 	 REPROCESSING RIGS AND THEIR BLUEPRINTS	With the release of Refinery Structures that are bonused to reprocessing, we are planning some changes to the existing reprocessing rigs that were released with Citadels in the Citadel Expansion. As Refineries are only available in the Medium and Large size, unlike Citadels and Engineering Complexes which also have an Extra Large version, we have had to make some changes to the value of the XL rigs. The following changes will then be made on the day of release:	All reprocessing rigs are receiving upgrades to the breadth of ores that receive their bonuses. Existing M reprocessing rigs will be consolidated into one variant that applies to all standard ores and one variant that applies to all ice. A new variant that applies to moongoo ore will also be added, reducing the total number of M reprocessing rigs from 4 to 3. Existing L reprocessing rigs will be consolidated into a single rig type that applies to all forms of ore and ice	Since L reprocessing rigs will now provide exactly the same benefits as XL reprocessing rigs we are reducing the cost of XL reprocessing rigs to the same level as L rigs	The strength of the reprocessing bonuses provided by all reprocessing rigs will be reduced slightly (a 1% absolute reduction in the base highsec yield for both T1 and T2 rigs)	All reprocessing rigs (M, L and XL) will be unfitted from their current locations and placed in the Corp Deliveries hangar of the structure in which they are located. The owners of the structure will then be able to decide if they wish to keep them in their current location or move them to a new Refinery once it has been built	All XL reprocessing rig items (and their corresponding blueprints) will be duplicated to compensate for the change in build requirements and value. All duplicate blueprints will hold the same levels of research as the ones currently owned. Extra rigs and blueprints owned by characters will be placed in the owner's personal Item Hangar in their home station. Extra rigs and blueprints owned by a corporation will be placed in the Corp Deliveries hangar in the corp HQ station

116	english	 	 INTERACTING WITH THE AGENCY	Once you have filtered down to the content you want, how do you go about finding out more information?	Each piece of content is going to have a basic card that will appear as a list on the left of the window.	Clicking on the basic card will open an expanded card offering more details about the content.	With these expanded cards we are going to try and expose all the relevant information that will be required for participation in the content and the possible rewards that can be received. The expanded card should be clearly explaining what the content is, how to participate if you cannot already (ship restrictions), what progression mechanics it ties into (standings), and how to get to it based on your current location (Set Destination, Warp to).	Some examples of extra information that will be included:	We will show you the potential asteroids that can appear Asteroid Belts, Ore Sites, and Ice Belts.	The hostiles that may appear in the sites. We are also looking at including NPC damage types in future iterations of The Agency so that should free up some space in all your bios.	If any content requires special modules to participate, we would like to let you know this in advance	This is just the first iteration of The (new) Agency, so we look forward to hearing your feedback on what other filters, content or information you would like to see included.	The Agency will be released with the Lifeblood expansion on October 24th.
116	english	 	 At this point, the Agency will provide a shortlist of the most suitable content based on the user selected filters, location, standings, skillpoints and other relevant parameters. The details of how we come up with the shortlist would probably require a blog of its own, but the mantra is that we always give you the best, nearest content you can actually participate in right now, while avoiding redundant choice.

116	english	 	 FILTERING THE AGENCY	You can imagine with 15 years of EVE content, it all amounts to A LOT of cards for players to sift through! We want you to find content that's both accessible and interesting to you, but with all this possible content and information available, how will you be able to find the content you want and make sense of The Agency?	We will be providing some filters so you can discover the content you want to run and where you want to run it. The goal here is to give enough control over your search without burdening you with too much clicking.	On release we will have two top level, user configurable filters to narrow down to the content you want. The first filter is "Range", which lets you to select your current system, 2 jumps, 5 jumps, 10 jumps or any distance to indicate the maximum distance you're willing to travel.	The second filter is “Content Type”, which breaks down in the following way:	Suggested - This will be a mix of all the available content to you	Combat - This will be a mix of all available combat content, such as Security Agents and combat sites	Mining - A mix of all available mining content, such as Mining Agents and Asteroid Belts	Specify - One specific type of content. In some cases, this comes with content type specific filtering, such as, faction, corp, level and type for agents, to give players more precise control:	Agents	Sites

116	english	 	 I am sure some of you are reading this list thinking that we are killing exploration by including Anomalies and Signatures. Worry not, these items will only appear for the system that you are currently in and you will still have to scan down signatures to know exactly what they are. Once you have scanned them they will appear in your list of available cards.	We have our sights set on adding the following systems to the Agency in the future:	Incursions	Landmarks	Factional Warfare

117	english	 	 Thanks for reading,
117	english	 	 SUPPORTING CHANGES	We are making one other very important change to the way Alpha Clones work in this release to support the expanded skill set: Free Alpha Skill Training will stop when a character reaches 5 million total skill points.	Training after 5 million skill points works normally, that is, you can train skills with Omega time or Skill Injectors. Any skills you’ve previously trained which fall under the Alpha set can be used at any time, regardless of Clone State. It looks like this:	As we looked at adding more skills to the Alpha set we realized that bringing along free passive training up to the new Alpha cap, like we did the first time around, would cause problems. The more free training we give away the less valuable skill points become, which is not good for existing players, scary for CCP, and inevitably harmful to game balance and the game economy.	By stopping training below the current skill extraction limit, skill points keep their value and new players can invest in them at their own pace without being required to subscribe every month to use the skills they’ve already trained.	And that’s it for today! Look below for the complete list of new skills and please let us know if you think it’s missing something or if there’s something that doesn’t belong!
117	english	 	 All Factions	Being restricted to one faction had some important goals at release, but it also had some big drawbacks and we’re going to let it go. Alphas will now be able to train Ship Command skills from all four factions and will also be able to train all weapon systems. Not only does this open up cross training, a key component of EVE progression, it also opens up pirate faction ships which are some of the most powerful ships in the Tech I arsenal.
117	english	 	 The most obvious restriction that Alphas face is ship size. Even though EVE is unique in its design to allow even a frigate pilot to make a difference in any battle, the reality is that big ships offer capabilities and experiences that can be hard to get in Frigates and Cruisers. With Battlecruisers and Tech II Medium weapons available, Alphas should be able to make a big difference in any part of the game.	Battleships	Yes, Battleships! Battleships are some of EVE’s most iconic ships and the most common aspiration for new players. We see them as an essential part of a deep EVE experience and so we want everyone to be train to fly them. We’ve also heard loud and clear from the CSM and from the discussions surrounding the announcement at EVE Vegas that Battleships are widely considered powerful and this might be scary territory for existing players. That’s why we’re holding back on Tech II Large weapons for now, and it’s also why we will watch behavior post release very carefully. If we see negative effects, we will make changes. We hope that isn’t necessary though and we believe that granting access to Battleships for Alphas will be exciting for everyone in New Eden.
117	english	 	 Expanded Alpha Set	That’s where the new skill list comes in. By expanding the amount of skills available to Alphas, the free experience will be much deeper and more powerful. We hope that with a stronger free experience, we see more players staying around to play as Alphas even if they can’t subscribe right away. This makes EVE even stronger for all pilots, for as we know players are the content in New Eden.	Let’s go over some of the highlights from the new Alpha skill set and talk about why we chose this list, then you can find the complete list at the bottom of the blog.	Tech II Small and Medium Weapons	Comparing Alpha ships to their Omega counterparts can look pretty brutal right now due to the lack of Tech II weapons. By adding them to the Alpha set, not only will DPS potential be much closer between Alphas and Omegas, Alphas will also pick up the extremely important utility granted by certain Tech II ammo variations.	Battlecruisers
117	english	 	 THE COULD BE BETTER	We have these great signs that Alpha access to EVE is something the world wants, but, on the other hand, we also see evidence that the current Alpha experience is too restricted to hold players long term. Being an Alpha is often described more like an infinite trial period than a true free experience, and our data seems to back that up. New players decide if the game is right for them very quickly, then either leave or subscribe rather than playing as an Alpha long term. Of course, more Omegas is fantastic but we think many of the players who leave might be willing to stay around if subscription didn’t feel like a requirement.
117	english	 	 THE GOOD	All in all, our results have been very positive. Introducing Alpha clones increased day-to-day activity in EVE, increased new player numbers, and encouraged many former players to come back. Clone States improved the discussion around joining EVE for the first time, both in the media and in our community, where Clone States is supported and advertised as a great option for trying EVE for free at your own pace. And, importantly, EVE’s economy and gameplay ecosystem are intact and healthy despite some concerns before launch about potential abuse by free accounts (with Ghost Training as a speed bump:/ ).

118	english	 	 THE JOURNAL	The Journal is a bit of a different beast, and has served as an outlet for a lot of in game content over the years.  We wanted to make sure that we kept our efforts focused while overhauling it, so we hooked up some metric tracking to the Journal window.	As it currently stands on TQ we have the following tabs in the journal and the % of how often they are opened compared to all windows in EVE:
118	english	 	 In addition to all these changes, we are removing the Agent Finder as it is currently known.	With the introduction of The Agency, we effectively introduced a new Agent Finder and we felt this was an opportunity to encourage people to use The Agency, while simplifying the process of finding an Agent to work with.	If you filter the Agency to "Specify" for "Agents" you will basically get all the filters that were in the Agent Finder.
118	english	 	 We would like to know what you use the Loyalty Point Log for, so please provide us some feedback in the comments thread for this devblog. For Example: Do you only use this to see your current pool of LP?	Agent Finder
118	english	 	 The Epic Journal will be removed completely and will be handled entirely by the Agency. See The Agency updates above for more information and pictures.	Incursions:	We are also moving almost all the Incursion tab to the Agency, however we have not found a good home for the loyalty point log, so with the January release we will keep this in the Journal and everything else will move to The Agency.
118	english	 	 Clicking any of the Contracts window front page messages like "You have x contracts that require attention" or "Your corp has y contracts in progress" will now take you to the "My Contracts" tab within the "Contracts" window.	We are also reorganizing the order of the buttons in this window to make more sense. Contract Type will now be the first dropdown box in the "My Contracts" tab.	Planetary Launches:	The "Planetary Launches" tab will be moved to become a new tab in the "Planetary Colonies" window. Functionally this tab and window will remain the same and PI interaction will now be accessed in one location.	Epic Journal:
118	english	 	 This tab is going to be removed and the contracts window should be able to handle everything this tab does.	For this to work we are adding a "Requires Attention" filter to the "Status" dropdown in the "My Contracts" tab of the "Contracts" window.
118	english	 	 This tab will remain untouched in the January release. We feel the amount of people currently using it means we should leave this as it is for the time being.	Expeditions:	These will be moving over to the Agency where you will be able to track your expeditions. To see your current Expeditions just open the Agency and select either the Suggested tab or filter for combat sites and remember to adjust the distance.	Contracts:
118	english	 	 Incursions – 0.5%	None of the numbers were too surprising. Some of the only access or information about these features is in the Journal or through external 3rd party information.	So, with these numbers in mind we started looking at what we could do to better represent this information or make it more discoverable.	Let’s run through the above tabs and break down what we will be doing for January	Agents:
118	english	 	 Epic Journal – 0.25 %
118	english	 	 Planetary Launches – 0.26%

119	english	 	 OTHER UPWELL 2.0 CHANGES	Beyond the four main pillars, there are also many other miscellaneous improvements for Upwell structures coming in the Upwell 2.0 release. These changes cover a wide variety of topics any most of them were sourced from community requests and suggestions:	To provide more time for final battles (especially in high load situations), the final hull repair timer for Upwell Structures has been doubled from 15 minutes to 30 minutes.	The damage messages received when attacking structures will now properly display the amount of damage your weapons are inflicting even if that damage is being deflected by the structure damage cap. Instead of listing your attack as “0 damage”, you will see the potential damage with a note of how much of that damage was deflected.	To improve the balance around using carriers from within tether range of structures, launching fighters is now considered an aggressive action for the tethering system. This means that any carrier or supercarrier with fighters under its control will automatically break tether and remain untethered until it either recalls or abandons the fighters (or those fighters are destroyed in combat)	Asset safety is a major part of Upwell structures, but we have heard from many players that it provides a bit too much absolute safety in some circumstances. We are making a few tweaks to the asset safety costs to help address these concerns:	The formula for calculating asset safety values will now provide a more accurate estimate of the item value, and will be much less likely to value an item at 0isk	A new minimum asset safety recovery cost has been set at 0.5% of item value. This cost will be required to recover items from asset safety even if the recovery takes place in the same solar system	We are currently investigating adding asset safety costs to the killmails for structures so that attackers would be able to clearly see how much damage they inflicted. This will not be ready in time for Upwell 2.0 and we cannot guarantee it at this time, but we are hopeful that it will be possible in the future.	Another issue that the CSM raised at our recent summit meeting was the removal of structure rigs before destruction to deny satisfaction to the attackers. To solve this issue, destruction of fitted rigs will no longer be possible while a structure is damaged. Rigs will essentially follow the same rules as modules.	A new icon has been added to structure brackets in the overview and space scene to indicate whether you currently have permission to dock in that structure. This indication will make it much easier to determine which of the structures on a grid are open to you. It is however important to remember that even if one of your characters has permission to dock in a structure, that doesn’t mean that your other characters necessarily have the same permissions.	NPC corps may now be added to access lists in the same way that player corps can be added. This will allow ACL admins to add specific NPC corps such as rookie corps and FW militia corps to their permission lists as needed.	Unanchoring structures will now display the progress of their unanchoring timer in the structure browser to characters with the Station Manager role	When unfitting a clone bay service module, a new popup message will inform you about how many jump clones would be destroyed by that action and check to see if you’re sure	It is now possible to self destruct pods inside a citadel with a cloning bay service module, just like you can in a station.	There are also some other changes we have in progress that will not be ready for the February path but that will be coming soon after:	Locking of blueprints is coming soon to Upwell structures! Locked blueprints will remain locked if they enter asset safety and will need to be unlocked by vote before being recovered from the asset safety system. This is a major step towards full feature parity between station and Upwell structures and we hope that it will be very helpful for industrialists	We are working on increasing the set of characters allowed in the names of Upwell structures to include commonly used characters such as $, %, and ~	Most of these changes and new features will be showing up on the test server in the near future for the community to try out and see what you think. We will be creating specific feedback threads with numbers for many of the balance changes such as the new modules and fighters, so keep an eye out on the official forums for those to appear in the coming days. We highly encourage all interested players to hop onto the Singularity public testing server and try these changes out for themselves.	One important task to complete before the February 13th patch day is to pre-set the reinforcement hour and day for your active structures. This can be done through the structure browser in the same place where current vulnerability schedules can be changed. We will be releasing new reports as reminders between now and the Upwell 2.0 patch to ensure that everyone has a chance to prepare.	Once again, we want to give a huge thanks to everyone who has been passing along feedback on the existing structure system and on these new proposed changes. We will be reserving space in the comments thread for a FAQ and some example scenarios and we encourage you all to ask questions and let us know what you think there.	Thanks for joining us for this dev blog today and fly safe!
119	english	 	 The structure combat overhaul will also include a major rework to structure combat modules. The fitting gameplay options and choices available to structure owners has been lacking compared to ship fitting gameplay and we intend to start closing the gap with the Upwell 2.0 release.	The largest change to modules in this release will be the addition of new T2 Standup modules. These will provide upgraded functionality to all the major combat modules for Upwell structures and introduce numerous new fitting options. Entirely new module categories will also be brought to Upwell structures, including capacitor power relays, capacitor batteries, armor reinforcers.	To go along with these new fitting options, we will also be adjusting the balance around structure fitting stats and module stats to bring more interesting gameplay to structure fitting. Expect CPU and Powergrid decisions to matter much more after this release, especially if you wish to take advantage of the new T2 modules. The fitting requirements of service modules have been reduced significantly, and structure Powergrid and CPU pools have been reduced to compensate.	Structure weapons are also receiving a balance pass, with anti-capital damage generally reducing and anti-subcapital damage generally increasing. The Standup Heavy Guided Bombs (formerly known as Standup AM Guided Bombs) will also be receiving a significant increase to their explosion radius to better differentiate them from the Standup Light Guided Bombs (formerly known as Standup AS Guided Bombs). All of the Standup missiles and launchers are also being renamed to more clearly show their roles and remove their over-reliance on acronym gobbledygook.	Structure tackle modules will also be receiving major updates with this release. These powerful modules can often become oppressive with their ability to keep single targets tackled and webbed indefinitely. It is especially important for us to address these modules now since the addition of 24/7 shield vulnerability means structures will be able to activate their tackle modules at all times. To solve these issues, we plan to add a reactivation delay to the Standup Focused Warp Disruptor (formerly known as the Standup Warp Scrambler) and Standup Stasis Webifier modules that prevents them from being cycled constantly without breaks. The current plan is for them to activate for 30 seconds, and then need to wait one minute before activating again. The Standup Focused Warp Disruptor will also be changed to become scriptable, with a longer-range disruptor mode and a shorter-range scrambler mode accessible through a script. Combined with these changes they would also be limited to a maximum of one copy each fitted to a structure. The intent would be for these modules to be used strategically to grab tackle long enough for an allied ship to get their own point, or in conjunction with the new AoE webs and bubbles.	After some productive discussions with the CSM at our recent summit meeting, we will also be increasing the locking range of Upwell structures significantly to better enable them to engage with targets at extreme ranges. Base lock range of Upwell Structures is planned to increase to 350k, 380km, and 400km for medium, large and XL structures respectively. Additionally all Upwell Structure will gain the ability to increase target range further to a cap of 490km through the existing targeting speed rigs and modules which will be expanded to also provide targeting range bonuses in addition to their current benefits.
119	english	 	 Another major component of this combat rework is a re-imagining of structure fighters. Currently Upwell structures may launch the same types of fighters used by carriers and supercarriers, but these fighters do not receive any benefits from skills or ship bonuses. As a part of this release, Upwell will be releasing dedicated Standup variants of every fighter used by capsuleers. These new fighters will be much more powerful than their standard variants, and will only be able to be launched by Upwell structures. Building these new Standup fighters will require a standard fighter plus some additional input equal to approximately 25% more material value. The blueprints for these Standup fighters will be available seeded on the market from any Upwell Consortium member station (the same locations where other Upwell BPOs are seeded). Not willing to be outdone, Sansha’s Nation WISHES TO EXPAND ITS BORDERS has released its own structure-capable upgrade package for the Shadow heavy fighter that can be purchased in BPC form from Sansha’s Nation loyalty point stores. On patch day existing fighters will need to be upgraded to Standup variants in order to be launched from Upwell structures.	Since fighters will now be playing a larger part in structure gameplay Upwell has also upgraded the fighter interfacing software for all of their structures. Staring with the Upwell 2.0 release, whenever a capsuleer leaves the gunner position of a structure (or two capsuleers swap) any fighters launched from that structure will not be abandoned. They will remain connected, disengage from combat, and automatically start flying back to the structure for recovery. New gunners will then be able to issue them commands immediately if desired.	These new Standup fighters will continue to not require any capsuleer skills to operate, and therefore will not benefit from those skills. However, their powerful base stats more than make up for the lack of skill bonuses. They enjoy massive bonuses to dps, hitpoints, speed, and sensor strength that make them powerful forces on the battlefield. Fighters provide an element of positional and movement gameplay that is otherwise unavailable to structure gunners, which is why we are especially excited to upgrade structure fighters into a state where they will become a major part of these battles.	**Structure Module Rebalance**
119	english	 	 One significant component of this combat overhaul is the addition of new burst projector superweapons to Upwell structures. These powerful disruptive weapons are currently primarily available on supercarriers and allow the operator to place area of effect disruption bursts anywhere in the battlefield remotely. The disruption bursts are visible before they take effect, allowing opposing pilots to see them coming and evade their impact range. The initial pass of structure burst projectors includes AoE target painter, weapon disruptor, energy neutralization, ecm jammer, sensor dampening, stasis webification, and warp disruption bubble effects.	The addition of the new Standup Energy Neutralization Burst Projector will replace the functions of the Standup Void Guided Bomb, which has been causing balance issues. The Neutralization Burst Projector requires more skill and forethought to use and has significantly more counterplan available, making it a better choice overall for the EVE combat environment. When the Upwell Structures 2.0 release deploys on February 13th all existing Standup Void Guided bombs and their blueprints will be converted automatically to Standup Light Guided bombs and their blueprints.	These new Standup Burst Projector modules are able to be used on all Medium, Large, and XL structures. The Large and XL versions of Upwell Structures are especially well suited to use these modules as they will receive a role bonus to the rate of fire of Burst Projectors and Guided Bomb Launchers.	**Standup Fighters**
119	english	 	 PILLAR #3: STRUCTURE COMBAT OVERHAUL	The third major pillar of this Upwell structure revamp is the largest set of structure combat balance changes since the introduction of Citadels. Combat alongside, against, and near Upwell structures is an important part of the EVE metagame and it needs continued iteration to ensure that the experience is the best it can be.	The key goals of these changes are to make structure combat more interesting and enjoyable for structure gunners, structure defenders, and structure attackers. This means focusing on mechanics that provide players with choices and opportunities to display their skill, and that have effective counterplay available.	**Superweapons**
119	english	 	 5.5 days for Highsec space	This means that the final battle for a structure will always take place on the day of the week chosen by the defender, within a four hour window centered on their selected reinforcement hour.	Just as in the previous system, all a structure’s service modules will go offline while the structure is in this final reinforcement period.	When a structure finishes its final reinforcement period its hull hitpoints become vulnerable to attack. At this point the structure may be destroyed once and for all with a successful attack and final battle.	Under this new system a random unscouted attack against a full power Upwell structure could lead to a set of reinforcement timers with a maximum combined duration of 14 days in highsec, 11 days in nullsec and lowsec, and 9 days in W-space. However, a prepared attacker that hacks the structure for its reinforcement information ahead of time can ensure that those durations drop to 7 days in highsec, 4 days in lowsec and nullsec and 2 days in W-space. This highlights the importance of hacking potential target structures to obtain the best possible information for your planning.	This new system also enables clever attackers to ensure that the first reinforcement period for a full power structures will exit during a weekend to generate potential fights by launching initial attacks against structures on Thursday evening, Friday, or Saturday in preparation for the next day’s reinforcement hour.	The following chart shows the complete state flow available to Upwell structures in this new system:	Chart has been updated from original blog version (click to enlarge

120	english	 	 Once again, the contributions of EVE Online pilots to this groundbreaking project cannot be understated. Thank you to MMOS and the University of Geneva for allowing our pilots the opportunity to bring their expertise in navigating the galaxy into the world of real science.	MMOS recently published a blog about the results so far, which you can check out here.	This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement Nr 732703.
120	english	 	 Since the release of the new Project Discovery, we have made several changes. Firstly, we have removed all samples where the signal-to-noise ratio is too low, since they aren’t fair and don’t significantly contribute to the scientific effort.	We noted a large number of players having trouble with marking the transits accurately for high frequency transits. This is caused by the fact that a small error in period adds up cumulatively for each marker, causing them to eventually fall outside the allowed margin of error. We attributed this to problems with reading whether the transits are perfectly aligned in the folded mode.	To combat this issue, we added a magnifying glass on the minimap. This allows players who often encounter this issue to check whether each individual marker falls within a transit by looking at a zoomed in version of the full unfolded graph at any time during the folding process.	We have also, at the suggestion of our players, added a feature that allows players to examine multiples of the selected period, which is especially useful for the situation when multiple transits become visible during the folding phase aside from the one being folded.	When building this project, we became aware that the solutions for eclipsing binaries were flawed due to the inclusion of only the primary eclipse and not the secondary one. As such, we removed them from the dataset until their solutions could be adjusted. However, after releasing the feature we became aware of a separate type of binary that had the same problem, causing players to encounter samples where half the transits were correctly part of the solution and half of them were not. These samples have been removed from the data set.	Final Remark:
120	english	 	 Tweaking Tools and the Dataset
120	english	 	 So why don’t we use them?	Project Discovery is aimed at compensating for weaknesses inherent in those algorithms, namely their reliance on perfectly periodic data and their ineffectiveness at dealing with noise.	While expecting perfectly periodic data sounds like a fair assumption when dealing with the orbits of planets, systems that include multiple planets in close proximity don't exhibit perfectly periodic orbits, since their gravitational pull affects the orbit of other planets in the same system in a phenomenon known as Transit Timing Variation (TTV).	TTV can create small variances in the period of the transiting planet which severely inhibits the frequency analysis-based algorithms used to automatically search through this data. However, the wobbles are generally small enough that they can still be selected with our marker tool without going outside the allowed margin of error. A visual example of this is shown in this video.	Aside from TTV, there are also two other types of transits where Project Discovery is expected to outperform algorithmic analysis.	Firstly, we have transits in systems with strong stellar activity, where the algorithms can’t get a clean fold, even if the transit can be seen clearly with the naked eye.	Secondly, there are circumbinary planets, which are planets orbiting binary stars. Frequency analysis-based algorithms have trouble with these because the relative position of the stars and the planet can be different each time the planet transits.
120	english	 	 As some of you know and have pointed out, there are many powerful methods for frequency analysis that already exist such as Fourier Transforms, Least-Squares Spectral Analysis and Box-Fitting Least Squares Algorithms.
120	english	 	 At launch, we employed a "training period" system from the previous Project Discovery, where players would be presented with increasingly difficult tasks until they had solved at least one at each difficulty level.	This was used successfully with the Human Protein Atlas without any issues. However, after launching Exoplanets on Tranquility we quickly encountered an issue where players were getting stuck in this training period because they couldn't solve the higher difficulty tasks. This would cause them to get stuck in a loop where they would only be served the higher difficulty tasks we had to offer as they had completed all lower difficulties, and they wouldn’t be able to move onto analyzing unsolved samples.	This resulted in an extremely frustrating experience, with most players having to try and guess their way out of the training period with extremely low accuracy scores.	After investigating the situation, we determined that this was primarily caused by the fact that the most difficult tasks in the Exoplanets project were much more difficult than the most challenging Human Protein Atlas tasks.	We ended up solving this by removing the highest difficulty of task (level 5) from this training period and resetting the accuracy of all players that had dropped below 50%. We decided to only reset those below 50% since anyone above that accuracy rating had proven themselves adept at the task.	These players who were getting stuck in the training set also raised another issue - some of the level 5 difficulty tasks were simply too hard for many of our players to solve at all. Watching the feedback from players and examining the samples they were having trouble with led us to the discovery that some of them were only solvable by looking at other data alongside the curve or by using frequency analysis, since the transits were obscured by the general noise of the sample.	After some discussions with Michel Mayor's team, we concluded that these could safely be excluded, as they couldn't realistically be found by eye and didn't further the scientific goals of the project.	ui3	The Many Paths of Discovery
120	english	 	 Initial Patterns and Problems
120	english	 	 A message from the Project Discovery devs	Project Discovery is always a continuous process. Along the way, we’ve found some issues, some solutions and some improvements to guide us to even greater heights.	Working on Project Discovery has been a unique challenge for several reasons, not least of which has been the sheer amount of data we are working with. The magnitude of the data makes checking it by hand more or less impossible, so when problems arise they need to be classified in such a way that we can automatically detect problematic samples, since combing through the data by hand would be infeasible.	With the help of capsuleers in EVE Online, however, this data becomes much more manageable and we’ve already found and eliminated several issues.	We’ve even reached the point of sending the first batch of data off to Geneva for follow up research.
120	english	 	 Regardless of their diverse in-game roles (be they haulers, combatants, spies or the like), the pilots of EVE Online have shown themselves to be effective, real-life explorers of the galaxy.	Although we are well aware of the EVE Community’s tendency to surpass expectations, we may yet again have underestimated the capsuleers’ capacity for science. Rest assured, however, there’s plenty for Project Discovery to do, as we try to discover something new in all the stars in the sky that the CoRoT telescope has seen twinkling.

121	english	 	 Until next time,
121	english	 	 Looking forward:	Along with the changes above, we had also hoped to ‘fix’ 500mn Heavy Interdictors in this patch. We decided to hold off until we can also ship a new module to replace the mass control for wormholers. Look for that set of changes in the near future. We also aim to keep up the pace on small changes like the ones above to make sure the meta is interesting and dynamic. Please let us know what you think of these changes in the comments thread for this blog and tell us what ships and modules you would like to receive balance passes in the future.	If you'd like to discuss the contents of this dev blog, you can do so in the comments thread over on the EVE Online Forums!
121	english	 	 Introducing the Monitor:	We have been gathering feedback from the community for quite some time now about the idea of creating a dedicated ship to combat “headshotting” in large fleet battles. “Headshotting” is the tactic of destroying enemy fleet commanders and other leaders to disrupt the organization of hostile fleets. It’s a clever and effective tactic, but it also has a tendency to prematurely end fights and makes it more difficult for newer fleet commanders to learn the ropes. When we’ve discussed this issues with the community at events like Fanfest and through the CSM the idea of a specialized ship designed to survive at all costs has received widespread support. Such a ship would need to be an effective option for resisting headshot attempts while avoiding becoming so powerful and versatile that it would become the only ship worth commanding from.	The Monitor is the first ship in a new group called “Flag Cruisers”. It will be completely focused on survivability at the expense of all other attributes, intended for players who absolutely need to be able to survive uncloaked in a battle. It has no cargo bay, weapons, or drones.	The only modules it can fit are Afterburners, Microwarpdrives, and Micro Jump Drives. In exchange for these limitations it combines command ship levels of effective hitpoints (including 90%+ base armor and shield resistances) with the signature radius of a frigate and built-in resistances against ECM, sensor dampeners, neutralizers, and target painters. This is a ship that will only be flown by a relatively small number of capsuleers but we know that those players will be providing content for many others.	We are very interested in hearing what you think about this new ship. All the details and discussion can be found in this forum thread.

122	english	 	 Discussion thread	This upcoming March release will also include a set of tweaks to the Entosis Link module and to sov capture events. The primary goals of these changes are to shake up the sov combat metagame and give players new gameplay options to optimize and master.	We presented an earlier form of these proposed changes to the CSM at the recent winter summit and incorporated their feedback into the design below.	The biggest of these changes revolve around the Entosis Link module itself. We are currently planning on the following changes to the Entosis Link:	Allow remote assistance to subcapital ships with Entosis Links running (including remote reps)	Significantly reduced max ranges: 20km for T1 and 50km for T2	Significantly reduced fitting requirements for the T2 module: 20 power grid and 5 CPU	+100% sensor strength to any ship with an active cycling Entosis Link	Combined these changes remove the largest downside of activating an Entosis Link (the remote assistance block) while also forcing the linking ships into a much closer area around their target.	Being able to remote rep the linking ship also makes it easier to run multiple redundant links which reduces the power of alpha doctrines in sov capture events.	We are also looking at some tweaks to the node spawning in sov capture events:	Increase the score gained per node capture from 5% to 7%	Reduce the number of starting nodes from 5 to 4	Increase the random node spawn chance by ~14%	These changes reduce the number of node captures required to complete an uncontested event as well as concentrating the starting locations for fights somewhat.	We are sure that a great many of you will have feedback to share on these proposed changes, and we're looking forward to discussion in the various feedback threads for each of these changes.	Thanks for taking the time to read this dev blog today and thanks in advance for your feedback in the forum threads.	These changes will be available for testing on the Singularity test server very soon and we encourage everyone to try them out there and give as much feedback as possible!
122	english	 	 Discussion thread	Alongside the jump fatigue reductions above, we are also looking at making changes to another commonly discussed issue with jump travel. The introduction of Upwell Structures and tethering with the Citadel expansion opened new ways for capitals to move with extreme safety by jumping directly from one structure to another and receiving tethering at both the origin and the destination of the jump.	This is a significant increase in safety compared to the previous use of starbases and we have been hearing concerns about this mechanic from the community for the last two years.	We are currently planning a change for March that would delay tethering for a short time after a cynosural jump. This delay would not impact docking, so if a ship jumps to an Upwell Structure that is large enough for them to dock then they will still be able to dock immediately after the session change timer.	This change would mainly impact the use of medium structures as a safe travel network for combat capital ships. For more details and to let us know what you think of this proposal we encourage everyone to check out the forum thread here.	epjagentosis

It sits in a difficult spot in EVE's metagame, as it is one of the least satisfying mechanics possible but is also universally recognized as necessary in some form.	We spent countless hours discussing this mechanic with EVE players in person at events, on podcasts and streams, through the CSM, and on the forums over the past few years. In these discussions it's clear that although there are many opinions on the direction we should take this feature, everyone agrees that it needs iteration.	For the upcoming March release, we are aiming to make a small but extremely significant change to Jump Fatigue that will hopefully reduce the pain of the feature while avoiding a return to the thoroughly dysfunctional capital meta that existed before the Phoebe release in 2014.	The current proposed change for March is a 95% reduction in the cap on fatigue accumulation. We would reduce the maximum possible jump fatigue (blue timer) from the current 4 days to 5 hours and the maximum possible jump activation cooldown (orange timer) from 9.6 hours to 30 minutes.	In practice, this change would change the optimal jump pattern for long distance travel to jumping as soon as your orange timer expires. Capital ships will continue to have the ability to use stargates as well in addition to their jump capabilities.	We are very interested in hearing opinions from the community on this proposed change, and we encourage everyone to check out the forum thread for discussion and any changes to the plan.

123	english	 	 SKIN LIFECYCLES & DISCOUNTS	While we will continue focusing our efforts to deliver more high quality and unique SKINs in store. To keep things fresh, we will be limiting the amout of time that SKINs spend in the New Eden Store to 3 months, at which point they will be retired. This change will allow us to ensure that the store maintains the right amount of easy to navigate content, while also providing players with discounted prices much sooner than before with a retirement sale each time a SKIN is retired.
123	english	 	 RETIRING OLDER CONTENT	Currently we have a situation where SKINs & Apparel remain in the store for years, become dated and eventually clutter things up, to the point where we have almost 800 cosmetic items in store today.	In order to keep the store fresh & easier to navigate, we will be retiring a large portion of our current SKIN & Apparel items in the coming weeks. We will be doing this through a series of weekly retirement sales, starting in March and running through until June, where retiring items will be sold at discounted prices before being removed from the store. So be sure to check the store each week during this time to grab a bargain on your favorite item before they retire.	2018.03.01.15.58.44
124	english	 	 We’re currently working on a few tools and processes internally that will bring further hell down on those who choose to bot in EVE Online.	At this stage, we’re a little too early in the process to talk about any specifics, but be sure to keep checking back in these regular updates for more information.	If you'd like to discuss this dev blog, feel free to do so in the comments thread on the EVE Online Forums here!

125	english	 	 To help you better distinguish it from the normal radial menu, this one is tinted in the fleet color (usually purple). This radial menu will allow FCs to broadcast their commands, such as target, warp to and align to. In addition, it allows normal squad members to broadcast for reps, either by activating the menu on themselves or their ship, or by activating it in empty space.	During the EVE Vegas livestream where Community fittings were being discussed, one of you suggested in the twitch chat that we add filter in the Fitting window to filter out ships and fits you didn't have skills for. I thought that was such a good idea that I might even have confirmed there and then that it would be added, and shortly after it was deployed to TQ.	And finally, here is a list of some of the other changes we've made together over the last year or so:	When a pilot invites you to fleet, the message you get will include a link to that character's info.	When the fleet boss quits, a fleet role will now be passed on to the highest-ranking member in the fleet that is at the top of the list in the UI, so people can make sure they fill those spots by people who are available.	Heavily relaxed the squad and wing size restrictions to 256 members per squad, 25 squads per wing and 25 wings per fleet. Note: Fleets are still restricted to the same max size.

Expanded the 'Engage Drones' shortcut to also give the 'Mine Repeatedly' command to any mining drones.	Added a number of assignable shortcuts for various fighter actions (they are unassigned by default but can be set up in the Esc menu)	Relaxed the throttling on giving orders to Fighter Squadrons. This should result in less occurrences of busy squadrons during high APM usage.	A fighter squadron launched from a structure will now undock from one of the structure's frigate undock points	The ship name in 'Fitting management' windows is now a link to the info for the ship type.	It is now possible to suppress the confirmation pop up windows for offlining weapons, offlining modules, which are part of a group, and unfitting modules, which are part of a group.

125	english	 	 In Lifeblood, we also added a new type of radial menu, the fleet broadcasting radial menu. To use it, you need to assign a shortcut through the ESC window, and when that key is held down and a radial menu is activated, you get the broadcasting options rather than the normal options.
125	english	 	 In addition to this, we added this tooltip to a few handpicked numbers, such as the total in the Sell Item window and the total in the Buy window. If you know of other places where this tooltip would be useful, please let us know ??
125	english	 	 15545640000 => ˜ 15.5 billion
125	english	 	 25000 => 25.0 thousand	9999000 => ˜ 10.0 million
125	english	 	 The HQ listed in Show Info windows for corporation will now be a link	A tooltip has been added to the standing icon in the show info window to show what that icon is based on (player to player, player to corp, alliance to corp etc).	The height of the 'Duration' drop down in market orders have been increased, so all entries fit without scrolling	The Salvage option for salvage drones has been moved to the top of the right click menu	Volume information has been added to the 'Material input' and 'Output' tooltips in the Industry window	The right click options that have been categorized as potentially especially destructive will now have a red ! in front of them. Among other things, we hope this helps to make it easier to differentiate between 'Reprocess' and 'Repackage'.	The contents of the 'My Structures' tab in the 'Structure browser' can now be fitered by typing a structure type or region in the filter field.	Shuttles and pods now have 90% reduction to effective distance traveled for jump fatigue.	Past Changes:	In EVE Online: Lifeblood, we released a small change to help you quickly see the magnitude of numbers you enter in buy or sell orders, contracts and any other input boxes. If a number higher than 10k has been entered in any input box, it now has a tooltip writing out the amount, for example:	45343 => ˜ 45.3 thousand
125	english	 	 Many pilots out there, yours truly included, find it hard to figure out which solar systems they can enter without the Faction police hunting them down. To make that easier, we have now included a tooltip on your security status in the 'Character sheet', informing you in which solar systems you should watch out for the police.	securityStatus	Other changes we have in the March release:	The results from ship scans are now organized by slots
125	english	 	 I find the Compare tool pretty useful but to be honest, it can be a bit difficult to find what differs between the items you are comparing because there are so many attributes and many of them have exactly the same values for the compared items.	We are adding an option in the 'Compare tool' that will allow you to filter the Attributes list so it only displays those attributes whose values are not the same for all the items you are comparing. Hopefully it will make it will make it easier for you to drill down to what are the real differences between the items and what are the trade-offs.	compareTool	Structures have been making their mark in the landscape of New Eden, and it therefore seems appropriate that they get their own tab in the solar systems' 'Show Info' windows, rather than being lumped in with Orbital Bodies, which they technically are not. Please note that just as before, the show info window will only show you those structures you have access too.
125	english	 	 OTHER CHANGES	Within certain circles, such as the Incursion community, fleet tags are frequently used. A common suggestion has been to have the tags displayed on the target in the target bar, so we will be adding them there. Additionally, we are changing it so now they will be able to untag targets, in case a mistake was made, or tactics have changed since the tagging.	tagOnTarget
125	english	 	 Getting targeted is commonly known as "being yellow boxed", given the yellow bracket that appears around the ship of the attacker. As many of you probably know, once you see a lot of yellow boxes suddenly appear in space, you are likely to be the enemies' next target. However, logistics pilots, FCs and other key people in the fleet are frequently targeted by their own fleet, as they are pre-locked by the logistics wing to give a better chance of keeping them alive. (To be honest, I always get a bit nervous seeing that yellow box, even though I know it's in my best interest, and it makes it harder to see when I'm actually being targeted by the enemy.)	In order to help you see when you are truly "yellow boxed" in the "incoming-attack-sense", we are changing it so when a fleet member targets you, the bracket around their ship will be in the fleet color rather than yellow. By default, it will therefore be purple, but if you have changed the color of the fleet flag to be anything else, the targeting bracket will be of that color. Yes, I do know you can change the fleet color to be yellow, but if you do, that´s kind of on you, isn´t it?	If for any reason, your fleet mate attacks you, the bracket will change color and become red, just as before.	beforeAfterBrackets	Another small change we are making to help out logistics pilots, is to include the ship type name in the broadcast for reps. This has been frequently asked for by logistics pilots all over, who would like to know the type of the ships that are in trouble, so they can prioritize the broadcasts and evaluate if they even have a chance to save the ship at all.	broadcastWithShipType
