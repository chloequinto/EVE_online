81	english	 	 Bans are done in 1 – 2 – 1 order. For example: Team A will take the first ban, Team B will take the second and third ban, and Team A will finish the banning phase with the fourth ban.	Each ban has a time limit of one minute; if no ship is selected within that timeframe the ban is forfeit.	Once the bans start, a drop down menu will appear where you select the ship to ban. You can type the name of the ship to speed up the process.	Please be aware that banning a ship will not remove it from the list. Selecting the same ship type twice is a wasted ban.	Each ban targets a specific ship type and not a ship class or other hull. For example, banning the Harpy would not exclude the Hawk or frigates in general.	Teams should endeavor to have multiple ship setups available as bans may impact your primary team setup. No additional time will be given if teams do not have eligible ships available.	During the final day of competition, some matches will require teams to be ready within 15 minutes after the completion of banning. We expect that many teams will find this time limit challenging. The best teams in New Eden will be the ones that can adapt quickly.	All bans apply to both teams equally.	New to EVE? Start your 14-day free trial today.	Returning pilot?
