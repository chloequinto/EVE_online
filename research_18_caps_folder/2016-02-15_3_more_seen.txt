AND YOUR REWARDS ARE...
Prizes will be awarded for 1st, 2nd and 3rd place entries. There will also be an additional prize awarded at the sole discretion of CCP Seagull.  (CCP Seagull was an early champion of CREST and helped lead the team that delivered it. Due to CCP Seagull's history with CREST, she has been given the honor of selecting one additional entry to win a prize completely at her own discretion.)
Prizes include two of the amazing TQ server blades that our operations team had put together. You can read a bit more about them here: //community.eveonline.com/news/dev-blogs/fanfest-2015-silent-auction-servers-t-shirts-guns..-oh-my/
