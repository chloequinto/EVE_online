THE REST
Lastly, I want to mention a few small changes we have implemented recently but not had the opportunity to tell you about:
Added a Booster Timer that clearly shows you how much time you have left on your active boosters, their benefits, and side effects. This timer is displayed next to other timers such as Weapon and Limited Engagement timers.
Added the ability to select which overview preset to use when scanning with the Directional Scanner.
Added a visual timer in the HUD on modules (such as micro jump drives and cloaking devices) that have cooldown time to indicate how much was left of the cooldown.
Added the ability to name your jump clones. This can be done through a right click option on the jump clones in the Character Sheet
We hope these small changes make your stay in New Eden a little bit more pleasant.
Fly Safe,
