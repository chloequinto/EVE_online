CHRISTMAS COLLECTIBLES!
It's been an interesting year for New Eden and what better way to commemorate it with a set of collectibles trinkets that have a little fun with both player and non-player backstory.
On December 24th, each active EVE Online account will also receive a set of 20 collectible special edition commodities that poke a little fun at some of the adventures and mishaps that have occured over the course of the last year. These will also appear in your redeeming system on character selection.
