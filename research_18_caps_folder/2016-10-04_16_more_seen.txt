The Orca is receiving a massive overhaul in the November expansion, with huge buffs to almost every attribute.

As the middle ship in the mining foreman progression path (and top of the pack for highsec) the Orca is extremely capable in all three of the mining foreman pillars:
Help fleetmates mine more effectively:
Three command bursts, a 3% per level bonus to Mining Foreman Burst strength, and a 50% role bonus to Command Burst area of effect make the Orca a great choice for providing mining boosts
+500% survey scanner range makes the Orca a perfect coordination platform
The Orca retains its existing Ship Maintenance Bay, enabling fleetmates to refit their mining ships and allowing storage of mining vessels for transport and backup
Alongside the unchanged bonuses to tractor beams, the ore hold of the Orca has been tripled in size. The Orca is a perfect vessel for storage and hauling of ore
Defend the mining operation:
Thanks to a +10% per level bonus and +100% role bonus to drone damage, the Orca can deal battleship-level damage with a flight of fast medium drones
A 400% bonus to Remote Shield Booster optimal range allows the Orca to effectively aid in the defense of its allies using large remote shield boosters.
A bonus to Shield Command Burst strength allows the Orca to improve the tank of its allies, providing useful resistance from all kinds of assaults (including suicide ganks)
Contribute with powerful mining drones:
With both skill and role bonuses to mining drone yield, the Orca can pull in similar ore volumes to an exhumer
