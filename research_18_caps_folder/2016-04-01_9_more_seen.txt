WINNERS OF THE EVE ONLINE API CHALLENGE
On February 15th we announced the first EVE Online API Challenge and deadline for entering was on March 4th. Since then a group of us at CCP have been hard at work with our best court dress. We were incredibly happy to see a total of 42 (little known fact, that number was used to seed New Eden) entries into the contest.
