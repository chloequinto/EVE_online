NEW ITEM CATALOG AND AURUM PRICING
The new store will launch with 105 entries. Of those over 60 items will be new and never seen before. A healthy mix of clothing items, two new full-sleeve tattoos (for both right and left arms) and four new ship skins will be offered. 
Abaddon Tash-Murkon edition
Hyperion Innerzone Shipping edition
Maelstrom Nefantar edition
Rokh Wiyrkomi edition
The price ranges for a single item in the first iteration will go from 45 AUR (for a frigate ship skin) to 1500 AUR (for the full sleeve ‘Wreckage’ tattoo), while the 10 run blueprints will range from 400 Aurum (10 frigate skins) to 3000 Aurum (10 battleship skins). We will be offering more items in the future at a faster rate than previously and there will be regular sales and special offers. 
With the release of the New Eden Store, we will stop selling Aurum Tokens and start selling Aurum directly instead. Existing Aurum Tokens can still be redeemed for Aurum – we will just stop selling new ones. You can also continue to convert your PLEX into AUR like previously. Coupled with the AURUM sales we are changing the pricing structure. You will now get slightly more AURUM when purchasing directly.
The new Aurum prices are as follows:
