CCP Seagull: Contact management was one of the first read-write APIs we got working internally with CREST years ago, and we've had test implementations of contact management running internally for a long time. That we have been able to now actually release these APIs on Tranquility and can see the kind of good looking and nicely featured contact management utility app like the EVE Online Contact Manager realized and accessible to players, to me represents one small victory for the vision we had for CREST. That's why this app gets my special price - having this kind of app created by actual third party developers on a fully functioning CREST and authentication stack, instead of internally by us on test infrastructure not actually usable outside CCP - that's what makes this special for me, as I have been involved with CREST development from the very beginning. Congratulations to Julian Aldurald for a well done implementation of some of the potential that the Contact APIs provide!
