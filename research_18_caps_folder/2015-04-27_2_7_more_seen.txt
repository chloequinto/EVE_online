SLIDE FROM SIDE TO SIDE
One of the corp management features our players frequently requested is the ability to see all the content of each screen in the smallest resolutions. Instead of band-aiding that by adding a side scroll feature to the content, we tilted the column headers making them vertical. The labels get cut if they exceed the header height, but you can always hover over to get a tooltip with the full text string. This change solves the scrolling problem (all the screens fit in the minimum resolution) and also helps with tightening the checkbox matrix.
