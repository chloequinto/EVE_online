CYCLONE
Cyclone:
A simple buff here to nudge an already decent ship towards competitive viability
Minmatar Battlecruiser bonus per level: 7.5% to Heavy Missile Launcher and Heavy Assault Missile Launcher rate of fire (was 5%)
Eagle:
The Eagle has had a place before in the fleet meta and may find one again between the Assault Damage Control and the Ferox nerf, but we still feel some added utility is a good idea.
+12 maximum velocity
+25 drone bandwidth
+25 drone bay
Muninn:
We hope with these improvements the Muninn can find a place as a more agile and slippery artillery option compared to Hurricanes or even Lokis, but that’s some stiff competition so we’ll have to see how it goes.
Minmatar Cruiser bonus per level: 7.5% Medium Projectile Turret damage (was 5%)
+150 armor HP
+20 maximum velocity
-750,000 mass
-10 signature radius
-1 high slot
+1 mid slot
