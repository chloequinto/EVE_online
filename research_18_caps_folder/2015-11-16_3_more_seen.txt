A FEW EXAMPLES
A few members of the community have already implemented this new CREST feature and you can go and try them out now.
Fleet-Up
Fleet-Up is a web site where you can share ship fittings and doctrines with others. It allows you to create private groups for your corporation or public groups such as the RvB Ganked or Spectre Fleet groups. Once you have a group with some saved fits others can come along view your fits, see if their skills allow them to use it, and then also if browsing from the in-game browser (IGB) they can open the fit in game.
With the release of the fittings resource for CREST in Parallax fleet-up now lets you save the fits to your character from any browser without having to open the client at all. Here are some screen shots from Wacktopia of Fleet-Up:
In the above you can see Fleet-Up asking you to give them permission to view and save fits for your character.
Fleet-Up allows you to link multiple characters to a single Fleet-Up account so here you can select which character to import the fits from.
After selecting a character Fleet-Up will show you all of the fits for that character and then you can easily import those fits into Fleet-Up to be shared.
Wacktopia has said he is working on adding the ability to also export fits from Fleet-Up to EVE however it wasn't ready to be released at the time of writing this dev blog. If you would like to try Fleet-Up you can go to //fleet-up.com/
Pyfa
Pyfa is a fitting tool that lets you play around and experiment with fittings without needing to open the client, own the modules or ship, and before you have the skills. One of its greatest uses is the ability to have a very large number of fits and compare them to each other. Now once you're happy with a given fit and want to actually use it in EVE you can easily save it to the EVE server. The nice advantage of this new method over the existing method of copy the fit to clipboard and save that into the game is that you don't have to have the EVE client open on the same machine as Pyfa. You could in theory (and I would never advocate you do this) have Pyfa installed at work, mess around with fittings, save some fittings to EVE, and then when you log into EVE at home (because you wouldn't do that at the office would you?) the fits would already be available to your character.
Here you can see Pyfa asking which character you would like to export the current fit to.
Pyfa now also allows you to import fits from EVE easily. Great for those times when you don't have EVE installed and want to play around with a saved fit from one of your characters.
Being as awesome as they are the Pyfa team even allows you to select between using Singularity or Tranquility.
You can get the newest release put together by Sable Blitzmann of Pyfa from their GitHub releases page here: //github.com/DarkFenX/Pyfa/releases
zKillboard
Ever been browsing zKillboard and found that one fit that blew your mind as being not complete shit in your opinion? Well guess what, Squizz Caphinator has been kind enough to update zKillboard so that while browsing zKillboard, not on company time, you can easily click one button and have the fit saved to your character.
To try it out just visit any kill from zKillboard: //zkillboard.com/
