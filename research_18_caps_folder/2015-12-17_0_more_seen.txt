AND FINALLY...
Come join us at the Annual Luminaire Snowball fight, hosted by Commander A9 on December 20th at 21:00 EVE Time, where there'll be a few CCPers ready to have some fun with snowballs and fireworks. You can find out more about the snowball fight, the light shows and the planned secret Santa event by heading on over to this forum thread.
There'll be more information next week on additional Holiday offers, as well as another blog from Team Murder Services. Until then, we've got pirates to hunt down...
