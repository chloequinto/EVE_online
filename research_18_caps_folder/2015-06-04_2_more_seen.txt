THE FUTURE
OK great, new Marauder and SOE SKINs! What about the future though? What else is coming later this year? We have begun working on what we call "designer SKINs" made by corporations or people in New Eden that are setup for the sole purpose of designing dramatic or unique looking SKINs. Right now every SKIN is tied to a single corporation or faction and follows their design philosophy. These designer SKINs help give us a bit more freedom in that we don't have to try and tie each SKIN to an existing corporation or create a new corporation for each SKIN we want to make. With that in mind we are aiming to have four new designer SKINs out this summer. Two for Minmatar and two for Caldari as those two empires have the least number of SKINs available right now.
Here are some concepts that our art director has come up with. These will likely not be what we end up releasing but should hopefully give you an idea of what we are considering doing.
Again these are just concepts but we are aiming to ship some form of the new designer SKINs this summer. The end result of this new designer SKINs system is that we will be able to ship
