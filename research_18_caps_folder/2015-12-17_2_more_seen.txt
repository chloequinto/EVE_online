SNOWBALL FIGHT!

Firstly, the always popular stacks of snowballs and festival launchers will return to your hangars this holiday season, along with fireworks of various colors to help you celebrate the arrival of the new year (or distract a hostile pilot with pretty lights and flashing colors long enough to make a daring and heroic escape).
There will be two drops of Snowballs, Fireworks and Festival Launchers over the course of the holiday period. These will occur once for each active EVE Online account on the dates listed, and with the following items being deposited into your account's redeeming system:
December 24th, 2015:
2x Festival Launcher
200x Snowball
1x Women's 'Rocket' Dress (festive)
1x Men's 'Curate' Coat (festive)
December 30th, 2015:
2x Festival Launcher
200x Barium Firework
200x Copper Firework
200x Sodium Firework
If you're new to EVE, or are unsure how to redeem these items in character selection, then feel free to take a look at this article written by our friendly GM Team on the Customer Support Help Center for more information.
