Description: Pathfinder is a desktop application which is able to find the shortest path between solar systems (including wormholes) using data retrieved from Eve SDE and 3rd party wormhole mapping tools. If you are looking to see how it works without downloading it Valtyr has a nice YouTube video showing it off: youtube.com/watch?v=oM3mSKzZM0w
Comments:
CCP FoxFour: One of the really cool things about this project is not only does it sound like something I could see myself using, I have actively been using it over the last few weeks. It is an incredibly well polished entry that aims to solve a single problem and does so well.
CCP Bartender: I was impressed by how focused and complete this project was. Valtyr has clearly resisted the temptation for feature creep and the result is a tool which does one thing and does it extremely well with no fuss.
CCP SnowedIn: Absolutely love the integrations in this app. Very clean and intuitive, does one thing well... great job.
