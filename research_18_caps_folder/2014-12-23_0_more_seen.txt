UPDATE:
Based on feedback and further tweaking, we've made the following changes to some modules. These changes are listed below, and take precedence over the statistics above.
Capacitor Power Relays
NameCPUShield Boost Bonus (%)Capacitor Recharge Rate Bonus (%)
Type-D Restrained Capacitor Power Relay4-822
Mark I Compact Capacitor Power Relay2-1022
Type-D Restrained Capacitor Power Relay – Shield Boost penalty decreased from -10% to -8%
Mark I Compact Capacitor Power Relay – Shield Boost penalty decreased from -8% to -10%
The Shield Boost Bonus error has been fixed. Type-D and Mark I modules had the value reversed.
Expanded Cargoholds
NameStructure Hitpoint Bonus (%)Cargo Capacity Bonus (%)Velocity Modifier (%)
Civilian Expanded Cargohold-3010-20
Expanded Cargohold I-2017.50-15
Type-D Restrained Expanded Cargo-1522.50-13
Expanded Cargohold II-2327.50-18
'Basic' Expanded Cargohold-517.50-20
Expanded Cargohold I – Structure Hitpoint penalty reduced from -25% to -20%
Expanded Cargohold II – Structure Hitpoint penalty increased from 20% to -23%, Velocity modifier increased from -10% to -18%
These three changes should bring the T1 and T2 Expanded Cargoholds better in line with other module types, with the T2 version of a module giving the best performance but with higher drawbacks than T1.
'Basic' Expanded Cargohold – Structure Hitpoint penalty reduced from -10% to -5%. This should allow players who care more about keeping as much structure hitpoint as possible an attractive option, at the cost of cargo capacity.
Inertial Stabilizers
Inertial Stabilizers are now consistently named Inertial Stabilizers instead of some being Inertia Stabilizers and some Inertial Stabilizers.
NameSignature Radius Bonus (%)Inertia Modifier (%)
Type-D Restrained Inertial Stabilizers8-18.50
Type-D Restrained Inertial Stabilizers – Signature Radius penalty decreased from 9% to 8%
