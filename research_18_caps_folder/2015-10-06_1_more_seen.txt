WHEN CAN I TRY IT?
Right now! Download it from here: //binaries.eveonline.com/EveLauncher-969236.exe
To begin with we'll offer this new launcher as an alternative to the current one. It is still in an early state and we want your feedback before we commit to switching over. The current launcher will continue to be offered until we are fully confident that the new launcher provides a better experience for all players.
What about my settings?
As of yet, we do not provide a path to migrate settings to the new setup. We do plan on developing a simple tool to help with migrating settings, though, so do not despair.
What about the Mac?
The Mac version is not available in this first pre-release, but we are working on it.
