VIRTUALIZE ALL THE THINGS!
Before we go further, keep in mind that this is a proof of concept that we have yet to test. It is entirely possible we'll ditch this and just go with plain normal clusters (that still happen to be running on insanely UltraMegaShiny hardware from the heavens).
 Our plan is to create a 4 node ESXi cluster farm with the 4 monster nodes.  On top of the hypervisor we'll build both of our SQL Server clusters with one cluster node per ESXi server - as if they were physical.  No real change there!  
But...
The real benefit comes into play when (or if, but more likely when) one of these physical hosts needs hardware maintenance or needs to be taken offline for some reason.  At this point, in a typical two-node physical cluster we would be forced to run on only one cluster node and have fingers crossed that our now-single-point-of-failure does not fail. Lots of soulful Amarrian prayers would be required.
With our virtual direction, we could simply vMotion the passive cluster node from its dedicated ESXi host to another ESXi host (the one hosting the 2nd cluster’s passive node)...and Bob’s yer uncle!  Sure that one host with two passive nodes will now be over-allocated, but we would have to lose two more hosts before that becomes an issue!
This means that not only are we redundant on the SQL Instance level by using Windows Failover Clustering, but we'll now be able to survive more than one hardware failure as well!  We have a lot of testing to do with this but for the most part this is all proven tech, so really, what could possibly go wrong?! 
Yours always!
