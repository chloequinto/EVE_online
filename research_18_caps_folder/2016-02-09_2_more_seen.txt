MARQUEE SELECT
Marquee select is simply the act of drawing a box on the screen using the mouse to select one or more things. It can now be triggered by holding down any of the combat command shortcuts (ALT for “Look At” or C for “Track”, etc.) and dragging with the left mouse button over the 3d scene. On releasing the mouse button, the selected command will be performed on the selected entity or entities. Even though this new feature is not strictly tied to the new camera modes, it ended up in this package as it allows you to apply camera commands such as “Look At” and “Track” within the 3d scene, hassle free, as opposed to relying on the overview or right-click menus. “Look at” is now implemented to work nicely even when you select multiple entities at once, essentially allowing you to drill down into large clusters of ships step by step.
The nice side effect is that marquee selection also works nicely with any other in-space command such as “Orbit”, “Approach” or “Warp”. One of the major reasons why it previously wasn’t practical to play the game relying mostly or only on the 3d scene was the near impossibility of picking those tiny brackets moving at lightning speeds. Marquee selection solves this problem quite elegantly as it’s much, much easier to draw a box around a handful of moving pixels than it is to click them. Oh, did I mention you can now use CTRL + Marquee to target multiple things at once? It’s pretty neat. We also added a new “Select” command to be used with marquee which is triggered by holding SHIFT.
