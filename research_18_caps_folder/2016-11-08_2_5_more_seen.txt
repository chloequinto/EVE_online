THE SOTIYO-CLASS EXTRA LARGE ENGINEERING COMPLEX
The largest of the three structures, named after one of the co-creators of the first Caldari jump drive, the Sotiyo-Urbaata Drive, the Sotiyo serves as a large scale manufacturing and assembly site for everything from sub capital ships and modules up to supercapital class hulls.
The Sotiyo will be able to accept capital class ships into its docking bays, and will be able to install services for the production of the largest supercapital ships in New Eden.
Thanks to the generalization benefits of larger structure engineering rigs, one Sotiyo will be able to receive bonuses to all forms of manufacturing at once if desired, providing great convenience for its hard-working residents.
