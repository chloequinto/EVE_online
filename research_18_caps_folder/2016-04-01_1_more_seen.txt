THINGS WE LEARNED
Setting up/Compiling/Running many projects in different languages and platforms is hard
One of the things we under estimated was how much time we would have to spend trying to get every project to run. While some projects had demo web sites running or pre-compiled binaries/setup files we wanted to be able to run the entries locally where possible to ensure the version we were judging is what was submitted. We tried to run most of them in Vagrantfiles but even then simply understanding how each of the different languages and frameworks works was not a small task. In the future I think we will require that entries include a version we can run out of the box. For web applications this will probably mean a Vagrantfile or Dockerfile and desktop applications needing a compiled version we can just run.
Better define the judging criteria
One of the things that came up during the judging was how we all defined the criteria differently in our heads. This lead to a lot of instances of us having to discuss things that should probably just have been defined better. Things like should technical difficulty be how difficult of a task the application is trying to solve or should it be how much of CREST the application is using since the contest was about CREST. While we were able to resolve this in the end we should have had all of this defined better up front. The other part of this was how slow we were to get into the judging as we all sort of had different ideas of how to do it. For the next challenge we hope to answer all of these questions internally before we announce the contest.
