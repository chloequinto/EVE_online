SETTING THE STAGE
The week previous saw a large battle between these opponents over the second of the Keepstar’s three vulnerability timers, where the attackers succeeded in stripping away the defensive armor layer and leaving the hull itself vulnerable to attack.
This earlier battle saw a total of 1634 different pilots engage the Keepstar over the course of 5 hours, with a peak concurrent total of 4510 pilots in system.
Despite the overwhelming forces arrayed against them, Circle-Of-Two, alongside Test Alliance Please Ignore and various other allies, managed to extract a solid toll from their opponents. Combined, more than 250 billion ISK (EVE’s currency) was lost in the battle that set the stage for the final showdown a week later. A more detailed overview of events during this battle can be found in this Reddit thread by Knerf of Northern Coalition.
