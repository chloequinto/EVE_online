THE MORDU’S LEGION BARGHEST BATTLESHIP
The flagship of the new Mordu’s Legion fleet is the mighty Barghest. This Battleship was developed in response to emerging threats from the Guristas. It is designed as a fast battleship with high-speed missile delivery systems along with increased range for warp scramblers and disruptors, making it fully capable of contesting the field with more traditional heavy skirmishers.
