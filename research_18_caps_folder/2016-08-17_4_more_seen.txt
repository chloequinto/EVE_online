QUEUE STRUCTURE
Perhaps it would be a good idea to give a quick overview of how the Customer Support ticket queue is setup before we go any further. Players submit tickets which are filtered into various categories Billing, Gameplay and Technical being the three main ones with each category having sub-categories. It’s not a case of all tickets being in one big queue and then handled on a first come first served basis. We can't adopt a 'one big queue' approach with all GMs working out of it because different GMs have different training and specializations. Also some tickets are more time sensitive than others and they need to be addressed as soon as possible.
All tickets are important to us but we do filter some tickets into a queue in which a GM will reply to the ticket is less than an hour--usually within 15 minutes.  In this queue we handle the aforementioned tickets which are time sensitive such as offensive behavior, player harm reports (broadcast for reps), stuck characters, and some tickets which can be quickly solved with the click of a button such as agent mission issues.  
We also tend to handle most account information tickets in this queue. The reasoning behind this is that if a player wants to come back to the game and does not remember his account details then we want to be able to provide them as quickly as possible rather than have him wait for a few days during which time the urge to rejoin may fade or when they might not have time set-aside to make their grand return.
