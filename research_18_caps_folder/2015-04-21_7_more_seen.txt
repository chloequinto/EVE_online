THE NEW EDEN STORE (NES) 
Purchasing SKINs will work in the same way as all other purchases from the NES. Simply access the NES from the character selection screen or in-game from the sidebar. SKINs will have their own category in the NES.
Once a SKIN is purchased, the item will be placed in your account's redeeming queue and can be redeemed for any character in that account as normal.
