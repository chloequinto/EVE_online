NEW REACTIONS SKILLS 
All characters will be able to run Reactions, including those in an Alpha state, but only Omega pilots will be able to improve their operating efficiency in this area. New skills that determine their ability to run Reactions efficiently and effectively will be introduced prior to the Winter release, to allow pilots time to train them up in time. The effects of these skills are exclusive to Reaction activities. They will not affect a character's ability to perform other industrial activities such as Manufacturing or Invention, and other Industry skills will not affect their Reaction activity.
Reactions: Speeds up reaction jobs by 4% per level
Mass Reactions: Allows one additional Reaction job per character per level
Advanced Mass Reactions: Allows one additional Reaction job per character per level
Remote Reactions: Each level increases the distance at which Reaction jobs can be started. Level 1 allows for jobs at a range within 5 jumps, and each subsequent level adds 5 more jumps to the range, with a maximum of a 25-jump range
