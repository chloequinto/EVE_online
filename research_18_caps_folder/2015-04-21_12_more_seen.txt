BASICS
With Ship Paint Pilot Program, you would manufacture a custom ship by combining a blueprint of a paint pattern and a packaged version of the base ship. This meant that the paint patterns fate was locked to the fate of the ship. So for instance, if you wanted to self-destruct a bunch of Interbus Moros' instead of flying them halfway across New Eden, the paint style would go with it. 
In contrast, the new SKIN system acts much closer to the way skillbooks work in EVE. Each SKIN variant comes as a SKIN item (a licensed pattern), which you can activate for your character or sell on the market. This character then has access to the SKIN for any ships that it applies to, meaning once you lose a skinned ship, you can simply hop in to another and reapply the SKIN pattern. If your character loses their pod and dies or jump clones from one location to another they will still have access to use all their SKIN's.
So to recap:
You can now buy SKINs (with Aurum) from the New Eden Store, in the Fitting screen, or the 3D Preview screen.
Before activation, each SKIN is an item which can be bought and sold in the market (for ISK), can drop if it's in your cargo and your ship explodes, etc.
SKINs are used by activating them for a character, giving that character access to SKIN variations that the item covers.
Once activated, SKINs cannot be removed, but also cannot be destroyed (including loss of ship or pod)
