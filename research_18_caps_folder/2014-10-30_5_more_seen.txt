SCIENCE FIELD CHANGES
As mentioned in our previous blog, we are going to change science field skills drastically both for invention and Tech II manufacturing activities. If you haven’t seen the changes yet and are even loosely involved with those activities, we strongly recommend you read them so you can plan ahead, as skills will not be reimbursed (none are taken away. requirements are just shuffled around) and you may find yourself unable to invent a particular item you were the day before release.
We are specifically referring to the module changes here and ship changes there.
We are also renaming the following skills:
Frigate Construction to Advanced Small Ship Construction
Cruiser Construction to Advanced Medium Ship Construction
Battleship Construction to Advanced Large Ship Construction
Industrial Construction to Advanced Industrial Ship Construction
Reverse Engineering to Sleeper Encryption Methods
In addition, we are going to decrease level requirements to 1 for Tech II item manufacturing on the following skills:
Advanced Small Ship Construction
Advanced Medium Ship Construction
Advanced Large Ship Construction
Avanced Industrial Ship Construction
Amarr Starship Engineering
Caldari Starship Engineering
Gallente Starship Engineering
Minmatar Starship Engineering
Electromagnetic Physics
Electronic Engineering
Graviton Physics
High Energy Physics
Hydromagnetic Physics
Laser Physics
Mechanical Engineering
Molecular Engineering
Nuclear Physics
Plasma Physics
Quantum Physics
Rocket Science
To compensate for this change, all those skills will now give a 1% Time Efficiency bonus for the Tech II manufacturing job they are required for, which is still going to give an incentive for players to train those up, or give an edge for players that already trained them.
Please note this will however not affect the training structure for construction skills, as you still need the smaller advanced ship construction skill before you can train for the next size.
Current manufacturing skill requirements (left) versus Phoebe (right) for an Arazu:
So after the change, the Arazu manufacturer would gain a 15% TE bonus if he / she had Advanced Medium Ship Construction, Gallente Starship Engineering and Electronic Engineering skills at 5.
Advanced Small Ship Construction skill would however give no bonus here since it is a prerequisite of Advanced Medium Ship Construction.
