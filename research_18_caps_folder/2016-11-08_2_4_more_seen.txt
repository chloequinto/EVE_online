The Sotiyo is a behemoth of a manufacturing facility, able to produce everything a corporation, alliance, or indeed a coalition needs. From the ground up it is designed to support manufacturing on the largest scale and has the ability to act as a fleet shipyard, churning out capital and supercapital class vessels and serving as a vital node in an alliance or coalition’s sphere of industrial operations.
