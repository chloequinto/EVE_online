ENGINEERING RIG SECURITY STATUS SCALING
Another area of similarity between the new Engineering Rigs and the existing Citadel Rigs is that the bonuses provided by these rigs changes depending on what type of space their structure is anchored within.
Each Engineering Rig has three sets of bonuses:
One base value for highsec space
One for lowsec space that has a 90% higher bonus than the base value
One for nullsec and wormhole space that has a 110% higher bonus than the base value
Tech 1 rigs that provide manufacturing material input benefits have the following bonuses:
Highsec: 2%
Lowsec: 3.8%
Nullsec: 4.2%
Tech 2 rigs that provide manufacturing material input have the following bonuses:
Highsec: 2.4%
Lowsec: 4.56%
Nullsec: 5.04%
Tech 1 rigs that provide manufacturing or science job speed benefits have the following bonuses:
Highsec: 20%
Lowsec: 38%
Nullsec: 42%
Tech 2 rigs that provide manufacturing or science job speed benefits have the following bonuses:
Highsec: 24%
Lowsec: 45.6%
Nullsec: 50.4%
Tech 1 rigs that provide science cost reduction benefits have the following bonuses:
Highsec: 10%
Lowsec: 19%
Nullsec: 21%
Tech 2 rigs that provide science cost reduction benefits have the following bonuses:
Highsec: 12%
Lowsec: 22.8%
Nullsec: 25.2%
Tech 1 rigs that provide manufacturing material input benefits have the following bonuses:
Highsec: 2%
Lowsec: 3.8%
Nullsec: 4.2%
Tech 2 rigs that provide manufacturing material input have the following bonuses:
Highsec: 2.4%
Lowsec: 4.56%
Nullsec: 5.04%
Tech 1 rigs that provide manufacturing or science job speed benefits have the following bonuses:
Highsec: 20%
Lowsec: 38%
Nullsec: 42%
Tech 2 rigs that provide manufacturing or science job speed benefits have the following bonuses:
Highsec: 24%
Lowsec: 45.6%
Nullsec: 50.4%
Tech 1 rigs that provide science cost reduction benefits have the following bonuses:
Highsec: 10%
Lowsec: 19%
Nullsec: 21%
Tech 2 rigs that provide science cost reduction benefits have the following bonuses:
Highsec: 12%
Lowsec: 22.8%
Nullsec: 25.2%
With the 1% bonus to job material requirements on Engineering Complexes and a T2 rig in nullsec space, the maximum material input bonus available from an Upwell structure after the Ascension expansion will be 5.99%.
With the 30% job speed bonus on the Sotiyo Engineering Complex and a T2 rig in nullsec space, the maximum job speed bonus available from Upwell structures in Ascension will be 65.28%.
And finally the maximum science job cost reduction bonus available from these structures will be 28.94%.
We have a chart with the current draft of stats and material compositions for all 106 Engineering Rigs at the end of the blog for all the granular details.
