HOW DO I GET INVOLVED?
Numerous sources corroborate that sometime within the next 24 hours, Mordu’s Legion Command will publicly release coordinates and details of Serpentis Corporation storage sites located across New Eden.
With permission from the Upwell Consortium and Outer Ring Excavations, as well as with authorization from CONCORD, Mordu’s Legion will declare these sites open season for capsuleer assault, with attacking pilots entitled to any loot that survives the onslaught.
These Serpentis sites will appear globally on the overviews of all capsuleers without the need to scan them down, and will be labeled as “Operation Frostline Target” for ease of identification.

As you can probably imagine, the Serpentis Corporation are a little angry about their operations being exposed, so when you warp to these locations, be sure that you’re adequately prepared to take on several waves of angry Serpentis frigate and cruiser pilots.
Oh, and watch out for other opportunistic pilots like yourself looking to claim the spoils of the firefight, because things could get a little messy.
Leaked manifests suggest loot from these vaults including apparel, synth-grade boosters, ship blueprints, all manner of high and low value modules, implants and Nexus Chips, so there’ll be plenty of trigger-happy pilots looking to make a quick profit from grabbing some of the more exotic salvage.
Also, please be aware that the loot drops will be changing over the course of the holidays to add in even more content, so be sure to keep your eye on the news for more information.
In addition to this, we will be actively monitoring the Twitter hashtag #frostline for cool stories, artwork and pretty screenshots, so be sure that if you’re tweeting screenshots of your escapades during Operation Frostline, than you remember the hashtag for the chance to win a few more prizes including PLEX and signed copies of EVE: The Art Of New Eden.
