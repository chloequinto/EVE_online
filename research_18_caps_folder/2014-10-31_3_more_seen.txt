THE OVERVIEW STATES AND “ALWAYS SHOW”
The ability to have a "war target"/"fleet member" only Overview has been a commonly requested feature and it is arriving with Phoebe. We will be adding a third entity display setting called "Always Show" to the overview. Before I explain what that means, let me go over how the display settings currently work:
Entities (ships, drones, etc.) on the same grid as you in space are displayed in the Overview as long as they do not match a state that is filtered out. This can be quite tricky and confusing because any one entity commonly has multiple states (war target, outlaw, etc).
For example, you can have a corp(1) and alliance(2) mate in the same fleet(3) as you, but is also a supspect(4) with security level below 0 (5), and he‘s neutral(6) to you. If you filter out any of those 6 states he matches, he will not appear in your Overview, which is not always ideal. This has for example caused war target hunters some issues, because in order to have war targets in the Overview, they cannot filter out all those random neutrals they meet on their travels, since their war targets might be neutrals too.
So what is this new display setting? As I mentioned above, we refer to it as "Always Show", and what it means is that if an entity has a state that is set to "Always Show", it does not matter if any of the other states it also matches are filtered out, the entity will always appear in your Overview.
If an entity does not have an "Always Show" state, it's displayed by default as long as it does not have a state that is filtered out, just like before.
To summarize:
Always show	Entities with this state will always be shown regardless of the display setting of additional states they may have
Filter out	Entities with this state will be filtered out unless they have additional states that are set to always show
Show by default	Entities with this state will be shown unless they have additional states that are filtered out
Always showEntities with this state will always be shown regardless of the display setting of additional states they may have
Filter outEntities with this state will be filtered out unless they have additional states that are set to always show
Show by defaultEntities with this state will be shown unless they have additional states that are filtered out
These changes are compatible with all current Overview profiles, which are simply treated as having no state with the "Always Show" setting.
It‘s worth mentioning that although we talk about "Always Show", nothing will override the settings in the Group tab. That is, if you have chosen to not see Battleships in your Overview, your fleet mate in the Raven will not be in the Overview, no matter how your state display settings are.
With this change, we've had to change the interface where you control the display settings of the entity states. The states are back to being in one list, but now you have 3 radio buttons ("Always show", "Filter out", "Show by default") to choose from for each of the states.
You can click each of them individually, or select many states in the list and set them all at once by clicking on the header icons.
