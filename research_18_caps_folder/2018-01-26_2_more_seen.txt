A message from the Project Discovery devs
Project Discovery is always a continuous process. Along the way, we’ve found some issues, some solutions and some improvements to guide us to even greater heights.
Working on Project Discovery has been a unique challenge for several reasons, not least of which has been the sheer amount of data we are working with. The magnitude of the data makes checking it by hand more or less impossible, so when problems arise they need to be classified in such a way that we can automatically detect problematic samples, since combing through the data by hand would be infeasible.
With the help of capsuleers in EVE Online, however, this data becomes much more manageable and we’ve already found and eliminated several issues.
We’ve even reached the point of sending the first batch of data off to Geneva for follow up research.
