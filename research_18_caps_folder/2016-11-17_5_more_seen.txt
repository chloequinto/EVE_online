FITTING SIMULATION MODE
Once you open the fitting window, you'll notice that a few things here and there have changed. One of them is that on the upper right side of the hull model is a new button with a picture of your hull's hologram. This button allows you to switch the fitting window between simulation mode and normal mode. Once you click that button and enter simulation, your hull will be swapped out for a cool looking hologram representation of the hull type.
In this simulated version of your hull, you can experiment as much as you want, change modules, activate weapons, try different charges, swap out rigs ... all without any changes being made to your real hull!
If you find a fit you are happy with, you can save it to your personal fittings or even corporation fittings if you have the necessary roles. If you are working on the same ship type as your real ship, you can also apply that fit directly to the ship. If you happen to be working on a fit for a ship type that is different from the one you are currently sitting in, clicking the 'Fit Ship…' button will open up the recently added Multifit window, allowing you to assemble 1-30 ships with that fit.
Pro tip: If the Multifit window indicates there are any missing items, mouse over the red text to get a tooltip that lists what's missing and a handy 'Buy All…' button.
