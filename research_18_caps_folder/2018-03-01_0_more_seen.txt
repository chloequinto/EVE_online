SUMMARY!
We’re currently working on a few tools and processes internally that will bring further hell down on those who choose to bot in EVE Online.
At this stage, we’re a little too early in the process to talk about any specifics, but be sure to keep checking back in these regular updates for more information.
If you'd like to discuss this dev blog, feel free to do so in the comments thread on the EVE Online Forums here!
