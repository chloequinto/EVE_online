UPGRADING TO SQL 2016
When I was drafting this blog we hit another massive milestone and something we really pushed to achieve before Fanfest: upgrading the SQL Engine for TQ to SQL 2016
We had been running EVE in SQL 2012 compatibility mode. But before the Fanfest rush and while the ops team is now all hands-on deck setting up as this blog is published, we were able to hit this objective on Monday April 3rd!
Quoting our friends at Microsoft … “SQL 2016 its just faster.”
That’s what we want to see happen of course.
Now the current status is to finish Fanfest (and get over the massive non-virtual hangovers) then emphasize back on the hardware side of things, since we can now easily scale our DB nodes and compare metrics where EVE benefits the most. Questions like whether having 1.5 TB of RAM helps a lot or is 768GB the right amount? Should it be 2x CPUs with more cores or lower core count and 4x CPUs essentially duplicating NUMA domains and cache etc. etc.?
Loads of options to improve the experience for you , there is always something …
I really encourage those who are coming to Fanfest and like to talk about hardware and operations related topics to check out our roundtable on Friday at 17:00 UTC in Rima B
I promise we will take the discussion to the next level at pub crawl ??
