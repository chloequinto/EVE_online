WHAT’S NEXT?
Now that we have delivered some much needed love to both the Caldari and Minmatar SKIN lines, we plan to expand designer SKINs to all four major factions.
The Raata Sunset designer line will be expanding to Amarrian hulls and the other three empires will be receiving new lines throughout the rest of the year. 
We have been adding something new into the New Eden Store every two weeks and we are aiming to keep up the pace. Sometimes these additions will be smaller and sometimes larger. If there isn’t a SKIN out yet which tickles your space brain, bear with us and hopefully soon you will find what you are looking for!
Till next time,
CCP Legion
