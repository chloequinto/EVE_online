TL:DR
Hey there. If you took the option of skipping here from the beginning, I’d like to welcome you to the end of the blog! If you have the time later I highly recommend reading the rest at your leisure.
The short version of all this is:
In the November expansion mining support gameplay is getting a huge revamp
Fleet boosts (including mining boosts) are becoming AoE buffs that only work on-grid
There’ll be three mining foreman ships: the new inexpensive Porpoise, a buffed Orca and a buffed Rorqual
Each Mining Foreman Ship will be able to fulfill three roles at once:
Help fleetmates mine more effectively
Defend the mining operation
Contribute with powerful mining drones
