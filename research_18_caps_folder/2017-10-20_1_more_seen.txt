BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE! JACKPOT ASTEROIDS
On rare occasions the Moon Drill can penetrate a particularly rich vein of ore on the moon's surface and the resulting chunk will yield far richer treasures. Although the composition of the chunk will still correspond to the moon, the moongoo ore that is brought up in the chunk and blasted into the asteroid field has a yield of 100% more materials when reprocessed.
More details about the new ores that can be found in moons and how they will be distributed across New Eden can be found here.
