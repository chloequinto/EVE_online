SERVICE MODULES
Service modules are more similar to structure hulls than the other modules. While they do not require Structure Components to build, they do require a mix of PI materials, minerals and the new structure fuel block.
Again, this is not the exhaustive list of all service modules that are planned for structures, but just the first batch.
