TELL US ABOUT THE NEW HOTNESS!
The new wave of Burners are former special ops teams trained by the four Empires. They’ve decided to go freelance and have quickly emerged as a major threat to peace and order in the cluster.
Unlike the first Burners who exclusively work alone, these new additions work in teams of three: a squad leader flying a heavily tanked Assault Frigate and two support pilots flying logistics frigates. Each individual ship in this squad are much less dangerous than the first Burners, but together they represent a significant challenge for any Capsuleer.
The ex-Amarrian Burner teams consist of a durable Vengeance supported by a pair of Inquisitors
The ex-Caldari Burner teams fly a rocket Hawk with a couple Bantams as backup.
The ex-Matari Burner teams prefer to use a swift Jaguar and two Bursts.
The ex-Gallente Burner teams operate with a facemelting Enyo and his Navitas buddies.
We’ll be making these new missions available on the Singularity test server (SiSi) later this week for your testing and feedback, using the same method as we used for the earlier Burners. This means that we will give players a method to increase their standings with all factions on SISI for mission testing, and we will disable all level 4 missions other than the four new Burner Missions.
The missions will be available in the same mission pools as the existing Burners on Tranquility starting on September 30th with our Oceanus release.
We hope that you all continue to enjoy the optional challenges that these Burner Missions bring, and continue doing what we know you do best: overcoming any and all obstacles.
On behalf of Team Five O and the whole EVE Online team, good hunting!
