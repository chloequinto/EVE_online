THE THUNDERDOME PROVING GROUNDS
Unlike previous years, we will not be providing support for teams practicing on Singularity or Duality. Instead, we now have a dedicated events server called Thunderdome that will be made available only to participating teams for practice usage. This server is hosted on dedicated hardware rather than Virtual Machines, and will allow teams to practice at their own leisure using the same tournament tool the tournament is run under. More details about server and how practices will work will be coming at a later date, so make sure you keep watching the EVE Alliance Tournament Discussion section
With rewards like this for those that find glory, we’re excited about the many matches between competing teams as they compete to claim the blood soaked prizes on offer. As always, if you have questions, feel free to head on over to the Alliance Tournament Forum.
