Continuing our efforts to support third-party developers, we are incredibly happy to announce The EVE Online API challenge: Create a piece of software that primarily focuses on use of the CREST API.
The goal of this challenge is to have some fun and strengthen the third-party developer community. We highly encourage those of you participating to think outside the box and do something new or different. Once all the entries are submitted and CCP has reviewed and judged them, we will share the results in another dev blog and possibly discuss them at Fanfest 2016. In addition and to help add to the fun of participating we will be giving away some prizes. But before we get to that, here are the rules you should be aware of.
