EXPLORATION
So for starters we have something for all you intrepid explorers out there.
The general consensus right now is that Relic sites are worth more than their Data site counterparts when it comes to the basic ISK per hour and this is something that we’ve had on our radar for a while.
So for Phoebe, we’ve made the following exploration changes to help alleviate this:
Lowered the volume of the most commonly dropped items (Electric Conduits for example) in exploration Data Sites from 1.0 (and above) to 0.5.
The drop frequency of faction POS blueprints in all Data and Relic sites has been increased.
The drop frequency of 'Optimized' items in all Data sites has been increased.
Faction Materials have been added to the all the exploration Data site loot tables.
These can be found in the Manufacture & Research > Materials > Faction Materials section of the Market.
List of added items:
Angel Simple Trigger Mechanism
Angel Advanced Trigger Mechanism
Angel Spatial Analyzer
Angel Standard Trigger Mechanism
Angel Dynamic Calibrator
Blood Raider Weapon Integration Unit
Blood Raider Limited Ballistic Control
Blood Raider Regular Ballistic Control
Blood Raider Extreme Ballistic Control
Blood Raider Power Redistributor
Guristas Gravity Focuser
Guristas Medium Weapon Console
Guristas Light Weapon Console
Guristas Graviton Hardening
Guristas Heavy Weapon Console
Serpentis Complex Target Guider
Serpentis Plain Target Guider
Serpentis Basic Target Guider
Serpentis Multi-tasking Processor
Serpentis 3D Scanner Gamut
Various Industrial Goods have been added to the all the exploration Data site loot tables. These can be found in the Trade Goods > Industrial Goods section of the Market.
List of added items:
High-Tech Data Chip
High-Tech Scanner
High-Tech Small Arms
High-Tech Manufacturing Tools
What this means is that the percentage chance of finding some lovely shimmery-like-things will be slightly higher.
Moreover, the volume decrease of the most commonly dropped items means that you’ll be making fewer return trips to offload your wares.
We’ve also added all of the Data and Relic exploration sites found in Null Security space to Wormhole Class 1, 2 and 3 systems. So feel free to venture forth into the deeper, darker unknown if you’re feeling dangerously loot frisky.
