AMENDMENTS TO EULA
CCP may, in its sole discretion, amend the EULA from time to time by posting an amended version at //community.eveonline.com/support/policies/eve-eula-en/ and/or notifying you when you attempt to log in to the System. If the EULA is amended, you will be asked to review the amended EULA when you log into your Account, and to indicate and confirm your acceptance of the amended EULA by clicking the "ACCEPT" and/or "CONFIRMED" buttons. You must accept the EULA in order to continue to access the System or play the Game.
If the amendment alters a material term of the EULA that is unacceptable to you, you may, as your sole and exclusive remedy, terminate the EULA and close your Account as described in Section 5, Termination.
