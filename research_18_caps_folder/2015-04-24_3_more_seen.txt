WHAT IS TWO-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION AND HOW DOES IT HELP ME?
Two-Factor Authentication is a security measure that adds an extra layer of security to your account authentication by asking for some sort of verification other than your password to complete the authentication. In our case we will start with offering two options:
A verification code sent to the registered and valid email address.
A verification code generated by a Google Authenticator compatible application on your smartphone.
This prevents others from accessing your account details in case your account credentials ever get compromised.
When you enable Two-Factor Authentication for your EVE Online account you will be required to provide the two-factor verification code when logging in through the EVE Online SSO or the Launcher.
This will protect you from nefarious people trying to steal your account by logging into account management and changing the registered email address, transferring your character etc.
