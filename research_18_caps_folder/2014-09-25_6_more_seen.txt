WHAT MODULES ARE WE STARTING WITH?
In Oceanus, we are starting the Module Tiericide project by applying the process to eight groups of modules. All of these modules represent fairly simple sets of changes as they do not have very many potential variations. They will serve as the launching point as we start the process of applying Tiericide to every module group in EVE.
The module groups being changed in Oceanus are:
Co-Processors
Reactor Control Units
Micro Auxiliary Power Cores
Light Missile Launchers
Capacitor Flux Coils
Cargo Scanners
Ship Scanners
Survey Scanners
Co-Processors
Co-Processors represent the simplest possible set of named modules, since there is nothing but basic power level to differentiate modules within this group. This means that the only named version will get the title “Upgraded” and all of the current named co-processors will be converted into Upgraded Co-Processors.
Beyond the changes to the named versions, we’ve also consolidated all five “Basic” versions into one single “Basic” type. The “Basic” type will get the CPU bonus of the old T1 version, and both the T1 and Upgraded versions will be getting a boost to bring them closer to T2 in power.
Finally, we’ve also gone ahead and cleaned up the progression among the faction officer versions of the Co-Processors. This mainly takes the form of bringing the Gallente/Serpentis variants up to par with the Caldari/Guristas ones. The Federation Navy, Khanid Navy and Shadow Serpentis variants will now give an equal bonus to the other faction Co-Pros and we’ve fixed up the progression among the officer variants to bring Serpentis and Guristas to parity.

Reactor Control Units
Reactor Control Units also only have room for one named module, but since they have CPU requirements, this one named module will use the “Compact” fitting specialization. All current named RCUs will be converted into Compact Reactor Control Units, which will provide a bigger powergrid bonus than any of the current named variants to put it between T1 and T2 in effectiveness.
The Reactor Control Unit II is receiving a small increase in CPU use, to help balance out the value of the different Reactor Controls.
Reactor Controls are another class where we are cleaning “Basic” variants up into one type, placing it in the Cosmos category just as we did with Co-Processors.
We are also fixing the Shadow Serpentis RCU to match the other faction variants in effectiveness.

Micro Auxiliary Power Cores
Micro Auxiliary Power Cores (MAPCs) will also only need one named specialization, but in this case we are making special consideration for owners of the currently Meta 4 Micro 'Vigor' Core Augmentation. The current metas 1-3 named MAPCs will be converted into the new Compact Compact Micro Auxiliary Power Core but the Vigors will be turned into Navy MAPCs over downtime.

Light Missile Launchers
For the Light Missile Launcher group of modules, we have room for two distinct named specializations. The Compact Light Missile Launcher will specialize in reduced fitting requirements, while the Ample Light Missile Launcher will specialize in extra missile capacity.
The current ‘Limos’ and TE-2100 light missile launchers will become Ample Launchers, and the current ‘Malkuth’ and ‘Arbalest’ launchers will become Compact Launchers.
We are also making some general balance changes to the Light Missile Launchers as a whole. The time between module activations of LMLs will increase by ~6.66%, resulting in a slight decrease in total DPS. This change is being made to help balance the Light Missile weapon system, which received buffs that were a bit too strong back in the Retribution expansion.

Cargo Scanners
For Cargo Scanners, Duration and Scan Range are both important stats, while there’s not a lot of option for a fitting variation. So we’re going for two variations. One that has reduced duration, called Enduring Cargo Scanner. It has reduced cycle time and reduced cap need (3 instead of 4). The other has better range and is called Scoped Cargo Scanner.
To align the new modules better, we’re also reducing the CPU of the tech I Cargo Scanner from 5 to 4.
Surface Cargo Scanner I and Prototype Freight Sensors will become Enduring Cargo Scanners while Interior Type-E Cargo Identifier and PL-0 Shipment Probe will become Scoped Cargo Scanners.
