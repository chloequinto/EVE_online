When playing Project Discovery, you will be presented with a light curve graph representing a star’s luminosity over time, which you’ll analyze primarily by looking for regular dips in luminosity. 
These dips can indicate the transit of a substantially large celestial body between the star being measured and the telescope here in Earth’s orbit. Generally, the only object large enough to cause such dips are exoplanets or other stars.

As part of the analysis, you’ll be given tools that will allow you to fold the luminosity curve of over time, and chop the curve into pieces of a given length so that you can overlay them across each other. This can make it easier to define periodic drops in luminosity, as they’ll line up if the graph is folded to the same frequency.
You‘ll also have a detrending tool at your disposal, which attempts to filter out large scale events caused by the star itself rather than a transiting object. Pilots can set the granularity of the detrending tool so that it will only filter out events that take longer than the set time span (options are 1 hour, 5 hours, 10 hours and 24 hours).

Once you’ve identified a potential transit event, you’ll be able to submit your findings to CONCORD, and they’ll be shipped off to the University of Geneva for further analysis by scientists there.
