FITTING AND SIMULATING MODULES
Once you have loaded a simulated hull, you are ready to start experimenting on it! You can simulate pretty much any module in EVE, as well as testing out and removing simulated rigs without having to destroy them.
There are a few ways to add a simulated module:
Double click a module in the 'Module' browser
Drag modules from nearly anywhere you can find them (for example: Module browsers, market, info, asset, inventory windows) and drop them in the center of the fitting window or an appropriate slot in the fitting window
SHIFT drag a module that has already been added to the simulated hull onto another slot to add another one in that slot
To unfit simulated modules, simply drag the module from the slot and drop it onto any of the browsers in the left panel of the window, use the 'Unfit' button associated with the slot or the slot's 'Unfit' right click option.
Once you have added some modules to the hull, you can click on them to cycle through their states
Offline ? online ? active ? overheated ? offline
With each state change, the stats in the fitting window will update to reflect the module's new state.
You can also reverse the cycle by holding down SHIFT while you click the module.

There are also 3 radial menus that allow you change the state of all the modules in a rack at once.
