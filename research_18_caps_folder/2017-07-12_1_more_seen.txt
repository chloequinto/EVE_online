WHAT ABOUT TWITCH INTEGRATION?
In a similar vein to captain’s quarters, the usage of integrated Twitch streaming was also recently reviewed, and with a negligible number of our pilots utilizing integrated Twitch functionality, we’ve also decided to discontinue support for this as of the September release.
Obviously, we still have 100% support for our streaming community and the incredible (and often entertaining) streams and initiatives that they run, however all our major streamers generally shy away from utilizing Twitch integration. This is purely because third party packages such as Open Broadcaster Software allow for levels of visual customizability that out integrated service could never hope to compete with, such as the ability to use custom overlays and censor parts of the screen for opsec purposes.
