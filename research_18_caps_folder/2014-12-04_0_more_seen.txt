OK, ENOUGH TALK, HOW DO I TURN IT ON
Just like past beta features, simply open up the escape menu by pressing ESC and in the lower left section of the ‘General Settings’ tab you should see an option to enable the new map.

Once clicked, you will get a second map icon in the Neocom with a small beta tag on it. Click on that and bam, new map.
Your participation in beta features is very much appreciated and we can’t wait to see what you think of our new map. Once you’ve checked it out, post your thoughts in the comments thread for this dev blog so that we can make the map the best it can be before we release it officially.
