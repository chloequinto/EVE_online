ZOOMING
We are working towards consolidating the solar system map and the star map into one seamless map. You can see the beginnings of this work by zooming in (by using the mouse wheel, double clicking or control clicking) on any system. The map will seamlessly zoom all the way down to the solar system level, showing you the location of stations and stargates. For now, using scan probes will still only be possible in the old solar system map but hopefully before long we can integrate that, together with more solar system scale functions, into the new map.
In addition to those major changes, there is a range of smaller ones:
You can now use the ‘grouping’ options to show the map at region or constellation level, rather than only showing all the stars at once
You can mark a home station with a label
The display of statistics and filters has been normalized in some cases to improve readability
The code that handles ‘picking’ has been rewritten which should improve the feel of system selection
We have a lot of work going into performance improvement, largely to help support windowed mode.
All that being said, there are some things missing or not workingthis is a beta after all. Here are a few that we know of and will be dealing with as soon as possible:
No search functionality
No jump range visualization for ships with jump drives
The map won’t currently load if you’re in a wormhole
The sovereignty filter hasn’t been hooked up yet
There’s probably more that we haven’t mentioned here but just remember this is an experimental feature and we will be adding features and functionality consistently over the coming weeks and months.
