STRUCTURE RIGS
Except from the hull themselves, rigs are going to be the most expensive piece of equipment to acquire. That is because they are going to offer great bonuses to the installed hull, and overtake the upgrade system currently in place for Outposts. Again, we’ll save the exact bonuses for the next structure blog not to overwhelm you guys all at once.
Rigs are entirely made from existing and regular salvage. Since we are going to have both Tech I and Tech II variations, they will be built in a similar manner to ship rigs, but with a much more expensive cost. We are aware such requirements will increase the demand for salvage, and increase rig price as a result. We will monitor how the market evolves and take additional measures if need be.
Below is an overview on the various rigs we want to release in the first batch:
The rig names we have above are generic categories to show their building costs. Exact rig types are much more numerous. Their associated effect and bonuses will be further explained in our next blog.
Blueprints:
Tech I rig blueprints will be available from the market through NPC sell orders. Tech II rig can be invented or found in sites as BPCs. Prices are going to be 100m ISK for a Tech I Medium Structure rig blueprint, 500m ISK for a Tech I Large Structure rig blueprint and around 2.5b ISK for an X-Large Structure rig blueprint.
