GOALS
Before we get started, let’s explain why we even need to consider this particular feature in the first place.
One of the core philosophies of EVE Online is that acquired resources can be lost. This in turn keeps the economy in check, gives a risk versus reward in the game, and promotes conflict and bragging (who doesn’t love those juicy killmails?). However, while this principle is in place for most of the structures in-game (starbases, customs offices, deployables), it does not apply to player built outposts.
This leads to several problems:
This gives high staging value to building outposts since they can never be removed.
As time passes space becomes more and more saturated with outposts, decreasing logistics risks in null-security space, and reducing the need to build more outposts in the first place.
So, we quickly decided that our new structures would need to be destructible, especially since they are going to be available everywhere from high-security to wormhole space. However, this introduces another problem: we want our structures to be used, but one of the deterrents against that goal is the fact they compete against existing NPC stations and player outposts (before we nuke them that is). As such, we have to accept the fact no one will want to store items or minions (if you are an alliance leader) in one of the new structures if they can be destroyed and lost on a whim.
And that is how asset safety was born.
