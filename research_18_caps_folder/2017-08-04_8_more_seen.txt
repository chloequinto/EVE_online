BETA MAP CHANGES 
We ended up with our head in the Beta map code for some of the work we have planned for later in the year. I would like to emphasize we are not working on removing the old map at this time, the changes are focused on increasing the performance and usability of the Beta map.
We have been tweaking the usability of the Beta map, mainly focusing on camera interaction and system/constellation/region navigation.
Here are some of the changes we are making for August:
Improved Beta map performance when zooming and rotating the map, especially when down at the constellation or solar system level.
The map camera is now pitch constrained so it cannot go below the map plane.
The introduction of a breadcrumb style label that shows the selected region/constellation/system and the corresponding faction (if any). Clicking a location will zoom and pan to it.
Ctrl+clicking a solar system will now set it as destination and Ctrl+shift+click will add it as a waypoint.
Hovering over a solar system will now show how many jumps away it is.
and more...
A breakdown of the changes can be found on the forum thread where we would love to get your feedback and suggestions regarding these changes:

There will also be a number of defect fixes going out. Remember to read the patch notes when they are available to see all the changes that have been made.
Thanks for reading! All these changes are currently available on Singularity and we look forward to hearing your thoughts and feedback.
