JOINING ROLES AND GRANTABLE ROLES
Under the current system, the number of screens needed to set roles was a whopping 19 screens. That is a lot to go through. This is how the tree structure was:
Roles
General
Station Services
Accounting
Hangar Access (HQ)
Container Access (HQ)
Hangar Access (Based at)
Container Access (Based at)
Hangar Access (Other)
Container Access (Other)
Grantable Roles
General
Station Services
Accounting
Hangar Access (HQ)

Hangar Access (Based at)

Consolidating Roles and Grantable Roles was one of the key ingredients of this effort. By adding a tristate checkbox, we sliced the number of screens in half.
These states are:
  Unchecked for no role
/ Half checked for Role
Fully checked for Grantable role
Before the change there were 6 of these screens to deal with hangars
This is the access screen after the change
