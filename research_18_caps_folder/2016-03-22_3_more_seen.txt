SEARCHING FOR WINGMEN
There are many corporations in New Eden who are more than happy to recruit and train rookie players, and joining a corporation is one of the best ways to get a solid head start in EVE. You can find a wealth of corporations looking to recruit in the in game corporation search tool that can help you find the right match for your playstyle.
There is no better source of experience and help than the existing players of EVE. Remember that this is a single-shard server, which means everyone plays on the same server. Notable places to check are the EVE subreddit, the New Citizens Q&A forum on the EVE Online forums, the EVE University Wiki, Brave Newbies Wiki and EVE101.com. If you have a Twitter account, you can also see what other players are currently talking about by watching #eveonline and the player created hashtag #tweetfleet.
In addition to this, there is a fantastic index of new player resources compiled on the /r/eve subreddit that can be viewed here.
