PRICING MODIFIERS
There are a range of modifiers that further affect the final price.
1. A reduction in price based on the stations and upgrades present in a system. Stations, Factional Warfare upgrades and certain outpost upgrades provide beneficial multipliers to costs. For any applicable job in a given system, the multipliers for all the stations and upgrades in that system are multiplied together with the base price. See Appendix 2 for a full list.
Also note: nullsec outpost upgrades which previously added manufacturing lines to the station, will instead offer a 1% material use reduction (i.e. an additional ME-1%) per upgrade installed.
2. Teams will increase job costs when they're used. This cost is a simple percentage increase, and will be listed in the team's information.
3. Facilities can impose a tax on jobs within that facility. For NPC-owned facilities, this is a flat 10%, meaning a 1.1x multiplier to the job price. For player-run outposts, this can be configured by the owners. For starbases, setting taxes won't be supported in the initial release but we are investigating supporting this in future after player feedback.
These multiply together with the base price to create a final per-run price for that job, which needs to be paid up front.
