THE NEW SERVERS
Since day one, EVE has been operated by IBM blade servers. For the upgrade we chose the next generation of IBM servers called IBM FLEX.The above picture demonstrates 1x FLEX Chassis connections to its storage 
The FLEX concept is similar to the blade centers in that there is a chassis which has power and cooling and you can have up to 14x nodes in each chassis.
In comparison, the current TQ blade centers run on 4x 1Gbit network connections then each of the 14x blade has access to 2x1GB as they have 2x network cards.
The new IBM Flex chassis will have 4x 10Gbit network connections, giving each flex node access a total of 2x 10Gbit throughput.
For the current way that EVE runs this is an overkill but having this in place allows for our engineers to test out interesting new ways to scale TQ and architecture performance, that will take time of course but the immediate benefit is that our deployment times will speed up a lot!
Also this will drastically improve our virtual server environment for example when we live migrate Virtual Machines across physical hosts. 
Oh yeah, we will have 6x chassis btw :D
Isn't she a beauty?
You can see a lot of redundancy in the internal components, which is planned so we can maintain TQ by swapping a whole chassis out of rotation while EVE players continue to battle, trade, chat, manufacture, explore, and scam on the other 5. 
The servers are connected to the storage via 2498-F48 IBM SAN 16Gbit Switches with everything cross-connected so there is no single point of failure.
