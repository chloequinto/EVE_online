MINING FOREMAN SHIPS
In the November expansion we are planning huge buffs to the existing Orca and Rorqual mining foreman ships, as well as adding a new inexpensive and mobile Industrial Command Ship to fill out the lower-end of the progression. Each of these ships hits a different price point and have significant differences in mobility and access to different areas of space.
As you’ll remember from the start of the blog, we’ve divided the Mining Foreman ship progression into four stages:
The new affordable and mobile Porpoise-class Industrial Command Ship
The Orca-class full-sized Industrial Command Ship
The Rorqual-class Capital Industrial Ship – without the Industrial Core module active
The Rorqual – with the Industrial Core module running
I’ll cover each of these ships individually in the following section, with specific focus on how each ship fulfills each of the three pillars of mining foreman gameplay.
