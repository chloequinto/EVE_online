THE STATUS OF THE TICKET QUEUE
As well as the above highlights for the department we must acknowledge that these past 6 months have had their difficulties, and to be honest the support we have provided for the last few months has not been ideal.  Twice in the past six months, mostly due to issues outside of our control, our ticket queue has gotten so high that we made the difficult decision to send out mass replies to the majority of tickets in the queue asking players to update their tickets if their issue persisted.  We were able to reduce the queues by about 70% using this emergency measure but it’s not exactly great support and we fully acknowledge that. However, as of writing, our level of support is high, our reply times low, and we aim to keep it that way.
In mid-June we made some changes to our email routing which resulted in replies to tickets by players not getting into our support system. New tickets were able to be submitted but any replies submitted by email to tickets did not make it into our system; this affected 1701 players. We should have detected the problem earlier but for a while it went unnoticed. Once we discovered this issue we contacted the affected players, apologized and provided a ship skin as compensation.
