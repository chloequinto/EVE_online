KEEP YOUR EYES PEELED!
That’s not all you’ll see from the Art team in this release.  Also be on the lookout for modified cynosural field graphics, enhanced local repairer effects, impressive new flames issuing forth from your engines, 13 new ships, and improved logos on every ship and station. All in all, New Eden has never looked better!
We recommend taking a moment to reflect on your favorite ship.  Fly around for a few days and reminisce about the great times you’ve had crushing your enemies, seeing them driven before you, and hearing the lamentation of the crewmen.
