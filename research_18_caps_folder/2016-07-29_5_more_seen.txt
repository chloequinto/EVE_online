PLEX
As with previous Alliance Tournaments, we will be distributing the PLEX collected as entry fees as prizes in the tournament. If a very large number of PLEX are bid during the secret auction, the number of PLEX awarded may potentially increase.
This year, the PLEX will be awarded as follows:
Teams that place between 17th and 32nd will receive 5 PLEX
Teams that place in the top 16 will receive 10 PLEX
Alliance Tournament Prize Ships
Ever since the 7th Alliance Tournament, the main prizes each year have been a set of special edition frigates and cruisers, with unmatched combat prowess. Only 50 of each type of frigate or cruiser are given each tournament.
As with Alliance Tournament XII, this year we will be distributing the special edition prize ships to the top 4 teams, with each team receiving an equal number of cruisers and frigates.
1st place: 25 Cruisers and 25 Frigates
2nd place: 15 Cruisers and 15 Frigates
3rd place: 7 Cruisers and 7 Frigates

Alliance Tournament Edition Blood Raider SKIN
As with Alliance Tournament XIII, we will be offering a ship SKIN that can be applied to any of the Blood Raider ships to give them a unique visual style. We will be awarding 10 copies of this SKIN for each series won by a team. This includes the single match series that make up the bulk of the tournament. This should provide an additional incentive to try and win every match you can. Again like last year, these skins will be handed out later than the rest of the prizes at a yet to be determined date.
