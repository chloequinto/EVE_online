REFINING YOUR PERFORMANCE: RIGS AND BONUSES
While the structures themselves have bonuses to Reprocessing, Upwell are also introducing rigs to improve the functionality exclusive to these new structures. These are focused on the activities that only these structures can perform: Reactions and Moon Mining. 
Rigs that effect the Moon Drill come in two sizes, Medium and Large.
Moon Drilling Efficiency - these rigs effect the volume of the moon chunk that is pulled from the moon, in relation to the amount of time set for the extraction.
Moon Drilling Efficiency Rig M Tech 1 - 2% volume/time increase
Moon Drilling Efficiency Rig M Tech 2 - 2.4% volume/time increase
Moon Ore Stability - these rigs effect the radius of the asteroid belt created when the moon chunk is exploded, making them easier and faster to mine. They also effect the stability of the ores, increasing the time until the chunk automatically explodes and increasing the time the asteroids take to decay.
Moon Ore Stability Rig M Tech 1 - Asteroid belt radius -20%, Time before self explode +20%, Asteroid decay time +50%
Moon Ore Stability Rig M Tech 2 - Asteroid belt radius -24%, Time before self explode +24%, Asteroid decay time +100%
Moon Drilling Proficiency - These large rigs combine the benefits of both Moon Drilling Efficiency rigs and Moon Ore Stability rigs
Moon Drilling Proficiency Rig L Tech 1 - Volume/time up by 2%, Asteroid belt radius -20%, Time before self explode +20%, Asteroid decay time +50%
Moon Drilling Proficiency Rig L Tech 2 - Volume/time up by 2.4%, Asteroid belt radius -24%, Time before self explode +24%, Asteroid decay time +100%
