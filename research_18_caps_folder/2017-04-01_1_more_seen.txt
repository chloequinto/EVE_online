BOOSTER PRODUCTION USING SODIUM CHLORIDE AND LACRIMIX
Both Sodium Chloride and Lacrimix will need to be used together during booster manufacturing to reap their benefits, however the rewards of including these in your manufacturing chain are second to none.
The Introduction of the Organic Mass Granulator will be accompanied by a new series of supercharged combat boosters, which will require these two new raw materials, and will give significant bonuses to various attributes when consumed.
These new boosters offer bonuses to similar attributes as their lesser counterparts, however the effects are significantly more intense*. Please see the list below for further information.
