THE NEW ANSWER
For all its popularity, however, Phong Reflection shows its age. One of the most visible wrinkles is its complete ignorance of energy conservation, a fundamental principle of physics. This means that under certain lighting conditions a resulting pixel is much brighter than it could actually be given the amount of energy that hits it. This prevents us from showing our assets realistically.
Subsequently, we need a new and better formula to determine accurate pixel color. It should account for energy conservation and be more complicated and more realistic than the Phong Reflection Model because GPU cycles are made to be spent on better results!
In fact, we can replace the single formula with a collection of different ones, all using the same data (material properties), but with different levels of exactness/simplification. We get to pick and choose. This new collection of rendering models is called “Physically Based Rendering” or PBR.
For implementation in New Eden, we chose Schlick’s approximation for the Fresnel factor, a distribution model from Trowbridge and Reitz (also known as GGX), and a Schlick-Smith based visibility function. All in all, a pretty standard PBR cocktail when it comes to non-organic objects. To give you an idea about the new complexity of our calculations, here is just the formula for the specular.
Here are some of the results (the new PBR ship is always the one closest to the camera):
