FAQ
We would like to address some common questions which have been asked over the course of developing the SKINS feature:
Q) Why is there a lack of Caldari and Minmatar SKIN options?
A) It will require a little more time in order to address the disparity between the Amarr and Gallente versus the Caldari and Minmatar ship SKIN lines. We are aware of it and are working towards a state of greater parity.
Q) Does the skin for a T1 ship also apply to any T2 variants?
A) Unless the SKIN item specifically mentions it affects multiple ships it will only affect the ship hulls stated on the item. Therefore a Rifter Nefantar SKIN (Permanent) item will only work on a Rifter, not a Jaguar or Wolf for instance.
Q) Will SKINs follow a character if it is traded to another account?
A) Yes. Like skills, SKINs will transfer when you purchase a character from the Character Bazaar.
Q) Will the SKINs I have active be exposed in the API?
A) Yes, we plan on making that information available from the API, however it will not be available on launch.
Q) Will the active SKIN on a ship be shown in Killmails?
A) On initial release we will not be recording the active SKIN for a ship when it is destroyed. However, we do realize the rich tradition of celebrating the loss of something shiny and it is on our list for further developments in the future.
Thank you for taking the not-insubstantial time to read this dev blog, and remember to fly safe! (Especially with those skinned ships!)
