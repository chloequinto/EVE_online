MODULES
While we’re talking about Force Auxiliaries, we though you might be interested in some of the new modules that we’ll be releasing with the Citadels Expansion:
Capital Ancillary Shield Booster and Armor Repairer
Replicating existing Small, Medium and Large Ancillary Shield Boosters & Armor Repairers. The Shield Boosters will require capital sized Cap Booster charges, while the Capital Ancillary Armor Repairer will still use Nanite Repair Paste. The armor versions of these modules will be limited to one per ship just like their smaller cousins.
Remote Ancillary Shield Booster and Armor Repairer
Limited to one per ship, we're introducing Small, Medium, Large and Capital versions. Like the local versions they require Cap Booster charges or Nanite Repair Paste to operate. These modules should add a new aspect of optimization gameplay to repair ships of all sizes.
Capital Emergency Hull Energizer
When activated, pushes the hull resists to 99% for 20 seconds. However, it burns out after cycling once. This module is a type of Damage Control, so you will have to decide if you want an Emergency Hull Energizer or standard Damage Control. 
Heavy Stasis Grapplers
You can find out more details about these here! Only fitable to battleships and capitals.
Capital Scriptable Armor & Shield Hardeners
Similar to Armor Hardeners and Shield Hardeners, but they can be scripted to provide either very weak protection from all damage types or high protection from a single damage type. These modules will allow capital pilots to react to incoming damage in a more customizable fashion than is possible with Reactive Armor Hardeners.
