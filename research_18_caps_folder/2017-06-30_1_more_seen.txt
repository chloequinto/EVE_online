WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO PHASE ONE?
Phase one of Project Discovery will be disabled during daily downtime on Tuesday, July 4th in order for CCP and MMOS to begin prepping the infrastructure for the release of phase two.
That means that if you still want to play phase one, this weekend is your last chance to do so!
Project Discovery will remain offline for one week during these preparations, before phase two is launched on July 11th with the deployment of the July release.
