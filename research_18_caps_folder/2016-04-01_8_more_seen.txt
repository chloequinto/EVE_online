OUR PROCESS
The first step for us was to fork all entries so that we could ensure we were looking at code submitted before the deadline. With all of the repositories forked and pushed to //github.com/eve-online-api-challenge it was easy for us to browse the code online and share it with everyone involved in judging. From there we went through and eliminated all entries that didn't conform to rules such as not including the MIT license and having been worked on before the contest started. Fortunately (or unfortunately if you are one of us who had go through all of the entries) this only removed a few entries from the list. From here we went through all of the entries and began the more serious judging which involved trying to get each entry running locally. After a first pass of judging we were able to sort all of the entries by a rough rank. This let us trim the list down to about 15 entries from which we began taking a more serious look at. Finally we sat down as a group and had a number of discussions about the handful of entries we thought were at the top until we had our top three entries in ranked order.
