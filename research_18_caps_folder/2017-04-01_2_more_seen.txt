Not only will the Organic Mass Granulator collect corpses. Once it’s full, it will also process the corpses it collects into useful raw materials.
The raw materials it will extract from the unfortunate biomass it collects are Sodium Chloride and Lacrimix, both of which are found in high concentrations throughout capsuleer corpses after a ship and pod loss.
Above – The results of processing a single unfortunate soul.
These raw materials can either be sold on the market for substantial profit, or used in the production of a new breed of combat boosters.
