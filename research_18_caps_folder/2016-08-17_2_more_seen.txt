'HIRE MORE GM'S!'
When talking about reply times with players we often get asked why we cannot simply hire more GMs when reply times get too high. EVE is a beautiful, vast and challenging game for players and GMs alike. It simply takes time to find the right GM for each position we want to fill. This is especially true for non-English language support. Its further complicated in that we would generally need a new employee to relocate to a barren, volcanic rock in the middle of the north Atlantic, or Iceland as its more commonly known. 
For other games a new GM may be fully trained after a few weeks, whereas with EVE it takes around six months to fully train a GM and expect them to operate with any degree of independence. This means that if the ticket queue suddenly spikes we can’t just hire a dozen more GMs to handle the load.  Hiring 100 extra GMs is just not viable – ultimately we are a business and we need to try to maintain a staffing level that provides the support we want to give you guys but is cost effective.
With that being said we have recently expanded our team both in Iceland and abroad. Indeed, at the time of writing this blog we expect to welcome a couple of new GMs to the team next week.
