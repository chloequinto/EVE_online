SO IT BEGINS, THE GREAT MARKET SPECULATION OF OUR TIME
Please remember all of those numbers and requirements are work in progress and subject to change before the release. Nevertheless, we wish you happy stockpiling and merry market manipulation hunger games. See you guys for our next blog, which will tackle structure hull fittings, bonuses, layout and why it’s usually better to upgrade to a larger sized structure if you have the means to do so.
Big shout-out to CCP Maximum Cats for graciously allowing us to use various Citadel concept arts for this blog.
