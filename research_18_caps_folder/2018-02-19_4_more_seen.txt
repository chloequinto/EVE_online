ATTACK BATTLECRUISERS:
We decided not to give medium MJDs to Attack Battlecruisers originally because at the time they were quite powerful kiters. These days they aren’t nearly as strong so we don’t think this restriction is needed any longer.
May now fit Medium Micro Jump Drive
Orthrus:
The Orthrus has been a small and medium scale powerhouse since its release and it’s time to bring it down a notch. With more pressure on the tank through reduced fitting room, slightly less speed and a bigger sig we hope it will feel less oppressive. It may take a few visits to get the Orthrus in the right place, but this should be a good start.
