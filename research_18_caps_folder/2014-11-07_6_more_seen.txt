THE GOALS
For the sake of clarity, I have prepared a list of the goals we set out to reach with the UI Modernization effort.
Roll out a complete new UI that will define the visual direction for EVE UI in the coming years
Less operating system, more Sci-Fi, and militaristic looking UI
Functionality and usability should feel modern and intuitive
Have the UI complement the beautiful New Eden view, instead of blocking it.
Better consistency between UI control look and feel.
Use colors in a sensible way.
Simpler, and more recognizable icons with a clear distinction between icons that represent items vs icons that represent UI controls and labels.
Now, let me explain a bit further.
