PERFORMANCE CHANGES
Tech III combined with "Brain in a box"(BiaB) have dramatically improved EVE Server performance, but by how much exactly? To give you some sense of scale here and how these changes are likely to affect your gameplay, here are a few graphs to show how load has changed:

This shows how the overall average CPU time per user by node type. Don't read too much into the numbers themselves, they are rather abstract and are there to provide a scale for reference. The average CPU time per user now is about 40% of what it was back before we launched BIAB. Following are subsets of this graph depending on gameplay around Empire Space, Wormholes, and Trading to take a few examples:

To read into the last one, you can see how much more responsive you can expect markets to be in Jita for example. The changes not only improve overall responsiveness but also make large fleet fights more viable.
Here is a very interesting graph showing CPU load and Time Dilation (TiDi) on the node that Hakonen was mapped to during the big fleet fight on Mar 2:

The system was not on a reinforced node, and it is in low security space, meaning that a lot of extra calculations are needed on the node for the crime watch system, i.e. keeping track of aggressors, standings, gate guns, etc. Time Dilation can't go below 10% and if it stays at 10% the task queues start filling up and players will experience things like modules not cycling, etc. eventually leading to node deaths. Looking at this graph we can see that TiDi went all the way down to 10% a few times, but the only periods of it staying there only span about 2x ~5 minutes. This means that those of you who did experience issues outside of dilated time, most likely did so during these periods. While TiDi stays above 10% it means the node is successfully processing the task queues with help from the time dilation and here we can see that rather than flat lining at 10%, it managed to stay between 10-20% during the peak of the battle.
