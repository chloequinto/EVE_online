NEW CAPABILITIES FOR PIRATE FACTION SHIPS
In Kronos, all the high end ships from Guristas, Angel Cartel, Blood Raiders, Serpentis and Sansha's Nation get their roles and bonuses updated and refined.
Serpentis ships will combine brutal hybrid damage with great speed and the strongest stasis webifiers in the game. Angel Cartel ships keep their extreme speed, combined with projectile mastery and enhanced warp drives. Sansha's Nation ships are receiving velocity bonuses from afterburners, making them just that much more deadly, especially their smaller ships. Blood Raiders will gain increased functionality for energy vampires as well as getting a bonus to webbing range on all ships. The Guristas will get reduced drone bays and bandwidth, but at the same time they will receive a large boost to the damage and hitpoints of drones, creating a unique fighting style.
