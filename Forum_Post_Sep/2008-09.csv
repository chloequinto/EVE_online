9/1/2008,"it's not enough just to boost the hp a bit, you're still likely to have our missiles pass through the sphere of influence of more than one or two carriers/ms's in a fleet engagement.if we're going to have a weapon-system that sucks _this_ much, at least buff it in other ways to make it balanced. like not being the 2nd worst dps, delayed, etc."
9/1/2008,"if dreads are supposed to be immune to electronic warfare (to include tracking disruptors), then citadel torpedoes should be invulnerable to being shot down as well. that would be balanced, the situation that we have right now is not.and the missiles launched before siege mode should hit for normal damaage. all citadel torps launched during siege cycle should do siege damage. that's fair.if possible, increasing the velocity by 50% and decreasing the flight time by 33% (same max range) would make the ship much less boring.but, i digress. people want to pop my non-siege mode citadels, fine. but i should do full damage with every torp that hits a ship of the appropriate size and slowness. unless you let tracking disruptors affect the turret based dreads, this is incredibly unbalanced."

9/1/2008,trading incurs risk and requires considerable player skill. missioning has/requires neither.

9/1/2008,"with the increased difficulty related to hi-sec suicide ganking which is about to come to fruition, i suppose that the isk farmers and rmt type people are extremely worried about their bottom-lines due to the reduced requirement for their service that this change may bring.i grieve for you."
9/1/2008,"i don't get your reversed psychology. the increased security is a great help for the rmt types. nerfing high sec missions would be a great setback for them, as it is one of their primary sources of income. what you are saying here, in essence, is that isk buyers are over represented amongst empire carebear types. if they don't lose ships, less people buy isk. i don't agree with you. i don't think they are over represented."
9/1/2008,"you completely missed the point.ask yourself this question. as easy as it supposedly is now to make risk free isk, why do isk farmers exist?now ask yourself this question.what would the effect of making isk much more difficult to get mean for the isk farmer's business."
9/1/2008,are you stab wounds in disguise or something?
9/1/2008,i can't believe that you are actually saying this. you are saying that we can't balance the game because many people would start cheating if we did. amazing.
9/1/2008,"ki an, do people cheat?"
9/1/2008,"beside the point. the real question is: should we accept that cheaters affect game balance? i'm talking about balance here, not exploit fixes and the like."

9/1/2008,how about answering the question then?
9/1/2008,should we be happy that cheaters effect game balance? no.do cheaters effect game balance? of course...
9/1/2008,"just to make sure i have understood you. ccp can't nerf lvl 4 high sec missions because if they did, the people running lvl 4 high sec missions would buy isk instead?you call that an argument?"
9/1/2008,"i'll go real slow.if the isk supply available to the majority of players is reduced, the overall effect that ""farmed isk"" has on the economy becomes greater due to the relative value of the isk, itself.such a situation increases the viability for out-of-game cash generation, leading to more pigs at the trought, so to speak.as in every mmo, there are those that have no issue with circumventing game mechanics in order to achieve their in-game goals. these players will actually gain a greater advantage, over those less unscrupulous, then they currently enjoy.of course, eventually the economy will self-correct and return the relative purchasing power of the average player back to where it currently stands, though leaving large 0.0 alliances in a significantly more powerful position, wealth distribution wise.so, in the end, your proposed changes will, at worst, harm the game and, at best, mean absolutely squat..."
9/1/2008,"now that's some quality bull**** right there. if you reduce the income of mission runners, you also reduce the income of isk farmers. less isk will be on the market. prices of isk will rise. if people want to buy isk, they will do so through the ccp sanctioned gtc system, as that will be cheaper. now, that takes care of your entire argument. let's focus on why you bring this up.it's apparent that you have run out of arguments for the status quo. your last hope lies with somehow pleading to honest players hate for isk farmers and rmt. it's something that you alone has dreamed up, and it is something that is so out of line with reality that i'm amazed you would bring it to the forums. you are presenting a non sequitur and you ground it on assumptions. now, you can continue this drivel, but you are only serving to further disrupt an important discussion."
9/1/2008,"wrong... in many ways. remember, necessity if the mother of...i can ignore the rest of your posting."
9/1/2008,"you just won't give this up, will you? it's obvious why, as i stated in my previous post, but it's getting kind of desperate tbh. why don't you, with your bull****ting skills, explain why you think lowering income in high sec will lead to an increase in illegal isk buying, bearing in mind that high sec missions is a major part of isk farming operations, and that gtc trading is becoming more prevalent than actual isk buying?"
9/1/2008,"man, you are a bit slow... what do hi-sec mission runners do with the isk that they earn?"
9/1/2008,most of them stockpile them. the pvp alts use them to fund pvp. the isk farmers sell them for rl money.
9/1/2008,good.now how does reducing the availability of hi-sec isk affect each of these groups?
9/1/2008,"stockpilers will stockpile less, and perhaps move to other places to aquire more isk, like low sec.pvp alts will definately join small alliances in low sec or 0.0. some will remain and settle for the lowered rewards.isk farmers will earn less and be forced to raise their prices. still don't see where you're getting with this."
9/1/2008,"stockpilers will stockpile less...(or do some other hi-sec actvity instead)...correct.pvp alts funding pvp will make less, thereby allowing for less pvp... ok.isk farmers will earn less... not on your life...they are, if we are discussing real isk farmers, already diversified and will simply move assets towards the more lucrative activity, which i don't really believe is hi-sec mission running, due to the time/effort required, anyway."
9/1/2008,"or low sec activity. not everyone is as risk adverse as you.no, they won't. pvp alts will find other venues to get rich. like joining up with a carebear alliance somewhere. or they will go to low sec. pvp will increase if this nerf goes through. low sec will be worth figthing over. pvp will also mean more, as the loss of an expensive ship will hurt. people will start flying t1 hulls again. thus, more pvp.then why haven't they done so already? no, nerfing missions will put a real damper on their isk making activities. that will make them having to raise their prices."
9/1/2008,i also realize that you still haven't manage to explain how isk farmers would actually benefit from this nerf.
9/1/2008,"this isn't about me. i already said what i make running l4 missions, about 5 to 6 million/hour. this is about those players that are making 20 or 30 million/hour, like has been claimed by your side over and over. if i go to low-sec, i risk a t1 ship...pvp alts allow a relatively quick way for low-sec players to gather some isk to fund their exploits, especially if the player is not that great at pvp. i guess they could be traders and/or miners, because according to you, all other isk generating activities should be conducted under fire. so why have a pvp alt that runs missions, use your main, since you won't need to go to hi-sec, anyway. wait, why aren't you doing that now?isk farmers are already diversified. hell, there are farmers renting space from 0.0 alliances farming hugh amounts of isk every day. reducing the hi-sec isk fountain will open even more opportunities for them..."
9/1/2008,"it's very much about you. you are the one who made a quite illogical argument. i asked you to back it up, and so far you haven't been able to.nice. why are you sharing this information? and this is a bad thing. low sec shouldn't be a wow-style battleground. people are supposed to live there, not just go there for 'fun'. eve used to be about corporate warfare and fighting over resources. pvp alts have other ways to achieve their income. they will just have to put themselves into a little bit of risk and competition to do so. just like everyone else.no, that's not what i say. i say all pve activities should be subject to competition. right now, missioning is the only pve activity that isn't.i run missions with both my alt and my main. my alt flies a raven, though, and he's got better social skills. plus, i like my slightly negative sec-status. makes me look more bad-ass. no, it will close down opportunities to aquire the isk. more people will shy away from illegal isk-buying as it gets more expensive (due to lessened supply from the farmers), and will instead buy gtcs from ccp. also, all isk-farmers aren't from a single company. they all do different things to get their isk. if one of those venues is closed, it doesn't mean that particular isk-farming company can just pick up and move all their isk-generating to 0.0.i think it's time you gave up this silly notion now. you can't back up your argument, and you're getting more desperate with each post you make. it's stupid, and it's illogical. give it up."
9/1/2008,"once again, you are wrong. you are mostly wrong because you assume that isk farmers make the majority of their isk from running l4's in hi-sec.you got bonus wrong from not soley calling for a nerf to hi-sec mission runners, but at the same time, you seem to discount the amount of farming that actually occurs in 0.0, as well as the most likely fact that, it is there, 0.0, where the true farmers make the vast majority of their isk.so now we have the scenario where, there is still a huge pile of isk being generated from 0.0 with the added benefit of a, now, isk starved population in hi-sec.you do the math...(if people run missions to generate isk to fund their gtc's, recoup pvp losses, and to support other in-game activities, can you guess what will happen when this source of income gets nerfed?)"
9/1/2008,"and once again, you are being completely illogical. no, i have never made that assumption. i know for a fact that part of the isk comes from lvl 4's in high sec, though. part of it. that means, if you remove that part, the price of isk will go up. that means less people will buy this isk, and instead use the completely legal way of buying and selling gtcs.the reason i discount it in this discussion is because it's irrelevant. we have no means to completely remove isk farming. what we can do is to reduce their means of income. however, this too is irrelevant, because that's not why we want this nerf. the reason we are having this discussion is because you claimed that nerfing lvl 4's in high sec would be good for farmers. i have shown you that you are wrong in this. you can either accept that, or you can continue to derail this debate.we already have a huge pile of isk being generated in 0.0. it's not going to go up because of this. instead, isk farmers will have less isk to seel because of this nerf. their prices will go up. i also still find it amusing that you accuse high sec dwellers of being potential isk buyers. do you think people would buy isk to fund their gtcs? wouldn't that be a bit counter productive? buy isk with rl money from an illegal seller to buy game time from someone with that isk who in turn bought the game time from ccp with rl cash? wouldn't it be better to give your rl money directly to ccp for game time? the fact is, your argument might work if there was no ccp sponsored gtc trade. with that trade in existence, your entire argument falls flat."
9/1/2008,"ok. how much time will it take the average hi-sec mission running gtc buyer, in game, to farm the necessary isk, if your suggestion is implemented?if farmers are already making the majority of their isk from activities other than the one you would like to see nerfed, how exactly does the change do anything but benefit them, when you are simply increasing their potential market?"
9/1/2008,"i don't know. what i do know is that they would not buy isk to affor gtcs. don't you see that it doesn't make sense? buying illegal isk for use in buying gametime from someone who bought the gametime from ccp? it's not logical. it's robbing peter to pay paul, or whatever the expression is.it seems you don't understand this either. if you lower the income of the isk farmers (which you do by nerfing high sec missions), the price of isk goes up. people stop buying isk from farmers, and if they are so inclined, instead buy isk through the gtc system. your argument doesn't make any sense. it's illogical. please, try to understand."
9/1/2008,"you can't balance the game based on cheaters and if that's the only argument then, well, i think ccp's course is clear. if people start buying more isk, then the gms will ramp up enforcement and start removing more isk. it will not reduce pvp...at least meaningful pvp. ""fly out into lowsec looking for random fight"" pvp would instead be replaced by ""fly around in lowsec and defend your valuable isk-gathering territory"" pvp, which is much, much better."
9/1/2008,"see this is where you have it wrong. who will defend their valuable areas?pirates? nope, they are mostly interested in blowing others up.carebears? nope, they will get blown up once and return to highsec. without their percieved ability to ""progress"" by losing their isk source or level 4s, many will quit.alliance pvp alts? nope, if they were interested in ""fighting for their valuable isk generating territories"" they would be running their mains in 0.0.basically those that are already in lowsec will benefit, everyone else will go do something different. lowsec will still be empty. the reason? if you lose a single ship a week you have lost more trying to run level 4s in lowsec as compared to running level 3s in highsec. at first people will move out there, but after losing a ship or two they will move back.it is simple math that the reason no one is in lowsec is because for running missions or mining you will lose ships and lose them often as a pve fitted ship will lose to a pvp fitted ship that has npcs backing it up every time. if you take all the precautions and align to station, jump when local changes, etc then you might as well be running level 1s in empire because you cannot make iskies while docked or cloaked in a safe spot.no amount of rewards or nerfs will force players into lowsec, you have to make it safer for the solo player or they won't move there. and like it or not, most empire corp players are essentially solo while chattering with their friends."
9/1/2008,"you do realise that low sec used to be populated when it was worth fighting over, right?also, how the hell do you think any alliances start anyway. they go from being a bunch of carebears or pvpers without a purpose and get togehter and cooperate. we're trying to make it worth doing this in low sec as a stepping stone to 0.0. not everyone in high sec is risk averse. they are there because you get the most isk/effot there, and among the best isk/h on top of that. if the profit is moved to low sec, they will go. not all of them, but some, and probably most. those of you who quit, take care and good luck in whatever game you try next. i hear age of conan is overrun with your type, so you could go there."
9/1/2008,"take a look at your calendar. lowsec emptied out not because high sec was suddenly more lucrative, lowsec emptied out shortly after revelations was released. what happened in revalations? probing. suddenty your deadspace missions and ss areas were not 99% safe. the ""risk"" factor went up dramatically, while rewards were raised slightly.that is why lowsec is empty; the risk vs reward is off in that part of the game. lowsec has never been a stepping stone to 0.0, regardless of what the player's guide might say. even when i started 2 years ago people would say go straight to 0.0 because lowsec wasn't worth it.if you want to make lowsec worth going to, that is great. nerfing high sec isn't the way; all it does is makes those same carebears (hint, you aren't talking people who like a struggle here) get restless and decide it isn't worth their time anymore. look at who you are claiming are running missions in high sec:1) carebears. guess what, there is not profit worth loss for these players. even if they were making a billion an hour if they lost a ship a week it is too much for some of them. if you can't guarantee the same isk/time ratio over a period of several months (ie, they make as much isk or more after ship losses) they simply won't go. and most of them won't go even if they do make more because they aren't interested in getting ganked.2) pvper's alts funding their pvp. excuse me? you seriously think these are even a little interested in risk when they are making isk to burn elsewhere? if they were they wouldn't have alts to begin with. these accounts would just get cancelled.3) 0.0 people making isk is safety. this one i can't understand when they can make as much or more in 0.0 than level 4s, except they don't have to watch over their shoulder all the time. these people wouldn't move to lowsec to do missions either, they would simply stay in 0.04) farmers. as previously mentioned, these people are heavily diversified and will just do something else.make this change and lowsec will not increase in population, it won't be more worthwhile simply because the hunters will always have too much of an advantage over the hunted. some small numbers might move, but the vast majority will do other activities.always with the ""you don't belong here if you don't play my way"". here is a little hint for you: you are requesting a radical change in the game that will effect all eve players in some way, and a large percentage of them dramatically. the burden of proving to ccp that your way is best is on you; it isn't our place to defend the status quo.telling ccp that those players aren't welcome isn't going to help your cause any, especially when you are seriously underestimating (imho) how many it will effect"
9/1/2008,"dumb carebears will get blown up and return to hisec. smart ones will organize, dodge and fight the pirates. i am of course aware that people would just run level 3s, which is why i am in favor of a blanket hisec mission nerf (full scaling rewards, bounties/loot included, by sec status) so that running 3s to make almost as much isk would not be an option.you wont lose ships while running a mission unless you're not paying attention. there are too many damn tools at your disposal to stop that from happening, and in my vast experiences with lowsec exploration (easier to probe down than in a mission) i have never been caught...even when flying in hisec/lowsec border systems that are usually brimming with pirates compared to the rest of it.i don't give a **** if people are too scared to move out there. i really don't care if one person moves out to lowsec (although a lot would). what i care about is that people who do go into lowsec are appropriately rewarded and people who sit in the safe, secure zones aren't making huge amounts of easy isk."
9/1/2008,this is what i've been saying all along. i don't think these people are getting it.
9/1/2008,"then advocate a method of rewards that doesn't screw over a large portion of the player base and you might actually have a chance of getting it. you aren't advocating making lowsec more valuable, you are advocting nerfing a huge portion of the game.i don't think these people are getting it"
9/1/2008,as mentioned already what happened to the plans for this?new graphics for different varieties of gates have already been completed.
9/1/2008,"a way other devs approached this was in the mmo shadowbanethe game was in a similar situation, and they created ""things"" to fight over and control that could be done with a pick-up gang of 5-10 players. for the sake of conversation, lets call these ""things"" key areaskey areas if controlled, gave money to the organization controlling it. key areas can be taken over by a small gang/fleet (5-10 non-cap ships)key areas could only switch hands for one hour at specified times. times were spread out to facilitate different time zones of prime time.key areas can be attacked within its hour window daily.key areas are displayed on the map to everyone and who controls them, and when their window of opportunity is......basically, this provided a few things. 1. provided something for people to fight for besides fortresses (pos's/bases)2. controlling a large number of them is a definate advantage3. a small organization can (and did) wrestle them from larger organizations.my 2 isk"

9/1/2008,"the lag brings a lot of frustration into any activity provided there are enough players in the system, fleet battles, trading etc. everything is affected, but the most important part is, that even tho besides fleet battles where response time is critical, the gaming experience is severely crippled.i wouldn t know how to improve this, it s not my job, i work in advertisement and pr, but i do know as a fact, that these factors count as 50% to 60% of how a person perceives service rendered, and that frustration+games (environment where you should be able to disconnect from the mundane) = discontinue usage, at least in my book.if you do polls upon service/subscription cancellation, you will probably notice that this is a major issue.edit: herschel, what do you propose? accepting it as a necessary evil? frankly dismissing a real issue and labeling it as a ""whine"" won t earn you any return on investment. whereas the experience being crippled ends up in a core brand misjudgement due to the fact that the good stuff eve has to offer pale in comparison to the fact that lag and frustration come hand in hand with the important parts that come with eve."

9/1/2008,"as they exist currently, implants seem to have a detrimental effect upon the game. for most people, who only use attribute increasing implants, these only act as another mandatory ""tier 3 learning skill"" (which most players and ccp despise). for those few w/ huge amounts of isk to burn on combat implants, these items constitute a huge new/old player divider. in both cases, implants strongly discourage pvp - particularly for those w/o easy access to jump clones via a 0.0 alliance.i'm open to any ideas on this subject, but do firmly believe that implants act as a severe deterrent to pvp in a game in which pvp is already extremely costly.[edit] adding ideas from the discussion into the main post for easier reading. these could either be added separately or as a whole to address the issue.1) make implants insurable. this would provide a moderate isk sink (like all insurance) and, instead of having multiple tiers of coverage (platinum, gold etc) there would likely only be one tier. the payout could be something like 80% of the value of the implants. that way, riding into pvp in an implanted clone would still cost something, but not be a total deterrent. faction/pirate implants would likely be insurable, but only in the way that t2 ships are insurable - for a fraction of their real value. this would prevent pirate implants becoming ""must-have"" items under this system.2) create a new skill that reduces the amount of time between clone jumps substantially. this would make choosing to enter pvp without implants less of a sp sink, while encouraging players to log on a bit more frequently (something ccp likes and is thus likely to implement).3) make jump clones more accessible to pilots in empire. while implants pose a substantial deterrent to 0.0 pilots - who can make considerably more isk/hr and can choose (via jump clones) not to risk their expensive implants - they practically require that empire pilots who depend on mining and mission running avoid pvp at all costs. the current jump clone mechanics also discourage empire pilots from joining corporations, since access to empire jump clones require high individual and corporate standing with an npc corporation."
9/1/2008,"two months and not one response?i had started another list but posting it would apparently do nothing.look, i don't mean to post off this stuff to be a **** - i'm not trying to out flaws or point a finger - ccp must understand that?i thought this sort of thing was the reason that ccp took to allowing a ""civilian"" board?i realize you guys are probably working on a whole re-write of the entire client, but you must recognize that this (the client) is your face to us - it is imperative you maintain and improve it (at least, in my opinion).best regards-raylon"

9/1/2008,i m vouching for it.
9/1/2008,"a much more comprehensive post on this topic was made a few months ago by chribba. it's not a bad idea, but it should probably be incorporated into his thread."
9/1/2008,"i m not for locking an account to an ip or anything of the sort. i m just saying that account safety can be perfectly preserved by using a device which basically generates 6 random numbers based on an algorithm with unique variables based on its serial number that is attached to a specific account and functions along with the password as a secondary means of identification, allowing you to use eve from anywhere provided you have your trusty token with you. banks use it, companies use it, why not eve? (and btw the example has been set in mmos due to the fact that blizzard implemented this into their mainstream product, world of warcraft)."

9/1/2008,"my idea is to add a mini-game to mining. you start mining and a window opens with a game, i suggest a match 3 game, the purpose of the game would benefit your cycle time.the game would have 5 levels of dificulty in which you have to work your way up and stay there. each level would decrease your cycle time by 10% so if you continued to do good in the game you could cut your cycle time in half. this would benefit people who where actively mining. the game would have to pause after a cycle, this would give you time to unload the cargo and your lasers would only run when the game is in progress.when you start mining your cycle time would be what it would normally be +gang bonuses. if your attain lvl 5 in the game when it pauses your cycle time with the bonuses is cut in half. i would also suggest negative effects if you do really really bad, this would be the case if time was going by and you do not make any matches or just randomly click around, indicating a macro. the overal goal of this would be make the miners who are at thier computer mining can make 3-4 times what a macro miner can, if marco miners want to keep playing with this system in play they will be reduced alot in thier profits.discuss..."
9/1/2008,"not a bad idea, in theory.in practice however, all this will achieve is to annoy human miners by placing an obstacle in their way.meanwhile, the macros, with their optical recognition software will both adapt quickly to your system and permanently gain a 50% reduction to their cycle time as their reaction time, as a machine is much faster than a humans so they'll be able to maintain the maximum level in your mini game really easily.-----there's also the possible disasterous effect it'll have on lowsec/0.0 miners who need to be at the keyboard anyway to make sure that they don't lose their ships to hostile players. placing this in their way would just be too distracting.so while i'm for ways of making mining more interesting, i don't believe your way is the solution."
9/1/2008,this seem like a pretty reasonable idehgasgdhfgf!this is a terrible idea and would only serve to make mining even less fun than it is now.
9/1/2008,slapped on mini-games are abominable game design. outright annoying legitimate miners for the sake of 'combating' macros is equally abominable game design and extremely short sighted (not to say blind and stupid).please keep posting your ideas in this forum and keep them out of the features and ideas forums as that one's already suffering from really bad ideas already. or just stop posting.
9/1/2008,minigames = fail.
9/1/2008,"please don't judge this rest of eve (or this forum) by reading the posts of people like this. your idea is certainly interesting and would be a potential way to solve the problem you mention. however, i think a more elegant solution - one which actually made mining itself more interesting, instead of adding-on an attention-stealing mini-game, would be better."
9/1/2008,"as long as they make items people would want, the risk/reward ratio should be self balancing. if the risk is too little for the reward, more people start doing fw missions, and the price the mission runners sell the items for drops.if the risk is too great, people move away from fw missions and the price rises. up until we don't have anyone left running them."
9/1/2008,"a possible alternative could be a discount in the militia lp store based on the decorations received.in practice a militia general would pay 50% (random number, it is only an example) of what a private would pay for the same item. but the discount would be operative only as long as he is a militia member.this way both capturing complex and doing missions would be rewarded. capturing complex would be needed to get the decorations, doing missions to get the lp."
9/1/2008,sounds like a good idea. in addition one might make those unique items illegal in to use for non fw pilots.
9/1/2008,a minmatar liberation force rifter would be sooo cool.

9/1/2008,"ummmm, you did look in the contract tab didn't you ? all the info is there."
9/1/2008,absolute support.although i remember reading somewhere that ccp was planning on upgrading the evemail system completely. let's hope they indeed will. soon.
9/1/2008,"please, don't take offense cheap, but what you are talking about is bounty hunting, not pirating. there is a difference. check out the recommendations to changes to that system:o)"
9/1/2008,"well, the bounty system is just optional.. for me it is about the lp system where pirates get points for killing other players within low-sec"
9/1/2008,"like all things in eve there will always be a debate on ""to shoot or not to shoot"" because honestly this is the only game where if someone is being rude or stupid you just shot their ass to shut them up.the whole thing on ninja looters and salvagers. yes i too have been a victim of this to the point where someone actually looted the mission objective then warped away trying to put a price tag on it. while others come in and clean out all my wrecks without looting them so i don't have kill rights.aggro should be given to people who ninja salvage but this in turn brings about a lot of problems where as people will dupe you into attacking them since they looted your wreck. then instead of ninja salvaging it will be given some fancy new name where the tactic is to get a mission runner to attack the ninja salvager where in turn his buddies will come in and kill the mission runner. yes everyone would love to be given to the choice to retaliate or not but it could cause a lot of problems down the line where people from different gangs or party accidentally looses a guy and he comes back only to be killed because people were scamming him.i personally think everyone should be given kill rights the freedom to choose if they want to pursue the ninja. the way things are now though is still manageable also. i think what they should do to fix this mess is to have med and large tractor beams. this way people who run l4 missions in battleships will at least have the chance to loot the wreck. ultimately people might not want to salvage but i would like to be able to loot my wreck before someone comes in to salvage it losing the loot in the wreck.ccp has been starting to worry me with a lot of changes that they have been making that look like them catering to noobs since they are getting better and better turnouts with every trail account. i don't want this issue to turn into something else to where this game will be just like wow, a noob society where the screaming masses of gamers who want to play things in easy mode win.addressing this issue is a problem, but i think if a fix should be made then it should be the tractor beams. have medium and large sizes that range from 45kms to 60kms for mediums and 70 to 100kms for larges. this way everyone can at least have a chance to loot the wreck before someone comes in to take it away from them. because almost all l4 battles happen with the ships at least 30 to 60kms away and for a bs to fly to all those wrecks is just too time consuming.they should also release more skill books for mission runners to where we gain an extra percentage extra for every kill that has a bounty. i know there is already a book that does that but at l5 it only gives you about 5 to 20k per kill. if its a percentage then you gain a lot for every bs kill and moderate extra for every frig kill. the extra money however is going to cause inflation which will cause prices for certain items to go up and sooner or later will have to be balanced out so that miners and other types of pilots have ways to make money and arent forced to do missions for money.all and all those are my 2 cents. medium and large tractor beams which doesn't change the game mechanics at all, could at least give mission runners a chance to loot the wreck.one more thing, if you are a ninja salvager. ask in local or in convo if you can loot the wrecks. i know a lot of people who really don't want to bother salvaging all that crap. you could find someone who will willingly tell you where they will do missions so that you can salvage and have a steady supply from reliable sources."
9/1/2008,"i commend you on a very well thought out and respectful post.some do ask, however, some do not. i personally don't, and wait and see how the mission runner reacts. there have been days where a runner has asked nicely for me to leave, and i have. other days, they've been less than polite, and i've made an example of them.it really all depends on the day."
9/1/2008,"i don't even know why people are even suggesting this......wait yes i do. its because they are ****ed that they aren't training as fast as everyone else because they don't want to put the time into training their learning skills so instead of having them do it they want everyone else to train just as fast as they do for fear of someone who started earlier getting further then they are. you all are just babies. everything in eve is a choice that you have to live with. why do you want to change a game that finally does what most of the hardcore community wanted?? we have a choice to do what we want. this isn't noobfest usa. eve isn't for the light hearted. yes we have our occassion noob here and their but do you really want this game to turn into another wow? where instead of people having intellectual debates like we are here, we end up with ""first"" ""noob"" ""flame war"" ""suck my ****"" all that dumb nonsense.learning skills are not a waste of time nor were they a bad idea. if ccp thinks that then i feel bad for them. like anything in this game if you want something you have to put the time into training it. **** you don't even have to train the long skills since you just do it at the end of your subscription and just come back when its done. i hope they don't change that either because i don't think i would play this game if i had to train something for 2months. if new players are complaining about it then they should just shut up. this game isn't for everyone and is especially not for the noobs that play wow, however for some reason you want to turn it into that. i have put the time into training my learning skills. if they are removed and everyone gets a base set of 5 then why? why should people be allowed to recieve something that most people had to train a couple of months for?you know what this is all probably about?you probably look at your skills wishing them to go faster, but then when you look at your learning skills, you don't want to train those ""just"" to make something go faster. so its not a sense of it being mandatory, its a sense of just because you want something to go faster you ""have to"" train your learning skills and you just don't want to do that, but when you look at the pilots around you who have put in the time and are bragging about how much their skill train time went down, you get jealous and angry that you didn't do it from the start and you think about all the time you lost since then just because you didnt spend those 8 days training something.there are those who decide to make a choice and then there are those who are indecisive. just because you feel regret that you couldn't make a choice doesn't mean you need to punish those who did."
9/1/2008,"i read over this and while the csm got a lot done, the issue overall is one of time. i don't think a meeting should be going on that long - not just for the comfort of csm members, but it got confusing with people leaving (though understandably) and who was voting, and a lot of the votes seemed rushed through, particularly when peoples votes would hinge on a particular point.so i'm starting to see the need for a csm-only forum. (and probably alternates too, given if they're going to be filling in and actually voting, they should probably have a chance to discuss things before hand as well) by csm-only, i don't mean privacy - i think transparency is important in discussions - but one in which only csm members post to discuss issues amongst themselves (visitors to the board are read-only). yes, we already have a discussion forum for the csm here, but that's between players and csm, not for the csm to discuss amongst themselves. (the problem being if they tried to discuss things amongst themselves here, players would jump in and then it wouldn't be discussing amongst themselves anymore) and yes, they can do that in the meetings, but then they end up being 5 hours long...rather than explanations and arguments in the meeting, that could have all been done and dusted on a forum. the advantage to a forum over a discussion meeting, is that anyone can swing by at their own convenience and in their own time zone - also that they can explore issues more fully. the disadvantages would be issues being explored a bit too much and egos/sniping going on (which seems to happen in all forums) so it would have to be professional and, if not ccp moderated/hosted then self moderated/hosted if possible.the link to a csm only forum if not ccp hosted/moderated could be posted as a sticky on jita speakers corner, so everyone could read what the csm's arguments /explanations to each other are. also there's the issues of the minutes/chatlog making sense, so when an issue is brought up and briefly described just so csm members remember what it is, a link could be put in either at the time or afterwards to the thread on the csm forum so people can read what the arguments between csm members for that issue was. (i don't think a link to the current eve-o csm forums is necessary, as players would have already had an opportunity to read all that, as well as the opportunity to post and make their own arguments/own votes there)so i wouldn't see it as 'adding an extra layer' of confusing bureaucracy, more like removing any explanation /argument from the meetings and having those elsewhere. nor is it replacing the discussion between csm and players, just that it's necessary to have discussion between csm members too.so i'd see the meetings going as:3. skills and balancing issues: for example the [ ] being changed to the [ ]. [thread link] vote yay or nayyaynaynayyayyay etc then onto 4. basically, less debating. there'd still be ! if people had problems - such as errors, but most of what they didn't understand or didn't agree with to the specific issue would have already been debated, and they'd then know what their vote is without all the ""i'll vote this, if you make this clear in the documents...""also there seem to be confusion on the documents - could those have been read before hand (posted on a csm only discussion forum!) or are they only published at the meetings? if the latter is true, it might save confusion to put a motd on irc saying:""for meeting 9 you should all have docs (filename) (filename) (filename)to hand for reference"" - then anyone who doesn't have those, knows from the outset that they don't, but should.apologies if i've misunderstood/misrepresented the process, i only follow things vaguely and it's what the meeting suggested to me.tl;dr - csm only-forum seems like a good idea in light of long meetings, and irc motd with the filenames for documents might be useful."
9/1/2008,"i don't know, but even tho the op wanted your view on the situation, i don't think it really matters. the issue is not going to find a solution based on jade's reasonings.but if you want my opinion leave it the way it is. who is to say what loot belongs to who in fleet battles? the guy with the most damage? the final blow? the little frig that tackled the guy so you could kill them in the first place?jade's view will be skewed anyway."
9/2/2008,sounds great! here's to hoping
9/2/2008,i like this idea
9/2/2008,"it would be interesting if colonies were needed instead of pos's for sovereignty.they could be used to ""produce"" people. ie:workers, marines, slaves, militants. the ""products"" could in turn be used to establish new colonies and disrupt or conquer foreign colonies.the ""inputs"" would have to be settlers, prospectors, livestock, tourists, ect. made available in empire."
9/2/2008,i support this generally...my only thoughts to add would be that with the dread needing split weapons it should be able to do maybe 5 or 10% more damage when fully trained to makeup for the extra time. also if possible i would like to hear how these ships were originally balanced when first designed and brought into the game as there ahs obviously been an error somewhere.
9/2/2008,since your limited by how many poses you can put up total per day per system i dont think this would enable pos spam

9/2/2008,"i propose that an option to vote against a suggestion posted on the assembly hall forum be added. this would enable the csm and players reading the forums to more easily assess the actual support for a particular suggestion. for instance, the post ""risk/reward of empire"" has 70 votes - a substantial number. but that is out of 396 posts.how many of those posts are discussion by a few individuals who are in favor? how many of the votes are the result of flame war? what percentage of posters believe that the ops idea has merit?give us a way to know at a glance - let us vote ""no."""

9/2/2008,"so you just finished 245 missions with the sansha (or serpintis, angel, ect..) and they're top agent has said to you ""wow, you're doing an amazing job working for us here, this is just the best darn work i've seen out of anyone!""so you feel all proud of yourself, but you're sick of running missions. so you go try some time at mining and sit down for a little quiet time.rats spawn of the same faction and just start ripping you a new one. ""wtf, i just did all your level4 missions, what have i done other than sit here to provoke you?!""---------what i propose.add a loyalty point store function of (whatever lp amount ccp deams worthy) to put your character on a ""watch list"" for npc patrols or something to that degree so that you will not be shot for a period of time (be it a day, week, or month based on lp requirements)also, if you are on their 'safelist' or 'watchlist' you can still be engaged by them under the conditions that only you engage them first.->frankly this should have been introduced the same time that pirate npc missions were made. but am i crazy? is this a good idea?this feature should also be disabled for those that have the lp to pull it off - but have negative standings."
9/2/2008,"this is something that needs a good fix, in empire space you will be shot when you have a negative standing towards a faction when you arrive in theyre space but when you don't you will be left alone.pirate factions should work the same way.neutral, negative standing - you will be shotpositive standing - you wont be shotits just odd that if you have a positive standing with a faction that you will still be shot."
9/2/2008,"i've never gone out of space controlled by one of the main 4 factions or concord so i had naively assumed that this was how all factions worked... it's such a basic premise of game design - if you're friendly with a faction, they don't try and kill you.frankly i am staggered at the news that you will get shot even with good standing... eve does have a standings system, and the pirate factions are represented ... so they should be used."

9/2/2008,"isn't that what happens in wars? the defender must either prevail by whatever means, maybe asking for help, or they must surrender. in this case, leave the corp, pay the ransom, whatever that might be. (fyi - i have been on both sides of this!)there is infrequenlty a good reason for starting a war, but they usually happen! i fail to see what point is trying to be made here.by the very statement above however, ank is in fact saying the corporations and alliances are bad because they encourage you to get attacked?rather than allowing game mechanics to control events, let the players. a new corp is a prime target, sure. however their ceo should have made plans for this, either with friendly other corps or have some isk to hire someone to help them out. without this, the ceo has failed and does not deserve that corp. when it splits, the players will go to another bigger corp... and... um... guess what! be safe with other players!the consequences are;you winyou loseyou surrenderthe corp splitsnow you are talking more sense!i personally believe that some of the csm are being narrow minded and on a single track, and this is to dumb things down and take the control from the player and put it into the game. frankly this worries me because it resembles governments controlling people by rules, regulations and redtape rather than using common sense.example: new roads on new housing estates in the uk are short and have many sharp right and turns. the reason? to stop boy racers driving at 90 miles an hour in a built up area. this is what the csm and ccp are moving towards. the real answer to the problem, is not to hit everyone with that ""punishment"" but to educate them better. in the case here, drivers to be made aware of what they are doing and face the consequences if they don't. the same applies to eve. rather than changing the road setup (read game mechanics), ccp and the csm need to educate and inform the players of what is expected along that road.the protection comes from oneself, and learning how to do it not from a set of strictures and rules that force actions upon you. this simply turns people into mindless robots following instructions.i have experienced all of this first hand, and i still play eve. i read once on the forum/website as my first day as a newbie a phrase that got me very far and made sure i was safe.... ""assume everyone wants to kill you""excercise caution, learn, educate yourself and learn how to look after yourself. do not rely on the ""system"" to protect you, because the moment you do that, you surrender yourself to that system and become a mindless robot to it.link to what i'd said in a previous topic that lead me here:"
9/2/2008,"no, she says that eve is bad because you can pvp. i guess her ""game developer"" job means she is making 2d flash games."
9/2/2008,"if the problem is an overpowered profession and the majority of the player base use it then there is no way to fix it without ""screwing them over"".and the only reason missioning is a huge portion of the game is because it's the perfect money maker.should we move crokite/bistot and the high-end 10/10 ded plexes to hisec? why not?"
9/2/2008,"believe it or not, a large percentage of those players like to run missions. same as some people like to mine ice (why? i can't comprehend why, i feel my soul shriveling even trying).*looks* nope, they aren't there now. hence for me to ask for them would be a major game-altering feat. i would be hard-pressed for even considering getting people or ccp to agree with this one. the status quo, and all that mentioned above.if we were discussing whether level 4s belonged in highsec before they were first implemented you might be able to pursuade me but it is way too late to take them out now. it would be like telling 0.0 players ""hey, we want to balance everything. no more sovereignty, no more caps and concord will be at every gate to make things safer and more player-friendly.""too much of what your average player does in eve revolves around missions and the results there of. you can't just take such a significant part of their daily eve lives out without huge consequences. it would cause more subscription losses than going to consensual pvp in high sec, i can pretty much guarantee, and is as radical of a move to those players it would effect.and yes, moving level 4s to lowsec is taking them away from the majority of highsec players because they will not go there to run missions. something the pvper types don't seem to understand. maybe try listening to some of the carebears for once and learning how they think?right now eve is a pretty good balance between pve and pvp players, leave it alone."
9/2/2008,"even so, kahega hits the point. you can't fix overpowered missions without screwing over the people who run those missions. sure, make them more fun. make them more dynamic. just make them pay a lot less. it's like the nano nerf. you can't nerf nanos without screwing over the people who fly nanos. i bet they really think it's fun to fly nanos, but that's beside the point.no. you make the pve/pvp distinction where no such distinction should be. pve should only be possible in a highly competitive environment. there should be no free rides."
9/2/2008,so you keep saying. ccp says otherwise.you still haven't convinced me why your idea would be good for eve as a game and ensure its survival.
9/2/2008,"i had a lengthy post written with arguments and such ...why bother ... screw the missions so i won't regret not continuing my subscription. it's the last thing still keeping me in game (but why would anybody bother, right?).i think the goons realy are successful with destroying the game for everybody else and some people even help them ..."
9/2/2008,level 1 = 1.0 & 0.9level 2 = 0.8 & 0.7level 3 = 0.6 & 0.5 level 4 = 0.4 & 0.3level 5 = 0.2 & 0.1 as the stations in 0.0 are mostly player ran giving them mission agents won't work well. i say this because they are not stable enough for consistent missioning. conquerable !
9/2/2008,"good luck w/ this ...ccp don't seem to care or have the ability to do anything about lag.plus they rather keep adding useless things to the game (like faction warfare, this ambulation crap they want to add, etc etc) that only add to the 'lag' issue. in order to gain more and more subscribers, which also adds to lag.so in other words, they are only worried about increasing thier income from this game and that's it!!!!imho- the only way we going to fix it is to put a dent in thier 'income' and then maybe, just maybe they will get thier heads out thier arse!!"
9/2/2008,walking in stations will a) hopefully be on dedicated servers and remove the stresses to the in space servers.b) keep the akfer's in major trade hubs in seperated servers while they are in station.c) prolly not set up at this time to be on seperate servers at this time and will only increase lag with virtual lap dances by manginas for isk
9/2/2008,"good pointsbut then if we all protested by not playing it kinda defeats the need to fix lag as there wouldn't be any pilots shooting each other and we wouldn't be posting here anymore. :)i really believe that changes could be made in the server that would improve things regarding lag within fleet battle systems when they occur. however, i do admit it would involve ccp investing heavily to fundamentally change the software and hardware running eve. at some point in the future we'll not see anymore huge battles because there will be a new 5th empire within eve controlling vast tracts of space or ccp will have so many subscribers walking in stations screwing around they'll be no more laggy pew pew in space.if eve ever breaks 500,000 subscribers and 50,000 online consistently ccp will be forced to do away with massive fleet battles all together or replace the server and software with something more dynamically scalable and much higher performance."
9/2/2008,"the disadvantages of shield tanking in pvp have been well known for as long as i have been in eve, and largely boil down to the fact that warp disruptors, scramblers, webbers and microwarpdrives - modules that are considered essential for pvp - take up midslots, which shield tankers need for their tank. in contrast, armor tankers, who use lowslots for their tanks, generally have free midslots to spare for these essential modules.to address part of this problem (in a balanced way) i propose a new module be created:prototype warp disruption generatorrange = 20kmwarp scramble strength = 2requires propulsion jamming ivcap usage = 5-10cap/s (balance point)fitting requirements = 2 pg, 60 cpu (balance point)possible objections:""won't this make caldari overpowered?""no. while this would certainly make caldari more viable in pvp, the fitting requirements and cap usage of this new module would make it difficult to use on most current caldari fits. a passive drake would have to give up 1-2 shield power relays in order to remain cap stable and either fit a cpu upgrade or give up a missile launcher to handle the additional cpu required to make the module work. ravens and other caldari ships with extra highslots would be similarly affected. many traditionally passive tanked ships may have to go for an active tank in order to fit this module effectively.furthermore, giving shield tanking ships a highslot tackle does not miraculously fix all their problems - mwds, webbers and cap boosters still compete for valuable midslots. a caldari pilot would either need to further sacrifice their tank to fit these modules, or would have to rely upon other ships to fill these roles.doesn't this change just boost caldari at the expense of everyone else?no. this boost would also aid minmatar shield tankers, and make any shield tank pvp ship more viable and enjoyable."
9/2/2008,"hi, i'm not sure you play eve-online so you may not have realised this. low slots, which are used for armour tank, are also used for damage mods.armour tankers choose between gank and tank. caldari choose between tackle and tank."
9/2/2008,"partially true. in reality however, most caldari tanks require both midslots and lowslots to be effective. (the lowslots are either used for shield power relays to increase passive tanking or for pdus/cap flux coils to make active shield tanking sustainable). so, it would be more accurate to say that caldari choose between tank, gank and tackle, while armor tankers choose between gank and tank (and get tackle basically for free).add to this equation that hybrids, projectiles and lasers have had their damage balanced so that they require fewer damage modules to get the same damage as missiles - the traditional caldari weapon and the disparity increases. as a test for whether the current situation is really balanced, ask yourself whether you would be happy if the situation were reversed and damage mods required midslots and tackle/mwd/cap boosters took up lowslots. i'm guessing that armor tanking pilots would consider this a nerf and would not be happy about it. to me, that is a fairly good indication that the tradeoff you just mentioned favors armor tankers to the exclusion of shield tankers.one last note - the high cpu requirements of the module i proposed would require a caldari pilot to sacrifice either a high or lowslot (i.e. give up a damage mod in order to fit a cpu upgrade or give up a missile launcher). that would seem to solve the problem of caldari getting to keep their high damage while fitting a tackle."
9/2/2008,"wrong. shield tanks can be passive. armour tanks cannot because they don't have natural regen. therefore they require cap which, because lows are used by damage mods / tank, are found in the mid slots in the form of cap rechargers. and as for missiles; you seem to forget that missiles don't have to worry about tracking or falloff, which i'd say makes up for the minimal damage loss."
9/2/2008,"to answer your first point - yes, shield tanks can be passive. however, an effective passive tank requires both mid and lowslots. essentially, a passive shield tank requires that you sacrifice both tackle and gank. this is fine for passive tanking your drake for missions (where neither gank or tackle are that neccesary), but is nearly worthless in pvp. the cap problem faced by active armor tankers is also faced by active shield tankers, with the notable difference that armor tankers can fit cap boosters without sacrificing tank while active shield tankers have to give up a valuable, tank-required midslot to do the same (not to mention that armor reppers require less cap for the same amount of repair).on your second point, you ""seem to forget"" that missiles take time to reach their target - allowing a target to warp away before being hit. this makes missiles worthless for sniping. furthermore, armor tanking ships can easily fit webbers and mwds - which negate the disadvantages of tracking substantially. missile users still have to deal with speed - which reduces damage per missile and in extreme cases makes a target impossible to hit (basically, mechanics that are similar to tracking penalties). also, gun users have access to tracking computers which increase both range and tracking - a module that missile don't have access to. essentially, if your missile range or speed is inadequate, you have to fit rigs or just be content to fire uselessly.finally, caldari ships generally cannot use the same size/quality of drones as their same-class counterparts, which again negates the caldari damage ""advantage.""again, i ask you to consider whether it would be a nerf on armor tanking if the tables were turned and tackle modules were moved to lowslots and damage mods to midslots. or, put it another way - would you rather have a drake or a brutix sitting with you on that gate? a megathron or a rokh? i think the answer is pretty obvious, and my time spent reading battleclinic killmails would seem to support the fact that shield tanking is less viable in pvp than armor tanking."
9/2/2008,"i agree that shield tanks are weaker than armor tank. i think this can be proved by looking at the % of players who use the various tank types. (please ccp, run data base querry and release real numbers.)i think the solution is to buff shield tanking some how, not to make armor and shield tank more alike. i think the best way is to:a) give shield 20% higher resists. example 15 armor, 5% thermal. this should be based on the most common damage types. i.e. if thermal is the most common damage type, add to the resists.b) my favorite, and xl shield extenders. multiple titans are a growing factor in 0.0 warfare. xl sheild extenders (i.e. double strength large) would free up extra tanking slot, therefore making shield tankers stronger.c) buff faction shield gear. many sheild items (such as gallente navy, rep fleet, etc) are not as good as t2 items. i would recommend boosting all faction sheild mods by 10%. i think the huge cost of these items would keep it in balance. boost only the main item.d) how about faction damage controls as an idea. this helps shield tankers more than armor tankers.there are many more possiblilities."

9/2/2008,"i know this is a big departure, but what if we moved all the belt rats to key areas. each system would have the same number of key areas as belts. these key areas would be like the faction warfare sites, except, instead of limiting types of ships, they would be limiting number of players. i think warfare without mwd would be fun at times. i would like to see some key areas be dead spaces."
9/2/2008,"this makes a lot of sense, but i would like to see only npc items auto supplied and i would like to see a cost premium of 15% added to the bill (shipping and handling).another option would be to use the all items includig ice products, but i would like to see the npc required to buy the product off the market."
9/2/2008,"i have to agree, ui customization is always good in an mmo, but i have to admit that this ui is a lot more flexible than most others, which is awesome.a lot of combat sounds in this game are just annoying, though... especially missile sounds while doing some missions. you just get pelted for 10 minutes with ultra loud fire crackers, it seems. more of a nuisance than weapon, don't you think?anyway, yes, more work can go into equalizing stuff, and other neat effects, even just based on camera distance. for instance, hearing some thumpy/ominous (low frequency crossover) effects would be cool, kind of like hearing a battle from far away. just being able to alter or tone down the missile sounds will make me very happy."

9/2/2008,a simple proposition: when a shield booster module (or armor/hull repairer) is activated it should turn itself off when there's nothing left to boost/repair and if your shield is full you won't be able to use shield booster module. this could be implemented as an option available when right-clicking the module in space.

9/2/2008,easier access to jcs/thread
9/2/2008,"outside of 0.0, pods are generally pretty safe, so i don't think removing them would be a wise choice.spamming warp as you start to hit deep structure tends to get you out 95% of the time (barring lag, poor luck, smartbombs etc)"
9/2/2008,"while increasing the availability of jump clones would help, the 24hr jc timer still impacts pvp availability. if i am in my implant clone and the a neutral/red comes into system, i have to decide whether the target is really worth jumping to my other clone 8 jumps away and taking a 24 hour skill training nerf. of course, each time i jump into my implanted clone, i am effectively locked out of pvp for 24 hours unless i want to risk my implants (thus negating the advantage of jcs in the first place).also, for a pilot in 0.0 the old ""click warp"" trick often doesn't work due to the prevalence of warp bubbles. pvping in 0.0 in a implanted clone is therefore even more dangerous than in lowsec (a danger which often, i think, leads to pilots foregoing pvp for fear of losing hundreds of millions worth of implants - the whole problem i am seeking to address).i am certainly not asking that implants be removed from the game - that would be overkill and probably very unlikely - but what about making standard, non-pirate implants insurable? that would remedy some of the ill effects of the implant system."
9/2/2008,"imo insurable implants would be counter-productive. because what would happen is that if the implants were insured for around what you bought them for, no one would ever worry about losing them, and people would end up losing them right and left. that means that once they get their insurance money and go to buy new implants, there's a huge demand which means implant prices go up. this is compounded by the fact that the insurance puts a price floor on implants. so in the end you might end up paying more for implants after this proposal than you do now."
9/2/2008,"suggestions then? it seems the prevailing opinion is ""implants are fine - yeah they discourage pvp, but that's too much trouble to fix.""is there a way to fix this? can i get some support saying its worth talking about? or am i the only person who thinks its worth debating?"

9/2/2008,"yesget a jumpclone, only fly what you can afford to loose"
9/2/2008,"implants are pretty cheap you don't need ""huge amounts of isk"" to use them. set up some jump clones, use a +4 for primary stat, +3 to secondary stat and you're risking less than 30m at a time.as for insurance.... no. just no. the last thing eve needs is another isk source."
9/2/2008,"despite the fact that you have apparently neglected to read what i previously posted, i'll respond.it seems that ""fly what you can afford to lose"" can become ""only pvp in a clone you can afford to lose."" serious pilots will want to insure that they increase their rate of sp gain to its max (+4 implants all the time if possible). thus, even with a unimplanted jc they have to sacrifice 24 hours of ideal skill training time to avoid risking their nice implants. furthermore, when they switch back to their implanted clone they have to wait an additional 24 hours until they can go back to their unimplanted clone and pvp safely. this leads to scenarios like what i encountered yesterday: a neutral comes into system. i have an onyx in the hanger and a friend in system with me. however, i'm in my implanted clone. should i bother to switch to an unimplanted clone and pursue the neutral? is one potential fight worth the 24 hours wait until i can get back to max skill training? or is this guy just in a damn shuttle or cov ops ship hopping from system to system? having implants just adds another level of decision making to the ""should i pvp or not"" thought process. we already have to contend with ""what is this guy flying,"" ""does he have friends,"" ""is this a trap,"" ""is pvp likely enough that i'm willing to take a break from ratting, mining, etc. to chase after it"" and so on. it seems to me that the last thing eve needs is another barrier (in terms of either time or financial risk) to pvp participation. thinking more about the issue, two ideas occur to me (although i believe supporting this post would only require that you agree that changing the implant system is worth mentioning to ccp). 1) make implants insurable. this would provide a moderate isk sink (like all insurance) and, instead of having multiple tiers of coverage (platinum, gold etc) there would likely only be one tier. the payout could be something like 80% of the value of the implants. that way, riding into pvp in an implanted clone would still cost something, but not be a total deterrent. faction/pirate implants would likely be insurable, but only in the way that t2 ships are insurable - for a fraction of their real value. this would prevent pirate implants becoming ""must-have"" items under this system.2) reduce the time delay between clone jumps substantially. perhaps down to 1-6 hours. this would make choosing to enter pvp without implants less of a sp sink, while encouraging players to log on a bit more frequently (something ccp likes and is thus more likely to implement."
9/2/2008,new skill advanced jump clone (name up for grabs)-20% timer for j cloning per lv
9/2/2008,"see, now that's a brilliant suggestion! maybe it could require jump clone iv. though a -20% per level might be too much (at level 5 there would be no timer, which would likely be too big of a database hog). perhaps a -15% reduction or a 4 hour time reduction per level..."
9/2/2008,"lets examine this claim about cost. assuming that someone just keeps a set of 4 +3's in their implanted clone (no charisma implant), that's a potential loss of about 45mil isk. in 0.0, i've found that i average about 18 isk/hr ratting in my raven. thus, it would require about 2.5 hours of ratting simply to replace those implants. while that isn't a ""huge amount of isk,"" two and a half hours is a fair amount of time - enough that the thought of replacing those implants definitely gives me an incentive not to pvp casually. add into that consideration that the cost of replacing a rigged bc is about 70mil isk and you are talking about a loss of 115mil isk per podding, or about 6.5 hours worth of ratting to replace both ship and pod (not including the time it takes hopping systems to collect implants and modules). that is a substantial amount of real life time that i have to risk every time i pvp. the amount of real life time lost increases if a player has +4s (as most serious players do), faction implants, or doesn't have access to 0.0 and must either mine or run missions for a living.in all, implants do pose a considerable barrier to pvp. while there are ways to minimize the risks associated with owning implants, it seems that the implant system encourages carebearing over combat. i'd like to see battles become more frequent, and people feel free to take greater risks in pvp. maybe then we'd see a change in the ""80% of players stay in highsec"" statistics."
9/2/2008,"this is enough to keep casual players out of pvp.30m might not seem like much to a vet player or someone who puts in hours per day.. but for someone who can only run 1 or 2 missions per week, a loss of +4 implants can put a good month-long dent in play time."
9/2/2008,"ok, now for my own suggestion.much talk goes into a 'balanced' suggestion.. easier jumpclones, insurance, smaller jumpclone window, etc.all these really do is decrease the barrier, they do not remove it.so my suggestion? any one of the following:(1)split 'combat' and 'learning' implants into something handled differently by the codebase. learning implants are simply not lost when you are podkilled.(2) learning implants are removable - take them out and leave them in your hanger.(3) zero jumpclone time.any of these make it easier for even new or poor players to jump into pvp at a moment's notice without having to worry about slowing down their skilling (which, especially for young or moderate players is a big deal since skills are the gateway to what content you can access)."
9/2/2008,"i'd be fine with any of those suggestions. my only concern is that the ""hardcore"" playerbase (not to mention ccp) would be unwilling to support such sweeping changes.perhaps this problem should be discussed in a larger context - namely that pvp, the lifeblood of this game, is too hard to get into. implants are part of that problem, but only a part.oh, and i'd love it if your suggestions came with a ""support,"" since you seem to also think that the current system is in need of revision =)"
9/2/2008,"i would be happy to see all implants done away with and combat boosters too, then at least every player in the game would be equal as far as combat goes with the only differences being upon the skills trained and fittings choosen, not the ability to spend billions on pirate sets, to boot ones speed, armour, dps whatever. would probably be no need for the nano nerf either if the speed boosting implants did not exist. gang bonuses are another item which disadvantages some pilots."

9/2/2008,i'd think i'd borrow everybody's cpu and put a cov-ops cloak on a titan
9/2/2008,"personally, i think the covops cloak is flawed anyways. it doesn't need a huge cpu, to go along with the other ships having a buff to counter. the covops cloak should simply say ""can only be mounted on covops craft"".however, that is at least taking my idea into consideration. if a titan wants to fit something big and nifty, then it needs a sufficient fleet beneath it to supply the resources. it would keep fleets from deploying a dozen titans and little else, since each one would be practically useless without all the bells and whistles they like to have. without a supporting fleet, the titan could barely keep their repper online while everything else would be offline until the fight.another point of this approach, is the detrimental effect of losing your fleetmates. as ships go down during the battle, the capitals would lose the resources being provided by that ship. lose too much, and your gear starts going offline, starting with the heaviest items first (doomsday, drone control, etc.) until the capitals are forced to withdraw. then the battle could continue with the smaller craft, without the looming threat of dd annihilation overhead."

9/3/2008,"i'm not entirely sure what you are referring to as ""overpowered."" the module i proposed perhaps? i essentially based it on the warp disruptor - giving it the same same range (less if you include t2 warp disruptors), roughly double the cpu, pg and cap use requirements and an additional scramble point to offset the huge costs of fitting it. i doubt anyone, except a shield tanker, would prefer this thing over the existing t1 warp disruptor. i can't imagine how this thing would be ""overpowered.""to repeat my position in stronger words - t1 caldari ships and other shield tankers suck at pvp in a way that no other race does. period. i doubt that is even debatable. while caldari do have several good t2 niche ships (recons, sbs, hictors, interceptors etc) their ""meat and potatoes"" ships - bss, bcs, cruisers and hacs are grossly inferior to other ships of the same class in pvp, primarily because their tank requires that they forego many of the modules that are so essential for pvp. to list just a few:cap boosterssensor boosterswarp disruptors/scramblersmicrowarpdrivesafterburnerstracking computers (rokh/eagle/ferox/moa)stasis webbifiersremote sensor dampenerstracking disruptorsecma shield tanker who wants to put up any significant defense will likely only be able to fit one of these midslot modules.in contrast, here's what an armor tanker might have to ""give up"" to fit their tank:damage modulescap power relays/cap flux coilsreactor control/power diagnostic unitsbackup sensor arraysoh, and passive shield tankers would have to give up this same list of modules. just for added nerfing.shield tanking and armor tanking aren't even close to even in pvp. this proposal wouldn't make shield tanking more powerful than armor tanking - in fact, it would still be a far cry from making them ""even."" it would help a little though. maybe enough that pvp drakes, ravens and rokhs would be able to fit both a mwd and tackle, or webber and tackle. maybe enough that they would cease to be punch-lines.if that seems ""overpowered"" to you, we must be playing different games."
9/3/2008,"caldari is fine and does not need fixing. we do not need highslot tackle, and it would not be good for the game.edit:you mention ""pvp"", ""passive drake"" and ""shield power relays"" in the same sentence. i don't think that you really know what you're talking about... second edit. i've read the rest of your comments. oh dear."
9/3/2008,"this is kinda my point - the thought of flying a passive drake in pvp is ludicrous. a joke. this despite the fact that a passive drake can simultaneously put out 500-600 effective hp recharge and still deal 450dps. by the numbers, one would think this is a great ship for combat! unfortunately, the very thing this ship is designed to do (passive shield tank) requires that it be totally gimped in pvp."
9/3/2008,brick drakes are also slow and have huge signature radius for even easier targetting. i couldn't tell you the numbers but shots against drakes are typically higher quality because they have to dedicate almost every slot to their tank and then a nos or neut still turns off their hardeners and destroys them.cereberus aren't bad snipers even with the missile issues however i am not sure how well any caldari ships can do close range. part of it is the bonuses are typically range bonuses more than damage bonuses like gallente but the other part is the lack of survivability or usefullness up close becuase of the choices you mentioned. i could support this or something like the other poster said.
9/3/2008,"i don't understand. you mention pvp, but describe mission fits."
9/3/2008,it's not the lack of a scrambler - somebody else can tackle. it's the lack of a mwd that makes them terrible.
9/3/2008,"my point is that shield tanks - and particularly passive shield tanks - are only useful for mission running, and all caldari ships are designed to active or passive shield tank. i think that shield tanks, including passive shield tanks - should be useful in pvp - and i think they would be if they didn't keep you from fitting any useful pvp mods.i would also agree with that poster that said that mwds are more the problem than tackle. that may be, but i suspect that the speed changes coming down the pipe will help even the field in that regard.my first time enjoying pvp in a caldari ship was when i got my onyx. the gank and tank on it was decent - much less than i could get on a drake - but having that highslot tackle made the thing a decent gatecamper. now, obviously i don't want drakes running around with hictor tackles, but it got me thinking that caldari ships could find a role in pvp if they had access to tackle."
9/3/2008,the grass isn't always greener on the other side.
9/3/2008,"no, this is all wrong. ask for some advice about pvp fittings. the best pvp tanks are neither active nor passive, they're buffer tanks, and they work just as well for shields as they do for armour - the lesser ehp boost from lses, relative to 1600 plates, is countered by inv fields being superior to eanms and the small regen you get on shield buffer tanks.the drake in particular is a formidable pvp bc. it fits a solid buffer tank, with decent dps and mwd and full tackle - the onyx is just a hic."
9/3/2008,"yes, i've fitted a drake that way and it does work quite well for many application. there are, however, times when a repping fit would be much better - and in that regard, shield tanking falls on the wayside."
9/3/2008,"caldari ships suck when players fit them wrong. that is not news. mission fits do not work in pvp, period. cap flux coils and pdus? fact: caldari lowslots are used for damage mods, three minimum and a damage control ii.you rely on buffer rather then tank to carry you through. caldari ships do this well. if you want to active tank, then you use a cap booster just like every other sane person in pvp does.there are no times when a repping fit is better then a gank + buffer fit outside of a 1v1 (or niche applications such as sitting perma-agressed on a gate) and assuming a tank-bonused ship.in even a two-man gang, any repping fit is just a total waste.fact is, highslot scramblers would be amazingly overpowered. take a drake. currently it will generally kill any other bc. add a highslot scrambler, and even a slaved pimped mad gank bc has no chance whatsoever (and you can't tank a drake's damage output). can you say 'overpowered'?hell, take a raven. a buffer tanked raven will most likely (read: certainly at equal skills) kill a megathron if the fight starts in megathron's optimal range if you fit raven with web + point. the only way mega can win is by spending 700m on implants so it can match the effective hp. give the raven another free midslot, and what is the reason to fly a mega ever? seriously now."
9/3/2008,"congrats, what you've basically described here are static complexes, which used to exist in 0.0 and were removed due to a) various exploits with the complexes b) the inclusion of exploration complexes as a replacement.the issues with 0.0 sovereignty are much deeper than what you propose. many solutions for the sovereignty and 0.0 warfare issue have been discussed endlessly for a few years now outside of this thread."
9/3/2008,"pos warfare is te failpants atm.fix plz.make it more small scale, not by only x ships in x spotbut by making it more important to do several tasks with smaller gangs at once rather that blob-fest on a pos style.also isk from i dunno concord (?) for patrolling systems (to *cough* stop rats *cough* without needing to rat lol) would encourage constant roams, earn while u pvp! brilliant"

9/3/2008,"i know i'm late to the game but i just got a ship that could fit a clone bay, the rorqual. in my excitement i started a deep mining operation and jumped some miners out to my nice new rorqual.only to discover that you're basically screwed now that you're out there because you can't use the jump bay to go back! what is the point of a clone bay that is one way only?also why do you charge me 100k isk to install and i get none of it? it's my clone bay, if there's a fee for using it, i should get that.clone bay needs to act just like a station, i should be able to leave from there just like when i leave a station and leave my implanted clone behind.that or let me dock pods so i can jump them home."

9/3/2008,"right now your hangar is just a huge pile of junk you have to sort through. often it gets really cluttered with stuff you don't use, so you have to keep rummaging through all the useless items to get to the ones you need.it would be much better if you could have several different hangar divisions so you could tell where everything is without having to scroll past 700 pieces of junk."
9/3/2008,that's a great idea strill! what an original and creative suggestion!
9/3/2008,"great idea, more useful than the wallet imo."
9/3/2008,"um have you ever heard of station containers/vaults/wherahouses?these are baicly huge boxes of a million cubic meaters and above that you can use for the purpuses of filling moduals and packaged ships very usefull and they are seeded at all stations baring outposts.i'm not saying this dosent have any merit, it does would make my life slightly easyer but there is already an alternitive that works pretty well."
9/3/2008,"those have pretty big disadvantages, like you can't see what's in them unless you're docked at the station they're at, and you can't sell their contents unless you empty them."
9/3/2008,"the solution here is an upgrade to station container functionality. make them accessible remotely(intentional access only, for lag reasons), make them able to store space-expanding containers, and make them able to store unpackaged ships. also, make a non-secure variety."
9/3/2008,"awww...i think it would help to get divisions, station containers etc are great, but if you move home, you have to have them left about for 3 weeks till you can repackage them (if i recall correctly?)"
9/3/2008,oh yeah...*thumbs*
9/3/2008,"yes, i've never been successful in filling a station container (which can be purchased at any station i think) but if this was created, it would need to have a power-off switch. if i only want one bay - i'll only ask for one. seems like another window to get stuck to something and have to pull apart - then re-apply glue, and all that there junk."
9/3/2008,"bad idea simply due to the fact that is there is a mechanism for this, you can bet ccp will add a bug (oops, 'feature') to enable it at bad times.you can always set autorepeat off and hit it when you need it for 1 cycle."
9/3/2008,"yet, if it's optional then this problem is solved. i'm not suggesting that this would be even the default option, so if you play the game without changing this setting, you won't have any problems since everything would be just like it is now.setting autorepeat off is not very usefull when doing missions. having to deal with multiple targets i usualy forget to deactivate the shield booster and my cap runs dry (since i'm an active shield tanker). this is just one of the reasons why i suggested this change."
9/3/2008,"not supported as sometimes its a good idea to turn the booster on early if one wants to tank alpha sure boosters arent for alpha tank, but meh, least theres an option there if hp tanks get nerfed,leave as is tks"
9/3/2008,not supported. i like being able to keep my reppers on all the time without having to worry about them turning off.
9/3/2008,"i wouldn't use this option for pve, although i might for pvp, but it should be there. although if you wanted to make the option really useful, make it leave autorepeat on and just skip cycles. that might make it a little too easy, though."
9/3/2008,"torn on this. true, autorepeat handles most of this feature, but there is one area that it might be of benefit: high lag engagements, where normally running an active tank is just another way of draining your cap to zero.if the feature can work reliably in high-lag situations (like drones) then supported. otherwise, this is superfluous."
9/3/2008,no.it makes pve and pvp in eve even more boring..let us be aware of whole situation while taking punishment..
9/3/2008,support for lag fests. coming back to no cap is annoying when i haven't been able to turn anything on/off for 2 minutes.
9/3/2008,"think his point is that people do exactly that - they stay out of 0.0 and fit lesser implants. this results in a larger and larger disparity between casual and hardcore players which most of us, i think, would agree is bad for the game in the long run. ccp has repeatedly said that they want more players out in 0.0 and lowsec. i think that implants, along with other systems, prevent that from happening and a few changes would go a long way to easing the transition without dumbing down the game.24 hours jc cooldowns don't make the game more interesting or challenging. its an arbitrary number which simply serves to make life more irritating and discourage pvp participation."
9/3/2008,"for pretty much any change there will be people complaining and lamenting the 'end of eve as we know it!' and 'wow in space!!'... but ultimatly if ccp did something along these lines i think people would end up happier long term as more casual players enter pvp and sp gains level out between carebares and other groups. and of course you still have to decide between high grade learning implants and those 'low leanring bonus + bonus to combat implants' versions, so there would still be a trade off in implants."
9/3/2008,"this.currently, jcs are a tool for the total carebear, with 8.0 standings requirement.also, the 24 hour delay could be lessened.there's little reason to lose implants in low-sec; basically, smartbombs and getting horribly horribly lagged out."
9/3/2008,"excactly,unless they *dmg by 4 and make racial (effectively no change in total dps), then no support"
9/3/2008,"no, they don't.forcing people to just blob more (and fight less actual fights) at gates is bad. sentries are fine, really. they raise the bar for camping to a bc (for limited sentry action) or a tanked t2 cruiser, so you don't get all the annoying insta-locking interceptors and such.nerfing pirates trying to fight under sentries even more is just a bad thing. sentries are already a significant advantage on the side of fw / anti-pirate gangs which insist on fighting us at gates. they remove a solid part of our dps via drone killing and contribute to the overall damage in addition to preventing us from using faster, lighter ships which we occasionally need.if you think that increased sentry damage would make people stop gatecamping, it won't. it'll stop the easy to avoid 1-2 man gatecamp*, and it will nerf actual interesting fights under sentries where we already have a disadvantage, since we do get sentry aggro if we remote rep each other or shoot someone who has agressed our gang mates (which is really stupid).what you people seem to want is for haulers to be unmolested. the whole point of gatecamping is killing people in transit. nobody is going to stick 500m of stuff in a t1 ship costing 1 mil and go afk sit in a belt. they will occasionally stick 500m of stuff in a t1 ship costing 1 mil and autopilot while in transit however. catching and killing these people is the point of gatecamps.travel must be interdictable.*btw, someone solo camping - what are you whining about? yes, ship tanks have increased. so did ship dps of people you attempt to fight, and so did hp of people you attempt to fight too. i would laugh at the gatecamper trying to fight a ship of equal size under sentries. yeah, sure, you can get a drake to tank 1000 dps and have a point if you sink 80million into it. my hurricane delivers about 800 dps + 352 dps from sentries, want to know how much time it takes for the 80 mil sentry tanking drake to go splat?a lone gatecamper in a bc is after killing industrial ships and t1 cruisers piloted by absolute nubbins. attacking a properly fitted t1 cruiser while tanking sentries in a bc is very risky, much less trying to pick a real fight."
9/3/2008,"it'll promote more ss / dock tactics by gatecampers to avoid fights (which are already very annoying under sentries), but will not deter us from gatecamping and ganking 5:1.so it achieves precisely the opposite of what you want."
9/3/2008,"maybe it is time to re-examine gate guns in general, possibly even getting rid of them all together (or at least make them destructible). they are pretty useless at this point. anything big enough to tank them will wipe out a t1 indy, and anything small that might have been an interesting fight gets popped in no time. they also discourage young pirates, leaving camps to the people who have the sp/isk for battleships (which, granted, is no longer a big deal)"
9/3/2008,"the issue is that removing gate guns would make low-sec more dangerous for legitimate low-sec dwellers the same way fw (and the associated gangs of small, fast and fast locking ships) has made low-sec more dangerous for pirates (personally i used to roam in bigger ships without too many worries, except running into a really big and really organized gatecamp, those days are gone).it'd effectively mean that even frigates/etc would get caught and killed, and cloakers would have a much much harder time given a ceptor can mwd and decloak it in mere second. cruisers would literally stand no chance, and nano-ships would get much more common in hands of pirates*.all that is really a bad thing. i like low-sec for what it is (well, fw killed a part of it, but oh well): a place where you have good reasons to fly bigger ships, and where someone in a frigate (or interceptor or agile af) can roam far and free without too many worries (sans smartbombs). i'd like to keep that place.*which would increase the sp required to compete - it's reasonably easy to get in a bc, and much harder to get in a hac."
9/3/2008,"i don't know if this has been brought up already but this has been an issue for as long as i can remember and i know a lot of people who turned off the sound completely because of this. ccp really does need to put something like a ""game sounds"" slider in the audio tab, like it does for music, aura's voice, ui sounds, etc. lots of people like having ui sounds and background music, but find sounds such as cloaking or jumping gates very annoying, and sounds like autocannons firing to interfere with voice comms during battle."
9/3/2008,"i agree, this is needed and i would use it if it were available. i currently have sound off while i play."
9/3/2008,"eve has sound? seriously, though, the whole system needs an overhaul, badly."
9/3/2008,you can really advertise something by having a different colour ship.keyloggers how exactly? this isn't a mod...
9/3/2008,lag would be no worse than loading char avatars or personalised names on ships imo
9/3/2008,"if ccp make it non-server-side, so that only you see your ship as ""individual""-flashback! boom!- life of brian: ""were all individuals!"" ""im not!"" -/end flashback boom!-hmm,yes well client side adjustment wld make u feel cool that ur flying ur own custom ship, but no lag is created"
9/3/2008,"lets take this from a player and game stand point. for the longest time from the point eve was created. the game was mostly advertised by word of mouth. when such mouth would describe eve, it would describe it as a vast world with limitless possibilities but cold and dark repercussions for the unaware. what made, and what currently makes this game is the fact that it is player ran and player based. pvp as you so describe as a ""versus"" between players is an ignorant remark to video games in general. this game strives on the fact that its a cold world and that people have equal opportunity. if you were the victim of a gate camp well then that is your fault. who told you to go into low sec without a scout? if you got hit in high sec well again that's your fault for not paying attention to what your doing. i once lost over 200m to 300m worth of mods and implants because i was carelessly transporting to jita. i thought that if i autopiloted there i would be safe by the time i returned from whatever i was doing. (in the age before warp to 0, when bookmarks were a lucrative business). i was horribly mistaken. when i get back i'm in my pod and my ship was destroyed. almost everything blew up in the explosion, so the suicide was worth nothing. however, when i realized what happen i was more angry with myself because i knew better. i knew what people were capable of and i knew what i was transporting was valuable enough to suicide run for.people who do it just to make someone cry, people who do it as a business. these are the game mechanics and i hope it doesn't change. i don't want this game turning into another wow. a game where people complain because they don't want to make a choice with the options they were given.the market would also fall if we took out the pvp or gave people the option to fly where they wanted without consequence. how you ask? where do you think the stuff from the market comes from? how does everything get built? for what purpose do people put out sell orders and buy orders? its because we need it. its supply and demand. if someone blows up your ship, well hell your going to need another one. not only will you need a new ship but new mods. how about something to replace those implants you lost? everything that is sold, (except for certain skill books bought at rookie stations) is sold by the player, everything that is built is built by the player. pvp fuels the market for supply and demand. if things weren't lost then there would be no demand. if there's no demand then there's no supply. ultimately killing this game since the only possible way to make isk is to rat. if we end up having to rat for isk then again this turns into another wow where people have to kill npc's to turn a profit. wow doesn't have people completely committed to supplying the auction house with stuff, no people just put **** in there hoping it will sell not knowing anything. not only that you have to grind and grind to get stronger just to farm. not to mention have the stuff in that game is lost through the raw materials it takes to make some of those items. you can reprocess toilet paper in eve to make raw mats. eve has a dedicated player base for mining, researching, and building. eve gave these players a choice to do what all that by giving other players the choice to give them a reason to do all that. if you don't want to be caught up in the mess that is pirating then you better take the necessary precautions because guess what.....eve gave you the choice to be able to do that, if you don't want to then live with the consequences of being spanked around.with this my rant is over. so basically please before posting look at things objectively and intelligently before you go ranting off just because someone popped your balloon. this game was made to be cold.*ps - sorry if my grammar or spelling is off. i just recently lost a finger to a work related injury so i'm still getting used to typing."

9/4/2008,"i dont know much abut pos management and logistics, so i cannot comment on that.no matter what the changes will be, two things will be crucial. -it must be viable to attack sov without sending in numbers so large, that the server can't handle it.-therefor it must be viable to defend sov without sending in numbers so large, that the server can't handle it.right now mechanics don't actually allow that. if the attacker sends in small numbers he will get blobbed. so he brings the blobb on his own to make sure he's gonna win. the current system with the cynojammers is encouraging bobbing very much. to attack sov the cynojammer array needs to be shot down. although that would be possible with 30 ships it's not done with 30 ships. it would take so long, that a suitable defense fleet could easily stop the attack. so the attacker assembles a fleet large enough to kill the cynojammer within a couple of minutes. sadly though this number is so big, that the node dies if the defender tries to get in too.the solution to this is not to reduce the hitpoints of the array. the attacker would still use a blob if this got the job done faster and more ""secure"". the only solution imo would be, that blobbing made it harder to actually attack sov. sounds weird, but you somehow need to force people to intentionally not blobb in order to be more successful. imagine a situation like for example party a attacks sov-related structures/objects/whatever and party d has to defend. party d sends in only pos gunners. let's say they send 5 people. attacking party a is coming with 50 regular ships. they got 10 times the numbers of party d. so party d gets an appropriate boost like let's say increased hitpoints of all sov-related objects or increased tracking of guns, or increased damage. anything like that. it's just an example to show what i mean, so please don't pick on these and read further.now attacking party a can go on with their 10 times number advantage and take down the object. or they could reduce their own number seeing, that the opponent only has 5 people in system. let's say they could withdraw 20 ships and keep on attacking with 30 ships. they would only have 6 times the numbers of party d now. therefor the initial bonus granted to party d would be reduced by the appropriate amount. the withdrawn 20 people could go attack another system.what if there are no defenders you might ask? the number advantage would be infinite obviously. in that case the pos/attacked object could have the biggest boost. but as an unmanned pos is stupid 30 or 50 should be able to take down what they came for.the mechanic here has to be like this somehow: if the defender has 5 people in dedicated position/role to defend a specific object it should be totally stupid to attack with 200 people. while they could eventually win, they should take horrific losses. it needs a real drawback to blobbing other than just lag and lack of fun.well that's about my opinion. don't come down on me because of the used specific example (pos, certain arrays, hitpoints and stuff). if it was for me i wouldn't mind all poses in eve exploding right now and we never had to care about them again. :)"

9/4/2008,"ok its time for a topic about lowsec. i know ccp has considered viceroys, which would be allowing corps to control a section of space in return for a tax off the top of transactions happening there.this topic considers the following:why doing viceroys just anywhere in lowsec isn't as interesting as it could bewhat creating imbalances in the profit-terrain of lowsec will do to the social fabric of lowsec and evewhat it will do for lowsec as a wholehow the mechanics might work to take and hold a viceroyaltyhow empires and players both gain from this systemextra considerations and limitationsi think we can do bettermore than just providing incentives because a corporation is there, lowsec should offer greater differences in direct profitability. rather than letting corporations settle anywhere in lowsec as a viceroyalty, a much more interesting mechanic is to create a dozen or two dozen systems in lowsec which are much more profitable than others. either they spawn better ore, or better rats, or are home to a special complex. this creates extra value in these particular pockets.create 12-20 ""viceroyalty systems"" in 0.1 lowsec. each of these systems can be claimed by one corp at a time, and each system holds influence over the 6-8 nearest lowsec systems. the viceroy's system must include a static, beconed complex containing either high end ore, or faction npc rats, extremely valuable ice ores, or valuable gas clouds. it must also have station with good services, including refinery, factories and cloning, but not research (extra inventive for poses). challenging this claim involves promoting trade in the system. the viceroy's station will have a special agent who gives trade missions to ceos of competing corps only. more on this dynamic later.what social dynamics could we expect from this?profitable systems will attract the most organized and best able corps from empire to take them for themselevs. whoever owns these complexes gains access to a powerful revenue stream. this will lead to compettition among corps for the valuable resources presented by this system. adding profitability to lowsec systems will support a ""middle class"" of corporations. corps not yet big enough or organized enough to be part of 0.0, but certainly big enough to defend a few systems in lowsec and to war against pirate corporations in the area. having experienced this dynamic personally, it's incredibly fun to create informal alliances with nearby complex holders and fend off or drive out pirate corps with their help.it will bring lowsec alivei have seen a similar version of this work already, but it was an unintended consequence of static 5/10 complexes. the corps in charge of these complexes warred against each other for control of the resources they presented, and warred against the pirates in their area that threatned the security of pilots in lowsec. it's a great chance to bring a life and complexity not available in lowsec which is currently mediocre across the board.the mechanic of taking and controlling a viceroyaltythe empires want to promote two things in lowsec. trade and security. they do both by offering aspiring corps a chance to prove themselves with missions. these missions are about escorting a hauler with important supplies for building a healthy lowsec (medical supplies, researchers(science graduates), tourists and marines). one is given out each week to the three largest competing corps for the viceroyalty by the same agent. the agent also freely gives out the starting time(randomly determined) and ending point of the missions he's given. he will tell anyone that information, so that wanna-be viceroys will try to shoot down each other's convoy.competing corps must then sabotage each other's hauling missions while protecting their own. in case of a tie, the current viceroy remains in power, or it stays empty."
9/4/2008,"what do the empires gain from this?escorting this hauler or battleship full of goods through lowsec at a randomized time proves that this corp can maintain a military strength round the clock, and can protect trade in the area. this brings the stability and peace to lowsec that the empires really want, while supporting corps who are growing in power and influence, and of course providing some epic small scale pew pew between the viceroys and nearby pirates trying to hold their own turf.what do corps gain for becoming viceroys?the gains for holding a viceroyalty must be two-fold. first you need to support the corp's wallet. corps have their own needs, including supplying members with capital ships and fuel, paying for offices, paying for poses and fuel, and paying for wardecs against their enemies. some profit also needs to be available for players in that corp, to support their own growth and ability to buy and finance ships for the defence of the viceroyalty. sales tax and weekly security bonuses go to corps, while the complex is there to support the wallet of corp members, and bounties can supplement individual wallets.corps gain:-respect, notariety, visibility for recruiting-pvp challenges vs pirates-profit from the complex-some tax from sales occuring in their viceroyalty(small)-some bonuses paid by the empires for killing minus sec status characters, and for promoting mining and industry-some bonuses paid by players for killing bountied piratesadding these up should result in very good profits for a corp, but it still must be overall only the same profitability as 0.0 to consider moon mining, normal mining, and ratting in 0.0.remember there are only a limited number of these systems, and these are for grooming corps to exist in 0.0. rather than driving corps from 0.0 in, we want viceroys to get a taste of the profitability in 0.0, and realize that while there are a dozen of these in lowsec, there are hundreds of such systems in 0.0.further bits for consideration-viceroy's might be able to invest in better sentry guns or navy protection for their systems, depending on success and seniority.-adding benefits to viceroys based on numbers of minus sec status ships destroyed in their areas, and also for the amount of ore mined in their sphere of influence. -it might be very cool to allow viceroys to spread the benefits of their holdings to a few other corps (say 3 others) around them, allowing the viceroy to build alliances with friendly corps.-it could be very very cool to allow viceroys to be the arbiters of the bounty system, or bring them into it, since they are intended to compete with pirates.-creating alt corps to impede or influence the viceroy system must be an exploit.-corps in alliances cannot take part of the viceroy system.-i've done my best to build a system that does not support or favor farmers. any system built around who runs the most missions, or kills the most npcs, or who does the most anything, will favor farmers. thats why there's only one viceroy mission a week per corp."
9/4/2008,saved for archiving insightful comments. i'd love to hear from designers what their thoughts are for the viceroy system.mods please consider if this belongs in f&i instead of assembly hall. i'm not sure which. move if neccesary.
9/4/2008,"so your suggestion is to make lowsec more valuable, and give people a reason to control it. i like that suggestion, but i'm not sure your mechanism is necessary. if lowsec is profitable, people don't need to play king of the hill for it, they'll just use it and fight over it naturally. i like the kind of gameplay you refer to, but i'm not convinced by your methods."
9/4/2008,"thats good feedback. lowsec as a whole shouldn't be more valuable across the board, because there is actually quite a bit of it, and very few corps able to take the risk and put in the time to make it worthwhile. there are a few reasons why value in lowsec should be a concentrated resource:-few good organizers: good ceos who can organize a defence of an area and attract enough people are rare, they have to be special people at a special time in their lives where they have enough time. empires should want to attract and retain the best few of these, not a dozen mediocre ones.-too much lowsec to cause contention: there wouldnt be people fighting over lowsec because theres too much of it and not enough people everyone with enough time and organization could setup their own viceroyalty and you'd have space left over.-profitabillity: if every part of lowsec can be carved into viceroyalties to support 1 corp each, then holding several of them means enormous profits, or they get pre-nerfed and holding one or two just isnt worth it. either way that makes for an imbalance.when i was running one such corp, i knew maybe a half dozen corps outside of 0.0 who were organized enough to actually take advantage of the resources presented. if we could have sat anywhere in lowsec, huge expanses of it would have sat empty or underutilized, or we would have been over our heads in riches because of the expanses of underutilized systems.if all of lowsecwhat i'm suggesting here is to concentrate talent and rewards in order to allow people with the time and means to hold a place in 0.0 to attract the attention and rewards you need to have to make it worth it.creating a limited supply of special systems allows the best corps in empire to rise to the top, and ensures that there will be real competition around these areas."
9/4/2008,"thanks for giving us overview tabs. we really needed those. that said:generally:tabs are good. they allow us to switch between settings in a split second. please - keep this in mind and read on.the default tab:just as well that you removed it. it was messy anyway. without the default tab though, we have one less tab - which is bad.the number of tabs:we really need more, not less. increase the maximum to 10 please?the 1.1 load setting disaster:earlier, you could select a tab, and then simply right click to add wrecks, or even load up a brand new overview setting. all you had to do to when you were done, was click on the tab - and you are back where you started. this is no longer true.if you change or load an overview setting through the main overview menu (it's easy to do by mistake!) - it edits the tab too, as if you had right-clicked the tab, selected load overview setting, and made a choice. this is a terribly bad idea!take me for example. i have three tabs for fleet / pvp duties. i have one for missions. i used to have one that made navigation in crowded areas easy but for reasons you will soon see - that's gone.i also do salvaging, looting, mining, etc. this means i have extra overview settings that i can load, and lots of them! i have settings for scordite, kernite veldspar, wrecks, structures, fw beacons and objects, etc, etc. this is a lot of settings.pre 1.1, all i had to do was load up one of these less used settings when i needed them, and then click a tab to get back to normal. this doesn't work any more. so, now i have to use one of my five tabs for ""junk settings"". (and now we are down to just 4 tabs left over for presets.)whenever i need something that isn't in one of my tabs i must:1) switch to my junk tab.2) load setting / change manually / whatever.3) switch back to another tab when i'm done.what happens if i forget to switch tab? bang! kiss the overview settings goodbye - you just ruined your tab! best case scenario, you curse and repair the tab by manually reloading the right setting. worst case scenario you try to switch to a low-lag combat tab and get a face-full of veldspar asteroids, or something similarly evil. this is really, really bad...tabs are no longer easy, quick and foolproof. please, pretty please, with sugar on top - make it the way it was!so here's what i suggest changing, and fast:1) editing the current overview setting must not manipulate the current tab! this new behaviour is a disaster.2) while you are at it, increase the max number of tabs to 10."

9/4/2008,without a doubt. a landmark that should stand well and good where it was; especially since there was no problem to begin with (that i am aware of).
9/4/2008,sounds like a good idea.at first.then you realise all you really want is loot drones.
9/4/2008,"one way to balance the idea, would be a small, or medium salvage drone that does its thing on the wreck, and then puts the salvage in a can where the wreck was, rather than brining it back to the ship.along with that, you could have a modified sentry drone, called tractor drone, or some such. this would pull in cans/wrecks like a tractor beam, but at a slower speed."
9/4/2008,"so, you are basically advocating for macro-mining, because the mineral prices would be raised by the ""shortage"" caused in the light of lack of cheaters producing abundant amounts of minerals.translation: ""let the macro-miners cheat all they want, because if they are not around, the isk i pay would be distributed at the honest miners out there"".i feel the need to kick your head repeatedly."
9/4/2008,"1) as a suggestion, i would add the ""upgrading"" of high-sec belts, ie. better/more ore found in high sec.2) the warp stability bubble would be an idea, but it would most likely be ""abused"" for pvp :p3)but that would make miners in general easier victims.4) i have another suggestion: tuning of the lasers/strippers. as time passes by, the lasers need ""tuning"" in the form of user input, or the output is less. the ""tuning"" needs to be periodic (15-20 mins?) and brainless-easy (click left arrow once or right arrow once, depending on where a bar in the middle has moved towards) so as not to start whining. possibly even ""forgive"" one tuning mistake, so as not to punish miss-clicks. if this dialog can not be addressed by a script, it will make macro-miners mine less and less ore as time goes by, making macro-mining deliver near-zero output."

9/4/2008,"lag should be their #1 priority, sadly, i doubt that they'll ever fix it."
9/4/2008,"no, they wont.18 months ago jita used to be a laggy hellhole with 300 pilots. now it's a laggy hellhole with 700 pilots. ccp ""fixed"" jita, and so more people crammed in until it was laggy again.people in 0.0 alliances complain about lag, even when their fcs deliberately bring over-sized fleets with the specific intention of causing lag conditions.to a certain extent, ccp bet on the wrong horse when they were writing eve: at that time, it looked as though the future of cpus was ever-faster single-cored processers, and they planned accordingly. things turned out differently - and possibly the eve playerbase grew beyond their expectations as well - but even now tq is able to provide better performance than any comparable game: i've been in 100 vs 100 fights that were quite playable (10 fps, >1 sec module lag). of course, i've also been in 100v100 where the overview took 5 minutes to load. lag is a fickle god...hardware improvements can only increase performance by small percentages. if, say we would reasonably expect a 30v30 to be not particularly laggy, a 25% hardware performance improvement (and that's a big improvement) only gives us 37v38 - hardly noticeable, and completely irrelevant to the 200v180 fleet fights. ""fixing lag"" will require a wholesale rewrite of the code base - basically ""eve ii"", and that **** costs money and takes time, lots of both. and it may be that ccp have run the numbers and decided that the percentage of players who are actually affected by lag simply isn't high enough to justify the expense."
9/4/2008,i've been in a system with 40 people shooting a station and getting multiple minute lag. there are a ton of things wrong with the servers and they should really work on fixing problems rather then add features.

9/5/2008,very interesting and well laid out ideas.
9/5/2008,"what does the csm think? would they support raising it to ccp?shall we iron out the kinks - is the suggestion merely adding functionality to the already existing station container/vault/warehouse, or are people supporting the ""brand new"" ability for individuals to obtain extra divisions?personal wallet divisions sounds like a nice idea. should they be a fee based luxury??"
9/5/2008,"i think they would both be a great addition. both would be easy to implement (i think) as corps have them at the moment. the advantage of the wallet divisions speaks for itself really, the ability of having a spare fund incase you wake up after a drunken night in jita, to find that cnr wasn't actually a cnr (although, you should hide your head in shame even still). i think 3 divisions would be enough for the average player, (a ""current"" account, a ""savings"" account, and a ""omg wtf did i just buy???"" account). i don't think they should be a fee based luxury though, or skill based. the n00b eve player won'tbe worried about spreading their isk, and saving etc, although players starting a new char can immediately understand that they will need to save some isk (bounties / loot sales / whatever)..the advantage of the personnel hangar divisions would be a) less asset lag when checking your assets - why? because you wouldn't have loads of station containers / warehouses etc everywhere, cutting down your assets.b) less market lag - because there would be no need for them to be on the market. less items for sale? less lag..they could both be implemented easily, as they are already in the game. if they were implemented, it would mean less 1 man corps / alliances, and more people in player corps, more people playing fw, more people enjoying the game as it was meant to be...i can't think of a single dis-advantage of having them?"
9/5/2008,"okay fair enough they would be a godsend for all the reasons you state.why should a character get extra wallet and hangar divisions for free?i'm not saying it should 1m per week or anything like that, but a token amount 10k per week per division, payable to the corporation the extra corp hangar is located in or to concord for the extra wallet division.you're absolutely right it would cut down on solo corp entities. there are players out there that like the ability and freedom of slots and joining a corp - no matter how good or organized it is won't be able to offer this to their members.that's an idea. make it corp purchasable for members. perhaps a corporate granted role. this would make npc corps even less attractive than they are now. join a corp gain personal wallet and hangar divisions in the corps hq and office locations.i'm not sure how much smaller the markets would be though, sure there are pack rats already, being able to organize assets could lead to even more market activity as you can easily sort out between what you want to refine, what you want/need to hold on to and finally what you actually want to put on the market today or next time in a different region.i personally like the corp granted role of being able to use +1 extra station hangar floor and a wallet division, with an escalating fee system for subsequent additions."
9/5/2008,"maybe. the reason i brought up the idea of the personnel hangar / personnel wallet divisions was it was easy to implement (as it was already in place in one form), bringing in having to have rights / paying for the priviledge / different combinations or divisions etc would just had more work to ccp...making payment to a corp, or having to have roles to use your own personnel divisions takes away the point of them being personnel though. why would you need to pay for extra divisions? or have to get a director to give you rights to get another division on your personnel wallet? things like that don't involve the corp.i understand where you are coming from, and maybe the paying of concord could work. but i think that will just open up a whole new can of worms as i doubt people will pay for the right to have access to thier own wallets..even so, i agree that it would nice to hear from csm, as to their view on it."

9/5/2008,"oh well, why not."
9/5/2008,"supported, kind of.while i agree that the logistics of mining need a severe overhaul, i don't think the orca is the way to go about doing that. the ore multiplier is a good idea that deserves implementation (so you can have like 8 grades of each ore, with the yield going up substatially as the system security goes down).with the multiplier, there will be a reason to mine veld in .6 systems. at the moment, aside from population, there is no reason to move to lower securities to mine ores available in the higher ones. this will also solve the problem mentioned above, as the veld roids in 0.0 will be 2x - 5x as much yield.the base yield could be the same, but higher and lower grades varied, even if on a set naming system. therefore, in 0.0, you'd get exquisite veldspar [4x yield] but basic arkanor; while in 0.9, you might have only base-grade veldspar but also polluted arkanor [1% yield].honestly, while the orca does sound kinda neat, it's guaranteed use in the hands of macrominers would become a nightmare for honest miners. i cannot either give support to this thread or malign it, but i simply think it needs a new method for achieving the much-desired goal."
9/5/2008,"well.. i think we will see the orca in the industrial patch in december. i am against moving large ammount of ore/mins in the universe.. why? because it destroys local markets in favor of 1 big universe wide market. if you ask me, they should remove all cargospace on jumpdrive able ships!"

9/5/2008,"i always thought it was odd that 0.0 relied so heavily on empire space. you can't actually fly out to 0.0 space, start a corp, start an alliance, get an outpost, and hold a system without heavy heavy logistics from empire.the simple fact that you need pos fuels which are sold by npc makes 0.0 unrealistic to be honest. there is no reason why you need to go to empire to buy stuff to live in 0.0 space. but that's my opinion.the thing the op brings up is just another reason why 0.0 is just not as attractive as it could be. there should be capital mining lasers and mining fighters. ccp have said they want people to spread out and live lose in low/sec 0.0. yet they also want them to be tethered to empire.for the ops specific issue i would much rather see different levels of ore..veldspar only in empire. denise veldspar in low sec, concentrated veldspar in 0.0. then push up the amount of trit in each level. so maybe double the trit in denise, and then double it again in concentrated.that way the 0.0 veld roids will not be the size of planets :)"
9/5/2008,they would still be huge just not totally worthless in comparison. my problem is that ratting provides more lowends than mining. i don't think it is the ratting that is broken as it scales up rather well. you simply can't mine bs level quantities of veld.
9/5/2008,"0.0 is the wild west in '700 and '800. from the est and civilization come glass, precision machinery pieces, chemicals for the ammunitions, dynamite, trains and steam boilers for the sawmills and so on, for a myriad of items, some small some big. some of them could be produced locally but the cost was prohibitive (you don't build a plant capable of building steam boilers to power 1 sawmill), for others it required expert personnel that was available in numbers only in the east, mostly it was because the production was convenient only if you could sell to a large number of costumers. so it is pretty normal that 0.0 can't live at his top level without imports from empire and at the same time empire can't live at his top level without imports from 0.0."
9/5/2008,"sprs =/= pvp. the fact that you think any (non-idiot) caldari pilot uses sprs in pvp proves you know absolutely nothing about the subject.and caldari ships are just fine. in fact, they are better than fine, they're arguably the best race right now. amarr have more pure gank, but caldari are better at everything else. sure, they aren't that great at solo pvp, but these days nothing is good at solo pvp.oh, and shield tanking is just fine as well. what you conveniently forget to mention is that 3x damage mods are even more mandatory in pvp than web/point, so armor tankers lose more tank slots than shield tankers!"
9/5/2008,rofl 2 points @20km .bleat on caldari f1-f8 headrollers.
9/5/2008,"precisely.look at ships like the myrmidon - it has a armour tank bonus, yet the best setup for the ship involves a buffer shield tank - and it gets to fit mwd, web and point on top of everything while having the same sort of buffer a plated gank harbringer/hurricane do.armour tank the same ship, and it's very meh for most situations (outside of gatecamping/etc), has relatively low damage output and its active tank is rather worthless outside of a 1v1 (and, in fact, in 1v1 situations very often, unless you've got combat boosters + tank rigs - blame it on the fact there's no combat boosters which boost flat out dps).imagine that, a shield tank which is supposedly so bad outdoing a armour tank on a armour tank bonused ship for most pvp applications."
9/5/2008,"i used to be behind this idea a long time ago, but a few skilled caldari pilots taught me how wrong i was.a full-rack tank, max damage mods or tackle is fine and a defining difference between armor and shield tanks.a lighter tank, tackle, and damage mods is fine and available to both armor or shield tanks.a full-rack tank, max damage mods, and tackle is overpowered especially when handed only to one type of tanking."
9/5/2008,"well, op, you're forgetting something very important:armor tankers have fewer mid slots than sheild tankers, so they are in the same exact situation! for armor tankers it's just as difficult adding any sort of tackle, ewar, cap regen, or what-have-you to their mids when they have 1/3 as many as a comperable caldari ship."
9/5/2008,"though i'm not sure if this is the proper thread for such an idea, i do like the sounds of it. seems to me a much more long term thing - but cool concept to bring into the game either way."
9/5/2008,that would be very cool. thumbs up!
9/5/2008,/signedand it would fairly well integrate into a kind of lowsec viceroy thing spoken of elsewhere. a kind of toolset for player to create content...
9/5/2008,do want.
9/5/2008,hrrrr
9/5/2008,"as the former rp senator in swg, i'd be remiss in not supporting this."
9/5/2008,i remember that there has been some sort of talk about doing this sort of thing from ccp. for all of auora's problems it was still a way for players to pull a little influence/participation in the eve storyline and i'd support anything that gives us more of that and/or more tools for us to bring stories into the game.
9/5/2008,this has my support.
9/5/2008,"voting for this, or any implementation of events again, tbh."
9/5/2008,all for it
9/5/2008,"please please please please please!alright, so it needs to be looked at carefully and one needs to ensure it won't be abused and all, but . . . very good idea to at least look at!edit: oh, i have some fond memories of this in swg . . . as part of big rp plot on starsider that we were making a movie of, the imps invaded a player run town . . . ah, such fond memories."
9/5/2008,/signedhas anyone actually ever used a clone vat bay outside of the test server?
9/5/2008,definitely needs to be looked at
9/5/2008,full support
9/5/2008,have used it to get pilots from empire to a 0.0 station system .. but can only do 8 at a time so it is a little hard on the wallet . lol
9/5/2008,"i've used one to get to 0.0. was a bit of a pain getting back.they do have some limited usage . . . key word limited. quite limited.supported, they could use the boost."
9/5/2008,"i'd argue that the biggest reason such corps don't exist is because there's no benefit to it. as such, anybody ambitious and interested in controlling space will either join an alliance in pc 0.0 or fight over npc 0.0, instead of fighting over npc 0.4, which is at present utterly worthless, and where defence of your space ultimately denies you access to highsec. as such, i'm not convinced there's the superabundance of lowsec up for player control that you seem to think there is. there are 23 regions in empire, of which 10(from the looks of it) are used for factional warfare, and as such are unlikely to be fought over by pc corps. the remaining 13 - the forge, molden heath, derelik, domain, tash-murkon, kador, khanid, kor-azor, genesis, aridia, sinq laison, everyshore, and solitude - contain 200-300 lowsec systems, at a guess. that sounds like a lot, but remember that many corps will aim for control of several systems, not merely one. also, if lowsec becomes valuable, expect 0.0 empires to extend their reach inwards, and eat up a lot of the slack. that isn't even a bad thing, either - i care more about the space being usable than who uses it. given an adjustment period, i could see 50 corps being willing to carve out a constellation, even without alliances. that fills the space. 100 corps means everyone has someone to fight, and that again isn't unreasonable. seriously, what do you need to defend a half-dozen systems of no special value? 30 or 40 people should be able to do it handily. as for what you'd do to make lowsec worthwhile, just bring in buffs across the board. the sec status changes were a very good one, but more are needed. l5 missions need a major boost, and there need to be more and better l4 agents in lowsec. i've proposed solutions to the worthlessness of lowsec minerals before:the market prices in that are outdated, but they should still be workable. lowsec could have better deadspace complexes. also, i don't know what current moon distribution looks like, but i can guarantee some epic fights over dysprosium and promethium moons where they exist - if they've been kept out of lowsec, in whole or in part, bring them back in. and of course, rats could use a boost too, although not much of one, since we still want lowsec ratting to be noob-friendly. ultimately, non-fw lowsec should be a lot like npc 0.0, except without bubbles. right now, you have all the same risks, but with very few of the corresponding rewards. whatever changes that is the fix to lowsec, not setting up capture points."
9/5/2008,"hmm i did not read all of it i have to admit. however it looks like a system that i previously thought about myself :-)there is one distinct problem with this. static resources create static revenue. if this revenue is significant enough, 0.0 alliances will come in and claim it. after all they are the most powerfull entities ingame.so the revenue has to be unatractive for them or too much bother. however then it will be also too much bother for the usual target corp or small alliance.i would like for lowsec to become kind of a colonial space for the empires. what you get are roid belts, moons, planets as we have now. and that's all folks.some systems will remain as they are now, some will have nothing but belts, planets and moons. you can rent that space from the respective empire. then you will be able to build an outpost just like in 0.0 with these options:1. basic outpost with medical/cloning/repair/office2. outpost upgrades: reprocessing, labs, factory, market, agents !!! gate gunsyou can not control the basic facilities, as they are part of your duty to the empire. however you can control the upgrades (quality/taxes/fees). you have to give back a certain monetary tax back to the empire you rent from.thus this promotes investment into the area as the more you invest, the more you get back. the holding criteria is simply the tax of the empire. you are free of it for the 1st month or so, then you are billed on a weekly basis. should you fail to pay the full tax for 3 weeks in a row (or 5 weeks total) you loose your ""license"" and you have one week to clean up the station. also your standing with the empire is lowered. this means that warfare over valuable systems will be based on economics. your activities get disrupted enough for you to not generate enough money and you loose the license.for this we need freelance agents to be introduced. all levels and progresive less quality:l1 q20, l2 q16, l3 q10, l4 q0 - that's the limit on freelance agents. they also require a tax for you services you have to pay them, on the other hand, they will give you back some money from their operation, also a certain amount of players and completed missions is a factor or the agent will loose interest in the area.sounds doable ?"
9/5/2008,"as i said before i've seen this in action with 5/10 complexes. there were not 50 corps willing to take them. at best there were half that, and honestly i'd say more like 1/4. you're also assuming that each corp would take only their share. if every few systems supports a large corp, why not take several? our corp covered 2 5/10 complexes, and there were others that held 3 or 4. there were some complexes (like ostingele) which were held by farmers, because no corp was organized enough to take it.if you make all of lowsec valuable like that youre going to get single large corps taking all of it, not a clean distribution of smaller holders, and those large corps are going to make more than they could in 0.0. nerf that in the other direction and its not enough for the small corps to benefit from. its not a balanced system. some people might even try to say that limiting it to one viceroy per corp would fix that, but that's a stupid claim. players know better. you'd have one powerful corp that would dominate a dozen smaller ones and fight for them, in return for 3/4 of the viceroy revenue, and again they would make too much.you have to make it a very limited resource so that those competing are the top corps, strong enough to fend each other off.as a side point, adding in moons would just cause the 0.0 alliances to swoop in on the profits as they already do. i am willing to bet that every single one of the lowsec dysp/promethium moons are already held by 0.0 alliances. i'd remove those moons from lowsec altogether tbh."
9/5/2008,sounds good to me.
9/5/2008,oh yes!
9/5/2008,yes please.
9/5/2008,"200% supported.tabs worked! they had their issues, of course, but they worked just fine... now they're just a waste of space and time. :/also:put in a backup feature! let us export our overview settings and import them later after the next patch has deleted them."
9/5/2008,"i don't know how much work this would be, but . . . if it isn't to much, it would be kinda nice. yeah, you can manually find your way around jita when you're going through the forge, but the in game map can be a bit confusing and hard to use, and not everyone has a copy of ombey's by their desk . . . would be nice.actually, slightly more useful might be an autopilot function to avoid systems with more than a user definable number of pilots. if that's not technically feasable, then possibly several options: aviod systems with more than 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500 pilots.just a thought."
9/5/2008,"sadly this wont work.. i even put in a petition for it.to sum it up...""all roads lead to jita""and in that region... its pretty much true.i can't seem to find a way around it without going long distances."
9/5/2008,"i was curious about the many scam contracts that you see in contracts. i was wondering why ccp has never just looked at them and dropped the scam ones and fine the people responsible. i would think it would not take a great deal of time. i mean how hard is it to see wtb useing the cents as major numbers--some guys will have 10 or more in a row. we get told buyer beware because we cant be bothered with you being cheated. well, they dont really say that but it is the attitude you get. was just wondering. :)"
9/5/2008,"hello,obvious issue, long time standing issue.if you declare war on a corporation within a miltia, it should be that you declare war on every corporation in the miltia, and the faction that miltia is within.if you are at war with someone, they join the miltia after the next timedown since they applied. (so they can't just join the miltia to avoid a fight etc etc). and you are no longer at war when they join the miltia.miltia corporations cannot declare war with any corporation that is within the miltia alliance (caldari may not attack caldari or ammar based corporations)............then i wont find myself in a large miltia fleet, with people screaming for help as 2 ships attack them and there is nothing we can ""legally"" do to help them."
9/5/2008,bad idea on many many levels. also a repost of existing topic. thereand you can find the general discussion thread here with a lot of debate on the general issues and full and detailed explanations of why allowing fw membership to damage wardec functionality would be a bad thing for game balance. consequently. no support
9/5/2008,what jade failed to tell you... is that there is a perceived flaw and beyond all the rants and raves made by both sides of the debate... jade (we hope) should be pushing this issue thru the proper levels to reach the devs for discussion.
9/5/2008,"it's only really an issue because it gives alliances a back-door into fw combat, which is something the devs stated that they didn't want to happen (at least not yet).at the very least they should either disallow decs from corps that belong to a player alliance, or just open up fw to alliances and let them in through the front door."
9/5/2008,"i think that the salvage and tractor drones should be separate.salvage drones could fly out, salvage wrecks until their internal hold is too full for salvaging another wreck, then return to your drone bay. but you will have to move the stuff from the drones hold to your main hold before they will launch again.tractor drones shouldn't be too hard to visualise. you target a wreck/jetcan, they fly to it. then you hope that they tractor it back towards you, instead of tractoring it in circles while they orbit it. one it returns with the can, it drops it by your ship while it awaits the next order. you still have to remove the loot from the can.but i don't think that these drones should ever automatically target a wreck or can."
9/5/2008,"i think these would be cool. there's even room for t2 salvage drones, to allow for varying levels of salvage skill;t1 light: salvage 1 5m^3 cargo t1 medium: salvage 2 15m^3 cargot1 heavy: salvage 3 50m^3 cargot2 light: salvage 2 10m^3 cargot2 medium: salvage 3 25m^3 cargotw heavy: salvage 4 75m^3 cargospeed/hitpoints as per gallente drones.the cargo bays may seem over-large, but you need a certain amount purely because of the dreaded metal scraps."
9/5/2008,"while i do support the concept of salvage drones, there is one problem.how do they report a salvage failure ? atm if you don't have enough free cargo space, the salvager ends a successful salvage cycle with an error and does nothing to the wreck. however drones do never report anything. so if the same situation happens to a salvage drone, what should it do ? also in the case we make the heavy salvage drones have enough cargo for the worst case scenarion (so they can salvage a wreck always) then the smaller ones will have no use at all and are redundant for all practical purposes (other than if heavies are slower than normal tractor speed)."
9/5/2008,"medium drones: separate tractor and salvage drones, low cargo space.heavy drone: tractor and salvage capable variant, high cargo space."
9/5/2008,"yes to tractorbeam drones, no to salvage drones.for a couple of reasons.1) you can't tractor in wreaks that do not belong to you. so if you're raiding people's missions you still have to jet over to the can and do it. this is much better then just showing up in a big bad ass tank battleship and unleashing drones on peoples wreaks. there is already too much mission salvaging going on and it's very easy to do. i know because i do it often, a salvager drone would make life ungodly simply if i had salvager drones.2) tractorbeam drones would have more usefulness for everyone. where as salvage drone has pretty much a singular usage. in missions sometimes you are 75km away from a can that drops that has your objective in it. with salvager drones you still need to move to the can. tractorbeam drones will go and collect it for you.the simple fact is, salvager drones are way too easy mode. however making life a little easier for everyone and not just a select group of people would be a bonus. tractorbeam drones would have much much much more functionality for almost everyone."
9/5/2008,"not all wrecks produce scraps. drones simply return to the ship when they're full, as do mining drones."
9/5/2008,"i would like to see a addition to the game that using input form the player reduces or increases cycle time. i have thought of mini-games, downside takes players attention away form security of the ship.i have thought of another skill of mining efficiency, this would just increase macro pocket books.my big issues is:low sec and 0.0 veldspar risk does not meet the demand you have for it if you build.ice mining - omg... this sucks but has to be done.i would like to see a bigger bonus for the rorqual, and would love for it to be alot better then a command ship. also if the bonus would get better per member in fleet, that way when you have large alliance mining ops you can get the mining done faster.edit: btw i support this and would love to see a mining rig."
9/5/2008,"hello all,here's a brief few things that i would like to see for mining buffs:1) variable ore quality. have high sec ore give massive bonuses in null-sec (4x yield veld, for instance) or null-sec ore give pitiful benefits in high-sec (1% arkanor, so people can mine for their ships).2) remove t1 loot from drop tables. it's been suggested elsewhere, but i think this will massively boost the mining occupation, since you won't have huge piles of reprocessables from missions.3) high-sec pirate raids. this idea is expanded upon in my website, but basicly give occasional raids of high-sec that won't be detectable from a macro-sniffer, but will lay waste to those who don't pay attention in asteroid belts.4) asteroid veins. certain areas on a map displayed of the asteroid which will give bonuses to ore yield, detectable but not macroable.just my 0.02 isk."
9/5/2008,"very good point, i had neglected this. maybe mini-game/periodic input is a bad idea after all.a faster response on macroing tickets and/or better detection methods is probably the way to go.irrelevant, the way macro-ing works is in the long run. so, initial cost counts for nearly nothing for a macroer."
9/5/2008,"why???that just degrades (possibly in detrimental proportions) the value of high-sec mining, making mining a profession only profitable for 0.0 alliances."
9/5/2008,no it makes low sec mining more viable and lets people who want to build there own ships able to mine it all wherever they are. balance the numbers so that veldspar in 1.0 is better than ark and ark in -1.0 is better than veld and then let the market dictate who needs what.and rebalance drone mins. i don't care if you have to give them more low ends without taking high ends from the melt. having such terrible high end heavy amounts means they have to import as there is no way to get trit in required qty in 0.0 without hauler spawns.
9/5/2008,"as i was saying, i've seen that, it also dumps a lot more than you'd wish."
9/5/2008,"since the 1st drone bug was present over 3 years ago, i don't have much confidence that this will be addressed. can't hurt to vote though."
9/5/2008,how do you determine the enemy sov ? standing ? wardec ? i'd go for wardec ...
9/5/2008,yep use autopilot and whine when you get ganked
9/5/2008,"are you referring to just learning skills as in clarity ect , or are you talking about all skills in general like gunnery electronis engineering ect. if you are talking about all skills i;m afraid its a really stupid idea. skills are fine the way they are. though skill ques would be nice."
9/5/2008,"keep 'em in the game! they help weed out the ""adhd"" crowd."
9/5/2008,"i am a salvage and make my living of the carcass of other ships, but it seems to me despite salvaging supposedly being a deliberate profession put in by ccp there isn't much to support the profession.currently most salvage in the game comes from missions. to get this salvage you have to either run missions or you have to find a mission someone else has run. this causes problems because the only way to find these missions is to probe out the mission runners and their drones.this causes two problems.the first is when you enter a mission being run by a person there are issues with the runner claiming he owns the wreck and complaining starts despite the wreck not belonging to anyone (not the point of this thread)the second problem is if the mission runner turns in the mission and leaves the salvage floating in space. with no one around to probe out these wrecks cannot be found and are lost to the depths of space where they will pop after a couple of hours worthlessly.since ccp has made it abundantly clear the wrecks belong to no one i won't focus on that, instead i am concerned about the wrecks that i can't find due to the fact they have been abandoned. miners can find their rocks, archaeologists and hackers can find their sites, how come salvagers can't find salvage?please let us probe for wrecks."
9/5/2008,"ok so alot of people do camp gates for the fun of it and the killmails. but one thing you should know is most pvp alliances camp the 0.0/low sec gates to their space , while they may enjoy doing this it is for security reasons not just to bully carebears. oh and by the way the first thing you learn when u start a new char in eve is that it's a dark and dangerous universe. also i know heaps of guys that have been pvping since they were a few months old. look at agony empire and goons for instance."
9/5/2008,eve is and aways will be a dangerous predacious place...however that isnt to say that such predation should be so easy that it holds no real consequence..eve is also about the choices you make and the consequences of those choices..so those 16 bs's camping the jita gate to insta pop that huge lumbering freighter(you know the one without any module slots)well they will go boom..but should it be so e-z for them to grab billions of isk and meanwhile collect issurance(rumor has it you still can btw)for said bs?yes they lose sec rating but hell even id consider losing sec status for a few hundred billion isk with the promise of insurance money (still).
9/5/2008,i gotta ask... pole dancing injury?
9/5/2008,the chafing from that pole can be quite inconvenient.
9/5/2008,issues were submitted on the 26th of august. so it will take at least till next week.but i don't think the date has been announced yet.
9/5/2008,"more intriguingly, when is the next csm meeting? the 17th of august was almost three weeks ago."
9/5/2008,"i believe we are in a waiting position at present for when ccp gets back to us, at which point we will start the meetings again."
9/5/2008,"surely it would make more sense to be holding the meetings regardless of waiting for ccp to get back to you for their second meeting? that way, you guys can be processing the issues that will make it to the 3rd meeting. and so avoiding the problem with the last two meetings where issues were deferred as you were trying to address too many issues in too short a space of time.for example, instead of you having a marathon 6 hour meeting every three weeks to discuss up to 30 issues of which 6 or 7 get deferred to the start of the next meeting (thus making it more likely that a new issue will be deferred during that meeting), why not have 3 shorter, 2 hour meetings discussing 10 issues each on a weekly basis?at least, that way people aren't getting frustrated by time concerns as much. and it helps to keep the csm in the public eye. unfortunately, in the last few weeks it's seemed like the csm has dropped off the face of the earth (i think the only csm i've seen around the boards doing csm business has been yourself, lavista, though will confirm that through eve-search.com) i don't doubt that there has been plenty going on behind the scenes, however, we're just not seeing that.edit: here's the posting stats for each of the csm membersjade constantine - last posted 4th september (last ah/jita post 29th august)hardin - last posted 4th september (last ah/jita post 19th august)lavista vista - last posted 5th september (last ah/jita post 5th september)darius johnson - last posted 4th september (last ah/jita post 13th august)bane glorious - last posted 18th august (last ah/jita post 11th august)dierdra vaal - last posted 21st august (last ah/jita post 21st august)serenity steele - last posted 3rd september (last ah/jita post 2nd september)ankhesentapenkah - last posted 31st august (last ah/jita post 28th august)heh, for some of them i thought it had been longer, guess i just shot myself in the foot with this one..."
9/5/2008,"then limit your agenda items to ones not relevant to the questions you asked of ccp. otherwise your backlog will be truly frightening. that's still pretty bad - only two have posted on csm forums in the last week, and it's been over two weeks for four of them."
9/5/2008,i agree. pretty scary statistics i think.
9/5/2008,"not being funny but before you wring your hands at how ""terrible"" your fellow delegates are at communicating you might consider replying to the message i sent to the csm mailing list ten days ago asking the csm delegates for their opinion of when and what the next meeting should be and involve lavista. please don't express public moral outrage when you aren't able to respond to messages yourself.as for the statistics - well, i've not personally seen a topic i'm particularly impressed by/with general popular support/and or something i've got specialist gameplay knowledge of in the last couple of weeks - certainly not one for which i've got a strong desire to promote or the confidence that it could be voted through. guess everyone is busy at the moment players included.i'm guessing the other csm's must feel similarly.(for the record - the only issue any delegate has requested on record for next available meeting was the cribba mining dreadnaught thing that got resolved by the gms the same day.)in any case i've asked the other delegates to post their opinions on what the next meeting should involve and when it should be and when i've got answers from them all i'll make a decision."
9/5/2008,"i have recently been given an idea by one of my directors about corporation incomes;he said ""wouldn't it be good if when the corporation holds sovereignty we could charge people for entering the system via the stargates, it takes so long to get sovereignty of the systems, there should be more benefits from this.""as it does actually take so long to get sovereignty of a system there should be more benfits, and as the corp has had to spend so much isk on the pos there to gain it then the corp should be entitled to full control of the system and the corp should also have a full source of corp income - via the stargate charge, or charge to use the asteroid belts. it is only an idea but for a corporation there isn't really much we can earn from, wow kill a few pirates or mine a few belts or manufacture some ships, you know its not really that new is it? at least with system control the corporations can make it a hell of alot more fun!like i said, just an idea. thanks for readinggods honour - dark assylum industries"
9/5/2008,"why doesn't ccp just stuff isk directly into your wallets? i mean, hey, you're paying for being online...no pain, no gain."
9/5/2008,"sooo , ok i am a hostile. i have to pay the toll fee to come and kill you? what if i don't want to pay?"
9/5/2008,one thing i don't get - the server has to pass the information to the client on which bps are bpos and bpcs. why not just get the client to sort out the colour difference / flag it in some other way?
9/5/2008,i don't see how it's that complicated. have all prints with unlimited build limits blue and onse with limited runs a different collor
9/5/2008,"hmmm.i think the fairest (if there is such a thing, and i think there should be) the corp a & b has access rights, anyone else should be on a timer flagged to both parties.why do i think this. because it makes more sense than just a free for all and once the bottom-feeder gets in range and opens the wreck, or puts a salvager beam on it, because they're watching the action it should be flagged as ""stealing"" from both parties, not just the guy who just managed to warp off in their pod, or is currently waking up 25 jumps away (or whatever), trying to remember to upgrade his clone or crying because he forgot to do it beforehand.the alternative to leave current system in place, could end up with more suicides in empire than there is already. and really we could do without the lag."
9/5/2008,"i think if you blow up someone the loot should belong to both them and you. and anyone taking that can should be flagged.they would be a huge uproar if mission wrecks could be looted without the looter being flagged because lets face facts this argument that the loot belongs to the person that blew up can easily be looked at the same as the faction rat you blow still owning the loot. if this is not a valid changing then mission wrecks should be made the same, then we'll soon see you bears change your tune!"
9/5/2008,yeah what vista said..word of caution though..suicide gankers (most recently pandemic legion) can still do suicide gank freighters in high sec..and unfortunately the insurance pay outs for suicide ships still exist(yes even after the last patch unfortunatly). so just be aware that you do run that risk and so do your customers
9/5/2008,"you may also run into trust issues - it's all very well contracting out your massive cargo bay to other corps, but at those kind of volumes even a relatively innocuous cargo becomes valuable. plus, if the corps are requiring that kind of volume of stuff to be moved they are quite possibly already in the cap building business themselves and will have their own.i sometimes use my freighter to go on big trading journeys (having found some npc market cargos where i can get a 50% profit margin) but for the most part it's just a portable storage for all the bits of junk i've collected over the years. i know i'm not using it anything like its potential, but it's definitely not paid for itself yet. i reckon i've made about 350mil tops with it and i've had it over a year.nice toy though"
9/5/2008,very interesting and well laid out ideas.

9/6/2008,supported
9/6/2008,supported. current situation is ridiculous.
9/6/2008,i would appreciate if people would stop supporting this topic at this point and give me a bit of feedback on the submission template i have written up: thanks in advance.
9/6/2008,"against the speed changes that were on sisi, as they constituted a huge buff (more to heavy missiles than anything) to caldari and nerf to the two benefits for flying minmatar (webs and speed tanking).a proper speed adjustment would be to the effectiveness of certain implants (primarily high grade snakes), and perhaps extending a portion of the minmatar recon/eas web range bonus to a t1 ship like the bellicose. in addition, two particularly overpowered ships could have their base speed and agility adjusted downward, the sacriledge and ishtar, as their bonuses permit them to do significant damage without tracking issues. of these two, the sacriledge is more overpowered than the ishtar."
9/6/2008,"i read this post last night, and i honestly couldn't sleep because i was still trying to wrap my mind around it.i think your idea is the best of local ""fixes"", however i think it's been over thought. just imagine how much more server side work this system could cause. as i thought more about your idea, i tried to think of a way to have a similar effect, but simpler. here is what i thought of...concord neural networks would be high sec/low sec. nothing to do with your npc standings, they will function for you. the networks would corp controlled. this means that your ceo/directors would have a new panel in the corp management tab where they are allowed to add x(maybe 5 or 10) number of blues, and x(maybe 5 or 10) number of reds. each slot could cost a certain amount of isk for adding, or changing these blues/reds. also, there would be a 24hr delay for concord to update the networks(kinda like a war dec notice). npc corps would always show in local due to being npc controlled.in high sec local would function as it currently does. everyone shows and blue/reds/nuets are shown.now, here is where the changes start...in low sec blues show up, only if they have you set blue also. reds show will show up also. the local counter will show the number of blues+reds+neutrals. this way you can see if you have any friends, any enemies, and if there is a ""unknown"" threat you have to discover. neutrals can be ""discovered"" if you a) probe them like you currently would b) if they aggro any blue/reds in the system, they become visible in local.in player controlled 0.0...these networks don't have to be pos based. we all know pos warfare is boring and doesn't need more added to it. they could simply be associated w/ stations if a ""hard target"" needs to be established. however this system will work only in the corps/alliance sov systems, and it will work the same as low sec. the only difference is, the level of sov will change the number x of blues/reds you can have visible. obviously lvl 1 could be significantly lower than the concord number, lvl 2 slightly less, lvl 3 on par/slightly above, lvl 4 sov may be unique in being able to show the blue/reds + neutrals.in npc 0.0...again, works the same as low sec however instead of concord networks, you would have the npc faction network for that region. this is where you could bring standings into it. for instance, the serpentis constellation in fountain may charge more per slot because you have high standings towards an opposing faction.i think this could cause a increase of roaming gangs. you have a incentive to travel to a different region and attack someone you don't know because they won't see you coming. this allows the recons to do their job, go into system, find targets that will show neutral to the gang, get the gang a warp in and pew pew. this also allows traders to move further through space with less chance of being noticed. this won't stop gate camps in low sec. they will still sit on those high sec/low sec gates and pop anything that comes through, because even if you don't show on local, you show in space. this will help small corp, solo pvp players. they can fly around without being noticed immediately and hunt targets."
9/6/2008,sorry but i firmly disagree with this idea..you can not improve player experience on a broader level with this..no matter how you present this idea..stagnation is not a valid game improvement tool..and thats exactly what this will bring to eve.
9/6/2008,i read the pdf and i like it. bounty hunters system is really something that is long overdue and this idea is a nice start. good luck!
9/6/2008,yep nice idea
9/6/2008,"so instead of double clicking on a can to see it's contents you'd single click a tab. seems like a waste of programing time to me! however the wallet divisions does sound like a good idea, although i don't see why i should have to pay for different divisions. i don't have to pay in real life, so why should i have to pay in game? realism and all that"
9/6/2008,"this thread was supposed to be about wallet divisions, but the hangar idea keeps rearing its ugly head too lolthe idea of personnel hangar divisions, was so you wouldn't have to have loads of cans littering your assets, meaning that you could check your assets without having to be docked in the same station as them, and you can sell them from a distance (something you can't do when they are in a secure can).and i don't agree with the paying for wallet divisions either edit: also updated the topic to try and get a csm to look, and respond..or..well.anything!"
9/6/2008,i could honestly swore i already supported this. i already have a draft for the submission template
9/6/2008,1000% agree and signed.should be part of the corp trader role and key off wallet access.ofc i also think we should have a new galactic sales order management skill along the lines of the corp mgmt skills to expand control of orders beyond one region at a time. after all some people just dont have the rl money to afford multi accts to sit alts in each sales region who dont do anything buy post and modify sales orders.
9/6/2008,i would appreciate if people would stop the supporting now and would like to discuss this further.i have written up a submission template which looks like this:thank you!
9/6/2008,"well.. first of all.. i do support it but there is another problem right now, if the person who created the market order looses his/her roles all market orders are deleted. the only way i see this working is to make the corp wallet you use for creating the order also be the owner of the order."
9/6/2008,/signed.
9/6/2008,"i'd like to note that if it's tied to corp wallet divisions permissions, then that eliminates a lot of griefing potential."
9/6/2008,"hi there!i'd like to address the situation with level 4 agents in nasesharafa solar system. while everybody understands that it's a part of your job to change things around to keep the environment of the game dynamic and interesting, you also have to remember that some of the players have stayed in certain systems for a very long time - sometimes years. also a lot of those players use high level missions as the sole source of their income in the game. thus removing agents from nasesharafa will create a situation where established players and entire alliances that regard the system as their home and have invested tremendous amounts of money and effort into it will be forced to move. on behalf of these players i would like to strongly encourage you to replace agents that are moving with an equal number of other agents of level 4 or to leave the existing ones in place. we do appreciate your understanding in that matter.best regards,residents of nasesharafa solar system"

9/6/2008,this actually sounds really exciting. could you maybe give some examples of how it could be used? also maybe talk about how to prevent it from being abused?
9/6/2008,instances are this way. ----------> wow
9/6/2008,"a little more detail:swg has not supported npc actors providing ""lines"" for a very long time. and the storyteller system is not instanced, but only invited characters can actually engage in combat with the npcs. that's really all the invite does; it's even further away from instancing than the eve deadspace mechanic is.primarily, the storyteller system currently supports deploying combat npcs -- a tool eve does not have -- though they do not provide xp, and the only loot they'll drop is whatever the storyteller / gm gives to the npcs for that express purpose. combat npcs can also be converted to flavor npcs, and a select few (e.g. life day wookiees) can only be flavor npcs. this means they stand stationary or perhaps loiter (walk around), purely to add atmosphere.a huge number of props and obstacles are also available to create locations for use as rp events. this includes everything from setting up parties to pvp events to archaeological digs to almost anything else, and every few months more get added.swg does an incredible job of supporting ""flavor"" rp, with systems like this as well as clothing, player housing, etc. eve, in turn, does an incredible job of supporting ""mechanics"" rp, with at least halfway-decent in-universe explanations for almost every mechanic and a skill system that's not just levels and talents.both have a lot they should learn from each other."
9/6/2008,"thanks for the good detailed explanation. the actors having lines were removed due to abuse.here's a common example for swg. player cities were a very big thing. so you want to have a big party. you go buy decorations, stages, various environment props, racial npcs that stand around, etc. they become part of the environment. you can walk on the stages, etc.or you want to do a pvp event. you drop a hundred stormtroopers, choose their level, etc. you can even put loot in npcs for your participants to get. to prevent any player from engaging the troopers, or abusing this sytem to level up your toon,the storyteller, or the one who places the items, is in charge. they can assign assistants to help with the event, and only the storyteller or the assistants can invite players to be involved. nobody else can interact with the npcs, thus ruining your good time.there were things like shuttles that you could make fly in and land, atats, all kinds of goodies.now bring it to eve. in space, you could spawn a fleet of ships crucial to the plot of your event. they would only interact with say your corp members if it was a corp event, or a select list of players that you invite.in stations, you could basically decorate an empty room anyway you want, or even an entire section of the station, all to support the event. they have no real value, but were a great moneysink and a wonderful way to immerse players into a little more rp and believable galaxy.since they have no xp values, or bounty values, and can't be interacted with outside of those in the event, it would be hard to abuse the system.they also worked in code so you could only place things a certain area from each other. you couldn't for example, surround a house with stormtroopers, so the person inside had no way of getting out. by always allowing a little space, you can't reverse abuse it either."
9/6/2008,"yep, do it"
9/6/2008,support the idea
9/6/2008,i support ofc.
9/6/2008,"i didn't say they'd be spread evenly, 4 to a corp, i was using the numbers for illustration. some will have 1, some will have 20, but 4 seems a plausible average. and what i suggested was not making lowsec valuable in the same sense that nullsec is valuable. you do not have the same tools to defend your space - no bubbles, cyno jammers, or non-titan jump bridges - your ore is maybe half as good even if my new ones are added, your complexes cap out at maybe 7/10, instead of 10/10, and you face sec status bleed every time you defend your space. unless ccp is staffed by idiots, you do not have to worry about alliances swooping down on lowsec space like it's high-value 0.0, given how many of them seem to show disdain for wide swathes of actual nullsec. and my point was that it is a pretty limited resource - players manage to find things to war over in the thousands of systems of player-owned 0.0, i'm sure they can find flashpoints when you narrow them down to 250 systems, even if the space isn't as good. and so what if alliances control the moons? i'm trying to create incentives for players to visit these systems, not determine what corp size you have to be at to do so. i want goonswarm and bloodmoney incorporated to both be able to visit lowsec and feel like they're not wasting their time. different parts of it, perhaps, but there should be something there in the areas where fw isn't doing the trick."
9/6/2008,"*sigh*.....the past couple of months i have noticed a decline in the general direction of our eve community. now while some things haven been for the better. i fear that our world is in trouble. please read this and consider what i say objectively and not ""only"" from your own view. try to, when you think of your own situations think of the ramifications your choices have made to others, even if it was beneficial towards you. (pirating, cheating....whatever)(this is going to be a lot)eve is in the state of it trying to better itself. developers trying new things out, while implementing ideas from either themselves, the csm, or even the eve pilots. even though good intentions are always meant for good outcomes, they are usually met with disastrous results. i am talking mainly about the financial stability of eve.what is the basis of financial stability? that is supply and demand. even though the eve economy is on the rise with new players, it is in a inflation due to over population. yes i know, how can eve such a huge and vast environment be overpopulated with only 30k players at any given time. the ratio to supply and demand can not be met equally. everyone is saying how mission runners are getting their isk too easily while flooding the market with resources reprocessed from loot, or t1 mods. miners have a problem in the end just trying to find a stable mining market to use to supply their business.the demand is not high enough to meet the supply that is given to the player by eve. asteroids are being mined out almost immediately after they have respawned. from either actual miners, actual miners with alt accounts, or by the infamous macrominer. the same goes for mission runners. i know a few mission runners that don't even bother to loot their missions (i especially) for the soul purpose that while in a l4 mission, you don't have the speed nor the patience to loot everything thats within a 50km radius from you in every direction. now some people do and can, either because they are dedicated enough to go get a different ship after doing the mission or because they have an alt account doing the looting for them, or again the infamous ninja that does everything while your busy.now we must understand that a majority, and i mean probably 80 to 90 percent, of feedback is from players angry at others. so now their judgment is impaired and their anger is aimed at another players success. something that takes a person a year or more to train for in eve is now nerfed because a player base was formed of new players that didn't understand that you need to put the time in for something worth while. but i hope this turns into a respectful argument from out eve community.how can we fix supply and demand? well that's easy. how does any country make to where demand runs high for a supply of something? that is war ladies and gentlemen. yes war, fighting, destroying of peoples ships and items. low sec has all of the demand in the world why, because people are fighting over territory so supply is in high demand to fuel this ambition.i do understand that eve is brought on the idea of the ""becareful or you could lose everything you worked for."" it is this concept causing the inflation. people are afriad of losing what they have in fear of never getting it back. 500m in implants, 100m to 500m ship with an extra 200m in mods and drones. to secure that kind of money would take a while for any high sec person. low sec populace is probably a days worth of gathering.in the next post i make in this topic i will suggest somethings to get things......going. ""introduce a little anarchyupset the established orderand everything becomes chaos. im an agent of chaos."" quote from heath ledger character the joker from tdk"
9/6/2008,"now lets fix the problem with macrominers while introducing demand for supply. why not make miners criminals after so much ore from a region is mined, constellation, or even solar system. after so much m3 is mined into one ship the person becomes flagged. lets face it. if all that mining was real and asteroids never respawned it would be a criminal act to mine something protected correct? which we could do. this would keep miners having to move or if they are willing enough, they could have some company to keep them safe from harm. how to actually regulate this is still toiling around in my head. how much ore is too much, when does it become a problem from the miner? how do we keep supply high enough to meet demand without killing the supply. if miners are flagged it would honestly get rid of macrominers. how you ask because they could just program to go somewhere else? ah yes but how far is somewhere else. if we did region it would be too far for them to fly and it would slow down mining considerably for them. almost completely ruining the market all together. this wouldnt be a problem for rookie pilots since they probably can't mine that much that fast anyways. also giving a range of people a chance to mine.also to help the demand with the supply. we have to make sure people can fill their demand reasonably due to losing more stuff now. how about increasing the yield and number of each asteroid in the belts. since now people will be flagged this will give a lot more other people a chance to mine.i want this to work even with people who like to solo mine. so the flagging issue is a consequence to the events at large. how to regulate i'll leave to suggestions. i really don't want people to have to go here and there to mine, even though this does bring more grouped base mining for people, using miners with haulers, going from system to system. giving bonus' to haulers when they carry only asteroid ore. so that people can go from belt to belt in different systems without having to stop as much. this will in turn bring out more miners to the game since their is now a steady market because only an actual person who can call themselves a miner can follow it. again increases demand by introducing the possibility of destroying the ship. will add more to this later, this is just a rough draft for people to read.lets start with the basic life expectancy of a character in eve. unless stupid, a character will keep their ship for a long time. they avoid things like roaches to light. why not make the consequences of losing stuff more light. still keep it severe but manageable. we have insurance for ships. why not have insurances for some more. how about letting people have more than one clone. (add skill books here) with the clone comes their implants. (again skill books here). since people will still be worried about losing their items due to the price (make it reasonable) demand for ships and items goes up do to the lose of items and ships. lower the value to go to war. but while a corp is in war, insurance to their ships, clones, and implants is reduced. even though i am a big fan of ""shut the hell up, this is eve and if you want to whine and cry, go play wow."" i mean hell that's why i joined was because of the freedom of choice you have in this game. i don't want that taken away.but i want this game to work. things cost too much as it is. decrease the number of resources needed to build stuff. this will cause more people to be able to lose it and just say ""screw you"" and work towards another one.well its late and this is a rough draft of what i wanted to say. please understand how much i like this game. i want things to work but with all things. to make things work you have to do what joker says ""introduce a little anarchyupset the established orderand everything becomes chaos.""whats wrong with chaos, its what fuels the stock market :)"
9/6/2008,"don't you mean the supply isn't high enough to meet the demand?is your post a pt?i can't agree with much that you have written. nerfing mining by making them able to get flagged (and thus destroyed) will lower the amount of minerals making it to market, hence forcing up prices (not sure what you want to happen to prices exactly from your post). the cost of items on the markets is low; invention has pushed down many t2 items considerably. if you played a year ago, you'd have noticed this.flagging miners just makes mining that much harder...having to move the ship from the sysytem/region etc to mine again would be a right pain. anyway, how would you track it? i could mine, get to near the flag limit, warp and dump at a station, and return to mining. flagging is an unworkable solution really. asteroids shouldn't be protected...they are lumps of rock that happen to have minerals in them.eve has competition on its market. sure, you can find some small price spikes etc as market pvpers do their thing. but, overall, undercutting and below-cost selling happens which brings prices down...there already is more warfare happening of late: its called factional warfare, go and try it out ;)take care,arithron"
9/6/2008,"argh, stupid ideas and even more stupid reading..u really didnt think enough before posting..and u are missing few clues on how economy works.."
9/6/2008,"your solution to ""inflation"" is to make mining a criminal activity? i sincerely hope you don't vote - and i don't mean for the csm, i mean in real life."
9/6/2008,"lets outlaw mining...ok, so we can do the following:1) increase the cost of modules.2) increase the cost of ships.3) decrease the avaliability of modules.4) decrease the avaliability of ships.5) decrease lag in jita...wait..what?6) remove an ""entry point"" for pirates (i'm on about can flipping)7) remove cap ships from the game (no fuel - as thats mined. no ships, as the mins to produce them are mined...)8) remove mission runners, as they won't have any ships / ammo to use9) remove pirates, (see note 8)i think i could go on...but i'm bored."
9/6/2008,"here is an idea for csm to really garner from this thread; ban the op from ever posting in the assembly hall again, cause he just doesnt get it at all."
9/6/2008,xutanis - do you even bother to research or consider what pilots are saynig or did you just start flapping your gums?i mean.... at least bother to do your research before you spout stuff off!/me thumbs downtalk about irrationality with eloquence.and i hate to break it to you... inflation is pretty low on the list of problems that need to be resolved.i can think of much worse things.. as i can imagine everyone else can as well.and criminalizing mining is just flat ******ed.macro-miners should be banned.. yes... but that's as far as it goes.miners who bother to sit there and grind away for 2 hours straight or more deserve the fruits of there labors... if that guy sits there all day and eats up an belt's worth of rock then he deserves that as well.its called first come first serve.... so long as they are still there actively communicating and present.macro-miners script it up and walk away... that's called cheating.some people work hard to get what they want....thats just 1 of thousands of issues i have with your so called proposal.
9/6/2008,hmm solve inflation by creating inflation..hmmm. look its upto to players to report macro miners..and its upto ccp to ban em..i see no real problems buying ships and stuff in emp[ire..and stfu about mission runners..they have to contend with thieves and griefers just like anyone else..and um i sell the mods i bring home...unless i realy need the mega zyd etc.so thats contributing to bringing down the price by meeting demand..which is exactly what we need..not some poorly written op by someone who would prolly benefit more from inflation
9/6/2008,"agreed. holy crap, they broke something that was working great. aaaaaa."
9/6/2008,"this has been posted before, but i can't find the thread offhand, so i'll just support this one as well. and yes, avoiding jita is a pain, which is why it's the hub. but if you're willing to make the extra jumps, you should be able to do so and still use the automated route-finding software. a slider for how much you prefer fewer players, in the style of the sec preference slider, would be quite handy."
9/6/2008,new idea dont autopilot

9/6/2008,"yes, if you know which systems to use to go around.but anyways, just an idea. as indicated by the responses, not vital by any means, but makes things slightly easier."
9/6/2008,the real problem is that so many routes lead through jita that plotting a course around jita often adds a few jumps.what we need are more gates around jita. if we had more routes around jita then the autopilit would pick them already anyways
9/6/2008,i like this idea. support 100%
9/6/2008,"scamming is legit in eve. caveat emptor, and all that."
9/6/2008,give me an option to filter away want to buy orders. and i'm happy. its a real pain if you want to look for a ship ....
9/6/2008,"let me think about it... **** your carebear-ideas and instead remove all warnings on contracts (including freeform warnings). sounds good, eh?"
9/6/2008,that's easy enough to do - set a minimum price of zero.
9/6/2008,"i would love to do massive courier hauling but the current setup is highly corupt and flawed many courier are either bait runs to get a hauler into low sec so that the shipper can blow them up and also get the bond.or they are fixed scams,, cans with huge single container cargos that 99% of the players impossible to haul forcing them to fail and loose their huge bondsand lastly these courier missions are way too vulnerable to pirates its like the courier system was designed to benefit pvpers and to hurt shippers and haulers.you need to have alot more sorters and filters including low sec filters and odd sized cargosif i were you to make the system functional and enjoyable i would take the real object out of the equasion: make it so that the shipper (at least in highsec space) has 100% reliability in the shipping system make it more of a postal system.have shippers buy boxes based on size,distance,risk,and special handling instructions (like rush or fedex)they could also set up bulk shipping contracts that would emulate single m3 boxes so that any number of shippers could cooperate in getting the shipment to its destonation only limited by their cargobay size.if a hauler is blowup or leaves the game, whatever,,, the box would return to the origin after a preset time to be shiped by another hauler,,, it is even possible for a pirate to still blow up a hauler and deliver the shipment himself for the hauling fee.this would mean that pvpers or scammers would not be able to profit from haulers as much but it would function and be enjoyable which it is not right now unless you want to risk 25 million isk to make 15,000 isk"
9/6/2008,"3) this would allow a battleship to be moved in a hauler over the course of 10 trips. this seems obviously wrong. the size cap does need to go up, but breaking down has to be limited by the contents of the package.he did say ore and minerals when he stated his example,, use some common sense,, he obviously didnt mean breaking down a battleship or capital ship into tiny little loads!"
9/6/2008,"to make this as simple as possible suggestion : -make it so only ew ships can fit ew modules -remove the ew cycle, make it like it was in 2004"
9/6/2008,to make this as simple as possible: don't fix what isn't broken.
9/6/2008,"it's notbroken, it just sucks."
9/6/2008,"currently the pilgrim needs a small buff.there are allready some topics about this matter , but as far as i know no csm member or dev responded to any of them.so i made my own here and i ask the csm to bring this to ccp.the thing the pilgrim needs is a range bonus on its neuts. but we really don't want curses that can use covert ops cloaks.the pilgrim currently has these bonusses :amarr cruiser skill bonus: 5% bonus to tracking disruptor effectiveness and 10% bonus to drone hit points and damage per level.recon ships skill bonus: 20% bonus to energy vampire and energy neutralizer transfer amount and -96% to -100% reduction in cloaking device cpu use per levelrole bonus: 200-unit reduction in liquid ozone consumption for cynosural field generation and 50% reduction in cynosural field duration.the curse has these bonusses :amarr cruiser skill bonus: 5% bonus to tracking disruptor effectiveness and 10% bonus to drone hit points and damage per level.recon ships skill bonus: 40% bonus to energy vampire and energy neutralizer range and 20% bonus to energy vampire and energy neutralizer transfer amount per levelthe basic idea behind the recon ships is that there are 2 versions . 1 of them is a stealthy ewar machine. and the other is basicly an e-war hac.if the pilgrim gets a buff , it shouldn't take away the role of the curse. so the curse should have either more neuting power or more range. the things the curse and pilgrim share are a tracking disruptor bonus , a drone damage and hitpoint bonus and a neut/nos draining amount bonus.the curse has a neut range bonus and the pilgrim has the ability to use a covert ops cloaking device.because the pilgrim lacks the range bonus for the neuts , its too hard to actually get your e-war to work on your target.solution :remove the drone damage bonus from the pilgrim and give it a 25 % range bonus for neuts. this way the curse keeps on having a range and damage edge over the pilgrim . but the pilgrim isn't totally useless anymore.for a very detailed but a litle dated post aout the amarr recon's problems press me"
9/6/2008,i would much rather see it loss the neut amount bonus for a range bonus and keep the drone bonus.neut/nos have minimal impact on missile boats and without any bonused weapons system it will get used even less solo.
9/6/2008,"okay i posted on other thread, and how does this csm work? you decide issues on your views? or the people's view?"
9/6/2008,move it.
9/6/2008,"since i already have the ""salvage drones"" skill on my main, i'm guessing they already thought of this, and just haven't implemented it yet"
9/6/2008,there was a feature in the old ea game (earth and beyond) that might be of great use here.asteroids come into contact with many things..... so why not make the archeology skill have a new second purpose. make there be a % chance of something being discovered within or impacted with any average asteroid. could be as small as a tech 2 part or a small can with somevaluable minerals in it or a bpc or bpo or for extremely large roids perhaps even a small damaged ship or some damaged gear. im not suggesting that every roid contain something just a small % chance. who knows might make mining intresting again.just imagine the delight of some n00b mining a veld rock and they have the archeology skill at level whatever and they pop a nice little suprise.ofc i would hope it is imp'd in such a way so that macro miners cant take advantage of it though :)
9/6/2008,1) shortcut folder(s) onto desktop2) open folder 3) delete content that is cache'd4) profit
9/6/2008,"heres a new suggestionwhy not make attributes contribute to actual ingame performance of the player?for exampleevery point into willpower adds o.5% more damage to all weapon systems used (so that be about 10-15% max)every point of charisma adds o.5% standings gains or tax/fee reductionevery point of perception adds o.5% to scan resolution and targeting rangeif you make all attributes tie into to somthing or even possible multiple somethings it would become an incintive to train learning skills to the max. the bonus should however be minute, minute as possibly o.25% instead of 0.5%"
9/6/2008,"i disagree with the whole concept of this thread. i'm a fairly new player and haven't found having to train learning skills have limited me at all. you just need to use your imagination and find ways of playing that you can do, there is plenty of activities to choose from. if you don't like the way the game works, you don't have to play."
9/6/2008,"just for reference i'll provide a little eve ""life story"".when i joined eve, i wanted to mine. i did my thing in 1.0 during my trial period, learned how some stuff worked, etc etc. i thought i'd get rich flying to low sec to mine, so i did, and promptly got popped in the belts. the guys who were there were nice enough, i talked w/ them and i realized mining was boring versus the rush i just had in getting blown up. i joined their pirate corp and started to yarr! in my first month of eve. how does this have to do with learning skills? how do you think a 1 month old pirate training nothing but learn skills does? crap. i trained the learning skills a few levels in, nothing special, but immediately started on getting that warp scramble, better gunnery skills, better tank skills. when your that new, training a basic skill from lvl1 to lvl 3 makes a huge difference(and heck, alot of basic skills you might not even have) and they take next to no time. instead of immediately training learning skills for over a month so later on in eve when i'm training rank 8 lvl 5 skills i can do it faster, i trained my basic ""survival"" skills so that i wouldn't get wtfbbq'd all day long.how has this affected me a year into eve? i consider, and the pilots around me consider me to be a good pvp pilot. i can fly 2 races of ships, t2 ships up to cruiser, and t2 fit my ships w/ good support skills. i've worked on my learning skills since that first month, here and there training them up. being able to fly worthwhile ships has allowed me to make isk and buy implants to make up for my learning skills. as i begin to train longer skills, i see the importance of those learning skills, and will likely be training them higher.in short, learning skills aren't a mistake. they are there for you to grind away immediately if you choose to, they will be there later on if you choose to get some immediate pew pew on. is it to your advantage to train them? yes! is it to your advantage to train gunnery skills? of course! however, the level at which you train them, and when is entirely up to you. if i were a newbie flying around in drone boats, i surely would be concentrating on my drone skills while gunnery sat on the back burner. remember, if you have every learning skill to level 5, you have the learning advantage against an opponent who doesn't. so at first that opponent may kick your butt, but later you may be able to kick his because you got to that new item/ship faster."
9/6/2008,"would need some balancing. the problem is that it would make it much easier to probe down missioners in lowsec, or for highsec wars."
9/6/2008,actually the way i saw it was that if you had access to more wrecks your chances of hitting a person running a mission.besides missions are in deadspace so you would be less likely to find wrecks there than wrecks left abandoned after a mission has been turned in.missioners are already easy to probe down by searching for drones since you don't deploy drones unless you are fighting somone.
9/6/2008,"dear csm,ccp recently updated thier drawing board and has future plans for exploration and science vessels.i have an extensive 15 page plan on my computer now about introducing soe ships as the premeire civillian science vessels where as ore would be seen as a equal in industry.the way i have it setup is a love hate realtionship between the two organizations they paritally can benifit from each other but most of the time one sides actions will short change the other.i also plan to have soe to be just as extensive as their ore counter parts, currently ore is used to mine ice, roids, and gas and a capitol to increase logistics ability. although expected of a mining ship this gives them into three different markets something thats soe is going to have a hard time getting to compete with. soe products would be for artifacts (current cosmos) exploration and data in an attempt to be competitive with ore and help generate this love hate relationship.the idea goes as far as from the simple civillian ship to its most advanced variant, a support capitol ship, and further expands to player owned empire mechanics similar to how moon miners are used the science equivalent would compete with it.the end idea is to allow for expansion of other civillian branches (salvage and hacking) to also be added and provide thier services that would assist thier allies and disassist thier not so friendly neighbors, ie: salvaging clears out riod belts of garbage keeping them healthy for miners while soe would rather keep those garbage places to look for important data that might collect there.the reason why i was delaying the publishing of the notes (let alone streamline them) was the fact i wanted to get a visual aspect done first. however time seems to be shortening for me so i think its in order to get this idea out early enough to make a decision impact on ccp before they go to far into this on thier own path and having a new suggestion getting introduced may cause hardships on the development team as they consider the new options vs how far they already got done.if you approve of making this suggestion to be heard or at least drafted, i would love to see support though suggestions thoughs and changes as this is for the entire eve player base not just myself before we, the players via csm, submit a finalized suggestion to ccp.update sept 13its up but not posting the link here yet as its not fully ready got alot of things to hammer out and artwork to get done with it.the little guy with too much imagination,<^-^>nova fox"
9/6/2008,could you maybe try and outline the range of ships and their specific use cases?the concept looks interesting indeed. i like the colour scheme.
9/6/2008,i was going to plan on posting this in full in features and ideas if csm agrees to at least take a look at it.
9/6/2008,i'd happily take a look
9/6/2008,"ill be assembeling the document into fourm format for easy reading then and ill hit this page up once its finished, if you have any possible bright ideas hit this thread up and ill see about it."
9/6/2008,"oh come on andrew. that's just stupid.do i really have to repeat what ankh said when she hit the nail right on it's head?and where did you read that my fellow delegates are terrible? you are obviously not reading my message. i used ""scary"", which is an informal way of expressing that one is surprised."
9/6/2008,"gotta love the inside baseball. as for the meeting, i agree that there's been rather a paucity of interesting topics recently, but i was under the impression that meetings were regularly scheduled. anyone staring at a big blank agenda can easily enough find some less-interesting topics still worthy of advancement, or bring some forward on the assembly hall and see what players have to say, or dredge for old topics that never got brought up for one reason or another. but with no meeting even on the horizon, and lame-duck syndrome starting to show up(for those not running next time, at least), it's not a surprise that laziness is setting in, and people have stopped really caring. it is, however, immensely unfortunate - not only does it mean that less is being done, but it casts a bit of a shadow upon the idea of player representation in mmos generally. i don't know that any other game has ever done something like a csm, and i'd hate to see it fail for procedural reasons or because those involved have given up on something or other. i'm not trying to attribute blame to anybody here - i'm not on the inside, i don't know if it's everybody's fault or nobody's. i'm just saying, the system seems not to have been working especially well for the last week or two. it's not time to throw up our hands in defeat, of course, but i would like to see the resumption of regularly scheduled meetings at the very least."
9/6/2008,"weekly meetings should be a desirable goal of the csm. if not, i definately agree that fortnightly meetings need to be held. if there aren't any agenda items suitable (if!), then why not discuss an issue/s for development purposes?heck, why not even get around to making some firm rules for meetings/csm scope etc....since you aren't allowed to raise these concerns in a voting meeting...interaction with the playerbase via the forums has always been poor for a number of the csm members. i'm starting to think that some weren't supported to do csm stuff, but to occupy a position to stop others doing csm stuff!it could, however, be a disenchantment with the process and csm, given the rocky beginnings and clear non-communication between many members (or negative communication between members). lets hope for better next time!take care,arithron"
9/6/2008,"well charlieyes, it would have been polite to answer a direct question on when we should have the next meeting and what that meeting should cover. if you had agreed with ank then you should have posted ""i agree with ank - seconded."" simply saying nothing looks like you weren't interested. of course you are not the only one who hasn't replied or commented on the question. but you are the only one posting in public disapproval of poor csm communications standards with sad-face smilies at the lack of activity - hence you have voluntarily claimed for yourself a higher standard than those you are critical of. from my perspective as chair i need feedback and comment from the other delegates on this question:do we wait until we get ccp feedback on the 2nd session issues? do we continue with the bi-weekly meetings? do we have a brainstorming session on general issues (such as those proposed by ank?) if we do are those in way way shape or form ""official""? are any of the delegates going to disagree with such a meeting being on the record? one of the topics ank suggests is improving 0.0 sovereignty warfare. are the goons going to veto that on the continuing grounds that nobody else on the csm has their ""specific knowledge"" of territorial warfare? if they do that is anything the rest of us going to say on the issue going to matter anyways? there are a lot of unanswered questions. we have 9 csm delegates and so far 1 solid answer and 1 ""what she said"". if i go ahead and schedule a meeting on that basis whats the chances somebody accuses me of ""making up the rules"" and ""re-writing the csm"" again? is more drama what we really need at this point?but the bottom line charlie is that you are occupying a seat on a committee. when the committee chair asks for suggestions on how we proceed with the meeting structure simply saying nothing and assuming that your silence is meant to signify assent for what somebody else says is poor practice whichever way you cut it.yeah right and this means that i'm looking at a fascinating ceiling-ornament not expressing exasperation with you."
9/6/2008,"well we've been thrown a curve-ball in the timing anyhow because the late august feedback on issues is being delayed. but the bigger issue is the lack of topic advocacy. i'm one of nine csm delegates. i can't be advocating everything. and i've drawn a huge amount of criticism already for advocating issues that the other csm's don't like for one reason or another (and those were issues i did care about!). if you look back through the last meetings a fairly high proportion came from me - if i'm not seeing anything at the moment that has either a) significant popular support and i perceive as being in the interest of eve or b) that i'm personally enthused over - then its probably wrong for me to just keep on scooping up issues for the sake of issues. if people care enough about an issue they are welcome to write to me and ask me to take a look at something and argue the point (and they can certainly do that for any other csms - but if that isn't happening then maybe the case is that people just don't care that much about the current issue threads). well like i said i asked almost two weeks ago what the other delegates wanted to do about upcoming meetings and i've now had two responses of eight, both in favor of no more formal meetings until the ccp feedback, but mooting the principle of a generalized brainstorming meeting instead. but as you can appreciate thats not exactly a consensus. as for lame-duck syndrome i assure you, if there was an issue in the assembly hall i genuinely felt passionate about i'd be supporting and pushing it for this last session. i obviously can't speak for anyone else on that matter though.well, this csm does have problems its true and once my turn is over i'll be pretty outspoken on what they are, but even that said i think you are being a little melodramatic. reality was that everyone had a bunch of issues they wanted promoted at the beginning and most of us have managed to do what we promised to do in our manifestos in turns of issue advocacy. speaking personally i think i've 80% of the manifesto stuff i wanted through to get a hearing and have only failed on the 0.0 sovereignty improvement and local chat replacement stuff. sure i'm disappointed about that but ultimately you don't get everything you want. but the point is once the csm's have done their best to meet their manifesto pledges it becomes a matter of reacting to genuine emergencies or inspired good ideas. at the moment there isn't much of either in the assembly hall. i think there is a sense that we've done as much as can be done on our individual election pledges. i for example simply don't believe we'll get movement on 0.0 issues in this csm now. i think a future team might, but this one is too divided and log-jammed on these issues. but its going to be vital that the electorate choose wisely."
9/6/2008,"not sure i like the way this thread is going. i voted for the csm so they could discuss and bring to ccp's attention the issues which the players felt were important, not to be taking cheap shots at each other and apparently not discussing anything at all. that is what rl elections and rl polititians are for (for example, look at prime minister's question time in the british parliament - an embarassment to the whole democratic process).i agree with herschel in that there haven't been many great and innovative topics in the ah lately, but i also agree with arithron when he said that there are plenty buried back in the assembly hall that are good ideas, have decent support, which were never raised.i would far rather the csm spend their limited time looking through some of those than wasting it attacking each other.but what do i know - i'm just a voter"
9/6/2008,"well mate, its for the csm's to advocate issues. and if the players (or alternates) want an issue advocated then they need to make the argument and persuade other players to support that issue and talk csm's into doing the advocacy. and sure, for what its worth i agree with you (and ank as it happens) who say it would be nice to have a brainstorming session in the absence of any issues on some important issues -> example (0.0 sov warfare, local chat removal, improving low-sec et etc) but we do need a consensus to change the focus of meetings otherwise it'll just get bitter and snowed under in recriminations again. 3of9 votes does not a consensus make. at this point i think its best left for the next csm to choose how it wants to handle itself. this one has had some successes, some failures, some pr triumphs and some forum fiascos and its for the next group to define its own rules and regs. with any number of the current csms either not standing next time or maybe not getting reelected it'd be a bit rum to spend the last month making rules for the next people i think. well, best can be hoped for is that the electorate factor that into their votes next time around. speaking personally i do feel we've found the limits of what kind of issues can get through the csm and i'm disappointed that limit prevents us addressing ""the big issues"" we were asked to consider, but there's a very real question on whether the essential nature of the csm would ever allow advocacy of those issues since it is a virtual council of ingame interest groups determined to argue their corner. given that the big issues are almost by definition political issues, its no surprise that agreement doesn't come easy (or indeed possible) between ideological enemies."
9/6/2008,"i completely disagree about prime ministers questions by the way. i think its the cornerstone of our democracy in the uk and its absolutely neccessary for a leader to stand up to robust debate and challenge on a regular basis. but on topic, this is what tends to happen towards the end of a term when most election promises have been kept and people have done what they said they'd do. some of us won't be standing again, others will. with the outstanding issues covered then some csm's are beginning their reelection campaigns early and a certain degree of backbiting and personal attacks on rivals is to be expected. ccp named us ""tribal chieftains of the internet"" not marrage guidance counselors so its not exactly a surprise to see delegates sharpening their boot-knives for a little character assassination in the run-up to the next poll. nothing is stopping you posting and getting them back onto the first page and trying to engage players and csm delegates in the discussion. if you feel i've missed something that you think i should support then let me know. make the argument and if it persuades me i'll support it. can't really say fairer than that."
9/6/2008,"i don't think it will cause any drama to go right ahead with it. people can't whine if they didn't voice their opinion in the first place. no. that would be silly if they did. even if they did during a meeting, then the logs will always be public and even the community can identify the reason why we are not discussiong the issue which bothers a lot of people."
9/6/2008,"interesting reading in all. can't say i buy the arguement about csm members having fulfilled their manifestos etc. csm are elected to represent the players first and foremost. it's the narrow focus of their own manifestos that have limited the effectiveness of the csm in the first place. of course, its easy to use the 5% rule regarding current issues in the assembly hall to justify non-activity. it's just not doing what you were elected to do. arithron"
9/6/2008,they say its more complicated than most of us can dare imagine ajoining some sort of a tabels have millions of different entries and this game would simply be an exhasting manpower effort...
9/6/2008,"i read this post last night, and i honestly couldn't sleep because i was still trying to wrap my mind around it.i think your idea is the best of local ""fixes"", however i think it's been over thought. just imagine how much more server side work this system could cause. as i thought more about your idea, i tried to think of a way to have a similar effect, but simpler. here is what i thought of...concord neural networks would be high sec/low sec. nothing to do with your npc standings, they will function for you. the networks would corp controlled. this means that your ceo/directors would have a new panel in the corp management tab where they are allowed to add x(maybe 5 or 10) number of blues, and x(maybe 5 or 10) number of reds. each slot could cost a certain amount of isk for adding, or changing these blues/reds. also, there would be a 24hr delay for concord to update the networks(kinda like a war dec notice). npc corps would always show in local due to being npc controlled.in high sec local would function as it currently does. everyone shows and blue/reds/nuets are shown.now, here is where the changes start...in low sec blues show up, only if they have you set blue also. reds show will show up also. the local counter will show the number of blues+reds+neutrals. this way you can see if you have any friends, any enemies, and if there is a ""unknown"" threat you have to discover. neutrals can be ""discovered"" if you a) probe them like you currently would b) if they aggro any blue/reds in the system, they become visible in local.in player controlled 0.0...these networks don't have to be pos based. we all know pos warfare is boring and doesn't need more added to it. they could simply be associated w/ stations if a ""hard target"" needs to be established. however this system will work only in the corps/alliance sov systems, and it will work the same as low sec. the only difference is, the level of sov will change the number x of blues/reds you can have visible. obviously lvl 1 could be significantly lower than the concord number, lvl 2 slightly less, lvl 3 on par/slightly above, lvl 4 sov may be unique in being able to show the blue/reds + neutrals.in npc 0.0...again, works the same as low sec however instead of concord networks, you would have the npc faction network for that region. this is where you could bring standings into it. for instance, the serpentis constellation in fountain may charge more per slot because you have high standings towards an opposing faction.i think this could cause a increase of roaming gangs. you have a incentive to travel to a different region and attack someone you don't know because they won't see you coming. this allows the recons to do their job, go into system, find targets that will show neutral to the gang, get the gang a warp in and pew pew. this also allows traders to move further through space with less chance of being noticed. this won't stop gate camps in low sec. they will still sit on those high sec/low sec gates and pop anything that comes through, because even if you don't show on local, you show in space. this will help small corp, solo pvp players. they can fly around without being noticed immediately and hunt targets."
9/6/2008,sorry but i firmly disagree with this idea..you can not improve player experience on a broader level with this..no matter how you present this idea..stagnation is not a valid game improvement tool..and thats exactly what this will bring to eve.
9/7/2008,full supportit's been out there for two years and it's still popular. should be a hint to ccp
9/7/2008,/signed
9/7/2008,"ccp likes these threads to go the math route, so here's my analysis:increasing optimal/falloff increases the arc length at that range, raising the necessary absolute velocity to achieve necessary radial velocity to avoid being hit by a turret. thus a range increases and tracking increases both work to increase the overall hit envelope for a turret.scorch:25% penalty to tracking -- lowers hit envelope50% bonus to range -- increases hit envelopeno goofy third bonus -- ammo is usefulconflagration:25% penalty to tracking -- lowers hit envelope50% penalty to range -- lowers hit envelopegoofy third bonus -- ammo sucks cap quickly :-/this is the pattern for all tech 2 short range ammo.long range ammo gets one bonus that increases hit envelope and one that reduces it. however, short range ammo gets two ""bonuses"" that both reduce hit envelope and a goofy bonus that further works to make it useless.motion to instead give short range ammo a tracking bonus so that, like long range ammo, it has one bonus and one penalty to its overall tracking envelope."
9/7/2008,"totally agree that t2 ammo needs some rebalancing!i make and sell one particular type that has been mentioned here, so i suppose you could say i have a vested interest. that said, the short-range ammo types have had a raw deal...maybe ccp wants ammo to be free? anyway, i'm hoping not and will ask some csm members to support this...take care,arithron"
9/7/2008,t2 ammo needs this
9/7/2008,"like i said, the ideas are boundless. what would be really cool is if ccp decided to put this into the game but before started a huge thread with brainstorming ideas on what the players what it to entail."
9/7/2008,"full support, great post"
9/7/2008,give em their pixels
9/7/2008,"supported, the naglfar needs this or a buff as it is the worst dread by far"
9/7/2008,"it looks good, you could also add a pitch for players who want to see if a ship class is for them. there are a lot of times players (especially new ones) who think bigger is better, waste a lot of time training for a ship and find out they hate it. in my opinion nothing is worse for business where a client cannot test a product before they buy it. you can change anything i said to fit in your proposal, but i think it's another valid reason why skill training should be changed a little bit.edit: supported your proposal"
9/7/2008,"the devs commented on this earlier.they said that the test server needs to be an exact replica as the real server.if you alter certain parts because 'it's just the test server' then it isn't the test server anymore.because if you alter training speeds and stuff like that, it will be harder to find bugs that give you better training times and stuff.damn, eve search doesn't wanna work with me =\"
9/7/2008,"i do see what your saying however ccp have already removed the pos's from sisi so it's not a exact rep of tq, even if they can't give us the option to pick what level of skills, i'm sure they can reset the skill training times all to rank 1 on it without dire comebacks.tbh it's ccp's choice however i'm done with the testserver until ccp either stop mirroring the damn thing or, when it is, the skills you have trained on there stay.i've lost count the number of times i've trained or even started to train to help them test like they have asked only for it to get mirrored, if a sub capital** guy wants to test carriers out, they either have to spend all that isk on tq and wait for the next mirror or train it on sis and hope to god they get round to learning the skills to a functinal level before the next mirror. both of which isn't really a good model for a testing server//area.**i've used capitals as its the biggest isk value skills"
9/7/2008,"against. fix the nano problem without throwing the whole game off balance. these changes affect everyone, in special blasterboats too much."
9/7/2008,stagnation? how so?
9/7/2008,"this idea is just as stupid as every other ""nerf local"" whine.if i'm in a roaming gang you want me to wait a minute to see if there is anything in local to hunt? or i have to drope scan probes in every system i enter? that's going to make it even harder to find and catch anybody when you're roaming.no support and please go back to your mining."
9/7/2008,"i was reading through the posts one at a time, and thinking that this was a good idea, then i got to a part where you started talking about fuel costs for cloaking devices, and you lost my support.never, ever, should there be a cost to cloak on a ship that was designed around cloaking being its primary defense.as long as any idea is based with this potentially in mind somewhere down the line, it should never be given thought."
9/7/2008,"yea, im sure your ok with the fact that 8 out of 10 guys you encounter in 0.0 are already cloaked or at a pos by the time you load system cause they saw you come into local. something needs to be done about that, and this is not that bad of an idea. to say that its not a problem is ignorance at its peak. 20 second scan times are not unheard of on cov ops frigates, so its not like its that much of a wait to see if the system has people in it. it would seem the only person whining in this thread is you really"
9/7/2008,absolutely. as long as it's protected by a role.

9/7/2008,"in modern air combat simulators, you have active and passive radar systems. while active radar provides the pilot with more situational awareness, it's disadvantage it gives away information to passive systems.so why not give local a switchable passive and active mode? active = as is (with the exception of not seeing players in passive mode) and passive mode = invisable (but able to see players in active mode).this system could only be implemented fairly if asteroid belts had to be scanned in order to be found, as hunting miners and ratters, would be too 'casually' easy. then the 'hunter(s)' would have to scan for belts etc. causing a brief portrait/name to appear in the 'passive' local window. the 'hunter' finds a ship, scans again, to locate it. this is even better than local, as it indicates 'intent' but if the miner/ratter is afk or not paying attention, they get ganked.the constellation solution would do, if asteroid belts weren't made scan-able."
9/7/2008,making local a little less local. i like it. good idea
9/7/2008,if u don't show local you boost cloaker recons to such extend you can not believe... gate camps become so more potent...0.0 becomes so much more deadly.i'm pretty sure every ratter will die in 0.0 daily. as a gang scouted by a cloaking ship will be virtually invisible now.and if u remove local every ratter will use scanner every 30secs. can be a demanding job for ccp servers. remember why local is showing reds and blues now. and pls be realistic.and auto updating constellation chat will kill the forge. what 1000 ppl updating every sec..if it won't slow the game though i can live with it. but honestly local is in favor of defender or weak atm.. do u really want to tip the ballance?
9/7/2008,support
9/7/2008,you are basically right except for one thing: no ratter will be killed because there will be no one ratting (or very few). why risk a ship and your pod killing rats when you can just run level 4's?
9/7/2008,i support
9/7/2008,"for the love of god, stop spamming support messages without checking the support box. if this is a joke it's not funny, if this is an alt bomb it's being run by an idiot, and if this is a legitimate outpouring of support i weep for the human race."
9/7/2008,simple question: this is one of the systems used by the farming and probably isk selling haulers?from the location and plethora of non-kill missions agents it seem to be one of them.
9/7/2008,"there you go, clicked your 'support box.' heart attack averted? you going to be ok now? freaking out over such tiny issues is bad for your health, man. maybe channel your tremendous concern for the human race into something a bit more proactive than proper forum procedures would net a more gratifying result?"
9/7/2008,"answer is no. it's a base used by several corporations, mine included, to run level 3 and 4 missions, to help support our attempts to keep pirating out of the area. i think that was explained a in a couple of previous posts, but there you go, one more for the road."
9/7/2008,it just doesn't make sense to nerf suk. there is not much in the way of isk income from rats so why take the missions. please sort this out!
9/7/2008,"actually, not so tiny. people can spam they support an issue as often as you like, but it doesn't become an offical +1 until it's done. it's not exactly a tough thing to do - makes you look kinda dim not to do it really.it's the difference between an issue having maybe 10 supports of 27 posts or 24 supports of 27 - the 24/27 version looks much more emphatically supported to people not going into the thread, and is more likely to draw support & attention from csm.as for me - i don't even know where this system is, so i'm not supporting"

9/7/2008,"i never played swg, and probably would have if i knew something like that existed. it sounds like a fantastic tool for eve.however, it could degrade into characters creating very stupid events that just clog up the stations they're set in. if implemented, it shouldn't be easily available to anyone who wants to make use of it. approval should be requested from some department in the isd, and upon granting approval the person/corporation could set up their event. this would keep the ccp with some control over what goes on in their world while allowing players to further contribute to the story of eve."
9/7/2008,"if it happens in-station, it has to happen inside your corp office(post-ambulation). does that sound like a reasonable fix?"
9/7/2008,"actually, that's another aspect i forgot to mention, and solves the issue as well as having it in your corp office.in swg, you were limited to where you could place these things. they could not be in npc cities. they really could only be out in the open wild, or in your player city. this prevented the very issue you are talking about.so for eve, yeah, corp offices work, or you could rent a bar for the night, and for space, well space is huge, so if you put in a 10 au from any object in space, you're probably ok."
9/7/2008,"hmm, very interesting idea here. some small issues though.i know you have no put up ships for each race yet but im going to go with what i have read here so far.there is already a module that increases the speed of ships under skirmish warfare. and im curious as to why you say there are only 3 sets of warfare links. as a remeber there are 5: armor, siege, information, skirmish, and minning. but the minning one really dose not count for this discussion. and as far as this newly proposed module is concerned i'm not sure people will use it when they have a slipnier or claymore that can give a much higher and longer range bonus then your module.i love the positional engagement idea. all ships are in this position so they get a bonus, so on and so forth. the only issue comes down to blob warfare where that will make a fleet super and male your ship carrying that module pop faster then anything.an unfortunate bit of reality is this. any ship that is at the core of a fleets strategy or bonuses will suffer this problem. in a fleet battle that ship will be primaried. and, as a general rule, no matter what the ship can do it will die. even the speed tank idea will not give it much more survivability. remember there are ships out there that can move faster then it and are far cheaper. even if it had the speed to deal with close range combat, it would still fall victim to a sniper ship or sniper fleet. at that range the transversal (the number you want to get really high to avoid damage) will be so low reletive to the sniper that its going to hit the target. the unfortunate bit is that in order to make the ships tank with speed you need to get them moving so fast that they become invulnerable to all ships and drones.your bonus to abs seems a little to good, and here is why. using the t2 ab speed (135% bonus to speed) and doubling it for your proposed bonus (270%) and adding another 50% for zor's custom navagtion link and other implants that give bonuses to afterburners (405%) and skills (25% for acceleration control) is going to be about 506.25% bonus to speed. note that the proposed bonus to speed for the new mwds is going to be 500%. so basicly you have made a much cheaper and easier to run mwd. this is just a pilot and his ship. there is a good reason why few battleship pilots equip mwds on their ships. they are hard to run and unless you need them to get your guns into range they are not worth the time or energy. also ships with this would quickly become solo gank machines because of their speed. and that is something that ccp has been working a lot over the past couple of years to get away from.these are really interesting ideas but i really think they need a lot more working out. the biggest problem with making ship designs is trying to figure out how the ship could be used in a way that you had not intended. and even then you are not garenteed to make a ballanced ship. keep up the idea and see where it goes man. best of luck to yah."
9/7/2008,completely agree
9/7/2008,"agree, including the part about the ship owner getting the 100k"
9/7/2008,fking makes sense. but meh... lol ccp logics.
9/7/2008,"sadly jade is correct. as annoying as it is (to have corps singled out of fleets), the fact remains that changing it would open it up to wardec avoidance. a corporation would be able to dodge a wardec by moving/reforming in fw and still remain intact. that is unacceptable as it would prevent corporations being destroyed/disbanded, which is an important mechanic in eve's player run economy.if a corporation in fw was completely unable to affect the market in any (something which would likely be impossible) then you could do it."
9/7/2008,"i just bought a freighter and am helping my corpies move across system when i find out that i can't place standard/secure containers in the cargohold. finding this rather annoying & i can't see any reason for it, i'm suggesting that this be rectified perhaps by allowing giant and huge containers to be placed in the cargo, also that freight containers could be given a capacity bonus."
9/7/2008,giant secure container takes 3000 m3 but has room in it for 3950 m3. that is the reason why you can't put them in freighters. you can put freight containers in freighter tho as they are specifically for that purpose.
9/7/2008,"that's a truly awful explanation, so what your saying is a freighter can't store containers that compress their cargo because...?"
9/7/2008,yes that makes sense. it's just a pain in the proverbial but hey less lag is a good thing.
9/7/2008,that is how it is designed. in my opinion it's quite ok. if you need more room then train your freighter skill higher or if you need to move then 980 000 m3 then you will need multiple trips.
9/7/2008,"you're quite missing the point, i don't need more room i am moving all my corpies stuff across the galaxy now i would like to put each of the 15 corpies stuff into indiviual containers so it doesn't all get mixed up but i can't cause i can only use freight containers."
9/7/2008,you should be at least be able to put the huge/giant containers into a freighter aswell as the freight ones in my opinion.
9/7/2008,"i think i read somewhere that the in-game justification for this is that you can't put the 'compressing' containers into a cargo hold (unless they are stacked and not assembled) because the cargo bays of these ships are already of the 'compressing' type - so it's like putting a large can inside a giant can - you can't do that either.however, i do think there is room in the game for a slightly smaller non-compressing container a tad smaller than the general freight container - at 100k m3 it's a bit of a jump from the 3,950 you get off the next size down (or would, if you could even use the buggers, which you can't). even a 50k cumet would be a help logistically."
9/7/2008,"ccp does a lot of really strange things with cargo space, and this is just one of them. yes, freighters need more sizes of containers. either that or just make non-compressive cargo dividers items arbitrary size - you can change the size on the fly, and use them in any ship, if you want to containerize at an arbitrary size(though obviously, it can't be bigger than your remaining hold or smaller than the items within it). everybody from freighters to interceptors could make use of them in a worthwhile fashion. of course, i don't know if the database would like that proposal, but it's plausible and would be incredibly worthwhile."
9/7/2008,support my own thread.
9/7/2008,"if goonswarm wants to hold a system, then bloodmoney incorporated is definitely wasting their time looking for any resources there.0.0 alliances have their playground. if you don't want to have growing corps hide in highsec, there needs to be a gradual progression of difficulty.if one entity discovers they can hold 20 viceroyalties it would be a disaster. they would make far more than they ever could in 0.0, and it would be completely broken.i don't think the developers have any vision of moving the large scale endgame anywhere but 0.0."
9/7/2008,"of course not. we're not stupid enough to try to horn in on the dysprosium market. my point was that lowsec should accommodate both, not that we can go head to head. my vision is of a fairly steady progression, from empire space(low risk, low commitment, low reward), to fw lowsec(medium risk, low commitment, low reward for non-rpers), to non-fw lowsec(medium risk, high commitment, decent rewards), to npc nullsec(high risk, medium commitment, high reward), to player-owned nullsec(high risk, high commitment, spectacular reward). only the last supports all-out private war on a large scale, either financially or logistically. four of those exist correctly at present, but private lowsec is a glaring hole, and thus i try to address it. not with artificial wars, but with a proper valuation. lowsec should be noticeably more profitable than highsec - you get better ore, better agents, better rats, better complexes, and you can randomly steal other people's stuff if you care to. it should be noticeably less profitable than 0.0 - worse ore, worse rats, worse complexes, worse agents, and no ability to build up all the nice sov-required structures. if it fits into that zone, then you don't need viceroy systems, because the level of reward will attract the kind of corps you want. anybody big enough to hold 0.0 space will do so, because it's just better, so what you get will be the 20-man corps who have a taste for the dangerous, while the 200-man corps with a taste for capital warfare will go to where the real money is instead. a 200-man corp who chooses to roll over lowsec will be wasting their abilities(barring the odd dysprosium moon), so it'll turn into a training ground for growing corps and a playground for established small corps who want a system to call their own.edit: how exactly did i mess up ""aggress"" with ""address""?"
9/7/2008,"some things you might want to add to the rewards section.1. if you control a viceroy you should be able to get a percentage of the refinery tax's in your systems. up to 10%. as this is based upon the already set tax, you'd be getting 10% of the 5% tax that the stations charge. or 0.5% of the tax would come to your corp. 2. viceroy entitlement would allow moon mining in a 0.4 you control. this is only allowed to the viceroy. so while another corp could take out your tower, they couldn't moon mine there without owning the system in their viceroy.3. make standings effect your viceroyship holding. this works in two ways, one it gives the corp controlling it a reason to rat/explore/defend their area. ship kills (npc and player) in your controlled systems count towards your control of the system(s). limit of say 5 per day. this would make it so that 0.0 alliances couldn't control one with an alt corp and just sit there. they'd have to actively 'work' their space to keep it under their control.4. ability to add agents to your viceroy stations using the sov 3 system time progression of holding. simple. you holding your viceroy for 5 weeks you can begin 'luring' agents there. this has a cost and you can use lp's with your empire faction the space your holding is in to lure better agents.5. ability to 'upgrade' the services on npc stations in your viceroy. tired of a 30% refinery in your viceroy making it so no one refines there? np, upgrade it! signifigant cost for this, but would help make area's more profitable.6. upgrades you put in place are attackable, so if their brought down time and time again until you repair them. then you are losing standing with your viceroy and the attackers are gaining as a 'strong corp' that could hold it.7. a percentage of all services goes to the viceroy corp.hope that helps."
9/7/2008,"no no no... they will still have an entry point - they can mine to get their law-breaking jolliesbut would that mean it would be entirely lawful to can flip the renegade miners, or would you just count as an accomplice to the heineous crime of setting laser to rock?"
9/7/2008,"the 'nano issue' has seen a lot of threads. some of the ideas are good, some aren't. hopefully this one gets some attention.problem: mwd is too easy to perma-run on a nano fitsolution: increase cap usage for mwds (not the cap penalty), possibly add a ship bonus for cap usage on interceptors and other ships meant to be speed-tankedeffects:nanos are still a viable option, but their 'flight time' is limited.a ship can be made to perma-run the mwd, but uses slots for cap mods, hurting the nano and/or removing valuable mid slotsmwd remains useful for closing distance and escapingeverybody wins."
9/7/2008,"what ships are you flying that a mwd permaruns? the pvp fit where i can run my mwd for more than three cycles withoiut crippling myself is rare. now, i tend to run beefy blaster boats, not nano ships, but those things are utter pigs as-is. a battleship mwd uses more cap than an entire large cap booster provides, and the cruiser and frigate ones use significant portions of their respective boosters. i can't imagine making them worse would actually improve combat, it'd just annihilate legitimate fits as well as degenerate ones."
9/7/2008,"your forgetting that this wld gimp the ships that have to sacrifice their tanks/ewar etc to fit a mwd even more, which is a bad thing, and was one of ccps reasons for trying to remove the ""need for nano.."" (owww i trademark that one :d)"
9/7/2008,"i agree with these above two comments, but only to a point. imho, the only reason a mwd really cripples a 'standard' fit is the capacitor penalty. more activation cost (especially if the penalty was gone) wouldn't cripple these fits as bad. the point remains, however, getting four or five cycles without sacrificing any slots for cap mods leads to this module's abuse."
9/7/2008,"i'll just give an example, but shouldn't the faction items available on the lp market be better then the tech ii equipment? and the storyline mission items be better then the tech i items?caldari navy x-large shield booster110 million isk (contract buy)60 million isk thru lp600 hp400 power/cycle4 secondsx-large shield booster2.7 million isk600 hp400 power/cycle5 secondssame ideal with the shield boost amplifier. a 1.5% increase.i also got a few bpc from cosmos missions where the tech i version was better then the bpc i got. considering it would cost 4 million to build one unit of crap, verses the 5k isk counterpart which ends up being better.i think/suggest ccp should re-evaluate their storyline/faction items to be a little bit better then their tech i/ii counterparts.what do you guys think?"
9/7/2008,"um.you do realise that the cn variant is 25% better in terms of hp/sec, right? right?and that shield boosters are one of the most pimpable items in the game, going all the way up to the billions for the top deadspace stuff?"
9/7/2008,"yes i do understand that, but for a 1 sec cycle difference shouldn't be as staggering as it is.maybe a 2 sec difference? or 50 power/cycle needed? i'm not talking like make it magical or anything, just better then it really is."
9/7/2008,"subtracting a ""mere"" one second is a 20% reduction, yielding a 25% increase in tank. that's huge. saying that one second doesn't matter is like saying that adding one second to each operation your computer does should be irrelevant, when it would actually slow it down by a factor of a few billion. it's not the absolute size that matters, it's the relative size. you picked about the worst possible example to support your point here - cnxlsb are one of the better big-faction items. if you want to complain, start looking at factional hardeners, for example. even those are plausible, because of the fact that they're far easier to fit, but they're generally not worth the money. but the shield boosters definitely are if you're using them on the right ship - heck, 110 mil is a bargain for something like a pvp golem."
9/7/2008,"fw nodes have been seeing a lot of combat that is almost as big (in terms of numbers, and capitals) as 0.0 big battles. most of the 0.0 battles get the uber nodes to reduce lag, yet the fw nodes are still crap. thus exceedingly bad lag. could ccp please reinforce the fw nodes so we can get some good fights without waiting 5 minutes to lock something?"
9/7/2008,"no, they have said they want small gang warfare for fw so they obviouslly aren't going to do this.i for all agree with them, i don't think fw should be 0.0 lite with all the blobs and crap, but more about real pvp fun."

9/7/2008,"a fair point. and as you've said above, you've taken enough flak over the last few months that i can't blame you for trying not to rock the boat. as i said, people are getting lazy. also as i said, i'm not trying to blame anybody - not you, not lvv, nobody. i don't know who is at fault, nor do i have any way of knowing. i'm just trying to assert that there is a fault, something that all involved seem to agree on - you and lvv in words, the other seven by their silence. yeah, a touch melodramatic. i'm just annoyed by ccp's tendency towards excessive ambition - they do immensely cool things, but because they go haring off in a thousand directions at once, 999 of them fall short due to lack of support. the csm is not failing merely because there's been a couple slow weeks, but i don't want to see it fail at all. thus i'm raising the issue after two weeks, instead of waiting two months and having it be irreparable. yeah, but that's always vital. the scariest thing about politicians saying ""this is the most important election of our lives"" is that they're usually right - they all matter, as much as the institution that they're getting voted into matters. obviously, the csm is not a government, not even in-game, but if the csm matters, and i think it does, then its elections matter just as much. and if you can't work on promises, work on the ideas of others. it's not as flashy, and it's way more disjoint, but it's far better than giving up."

9/8/2008,"seriously supported.my naglfar will never see the light of day if this wont change,maybe i just reprocess it.its not nice to hear that you suck in everything and will be primaried becauseyou have the suckiest tank."
9/8/2008,supported.
9/8/2008,nice
9/8/2008,this really needs to be fixed.
9/8/2008,another good example:
9/8/2008,"yes, this is something that would reduce a lot of the annoyances after doing a cache reset or a patch upgrade - especially for those of us who use several alts across multiple accounts!please make this a priority!"
9/8/2008,this would be awesome.

9/8/2008,"this would benefit corps, sure, but how is a lone trader supposed to compete with a corp full of players constantly subtracting 1 isk from their corp's orders? it's hard enough for the little guy as is."

9/8/2008,makes sense.
9/8/2008,"um, what's that got to do with anything? leaving aside the fact that stations don't change hands all that often, if an alliance decides to spend the isk on a hypothetical outpost upgrade to provide an agent then that's an investment they're making, just like adding a refinery upgrade."
9/8/2008,"so if hi-sec missions were made more entertaining but less lucrative, you'd quit? being able to endlessly grind dull, safe, repetitive kill-missions is the only thing keeping you subscribed?"
9/8/2008,"the average idea here by anti mission guys is make them more grind and less rewarding, nerfing them both ways. they see them as mining arknor or bistot and want them to move them to mining ice. especially ki an and his clones, not a surprise has he has stated more than once his pure hatred for mission runners. to avoid large or huge after effects mission running must be changes with the chisel, doing a small change and then looking the effects (some of the new missions seem to go that way from the reports of people running them), you and your friends want want to sue the sledgehammer."
9/8/2008,i support this since they got rid of lofty scams and made it harder to high sec gank the reward for missioning/cearbearing is to high v risk ccp say there game is equal on riskvreward but they are missing the fact that carebearing has to risk no more part from beeing scammed in jita but thats there own fault for not reading and nowing what is and what not ^^fix the risk in high sec
9/8/2008,people who advocate the nerf of hi sec never play in high sec...
9/8/2008,"sorry, but i missed the part about making mission interesting in the op.mixing in pvp dangers does not make the mission interesting ... it's still the same mission just lot more dangerous.oh yeah, i wrote it's the last thing keeping me here ... that should imply i tried lots of other things ... seems you did not catch that ..."
9/8/2008,"moving all lvl4 agents to 0.0 is dream of big 0.0 alliances.lvl3s in lowsec actually by product of this dream and not even useful for anything. probably ratting in lowsec better than farming lvl3s.you can not group against of any 0.0 alliance. big or small... you go there in cloak ships and farm belts :) because any alliance even a npc station based corp is in 0.0 for constant pvp chance, not for the money..the will of the op is asking faction fitted npc ships run into 0.0 and die in their gate camps...btw dropping of lp and isk generated will make faction stuff much more expensive and carebear stuff much more cheaper... and a quite many account cancellations. because there are many ppls in this game playing game for occasional lvl4s they do in relative safety of high sec...because its a challanging while staying comfortable...fyi this game penalize ship+pod loss heavily .im against this proposal..."
9/8/2008,"seems you didn't catch that i said ""entertaining"", not ""dangerous"". seriously, all you want to do is log in, and do the same old kill missions, lining up a bunch of completely predictable red + and popping them? kill missions are basically space invaders on a nice 3d backdrop."
9/8/2008,"and who are u that u can judge what peoples should do or should not, and what would entertain others? if they like to do this than they should able to do this.every empire cb could cry.....why so big part of eve universe is 0.0 so they cant play there for the money they pay in peace in style they like without joining 0.0 alliances???so lets make every 0.0 to highsec ........would be that not a bit sux? because what the guys here suggest is the same with the cb'sp.s.: no im not a chinese isk farmer, my english sux just because i never learned english and because the majority of the forums would not understand what i write if i would use my mother language"
9/8/2008,"here is a solution to the op's problem, doesn't need any intervention from ccp and that can be done today!1. if you just hate carebear missioners and;2. this hatred propels your nerd rage to a fever pitch. you can;3. get some of your nerd raging buddies together and start invading high sec missions. 4. while there, steal loot, salvage, whatever you like. 5. hell, shoot a few rats and get some bounties while you are at it and, of course;6. even get the chance of annoying a poor carebear, to the point where it decides to open fire on your flashy ass;7. profit... ...or you can just continue to whine for ccp to do your job for you, but i wouldn't hold my breath for that..."
9/8/2008,the biggest problem in 0.0 is simply that it isn't scalable. you reach belt saturation point ratters and miners normally very quickly. it takes a lot of intelligence to keep a few systems safe enough for people in big pve fit ships to come out to make isk. this requires a lot of people to maintain while at the same time reducing the rewards. 3 ratters can take care of 12 belts. 2 can with really nice fits and skills.in u4 in syndicate their is an l4 kill agent q20 and an entire corp use to pay a fee just to have access to that station. that single agent was worth the 150m a month tax on that corp. that is my biggest problem with both sides. empire argues that 0.0 can make 60m/hour ratting and leave them alone and 0.0 people complain that that only happens every third blue moon on a tuesday when they are mystically alone in system. i normally mine 0.0 but have been running l3 and l4 mission (courier and kill) in lowsec and now l3 kill mission in high sec to get standings for a datacore agent. i have seen both sides the last few weeks. empire is even more dangerous for me because of war decs on my main.
9/8/2008,"damb dude, you're mighty defensive about a bunch of stuff i didn't say. i thought it was a pretty uncontentious assertion to say that missions in eve are dull and unimaginative."
9/8/2008,atm caldari stations have a 35km docking range from the undock point wich is something that should be lowerd to that of some of the gallente stations wich atm only has about 1km from undock to your out of docking range.it should never be completly safe to undock from some of the stations like it is today.

9/8/2008,i understand that ccp developed some pos modules for freeing/enslaving. this was when the move to the lp store meant the 'free the slaves' agent offer was scrapped.time for implementation?
9/8/2008,"hello all, i posted this in f&i and got some pretty good reception, and now im sending it to the assembly hall for votingwarning, alot of text, but please continue to readmy idea would require a bit of work, but i honestly think it is a very good ideaweve all heard about the pirates / alliance members complaining endlessly about how carebears can make horrid amounts of money in high security with virtually no risk, save ninja salvagers and can flippers, well, while i was having a long debate with someone in f&i about ninja salvaging, for some reason this idea popped into my headwhy not make agents ""contractable"" to alliances and corporations, this idea is pretty refined, and didnt have many wrinkles to start out with, but the ones that were found were ironed out, here are the main ones:agents can only be placed inside 0.3 sec systems or below so you must have a pos or outpost in 0.3 space or below, no high sec agents (this idea is out there to help pirates an alliances, not high sec dwellers even more, another one i can recall, is that again, since this would be to help ease pirates and alliances, all these agents would give payouts in between lvl. 4 and lvl. 5 agents (in both monetary, and lp, and standings rates), there would also be no faction standings requirment to use agents for any corp, the rp reason: the empires are having a flood of [npc] pirate corp activity, and now there are simply not enough pilots in high security to deal with the influx of these activities, and the empires are now allowing outsourcing, from the pirate rp point of view: the empires are putting more pressure on them, so they need help to fight against the empiresthere will also be a ""penalty"" so to speak for having an agent in your sovereign space, now, while you can hire an agent to work for you, and do get loyalty points from them, the agents do not come with an lp store, you would have to go to one of that npc corps stations to use the lp you have earned with themok, my idea is pretty simple, allow alliances and corporations to hire agents for their corporation for a price, here is the price list:there will be a generic agent level in between lvl. 4 and lvl. 5 agents, so to speak, a lvl. 4.5 agentthe price for this agent would be approx in between my original prices for lvl. 4 and lvl. 5 agentsto hire these agents, it would cost approximately 395million per week, if your going to hire this agent, it needs to be something you plan on doing, not just hiring as a cash cow you can use when you lose one to many shipsnow, since we all know many alliances could easily afford this price, as well as some corps, there will also be limits on how many agents can be hiredalliances----------------------------------------a maximum of 8 of these agentscorporations--------------------------------------a maximum of 3 of these agents(same prices apply for both alliances and corporations)ok now that we have the prices and limits out, now locationwhen you hire an agent, you have to put that agent up in a pos or outpost, if you place them at a pos, they have to be placed into a habitation module anchored around a pos (living quarters for the agent) and they must be destroyable, if their habitation module is destroyed, you lose that agent (obviously, he's dead) but also, if they are killed, there is a minimal two-week ""cooldown"" period towards all corporation, and you can no longer hire agents from any corporation for that two week period, in addition to that, all other agents from all corporations are ""pulled out"" by the corporation, and again, you must wait two weeks before you can hire another agent from them (and you dont get a refund)now if the agent is put at an outpost, no habitation module is needed, they are simply placed inside the outpostanother limitation would be that to use that agent, you must be a"
9/8/2008,"must be a part of that corporation / alliance to use any agents they have hired,ok, now in f&i we got a few concerns about alliances making alt / ghost corps to hire practicaly infinite amounts of agents, i have also thought of a way around that as wellagain, the limitation that is already in place is that you must be a part of a corp / alliance to use their agent, well this one has to deal with makine a ton of alt corps, hiring a bunch of agents, then joining the alliance with those addition of a ton of agents, here is the way around that:while individual corps can hire agents, if that corp has an agent, and then joins an alliance, he loses access to all the agents he has hired immediately (and again, no refunds) and then he is part of the alliance, and thus can now use the agents of that alliancethis also works both ways, if your part of an alliance with access to agents, and leave, you lose access to that agent immediately, simple as that, but also another catch is that you must also wait a mandatory 2 week ""cooldown period"" after you leave an alliance before you can hire any agents of any npc corpnow, there is still the concern of hiring those ghost corps, but until we can find another way around it, its a problem that would have to stay, because tbph, its no different than most pvp'ers having mission running alts in dodixie and auniathe main reason i thought of this idea is because to be perfectly honest, low sec, and 00 space should be at the least, more profitable than high security, imo and in many other opinions more risk should = more reward, and while this idea might not clear up everything and all the problems that exist, it would help clear up a tremendous amount 'friction' between the pvpe'ers and the pve'ers, and with this way, it doesnt ""nerf"" anyone's profession or occupation, its purely a choice that im almost 100% sure that many would use if the option was simply there-----------------------------------------------------------this concludes my proposal, thank you for reading, please show your support for this idea"
9/8/2008,"i supported the principle of this idea in the other thread on this topic and i'll support it again here. however, i think this is actually a significantly worse proposal than the one in the other thread. arbitrary limits on how many agents can be hired are a bad thing - if l5 missions ever become as good as they should be, the goonspace l5 agent will reside in a system as laggy as motsu. there should be costs, and fairly serious ones, but hard caps are usually a sign of poor design, especially in the context of eve. how about instead making a new corp management skill, or even skill tree, for the hiring of these agents? say, one skill for number of agents(1/3/10/50/unlimited) at rank 6 or so, one skill for level your corp can hire(skill level = max agent level) at rank 8 or so, and one skill for quality(-20/-10/0/10/20) at rank 10 or so. it would require a large sp investment, give the ceo skills besides corp size, and provide real progression. also, no agents in poses, they need an outpost. lowsec should have enough agents native to it that it won't need new ones installed by players."
9/8/2008,what was done for graphics should be done for audio! quite a few people actually appreciate audio more than they appreciate graphics. to me snazzy graphics are fairly unimportant but an immersive audio experience would transform the game.from a pilot's perspective audio has the ability to attract attention. graphics can convey more information but the pilot has to actually look at them to read them. audio rarely conveys as much information but has the advantage that it can attract the pilot's attention as/when/if needed.some specific suggestions:ui informational:incoming ordnance sounds different with different levels of shield/armour/hull.weapons/modules sound different at lower levels of capacitor.drones start to complain () when they come under fire.more atmosphere:radio chatter at gates and outside stations. there is/used to be some but it's very quiet if it's still there at all.the sound of rocks knocking together in asteroid belts (thing of the rock banging in blair witch project).sound of distant electronics if a probe is activated while in the same grid as the player.
9/8/2008,"eve has sound? </obligatory>yes, the sound system needs a lot of work. aside from eve voice, i play with sound off, and it's a real shame that it has to be that way. we need fewer annoyances, more information, and the ability to warp without deafening yourself."
9/8/2008,+1 eve sound is horrible but what bugs me more is the constant buzzing i get when i have it disabled >.>
9/8/2008,"yeah.update and resample all of the sounds in the game.some are... uh... idiotic, like the oversized rubber-band sound of rail guns or the gating-gun audio of a pulse laser.with the advancement of audio peripherals available the sound of a 1400mm should be a heck of a lot more impressive; deep and bassy with a lot of throat. currently the only weapon sound that's half way impressive is a tachyon discharge."
9/8/2008,if only you could mute that darn warp sound and the jukebox. (do like the songs but after 5 years they tend to get to my nerve)please?
9/8/2008,"go thread, go!"
9/8/2008,"wars should flag all pilots for the duration of the war period, regardless if they jump corp (they're still flagged until the end of that billing cycle).make wars last 30 days.allow victory conditions using an escrow interface such as we currently use:the yulai terms of warthe terms of surrender:using an interface identical to the current item exchange escrow window a corporation declares war on its target.the target has 24 hours to prepare for the war, or:they can satisfy the terms of the warfare contract by supplying the isk and/or items detailed in the contract.if these items are currently available in any of the corporation's hangars the ceo need not pull & compile them in any single location, they can simply click the 'accept terms of surrender' button and the items & isk are withdrawn immediately.items go to the declaring corporation's deliveries hangar and will need to be picked up while the isk goes directly to the corporation in the wallet selected during war setup.limitations:the declaring corp can select a region in which the items must be located to satisfy the terms of surrender, but cannot choose a specific system or station.the target corporation, if they choose to deliver the goods to a location determined through diplomacy, need not open an office. the party fulfilling the contract need only select 'use local hangar' and the items will be drawn from that hangar and go to the declaring corporation's delivery hangar.once the terms of surrender have been met the war ends in 30 minutes.if the escrow expires unfulfilled the war will terminate in 24 hours unless one of the parties re-initiates a war contract within that 24 hours."
9/8/2008,"i like the idea of explicit terms of surrender, as long as they can be changed mid-war. i'm not so much a fan of the 30 day part, though - that can be punishingly long for both sides, and sometimes it's good to have the ability to have an automatic ceasefire. perhaps a price per week, with the ability to buy for a given number of weeks up front. but yeah, quibbles aside this is good stuff."
9/8/2008,"i'm a fan too. i especially like that corp-jumpers remain (individually) flagged after jumping corps, but i don't think that they should remain flagged forever. maybe just for a week.there should also be a ""default"" surrender option that is always available to the defending corporation, maybe one-half the value of the defending corporation (we'd need some way of calculating that, though), to set an upper limit on how much the declaring corporation can extort the defending corporation. other surrender options could be offered (and altered) throughout the war as well, through the contract format you suggest.overall, great idea."
9/8/2008,a superflous ship with so-so bonuses pre nerfed to hell and with a clear role set out for combat in a game other than eve . this ship already exists it's a black ops .
9/8/2008,/signed/me is always up for new ships.... this... sounds good.
9/8/2008,"just the opportunity to have somone drive you round is awesome, sould lead to some proper comedy kidnappins though"
9/8/2008,"it'd be nice if there was some way to move multiple rigged ships, specifically thru empire. relocating several rigged ships can take an age, especially if you're moving from somewhere like ned to akora!"
9/8/2008,"i'm kinda torn between the two choices. on the other hand, that is something you pay for rigging your ships. otoh, it's totally frustrating, time-consuming and really bothersome activity that's most often done afk.but of course, if there was such a transport, it'd be an another advantage to alt freighter pilots and the like, who could easily transport entire rigged fleets wherever in eve without worrying one bit about any possible wardecs. atm it's possible as well, but at least you need to repackage the ships and lose the rigs in the process. changing the corp staging area would be so much safer, easier and invulnerable to anything except insanely dedicated suicide ganks if there was such a ship."
9/8/2008,"how about a tier 2 freighter with half the tier 1 freighter's cargo capacity but a ship hangar of say 1,5m m<U+FFFD> ? no jump capacity ofc, if you want that you can use a carrier obviously."
9/8/2008,i think 10km3 is enough for the other freighter. it hauls all teh ammo and mods you will need for a lot of ships. it should really focus on ships instead of cargo. i say whatever less than another capital assembled is.
9/8/2008,"i think it balances out, that you can skip training skills for rigs instead but you either have to fly them or use a capital of some sort to move them in bulk."
9/8/2008,the solution to this should be 2 re-packaging options:repackage for transport option - this does not destroy ships rigs. while in this state the ship can not be placed on the market for sale.repackage for market - this destroys rigs in place. allows ship to be placed on market for sale.what do you think?
9/8/2008,"just delete the ""assembled ships cannot go in cargo"" restriction. with that out of the way, a freighter can transport enough rigged cruiser-class ships to make a real difference. if you want to add a corp-hangar freighter then that could work too, but the rule against ships in cargo, whether they fit or not, is just a dumb one."
9/8/2008,i have heard that you can put a rigged ship in a courier contract and transport it that way.
9/8/2008,"i believe we already discussed this at the csm, which will be addressed at the next csm-ccp meeting"
9/8/2008,"freighters should by default be 'hangar capable'... since you can't eject anything when not in a pos or station what is the huge problem about hauling assembled ships??currently you can make a courier contract for anything up to battlecruiser to transport your fitted/kitted ships, but for battleships you're stuck because they're above the 120k single unit size cap.imo ships should be the same volume assembled and disassembled. keep caps above 1m cubic and you still won't have any worries about them being hauled around empire in freighters (or just put a hard limit on nothing larger than a bs being transported)."
9/8/2008,"make sure your clone is updatedclonejump to the rorqboard some ship in the rorq's ship maintainance hangar, and then do your stuffwhen done, put your ship back in the rorq, and self-destruct to get back to your cloning station."
9/8/2008,"works great when your clone is cheap, but it costs several million for a lot of vets. why not have it be ""4. wait out the jump clone timer, then clonejump back to your normal clone"" or something of the sort?"
9/8/2008,"yes, do something with that useless module"
9/8/2008,agreed
9/8/2008,"after looking into this a bit more it's not as big an issue as i thought it was. i think the factions that are getting back-door alliance help are truly deserving of the charity, and frankly, it isn't helping much."
9/8/2008,"the only thing here i would like to change is to have alliances be able to join fw as long as they are not space holding.i do think its a bit lame that the rest off the ""allaince"" (read milita) cant help, but on the other hand there needs to be a system for newbs to play pvp and if you dont want wardecing, dont join a player corp.basically i dont think the system is brilliant (with regards to fw) but on the same note i do not support wartering down of wardec mechanics."
9/8/2008,look i spotted a jade alt.
9/8/2008,you can make hauling contracts for it so their stuff gets packaged in a plastic wrap.
9/8/2008,"i think that the database problem is that the container can keep 999 individual stacks of items (at least that was the old limit) and your cargo space could (it they were not banned) keep 999 containers. when you jump or if seomeone scan you it can create severe database problems.for your problem there is a solution: your corpmates can create a contract (i think only the delivery is usable) and bundle the whole hangar contents in a plastic wrap (up to 100 items for each wrap and contract), selecting the new corp base as the destination station. that will make life easier for you as you will only need to move the wraps to the station and hit ""contract completed"". the wrap will be delivered automatically to the right hangar.your only problem can be if the destination system has no station and your corp is living out of a pos. as a generals suggestion, giving us the possibility to generate plastic wraps for stack of items without using the contract system would be nice.even more if we could rename the wrap after creation."
9/8/2008,"agreed with everything you said here except for level 3 i could blow away the drones/npcs with my hulk/drones.agreed it should be more like 95 percent *almost all kill mission are that much except for command but it is only 97 percent no 100 % chance to be honest for anything* than 65 % or w/e the hell it is. i hate to do storyline/kill mission in my hulk as if it could fit large weapon. *laugh at him cause of ccp logic*last thing you forget to ""click support this topic"" if you do support this topic."
9/8/2008,"mining missions should be limited only to 100% mining agents, and they should provide as much output in an hour as a combat agent of the same type (factoring loot pickup and salvaging).no other agent should issue mining missions, at all.and get rid of 'cargo delivery' storyline missions from combat-type agents!!! it's utterly pointless to work through the standard missions only to get an idiot haulage mission that returns like... 0.003% faction gain."
9/8/2008,"refinery tax instead of a sales tax is a great idea, and opens the door for viceroyalty upgrades as you pointed out. it also brings in a progression of natural quality, the best viceroys have systems with naturally good refining, while lesser ones have vulnerable upgrades to reach that level, and the worst havent been upgraded yet, i really like it.the moon mining idea again brings us up against dysp. and prom. moons. i want to be very shy of anything that pulls alliances out of 0.0. high end moon mining is an example of something that would make a viceroy more profitable than a comparable expanse of 0.0 space.the others are all a+ ideas. especially luring agents there based on how stable your viceroy is! i love that one.its like redestributing agents, supporting lowsec, and building player infrastructure all in one. you'd have to be able to lose agents if there was unrest and the viceroy changed hands. not all at once but if it was questionable who ran the place for month i'd expect some percentage of the agents to pack up for greener pastures.overall, awsome ideas. just hope ccp reads the forums as much as we do eh?"
9/8/2008,rofl @ op
9/8/2008,"not a miner myself but how about cutting base mining yield and adding some kind of mining related mini-game that increases your output above current rates but requires the miner to be active at the keyboard if he wants to profit from it?that would make mining more entertaining and macro and afk mining less viable.ofc it would just increase the amount of macro-ratters as well but that is nothing that a simple fix of cloaks on non-cloaking ships and giving shooting and npc an agression timer couldnt fix what the mini game could be i dont really know, maybe something where you get a 3d image of a roid and have to pick the areas with bonus ores to mine from, mining from other areas gives less yield and also makes the roid collapse faster before you can get to the good areas. also requiring to cutting a path into the roid using the mining laser to reach pockets with especially good ore could be included or maybe something entirely different and more entertaining?"
9/8/2008,"first your recipe is the way of rampant inflation: reduce the materials/items produced without reducing the isk inflow is the step to make inflation terrific even for t1 items.second: macrominers will simply have 3 mining alts on the same account, when one of them has filled his quota they switch to another character.instead regular players have normally 1 mining character for account and will be the one getting the impact of your idea.so a strong no vote."
9/8/2008,kids and mini games . no thanks.
9/8/2008,you did not hit your head hard enough ...
9/8/2008,sounds good /signed
9/8/2008,"have you actually played around with one of these? or any xl-booster? it just seems like you don't really get how tanking scales. because a base 600hp every 3 seconds *is* making it pretty damn magical. compare that to the pith and gist versions, and they'll run you billions.if it's the price you're worried about, then i take it you don't understand the economy, either. because things in eve are worth what people are willing to pay for them. and in this case, every 'bear that ever there was wants one."
9/8/2008,"hate to point out that tech 2 variance (compared with tech 1) is for the most part 20% or very close, which means your faction shield booster in the example given is on par with a t2 module, but does not require the same skill investment.therefore one could summise that it is in fact superior to many t2 items.that 1 second reduction is frankly pretty damned sweet. if you look at the pith xls, which use approximately 50% the capacitor of other xls then you have an awesome boost to tank sustainability. i certainly can't see any reason why faction shield boosters could possibly need buffing at the moment."
9/8/2008,"sure, let's see them be as wondrously lag-free as the 0.0 battles that are the same size. are you sure you know what you're asking for here?"
9/8/2008,dropping a line to update my progress on making my idea presentable.anyways 3 posts made and chopped down 4 of the 15 pages out so only 11 more pages remain and 6 of those are for the ships stats themselves so i got about 5 more pages of things to post and try to reduce down into a more to the point lesser detail and more playing around room idea.if there is a certain time limit you guys have for me to get this done i would love to know and may just chope out a few pages of the idea to get it done in time.
9/8/2008,"ship stats etc will be up to ccp to decide and debate if they like the idea!post your general design and capabilities for this class of ship, and why (the reasons) it's needed.oh, and don't forget to succinctly state what the current issue is by not having it!take care,arithron"
9/8/2008,it won't hurt to include some stats. but it's certainly not needed as long as you include the bonuses and what amount of slots it will have
9/8/2008,"of course the design angle paragraph would be included, also the first 4 pages of the suggestion are what going to allow the new ships to exist and prosper as it will be about a new profression the field scientist.imo the current issue of not having an soe ship is a not so diverse job market not involving pew pew, i seek to end this and increase compition for resources and the sort.ill be getting hopefully the last two core posts done today involving reason and system to be introduced, then copy paste most of the ship stats over after i nerfed them."
9/8/2008,true i can probably save about 7 pages killing the cargo and other non stats.
9/8/2008,"this is now wow, sp does not equal ""pwning noobs"". people with a lot of sp lose expensive **** in stupid ways all the time. that being said the game has a huge, very populated, and comfy newbie area called high sec. when you feel ready you should skip low sec altogether and move into 0.0, npc 0.0 if you have to. don't go out in your most expensive ship, don't try fighting the first thing you see, learn how to run. a large portion of this game seems to be terrified of leaving high/lowsec when even ccp states it would like more players to migrate into 0.0.also for the love of god learn to line break."
9/8/2008,"simple really - restrict membership of the csm to one player per alliance.a lot of us who really don't care much about the csm, had a feeling from the start that it would be held in thrall by the big power blocs, just simply owing to numbers of posteriors on seats that they could muster when it came time to vote. we do seem to have had our feelings validated though .you can muck around with the procedures all you like, end of day though, it's this realisation from the majority of the player base that unless you have a gbc or goon tag on your name - the csm is not the area for you and it's just best to move along. whether it continues or not is not really a matter of concern for most of the player base tbqh."
9/8/2008,"hmm, maybe smaller alliances and corps should throw their weight behind non-alliance csm runners then? i'll be looking for some support next time round take care,arithron"
9/8/2008,"at present, it is possible to block/unblock individual players in local and to be fair, it is s a very, very handy tool to have in eve. i could even make the stretch and say that it is used by many players more often than most care to admit.one problem with this tool though is that to block members of an individual corporation, or for that matter, an entire alliance, necessitates having to trawl through member lists and individually block players, or alternatively, to block them as you see them.now to be honest, i do have the members of one particular alliance in mind when making this request (no prizes for guessing which ) and my block list measures in the hundreds. however, a simple change whereby a player can right click on a name in local, select block player | block corporation | block alliance would be a boon for those of us who get a bit weary of seeing references to relatives and farm animals popping up in local before we get a chance to right click the player and hit block.sure there are lots of players, corporations and alliances that you can get ""gf"" out of, but from this players perspective, there are some that you know you will never see anything said but insults or innuendos. and others that you really couldn't care less about.personal choice is after all personal choice, and this change is not forcing anything onto anyone - but is merely providing an enhancement to an already existing system.do others agree?"

9/9/2008,"the t2 'range' ammos are ok. maybe a little too powerful, but their penalties counterbalance. spike, barrage, null, scorch, aurora, tremor.they are all useful, because whilst they have penalties, they add a capability - ability to 'stand off' a little further. the t2 'damage' ammos are basically inferior to faction - in most cases they're doing _very marginally_ more damage, if any at all (fury cruise missiles do exactly the same as faction, for example).the reason is simple - 1% more damage is acceptable for capacitor cost, and sometimes range, but not shorter range _and_ worse tracking.t2 'damage' ammos should, imo, simply be a -75% range ammo with a high cap cost. (where relevant). so it's just another notch 'down' the range ladder, in return for about 5% more damage than faction gets. range reduction might be reasonable to apply to falloff too, but tracking is what kills this stuff stone dead - there's very few situations where 1% more damage, with a tracking reduction is useful."

9/9/2008,o.0
9/9/2008,"i withdraw my lukewarm support for this proposal, on the grounds that:1. rp reasons, my toon is hardarsed anarchist in an unforgiving and deadly universe, yet somehow makes no attept to disable that 'iff' device that broadcasts her presence across the consellation, yet for some inexplicable reason the device fails in the system that she's in. how are the backstory writers going to explain that one?2. peeps, like their local, why take away their favorite social tool, for the dubious justification, of making covert-ops work as intended.3. the constellation solution, only displaces an implausable intelligence tool from one chat window to another, achieving nothing. if instantly knowing who is in local is a problem, then why is instantly knowing who is in a constellation an improvement?local as it stands, doesn't make sense.i should have the option of 'radio' silence.i should light up like a christmas tree when actively scanning for victims. asteroid belts should move and be found through scanning (if only to add a level of complexity for macro coders)"
9/9/2008,how do i do thumbs down lol oh shi-
9/9/2008,yes. local shows only those who've spoken until they leave. const. chat shows everyone in the const. just like local works now.this change would be balanced without benefiting a single segment of players any more than another. i don't buy into the argument that it would make less people go into low sec and 0.0... that's bullsh*t. low sec population is another issue imo.
9/9/2008,"as nice as this idea is, i'm not sure 100% about it.carebears - would be able to see people coming from ages away. at first they would dock, but when they get bored of docking constantly they will start working anyway but scanning constantly. server lag might increase a bit. covert ops instantly become hugely powerful for landing ontop of carebears before they can scan you in nearby belts.pvpers - can now see if anyone is in the constellation, rather than flying around so much. bottleneck gatecampss will form on the fishtank edges where the constellations change. holding constellations is now hugely important so that the chat is kept clear most of the time.i think it will too heavily increase gatecamping, and make isk generation in 0.0 alot harder. i mean... its not even that much better than high sec atm. they would have to heavily buff 0.0 rewards or nerf high sec if this was followed through.edit: meh nvm."
9/9/2008,"while i like the idea, you would be unable to tell if a wartarget is in the system and vice versa. how would you suggest getting around that problem? i'm talking about high-sec and low sec here, as its not an issue in 0.0"
9/9/2008,i like the idear.
9/9/2008,would be very nice for the smaller people out here. even if you are in a big alliance much of your efforts are from personal supplies.
9/9/2008,give it 50km3 agility of a frieghter and 5 low slots required skill is trainsport ship v
9/9/2008,it should be t1 so no t2 requirements here. also no non-t2 ship requires a l5 in teh previous to fly. that is like saying you should need caldari frigate and crusier v before you can even train caldari bs 1.

9/9/2008,could not bombs get a 'pre boost' as opposed to the usual 'pre nerfs'? as in cut the price heavily on bombs until you figure out what to do with them?please.
9/9/2008,"the rts game star trek: armada featured very expensive, very slow and very frail ships that would act as suicide bombers with a tremendous damage output. if you managed to get one of these close to the enemy you could change the outcome of a round.as a bomber pilot i would gladly die with my ship, if i knew that i destroyed or at least dealt enough damage to a blob to give my fleet a chance to win the battle.therefore i suggest:1) activating the bomb, destroys the stealth bomber and pods its pilot.2) the bomb must have a large damage radius of at least 50km3) damage dealt by a bomb must be sufficient to cripple battleships (larger ships could take more damage then smaller ones)4) the bomb must detonate once the launche has been activated.this would make the stealth bomber a sort of suicide smart bomber.:)"
9/9/2008,"currently watching the end of the packers game. read whole thread = no not at all.nerf empire missions? why? whole game out of balance. yes.okay so what we have here is the skewed isk making machine that is fun and ""safe"" in empire (no ships should be lost in a mission short of desync or lag) and the fun ratting/mining/exploration and pvp in 0.0.so you move all level 4 agents to 0.4 and 0.3: the missions don't change the ship fittings do. supposing the systems that get seeded see an increase in population as an individual you have a much lower chance of being the one that gets probed out and ""ganked"".i'm all for keeping eve the pvp game i love, even though i rarely pvp myself.will it truely make low sec more profitable than empire?not really if you can run level 3 missions in perfect safety for less isk, they are actually even easier to do anyway so you can run an extra one or two anyway.another point is that the casual players log in to say hello to corp mates as well as run missions/mine with them. i call myself a casual player because a) i live in empire. b) i mission and mine in empire and c) i can't be arsed with 0.0 politics, lag and capital online. i'm not isk rich but i do tell other players about 0.0 and what it takes to survive out there (to start with minimal requirements at least what i had when i first went). it's made me a better empire citizen at least and i won't break a sweat if i take some corp mates to a low sec system to do a level 4 mission or two because it might get the heart pumping and it'll mean the pirates will have more work to be successful.this post is my own opinions and not that of my current corp."
9/9/2008,"actually, i like it."
9/9/2008,"aren't we talking about making missions entertaining in a thread that starts with a complete bs suggestion to move them to lowsec with no other change ? i think this is the wrong thread for such a discussion ...hello yes i want more interesting and challenging missions !!! but that does not include a pvp element. please make them long, interesting, challenging with deep story behind, some puzzles and unpredictable twists and turns ... i am all for this !!!but do not include pvp in that ... that is not my or the usual mission runners game ... if i want pvp, i can go lowsec, 0.0, wardec ... there are many options.i am not forcing you or anybody else to run missions. make your isk in whatever way you actualy like ... but don't try to force me to pvp ... i can do so if i choose to ..."

9/9/2008,"meh, get over it. you can move stuff in empire a heck of a lot easier than anywhere else.of course, why they moved one to eggelehende (sp) makes no sense... aren't there agents there already? isn't it lowsec (or are all of the new systems lowsec?)lvl 4 agents need a major shuffle around so that there's no more than 1 in any given system anyway, and perhaps only 3 or 4 per constellation."

9/9/2008,1
9/9/2008,+1this is quite annoying for us as we don't have the standings to use the other agents in the area. i would like to know why the change was made? was it due to too many of the same type of agent being in the same system? or is it faction warfare related?m
9/9/2008,"why you can't ""turn down, accept or complete these missions""? if the agents haven't still moved they are available at the old station. if they have moved you can find them at the new station (and most missions can be delivered remotely). if needed you can petition to have them reset/cancelled.i am very curios about what is stopping you from completing and delivering the mission.edit:you have 25 days to complete your missions:2008.09.05 10:54""i will be moving to ravarin iii - moon 4 - chemal tech research center on 2008.10.05.""so i don't get your problem."

9/9/2008,"a good idear, i have seen this asked for many times in the past."
9/9/2008,"already gave support earlier. some suggestions:1) remove any npc sales of freeable slaves or enslaveable freemen.2) add agents to each faction that work exactly like the 'trade' cosmos agents, except that they ask for slaves (in the case of matari agents, to be freed) or non-slaves (in the case of the amarrians, to be enslaved), and give some sort of reward (standings, money, and/or lps).3) as opposed to the previous lp offers, no 'item' is returned to the player; this prevents 'recycling' operations. alternatively, the player could get the altered item instead of the reward.with the exception of the later half of point 3, all of this should fit easily into the existing systems, using the cosmos trade agents as a template.as an additional option, the slaves and freemen options should become significant drops in fw, as well as in normal missions to a lesser extent. for example, if the tribal liberation force captures an amarrian system, large numbers of slaves should be dropped to be brought to agents for medical attention/re-education."
9/9/2008,"opposed.* first, the costs are silly; as long as you intend to suggest the costs be so low, why not just make it free?* second, there is no reason that (for example) the caldari navy would spend even a microsecond worrying about the increase in npc pirate activity in bob space, let alone be willing to shell out large sums of cash and faction items to those helping patrol bob space.* third, if you want to shoot npcs, there are already belt rats to shoot at, and if that's not enough, you can always fall back on the exploration system, including sites that can be located with shipboard scanners.agent missions need to have at least the semblence of being intended to further the interests of their empires. if the cost of the agents was more significant and missions required going to combat sites or delivering goods to/from their home empire, then this would become (slightly) more reasonable -- but then there would be little or no incentive to 'hire' these agents.tldr: opposed."
9/9/2008,"^^^^you konw, lol i actually proposed this idea to help low sec based corps and alliances as well, mainly because i quite frequently hear on c&p and even general discussion about how its completely insane that you can make hundreds of million in high sec in 100% safety, the reason i proposed this was because it would be a way to help the pirates and alliances make more money, since they choose to do higher risk activities, they should also imo have the privelage of having at the very least, their own agentsas for the why would the caldari care about bob's problems, well, that could easily be adjusted so to speak, rp reason: they are fighting terrorists on their own ground and where they conjugate most (lower sec areas, and 00 space, and they are willing to help pay to 'rid the universe of terrorists' or something like thati konw its a rl comparision, but still, it applies, kinda how like america is in iraq and afghanistan fighting the terrorists over there so we dont have to fight them here, the rp reason could be switched to that, they are trying to rid the universe of the angel cartel or serpentis or whateveragain, its like saying ""terrorists arent a threat if they arent in our borders"" when in fact the opposite is trueas for herschels comment: i konw it sounds like a hard cap on the agent limits, but honestly that is needed, as was brought up in the f&i thread, any large alliance would easily be able to hire at least a dozen l5 agents, and that would be a bit extreme, and give alliances way to much influence on the faction market (as far as i konw, l5 missions pump out a few dozen thousand lp per mission iirc) and like was said in f&i, we dont want ot give alliances to much power, because hell, the problem wouldnt be with having to many l5 agents i dont think, i think it would be the probelm of hiring a ****load of l4 agents, i mean honestly, lol wouldnt it throw the game a bit to much out of balance if an alliance could field the equivelant of like every l4 agent in eve? but i would be willing to ""compromise"" lol, i will edit the limit a little bit, because perhaps only one l5 agent is a bit to limited, but it cant be to high either, im thinking of maybe 2 l5 agentsagain, as for the ""they should be in outposts only"" again, lol that gives alliances to much power, because to put up an outpost means you need sovereignty, and to own territory, and this is supposed to help low sec and alliances, i think the being able to put them into pos's should stay, because still, remeber, the habitation module needs to be anchored around a pos, and it can be destroyable, lol hell, maybe give it a tiny amount of hp, so it can be easily destroyed if the pos is attacked, but dont completely take it away from low sec pirate corps"
9/9/2008,"no, nada, never!!! i am opposed1 lvl4 agent cost 285mil a week, in your plan. one lvl4 mission runner can make roughly 20m/hr running missions. that means that one mission runner would only have to run 14.25hrs of missions to pay for an agents whole weekly fee.lets say you have 20 mission runners in a corp, who run an average of 20hrs worth of missions in a week;(20 ppl) * (20 hrs) = 400man hours a week400hrs * 20m/hr = 8billion isk a weekthat is just an insane ammount for a player corp to add to their 0.0 mining and ratting revenue streams. one can also suspect that some corps would have even more mission runners that that.the only way i would even consider something like this, is if the agent rental fee was in the 10s of billions of isk.while there may be a isk faucet in high sec missions, the ""solution"" is not to add another isk faucet(besides ratting and 0.0 mining) to all of 0.0. there already exisist low sec and some 0.0 agents, if you want to run missions go there. if some one else controlls that area and wont share with you, get off your arse and kick them out."
9/9/2008,"okay i can see where you're coming from. you shouldn't have an empire faction agent in any 0.0 region. fair enough.wouldn't it be more interesting to hire an agent of the local pirate faction instead to scout out the (opposing) empire faction ships instead? sansha rats in belt = amarr npc, gurrista rats in belts = caldari navy npc's etc.i'm sure empires do carry out incursions into low sec and 0.0 - it's a realistic story theme to use and while it may increase standings to the same rats you blow up in the belts, it will also lower the empire faction standings which might hurt a lot if you intend to ever want to come back ""home"".but then that's the point right? the starting point of a level 1 agent is a bit silly though. it could be a generic level agent on the premise that if you're able to live and thrive in 0.0 you're already at least able to tank a level 4 mission just long enough to warp out again until you learn how to fit an appropriate ship.any balancing concerns are not my own thankfully. however the bonus of using a generic agent that represents the local pirate faction means that there will be no bounties. just loyalty points, salvage and mods, which is fair enough surely?i've never understood why ships were a bit more expensive in 0.0 than in empire but it was only due the fact that people didn't mine the low end ores for their local market. silly really all that scope not being used, somewhat off on a tangent sorry.thank you - i support this idea if it used a single level agent 4.5 representing the local rat population.edits. they should come with an lp store and only be used in outposts not pos's. pos's are temporary placements certainly not for visitors or guests and wouldn't be able to support a vip of such diplomatic weight. it could be linked to the diplomacy skill too :p"
9/9/2008,"hmm, ok, well, you kinda have a point on the lvl 1 agent starting thingi guess i could change it for the lvl 4.5 agent thing as well, but still, remember people, i remember saying eth word ""empires"" in relation to hiring agents, maybe i should not have used that, my original idea would be to be able to hire agents from any corporation in the game (whether it be serpentis, or the fed navy), i will change thatergh, but you put me in a touugh position with the generic lvl agents thing, but i suppose it could be changed as well, but the limit on the amount of agents i will haev to redo so to speak, there still needs to be caps on these thingsi will edit my posts accordingly"
9/9/2008,"if the agent rental fee was in the tens of billions, no one would use my idea because they would probably not break even, and would again probably rather spend that 10billion isk on a carrier fleetim introducing this as a semi-easy way for low sec and alliances to make that easy money that mission runners can in high security, the numbers you put up apply as well to high sec mission runners, 20 members putting in 400man hours of work can still make 8 billion isk, wheterh it be in high sec or low secbut the alliances and low sec pirate corps are taking more risk first of all by simply beign where they are, and in most people's books, more risk should always = more rewardand honestly, your argument only really vaguely has roots for the 00 allianceswhen you and your corp start whoring missions in low sec as fast and as easy as you do in high sec, + salvage and loot them, and survive the gatecamps / pirates 100% of the time, then you can come here and have a little weightas i said, the 00 alliance argument has only a small amount of back behind that, 00 alliances, while they make alot of money by low sec belt ratting and mining, you konw what? they earned it by going out there, forming a fleet and kicking the previous owners out, they deserve to be able to make a ****load of money, the same goes for pirates, but instead of kicking out the previous owners of the space, they live in low security, and survive all the time in low sec and they deserve to be able to make a crapload of money, simple as that"
9/9/2008,"but they're already making billions on the moon minerals and advanced reactions/invention t2 production.i know agents in 0.0 would be nice, but they don't have to come with isk bounties on top of everything else."
9/9/2008,"technically 20hour/week is a bit much but going with that. 15% tax means that the alliance would be making 1.2 bil a week with 400 man hours of effort. ratting and mission are both an isk faucet but mining is not. someone else buys the mins so it is just money changing hands. everyone seems to forget that you would need to higher several agents to get enough spread for the people who have already done the mission grind for a different corp or even faction. i would be getting a caldari agent, you would be getting a minimitar, noob11 might be getting a different caldari agent. don't hard cap this. just get decreasing returns like everything else in eve. also you shouldn't be able to spam l4 or l5 agents. make it take 3 of the previous to get the next level. 9 l1 and 3 l2 for 1 l3 agent. that number is of course bad but the idea there is that you would send in small guys before you sent in the elite."
9/9/2008,"live events were awesome in swg and some of the best times i had. not only the player created events but the rare events that the devs would randomly setup, give you a system message and everyone is looking for the battle. those were alot diff and were given badges for being there. but as far as a player event...i loved them and hope something like that could be picked up."
9/9/2008,"people have been asking for sound improvements for a long time. to be honest the warp sound doesnt bother me. im sure they could make something better though. i dont care for music however would love to hear maybe the hum on the engine, workings of the ship, ect. makes you feel connected with the ship. also like many have said in past posts on other posts somewhere...alert sounds when being targetted or attacked. it could be a toggle or something that way if ur doing something u know ur gonna be targetted or hit many times over...u dont have it going off every 5 seconds...eh the details im not worried about. graphics are awesome right now, we just need to the sound to be on par. im sure they may have more important things to do, just hope they address it at somepoint."
9/9/2008,"the ability to turn off warp, stargate and declaoking sounds is enough to turn sound back on"
9/9/2008,yes sound is lame right now. make it better n stuffs. more sounds need to be able to play at once etc.also i would like to have separate sliders for practically every group of sounds in the game. currently you can't have just ui sounds.
9/9/2008,"gm told me it would be great if i posted this in here to bring to the devs offline towers can be a problem if they are on a moon that you wanteasy solution is to blow it up, get some buddys together and give it some hurtafter 4-10 hours (depending on the pos) you killed it.taking that amount of time on a unused stucture in space is frankly a waste of time, if the tower has been abandend its no loss to the owner of it or the owner that has left eve.what i suggest is that towers have a timer for being offline before they get set a to an abandend tower on which you can unanchor or refuel for yourself or corp use.currently my allaince has conquered a allaince and they have alot offline towers which they cannot recover, it would be fun to destroy them but even better after a while that you can steal that asset and re-use it against them.im not complaining about them if i wanted i nuke them but i think in future it will make better use out of offline towers than reducing them to dust.so here are the rules i suggest with offline towers1. tower goes offline timer starts2. 2 week or month down the line the tower changes to an abandend tower on which you can unanchor, or refuel and it will change into your corps name.3. if 1 or 2 is not possible after time the tower becomes weaker having no power and hitpoints are reduced dramaticly so you can kil them quickly and if they are put back online they regain their strengh instantlywhat you think guysedit this will work in low sec and high sec aswell so you dont need to wardec to kill them.tonkin"
9/9/2008,makes sense to me. supported.
9/9/2008,reasonable idea but unnecessaryplus i like the idea of something that i anchored in space is mine till it dies
9/9/2008,if you set up a pos and it runs out of fuel... it should be easily destroyed or should self destruct over time.it's ridiculous to see this problem cropping up because its likening to trashing up space.i'm in favor of any solution that makes it easier to remove offline'd stations.

9/9/2008,"hello everybody,i've come up with a mechanic that would allow people to respec their characters to a limited extent, and allow them to unlearn skills which they no longer have any need of (such as energy emission systems). this would create a new option under the right-click on the skills menu to 'unlearn skill to' > 'level 1, 2, 3 etc'.the user would be forced to pay 50 isk per skill point unlearned at a special facility (the corporate stations that make implants for each faction - eifyr & co, inherent, etc). the unlearning would occur gradually, outlined as follows.the skill points would be deducted at twice the rate that they're placed into a skill being learned. this skill would gain sp at 1.5x the speed (meaning that the sp of the original skill would deduct as fast as they were being transferred, although only at half efficiency). if you unlearn a skill completely, you will need to rebuy the skillbook if you ever wish to learn it again.advantages of this plan:skill training still takes timeunlearn some skills to gain otherscannot be manipulated (even if a stat is very low, you still need the training time)disadvantages:creates another option on the right-click listpossible to damage some characters if they get into the wrong handsallows characters to respec, very minorlywell, what do you guys think?"
9/9/2008,supporting my own topic...
9/9/2008,"not supported.i see no reason for it to be possible to 'forget' a skill outside aesthetic reasons and even then i see it as being unnecessary.if the game had a skill cap then it might make more sense. as it doesn't however there is no reason to allow characters to unlearn skills as those sp's don't affect your ability to learn other skills (unless they happen to be a prerequisite for the skill, or happen to be a learning skill)"
9/9/2008,"corp jumpers only remain flagged for the duration of that initial war declaration period (currently 7 days). after that, since they're part of another corp, they are safe... for a while.the 'default' surrender value should be 2x the declaration cost (4m for a corp, 100m for an alliance). that's a pittance for most corps/alliances so the declaring party would be well wise to set some greater level in the declaration terms.thanks, i certainly hope it's something that ccp looks at since the underpinnings are already in place and work amazingly well compared to what we used to have."
9/9/2008,"it's a step in the right direction, but how do you plan to keep pirate corps from simply asking for untenably large sums of isk, in order to get an open ended war that the defenders couldn't pay. even if they did pay, what stops teh same war from being re-declared the next month? or the next week?"
9/9/2008,you have only come up with a way to surrender. what about victory or loss conditions?
9/9/2008,"setting a ransom will just be abused but if the surrender terms was twice as much as what the declaring corp put into it then they run the risk of losing something instead of just constantly war decing folks just to get a pay day.i would like to give the option to vassal your corp to an alliance or corp that dec's you as another option to surrendering. it would be preferable for a lot of people because they may not want to fight and might not be able to afford the surrender cost. it would not allow them to kill you without concord interference but it might allow for people to more or less get into pvp in a manner that is much less a leap of faith since you know there is a corp of pvp'ers backing you up and in fact giving you orders.how long you would be vassaled is determined by the amount of money the war dec'er initially set as a surrender term. once that time is up the vassal corp can choose to leave, remain a vassal, or form an alliance with their overseer. the overseer could tax the vassal but only as much as they tax themselves. in the case of an alliance the tax would be the lowest tax rate of any member of the alliance.seem reasonable?"
9/9/2008,"as for victory conditions it could be a cash sum, the aggressor deposit a sum at the start of the war for the defender to match if they want to surrender. if it reaches an armistice the deposit is given back, if the aggressor somehow gets overwhelmed and surrender that's the reparations they'll pay, put down in the pot already. the aggressor committing cash to the campaign will help make sure there are less random declarations as there would be little to gain, having spread out the own funds there would be just so many wars of oppertunity if you want to secure profitable conditions."
9/9/2008,"i assume that surrender means the defending corporation loses and the declaring corporation wins. as to the other way around, the defending corporation has to make the war so unbearable to the declaring corporation that the declaring corporation voluntarily terminates the war contract, which they can at any time. if the declaring corporation voluntarily terminates the contract, the defending corporation wins.more defined victory or loss conditions would have to be mandatory to be used at all, and if they were mandatory, i think wars wouldn't be used as a game mechanism - organizations would seek ways around them to wage wars illegally. ""police actions,"" if you will."
9/9/2008,the same thing that prevents open-ended wardec extortion from happening now. nothing.
9/9/2008,no one really uses the surrender mechanism right now... i don't see why anyone would use this either...
9/9/2008,extortion is a very big problem in war dec'ing.specially if the corp is small time and there sp's are very low.things should be factor'ed into that before we start proposing changes.
9/9/2008,"absolutely not signed.i hate this idea. this is a sandbox game. it is up to the diplomats of both corps to find a solution to a war, if there even is one. you have a bigger corp beating up your small corp? you have still have many options at your disposal. no need to make silly victory/surrender conditions. war is not a freaking word of warcraft quest."
9/9/2008,well then it should be changed to racketeering (sp?).: o p
9/9/2008,"if a corp is too weak to handle the pressure from its competition, it should fold. just like a corporation in real life. if eve changes the game mechanics to give weak corps a survivability factor outside of open ended war, then it's unrealistic and watered down gameplay."
9/9/2008,/fail
9/9/2008,"make wars last 30 days.allow victory conditions using an escrow interface such as we currently use:the yulai terms of warthe terms of surrender:using an interface identical to the current item exchange escrow window a corporation declares war on its target.the target has 24 hours to prepare for the war, or:they can satisfy the terms of the warfare contract by supplying the isk and/or items detailed in the contract.if these items are currently available in any of the corporation's hangars the ceo need not pull & compile them in any single location, they can simply click the 'accept terms of surrender' button and the items & isk are withdrawn immediately.items go to the declaring corporation's deliveries hangar and will need to be picked up while the isk goes directly to the corporation in the wallet selected during war setup.and exactly how you expect non-pvp corps to deal with this? pay your extortion money every week? no thanks!"
9/9/2008,"your options are to;hire mercsfold corppay extortion moneyjoin a real corp/alliance that can hold its own.i repeat, no special treatment should be given to any weak corp. if you can't hack the heat, get out of the kitchen. does your mommy make your bed, pack your lunch and iron your clothes? no? then why should ccp cater to the equivalent of that in game."
9/9/2008,ah so you identify with the bigger bullies... i get it.i'm with the group that prefers to pick on people our own size : o pmore challenging that way.no biggie anyway as i can see this isn't getting anyone anywhere.
9/9/2008,i am part of a 23 man corp that decs 1500+ member alliances as well as small industrial corps. we dec whatever we feel will make us isk. do not paint me with a bully brush. war is business and business is war. adapt or die. change the mechanics and you do not have a sandbox game anymore.
9/9/2008,"i support this idea.although may i propose that the that the cost of declaring war becomes x base amount, plus 1/5 of the value being demanded as surrender terms. this should pay for a week. in less than 5 weeks, unless the looting is good, the war will seem pointless."
9/9/2008,"hells yeah.this could really be awesome. an awesome idea, supported."
9/9/2008,been asking for this for ages. it was an awsome idea then and its an awsome one now.
9/9/2008,"sounds sorta neat but having a copilot operate things such as drones would be a waste because they could, and most of the time would, be in a second ship which would be more beneficial than not having to micro your own drones tbh. basically there would always be more to gain by having friends bringing more ships rather than friends wasting their sp to micro stuff on your ship. if you were that concerned about time you wouldn't autopilot. this feature also wouldn't get used very often... it would take more time to get someone to jump in your ship so you could afk ap than if you had just undocked and afk ap'd to begin with. i mean... it's just a stretch.the taxi thing isn't right cause to get in say... an interceptor or something, you need to have the damn skills. people who don't train the skills shouldn't get to roll around in said ship and receive any of said ship's benefits even if they don't really get to control it. i'm not really against this but there's just no real reason to be for it. a waste of dev's time tbh."
9/9/2008,yep. would be good to have.
9/9/2008,clones in general need to be looked at
9/9/2008,"agreed, i should get a rorq for free.... oww wait.."
9/9/2008,fully agreed
9/9/2008,"wow! just wow!!! so what you saying is a person doesn't have the right in eve to post anonymously? since there isn't a mechanic for it people who do not want to be hounded by forum trolls in game do post with alts. if you don't think it doesn't happen your wrong.look at your public behavior since you have been in the csm jade! pot calling the kettle black don't you think! your here insulting a persons right to post anonymously and have the audacity to say that they are the ones who are in fact rude, abrasive, and unwilling to see other people's points? not to mention your clearly biased in this topic and defending that stance to the death atm which makes the bias all the more obvious. what are you doing? you have more or less dominated this thread with brow beating and insults on a position that you are biased on because of your direct involvement in war decing fw corps. you can't agree to disagree with people instead you come in and tell them they are clearly wrong and ignorant of the actual intent of ccp using the sandbox moniker of the game as an excuse to break the intent of ccp to use fw to get new players and carebears into pvp. your reputation is less than stellar so i don't know what your bragging about. your constant attempts at brow beating people into submission is very unbecoming of the chair of the csm, the csm itself, you, your corp, your alliance, and of the eve community for allowing you to be elected in the first place. good thing the csm is a popularity contest of who has the most corp/alliance members instead of forcing every person to vote when they log in because you most certainly would get no where near re-elected because your opponents would simply have to post the pages of ignorant drivel you spout and the intolerant behavior you display to condemn you to the ranks of the the ""has been's"" and ""never was's"". your right and its your duty as a member of the csm to represent the community as a whole too ccp and not forum ***** for the good of you, your corp, and your alliance. granted they got you elected, not going to go into how stupid the system is and how a blind monkey could get elected the first time a position like this is created, but you still have a duty to the entire player base even the ones that post as an alt and not as a main.as for my support of the topic, fw corps should, in my opinion, only be allowed to be war dec'ed if all of the corps in the faction are given the status of members of an alliance and can defend each other equally just as alliances do."
9/9/2008,i disagree of course. i will never consider the opinion of a posting alt to be the equal of a character with a fully-developed in-game reputation. i consider anonymity to be counterproductive to the interests of good political debate. hence i really won't be taking the opinions of alt-posters seriously.as for your opinion about fw corps being made immune to wardecs. you are simply wrong. its not a change that is in any way shape or form in the interests of eve online.
9/9/2008,"fw corps should not be immune to wardecs. if your corporation cannot compete it should close, just like in real life."
9/9/2008,"so a anonymous vote for a csm member doesn't count as much as a vote from someone you know? right, i will make sure your opposition knows that you only want people who you personally know and respect to vote for you because those are the only people you represent.again you prove your ineptness in dealing with people. it's an opinion jade. it cant be wrong. i didn't state it as fact but you do. proving that you incapable of making a rational decision outside of kowtowing to your own agenda."
9/9/2008,"yes it can. and yes it is. fw corps being made immune to wardecs would not be in the general good of eve. this thread shows its only a handful of alts in favour of this move - you all sound very similar to each other and you all make your point with a mix of bad information, ill-formed opinions, personal attacks and insults your stock in trade. but end of the day you are still completely wrong. not sure what kind of weird liberal non-judgmental form of education you attended but if i'd handed in a paper claiming it was my opinion that the world was shaped like a cheese sandwich then my teacher would hand back a score of zero - not plaudits for the attempt and a condescending commentary: ""well done! you might not have gotten the correct answer but you are differently right!""this is a debating forum. if you put your name (even an assumed one) to a terrible opinion you will get refuted and called on it."
9/9/2008,"o<U+FFFD>pin<U+FFFD>ion [  p<U+FFFD>nnyn ] (plural o<U+FFFD>pin<U+FFFD>ions)noun definition:personal view: the view somebody takes about an issue, especially when it is based solely on personal judgmentnow that you know what an opinion is and that it is not 1+1=2 maybe you can come to terms with the idea of being wrong. i wont be holding my breath on that.why? it would not be in the general good of jericho fraction but you have only argued that they shouldn't recieve special treatment and then thrown down insults about using alts. you obviously don't know wtf your talking about because i am not an alt but you haven't looked into that your simply blowing smoke up anyone's ass who would think your csm tag makes you an authority around here.the fact is they already get special treatment but don't get the benefit of being in a quasi alliance despite the fact that thats what they are part of more or less. it makes them easier targets because they have a lot more to worry about and can't help each other by forming an alliance to defend one another. they have to act in an autonomous manner and war dec'ing an alliance for a handful of noobs who are just trying to get into pvp isn't a very good option due to the massive cost involved in doing so. you have every advantage in farming fw corps for kills and you don't want to lose it.brow beating again jade. you say that we are here attacking you but nothing we have said is in error. we say your biased because jericho fraction is directly involved in this activity and you don't refute it. then you make back handed insults about how we ""know nothing"" and how alt's opinions can't be considered as viable. your the one coming in here insulting people and attacking them for using alt's but when one defends themselves by pointing out the error of your ways we are attacking and insulting you? you should talk to obama about running his campaign.again with the ignorant and backhanded insults in an attempt at avoiding the subject at hand. your behaving like a 12 year old who is being threatened with having his ball taken away and yet we are the people misbehaving? yet you don't refute anything here you simply say that it shouldn't be changed. for such an expert you seem to have no offerings as to why it would be bad, only that they shouldn't receive special treatment. the fact is they do and it makes them an easier target than being an alliance because they can't band together without leaving fw. if they all war dec it costs them as a group many times more to do it than it would a single corp or alliance. this makes them all that much weaker and the vicious circle continues."
9/9/2008,the best solution would be just to allow players to wrap grouped items in plastic wrap while in station(like with courier contracts) and rename them. no freight containers needed.^ beat me by 1 minute :(
9/9/2008,^^this is your solution^^and it has the added benifit that it comes with an itemized list stored in game.
9/9/2008,"and it has the added penalty that you and your buddies have to do 20x as much work as should be necessary in order to keep everything organized. this is a workaround, not a solution. it works, yes, but it should be better."
9/9/2008,smaller freight cans would be very nice.
9/9/2008,"re posted here for, hopefully, more recognition.having only played eve on a trial account and now a full account for a few days, my experience with the universe can only be called minimal at most. yet in my time things that could be changed have stuck out like a saw thumb, and things that could be added like flashes of inspiration, although i doubt they are original or ground braking. for the sake of cohesiveness, ill divide this post into said sections.fixesfirst on the agenda, warp problems. vastness is one of the most resounding aspects of eve game play, both in the sense of a ground breaking gaming world and the illusion of a fully functional reality sci-fi universe. without adding to the problems of ccps maintenance, improvement and the strain this puts on their resources id like to suggest some ways ive noticed that the immersion of eve could be enhanced.anybody here remember the first time they inter-stellar warped to a warp gate, activated it, their ship dissolving into space as a seemingly distant beam light supposedly shot you into another system and the background dramatically shifts into a new set of colored gassy clouds and suns?what i would naively like to suggest is a two fold system, one that firstly results in the maintenance and reconstruction, which from a role point perspective may be pushing the envelope, that increases the size of all warp gates to not only fit all ships but engulf them in a vast space to prevent ship clumping.so instead of dissolving youre enveloped, and instead of waiting several seconds and watching a beam of light, you are the beam of light.the next part would be a lovely segue between universes, something involving a first person view of travelling between solar systems.if anybody remembers sliders, you get the gist.another warp issue occurs before you even get to the gate, unless your lucky enough to have found a rare path that doesnt pass through any planets, moons or stations.i dont fully understand the mentality that creates elaborate and beautiful textures that create the game we love, then allows you to zip through them exposing them for the wire frame shams, that we know deep down, that they are.reading up on the material for eve we find a description of the inter-stellar warp drives us podders use. it involves our ships existing in a bubble of nothingness (seemingly paradoxical considering our ships in the bubble) but from my understanding it works like the bubble is an inverse patch of space. the outside of which connects with the universe but at the same time ceases to exist, thus causing frictionless motion. speeds which where once limited now fade and our ships hurtle across systems.using this useful explanation of how we do what we do when were rocking it with our rockets out, ive come up with some fairly simple ideas for how the illusion-shattering inter-stellar warping can be circumvented. firstly we make the warp effects denser, showing less of the universe around the ship while still providing inter connectivity. secondly whenever our ships fly through an object instead of the current consequences, we could have the warp effects grow denser for a few milliseconds.both of these are hard to imagine from the current point of view, seeing as when we go into warp the effects are localized around our ship, and our camera although always contained within the effect is slightly of to the side. for it to work fully i think there may have to be either a lock on the camera implemented, or a camera specific effect. i cant see people being happy about the lock."
9/9/2008,"improvementsthe biggest improvement i have to suggest seemed so convoluted that id have to implement some ****ty diagrams, so i have. it involves creating a moving background within eve while warping, without re-inventing every system in eve. at the moment you have a sphere of perception surrounding your ship, which depending on the universe you are in has a texture pasted onto it. presumably there is also the sphere, tangible at the moment, that contains everything in the solar system. making this set of everything the sphere that contains your universe backdrop would be the easiest to suggest, but also the hardest to implement, verging on impossible as well as an impossible waste of server and your computer processing. what i have in mind is using your sphere of perception, along with a percentage of your co-ordinates within a system and distorting/enlarging the system backdrop as you move through space. cue diagrams.please visit your user settings to re-enable images.please visit your user settings to re-enable images.this first diagram shows a ship in the middle of space, for the purpose of my inability to create spheres were in flatland for this. the green is the first 50% of the solar system, the purple is the rest. now when the ship moves 25% forward, maybe warping to a station, he gets deeper into the purple, thus the image in front of your ship seems to enlarge as an image that once filled 50% of a sphere now fills 75%, and stars that where once nw or ne are to your west and east flanks.i think also that it would be great if everything under the attribute for items was categorized much like ships are. also it would be a good idea to implement rules on the use of negatives and words such as bonus and penalty. i think seeing as the description of the item for the most part has whether or not its a penalty or a bonus its not strictly urgent, but it would be nice to get rid of bonus and penalty and stick with negatives and positive, or get rid of negatives. imagine a power grid penalty of -3% whilst trying to compare 40 items at once.finally some minor improvements, every time i come out of warp my ship jerks a little in speed causing my own jet stream to appear in front of me. no not lag, always. also when i activate an accelerator gate after aligning my speed drops to 0km instantly then into warp, feels a bit weird. the speed that is viewed should be the motion of my ship not the speed im aiming for. how can a ship drop to 0 instantly?summary and minor changes.new warp gates, warp effects.inter-stellar warp changes to avoid viewing internal structure meshes.changes to solar system backdrops to incorporate position in solar system.jet stream fixes.better structure to the item attribute tab.ability to view multiple overview tabs.using multiple filters when using the world map."
9/9/2008,"your warp gate proposals run into gameplay problems - you make it so that the player needs to get closer in order to warp, and that it takes longer to move between systems(time for the sliders graphic to display). the first one has major implications for gate camps, though i could see a couple ways to work around it(make the gates physically larger and have a smaller activation range, lower autopilot range to compensate), the second would have no effect but an aesthetic effect that lengthens travel times. space in eve is big enough as-is. if it was used as a pretty picture to cover over load times then maybe, but we all know now how long those load times are(i.e., not very), and we won't accept anything longer. i like the idea of planets looking like planets when you warp through them. i'm not willing to pay much of a performance penalty for it, however. if it's simple(the correct response is to make in-planet views opaque, of course), then sure, but even a 1% performance hit is too much. backdrop changes might be cool, again, but they could also be very system-intense. pretty much the same response as above. either that or make the whole eve universe have scattered stars and nebulae, and then generate a texture for each system therefrom, which would naturally be invariant. would yield a bit more connection, while still making everything easy on system resources. jet stream fixes i think are a result of the physics engine and the speed discontinuities around a warp starting/finishing. they're odd, agreed, but i'm not sure that they're even fixable without a major overhaul of how the game functions. better structure to the attributes tab i wholeheartedly and unreservedly support. it's a truly sad statement when my skill monitor has more and better data on what an item does than the game itself. you get a thumbs-up for this idea alone. also, while we're at it, let's include some actual information in the item description - any game with the ~10000 items eve has should not assume that you know what they all do, or even that you know what all the categories do. i'm not sure what you mean by tabs changes - please elaborate. on the world map, agreed. the ui for that section utterly sucks."
9/9/2008,"ship attribute tabs have categories, for example ""structure"" or ""propulsion"". my proposal is for items that affect multiple aspects of a ship or have multiple types of properties, a lot of rigs for example give penalties to some things and bonuses to others, are categorized the same way as ships. not because i want items to be categorized like ships, i just think ccp has done such an excellent job with ships that there doesn't seem to be a reason why it spills over into all ship related items?other implications are things like overloading in items, i think that should have it's own category and the thermodynamic skill required for overloading should be included in the skill req. under an overload heading.right now when we jump to another system there is always going to be a delay between when we see the system and when we are in the system. this is to allow time for everything to load and prevent you from being overwhelmed or ganked. my proposition is for the warp sequence to initiate and for the system to load in the background. maybe a few or even one and a bit seconds of a sequence then you arrive in a fully loaded system. obviously it could be made optional for hardcore pvps or low sec systems."
9/9/2008,there are functional problems with the game to be dealt with before aesthetics come into it at all. not supported
9/9/2008,"these are valid views that i've experienced through the game as a new player, a market ccp is desperately trying to reach. i'm sorry if your battle cruiser missiles are doing a 1% less damage then they should, but the team ccp hires to work on graphics could be working on this."
9/9/2008,"i meant overview tabs. i know what you meant with the attributes tab. as for the delay on system entry, there really isn't much of one - i'd say it averages a second or so under normal lag conditions. and the mechanism that prevents you from being overwhelmed is the 30-second cloak, not the delay on the system loading.issues are issues, and good ideas are good ideas. yes, these have lower priority, but they're still worth doing."
9/9/2008,"for someone whose not spent much time playing eve... nice to see your not acting like your average joe noob.but remember... your talking about a game where 30,000 pilots plus are having to load these very things your talking about.the literal engine of eve online itself would require vast changes and adjustments to accommodate your ideas.i support it... but not likely to be seen in the near future for sure... maybe..maybe not."
9/9/2008,materials for war is the worst mission for faction gain.i had a 40km3 haul through low sec the other day that gave me 8% though.
9/9/2008,everyone else likes this idea? can we get it built then?
9/9/2008,"assault frigates.as they are, they're neigh useless cept for ""my first t2 ship! omg!11"" which is quite a sad state (and as a heavy tackler they are really outdone by smaller, cheaper t1 frigs and ab ceptors). what i propose to start off with is simple enough: give them the bonuses from their respective hacs, and an extra slot (of an appropriate type), for a total of 12 slots, 11 for ishkur.retri, harpy, enyo:- damage bonuses (rof for retri, i think.)- gain midslot for each (lowslot for harpy?)- enyo gains 4 drones (from 1 light as it is) for 25m bandwith and spacerationale:it's sad a ranis can outdamage an enyo, ditto for sader vs retri. ishkur 4/4/3- loose 1 turret (ishtar-esc here, and prevent op damage)- gain midslot- looses optimal range bonus for drone control range- drone damage bonus- drone bonus goes from 5m3 to 25m3 per level - 25m -> 50m bandwithvalidation/etc:as ishtar gets 5x heavies, a weapon class up, ishkur should rightfully have 5 meds ... 180dps with 5 meds(int 4, hammerheads) really isn't op; compared to retris and enyos with damage bonus that can get 250dps or so.come on, the amarr eas has 60m3 and ishkur gets 55m3 with af 4. for reference, curse has 150m3 vs ishtar 325m3 at hac 4.25m3 base + 100m3 (4x 25m3) = 125m3; 5 meds, 5 spare meds or 2x small util waves or a med util wave, and 5 lights on top of that - lots of flexibility. as a drone carrier should have.if ccp wanted to give the missing slot, a low would be best for 4/4/4; but i think it is fine as is, having one less slot than the others.jaguar 5/4/3- swaps bonuses with wolf: gains fallof bonus instead of optimal bonus- speed bonus- gain highslot and turret slotthoughts:not much to see here - the falloff problem has been there since the beginningadditional turret helps only ok dpsmight do with gaining a token drone bay (2) ?wolf 5/3/4- swaps bonuses with jag: gains optimal instead of falloff- tracking bonus- gain midother thoughts:could loose 2 lows,gain 3 mids (so 5/5/2) or loose one low and gain 2 mids for 5/4/3i have a similar feeling for muninn, but thats a different postreason behind gaining mids and loosing lows is minnie t2 armour tank = fail.vengeance 5/3/4- gains rof bonus- +1 highslot, +1 launcherthoughts: a fine ship, lacking only in damage.possibly gain a small drone bay?hawk 5,5,2- gains a flight time bonus- shield boost bonus goes to launcher rof bonus (caldari don't get active shield bonus ever, only resistance...)- +1 midslotrationale: turns into mini cerb like it should be, not some bastardized tanking thing that has no role.alternate: instead of taking the bonus from the respective hac, they could gain a tanking bonus (resist, rep amount, etc) but that doesn't feel right at all.retri, enyo would probably need +10 tf cpu to be able to use their new midslot, jag,vengence *might* need 2mw grid or so for another gun. possibly +2-3 cap recharge/s (4/4 skills) to facilitate tanking in general...?ok. now the afs are mean little damage machines. fine. but they don't have a role! (that doesn't cripple them, as fitting a mwd does)thus i propose a role bonus to [10mn] ab pg use, giving them speeds of around 2km/s for the slower ones (ishkur, retri, hawk, harpy) to 2.5km/s (wolf, enyo, vengeance) and topping at 3km/s or thereabouts for jaguar. keep the high base mass about the same(tweak it to hit the desired speeds or thereabouts), but give them great agility so they can accelerate passably(while using ab, and very well without it), warp around, and move in a generally straight line but can't really maintain an orbit at a ""decent"" speed with afterburner running (never mind cap use). if the pilot wanted to, they could use a 1mn afterburner for almost free (grid reduction).with these changes, they would fill the heavy tackler role well but arent nano***s nor are they obsolete (or obsoleting another class). mean, solid little tacklers."
9/9/2008,have you read the empyrean age novel? the reason i ask is that there is an element of the amar storyline that could connect quite well to expanding exploration.
9/9/2008,just for the record i do not believe we should proceed with any meetings until ccp actually acknowledges those issues already submitted and sets a date for the review meeting.there is no point us debating and preparing issues if ccp is not going to make any effort to actually listen to them.now i am aware that andrew/jade is putting pressure on for a date - which is good - but is currently being stalled.i do not believe therefore that we should continue with 'business as usual' until ccp realise that they have to firm up a date and actually process all the proposals that are already in the pipeline. otherwise we simply create an unmanageable backlog.
9/9/2008,"sadly, i must disagree with both of these. whilst it would be very helpful if a date was set for the (online) ccp-csm review meeting it doesn't actually stop us doing everything else. on the second i see no evidence that they aren't making an effort! they sent us a timetable and we (erm. i) sent them a response to tell them we could send them the second list immediately rather than the three weeks away of their proposal. it is now with them and will still arrive back to us before they asked to receive it! this is a good thing so far as i can see.there *is* a backlog though; the one created by the other pilots of eve. the ones we are here to represent. as i see it, either we stop those we represent from using these forums - and become the puppets of ccp to some extent in shutting down discussion - or we take our responsibilities seriously and show pilots and ccp alike that we are here to do the business we were elected to do.iz"
9/9/2008,i agree with inanna. i'm certainly building up a backlog of issues which has to be discussed.
9/9/2008,you have your opinion and i have mine.i just do not believe we should be be ploughing on regardless when at this moment in time ccp cannot even set a date to get back to us on the issues already submitted. they have known the 'schedule' for a long time...we can of course continue to look at issues - hell i have some of my own on the assembly halls - but the whole thing is rather pointless if we simply turn into a talking shop - which is what we will become unless ccp gets its finger out...of course we have a responsibility to the players of eve but in my opinion giving people the impression we are achieving anything when everything is currently stalled is not exactly being 'responsible'...yes we can go on examining and voting on issues but unless that process is leading to something constructive then its all rather pointless.my view is that more pressure needs to be placed on ccp to get this sorted and that refusing to do anymore work until they take this seriously is a good way of getting their attention and the process moved forward. of course we can all pretend that everything is rosy and if people want to have more meetings simply to be pious and look good then i will certainly participate - but my heart wont really be in it unless we get some indication from ccp that they are interested in taking this seriously.they clearly demonstrated this interest in iceland and i was very positive about the process at that stage but there seems to be some drift now and we need to get back on course. we cant rely on the csm working only when there are face to face meetings!we - the members of the csm - have had many meetings since our return from iceland - often long tedious and argumentative meetings - we have been doing our part - it really is up to ccp to do theirs...- we still do not have csm forums - these are still promised soon (tm)- we have not had any detailed feedback of action on the priorities we agreed in iceland.- we do not know when ccp is going to respond to the last batch of issues we submittedall of these things can be resolved and i know there are 'some' good people in ccp working on these but it is taking too long and i really don't see the point of continuing to mislead the voters that things are progressing normally when they are not.
9/9/2008,on reflection maybe i am being too negative. if people want to organise another meeting then i will certainly be there and contributing. i would however like to see more concerted pressure being put on ccp to progress things!
9/9/2008,"my opinions are not a hundred miles from yours hardin. i think you make some very decent points there and the process does need to start moving again from ccp's end certainly.once we get the responses from issue pack 2 lets look at posting a new meeting time and we'll start handling the backlog again. speaking personally i don't have that much more i want on the agenda at the moment, but i can think of some issues that should be discussed before we finish. (the proper local chat replacement topic from tusko for example :)how about if we get the responses from ccp prior to wednesday evening lets look at a meeting this sunday (14th) or if later than that the following sunday (21st?)"
9/9/2008,"a build up or backlog of issues...for ccp to deal with...i hardly see how this affects the elected responsibility of the csm members to hold regular meeting to discuss player issues. if ccp has a build-up of issues, it's not of any concern to the csm! they have fulfilled their obligation to players by submitting them in the first place. i might go as far as to suggest that maybe ccp has been a little busy of late with patches etc. it's just more of the same; excuses for not doing something, rather than proactive reasons to do it.it's irrelevant if csm members (any csm member) feels they don't have any issues to bring to a meeting. look in the assembly hall, where player issues are posted...interact... discuss...essentially, put personal agendas and manifestos aside and look at issues that may just benefit players outside your narrow focus.take care,arithron"
9/9/2008,"this only makes sense if you believe that ccp is intentionally ignoring the csm and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. and in that case, the correct thing to do is resign in protest en masse, and probably head straight for the gaming press to raise hell, rather than sit in a corner. of course, i don't believe that ccp is lying about their commitment to the csm, and i don't think you believe it either. yes, they're busy. yes, they'll get back to you soon(tm). but given that the time between being raised in the assembly hall and being put into a patch is likely going to be several months at a minimum for the vast majority of issues, what's an extra couple of weeks in the middle of that? besides, even if they don't get back to you, they can still take your ideas and implement them - it's far worse for accountability and communication, of course, but it doesn't actually harm the csm's core function. so given that the only reason for your delay is ccp's delay, and that you've all known about ccps propensity towards delay for years now, this all seems kind of pointless. clear your backlog, and let ccp worry about theirs."
9/9/2008,"csm just received a preliminary response to all the issues. the issues weren sent on the 26th of august. so the issues were handeled in exactly 2 weeks, as the csm document describes.so everything is fine...as for the actual content of the response, i'll not comment on for now till i make sure it won't break the nda or anything, since the information we got is that there will be official posts for it after the discussions with ccp we will be having."
9/9/2008,"good to hear. like i said, i don't think ccp is shirking their commitments here, and i don't think that hardin really believes that either. i'd fully understand if you guys had decided not to bring forward issues related to those you were awaiting response on already, that would just be natural. but the submission-reply loop is close to a month, and there's three of them in a six-month term. does anybody really want the csm to spend 1/3 to 1/2 their time in office passively awaiting a response? this is a big game, and there's a lot of things that can be discussed, even with a few dozen issues outstanding already. also, two questions on this topic. is there a clean list of what topics are up somewhere, or will i have to search the minutes to find out what they are? and when can we expect wrangler's forum bomb?"

9/10/2008,"i think you'd go a long way towards making t2 ammo better by reducing or removing the often massive penalties for their use. this is especially true with most t2 missiles. people use faction ammo now because it's all benefit, no drawback (other than cost, which isn't that significant)."

9/10/2008,hell i think the whole race needs a serious look at after the nano nerf (yes i support nano nerf as long as minmatar get looked at). give us alpha or something.... personally i'd like to see it switched to all turrets and have 20% dmg bonus per level at 5% rof penelty (roughly same as 5% rof and 5% dmg) so it could 1 shot any bs stupid enough to stand still for long enough.... but i'm just dreaming =p

9/10/2008,"what i'd like to see:local works much like certain chat channels do now. you can see how many people are in local, and you can see anyone who spoke in local since you entered (unlike the regular chat channels, however, they would not appear to be in local after they've left). you would not know who is in local unless they say, ""it's me"" or something to that effect in local.i also think that the constellation should work the way local does now. you'd still be able to use it as an intelligence gathering tool, supplemented by your knowledge of how many people are in a given solar system. however, while you'd be able to use local to track the movements of larger fleets, it will be much less useful in tracking the movements of small gangs and nearly useless for tracking single ships."
9/10/2008,"agreed.i would like to see local functionality replaced by, an albeit less powerful, ship scanner system. this passive system will warn the pilot when a warp signature is detected within it's scan range, (4.1 au, i think). i would also like a stargate activation warning, to be issued to all pilots in the local system. this warning could contain information like which stargate was activated (for systems with multiple gates, of course) and vessel type.keep chat at a constellation level, if really needed, i guess..."

9/10/2008,the enitre point of this thread is that a 100m rigged uninsurable ittyv with 38km3 (18km3 unrigged and 5m tops) and a 750km3 freighter costing 900m-1bil is too big a jump.
9/10/2008,"you realise that a km^3 is 1000m * 1000m * 1000m, thats 1,000,000,000 m^3. what unit could you possibly mean? 5000m^3 is obviously an industrial, and something that can just manage to squeeze in an unpackaged battleship (sub cap) is already in place, its the freighter."
9/10/2008,"a rigged ship must be assembled. only packaged, non-assembled ships can be put into cargo. packaging a rigged ship destroys the rigs. assembled ships can only go into a sma ship maintenance array.the 5km3 is for fittings to move with your ship."

9/10/2008,"actually, from what i remember explorer saying in a conversation in iceland, it's actually a lot more involved than, for example, putting rigs on killmails. i don't remember specifics but it involves pulling data out of the server cache or some business, and i don't know crap about programming but suffice to say it really sounds not worth it.besides, some things are best left to the imagination."
9/10/2008,"but you think instruments in ambulation are?pfft.i would love implants on a pod-killmail. all killmails already pulls data from the cache. but i assume the actual reason is that the killmail has to pull the implant data from another node.so once infiniband is in place, i must assume this is quite possible. i would love to see it."

9/10/2008,"this is similar to my idea here:hirable agents for your conquerable outpoststhe main opposition you'll get for the idea is that some people don't buy the backstory of any npc corps having enough interest in 0.0 space to support missions of any sort (despite there being already quite a few npc corps that have agents in 0.0 space right now). personally i think this argument is weak. especially given the distribution of agents in the game right now (you can find serpentis in angel space, soe in guristas for a couple of examples; i'm sure there's more). in short, supported"

9/10/2008,"you left out the biggest problem with this idea:-allows people to respec to the flavor of the month at will.given the neverending cycle of nerf/buff that is eve, encouraging people to constantly reinvent their characters would be bad, imo."
9/10/2008,"i really don't see why you would do this.my pvp character can fly all kinds of cruisers pretty damn well. why? because i keep wanting to try something new.that means every month i feel like flying something new. i could respec, but why would i do that? it's still going to take time anyways. so why give up a skill? that's the idea of eve; that skills are persistent.while it would be cool to untrain my mining ii, i really can't see it being important enough for the devs to spend time doing thos."
9/10/2008,this is effectively already possible through character trading. if people aren't happy with the skillset of their current character they can just go buy another.not supported./ben
9/10/2008,there is absolutely no point to delearning a skill.all skills have a value of some sort or another in the long run.whether you use that skill however is something that you have to deal with.if you train something your not going to use... you only have yourself to blame.delearning is nothing more than a waste of time... the fact you proposed paying isk is a major turnoff.unless you can find a positive spin on delearning skills... your better off buying a lower graded clone and killing yourself (in game that is) and chancing it in not having a skill or 2.granted you can't control that... but i'm trying to highlight just how foolish your proposal is.now if you can trade skill points at a cost.... from one skill book to another?that's different... that means its going to something more positive... but the cost should be based on the value of the skill book itself...and the rank as well.higher the rank and value... the higher the cost per skill point.that makes more sense... then what you came up with.
9/10/2008,"two problems i can see with this.1) encourages training for flavor-of-the-months.2) devaluates specialization. today i'll mine on a hulk for isk with all mining skills at 5. tomorrow i'll fly a titan. on saturday i'll refine my loot with all my industry skills at 5. next week i'll just re-spec all my hauler skills to level 5 to transport my loot.i'm sorry, but i give this idea a thumbs down."
9/10/2008,"i'd like to see some form of sp reallocation possible. maybe with some sp penalty associated with it. ie you have 100,000 points in industry, after unlearning the sp you are penalized 30% (just a number, could be more, could be less) and allowed to spend the remaining 70% on other skills. a total sp penalty would prevent the abuse of such a system."
9/10/2008,i could only see that working if it figured the time to train with your highest attributes and reallocated figuring the same amount of time with your lowest attributes. that would prevent power learning a select few skills and then spending the sp on skill your attributes were terrible in.
9/10/2008,"can't see any use for that.what does the op mean with: ""unlearn some skills to gain others"" ?you can learn as many skills as you want. there is no cap that allows you only to learn a limited amount of skills.besides: change clone so that it doesn't cover your current skillpoints, selfdestruct your pod..."

9/10/2008,"excuse me alt's and mains - but can we get back to the discussion of war dec'ing in fw. seems this thread went off topic a bit and needs to come back to the point.imho - war dec'ing is fine - we are fighting in both now fw and a war dec...however the one thing that does need to be changed is fleet operations for fw ops only.if you are in a fw fleet and you are fired on by another militia, corp, neutral, pirate or whoever, all fleet members have the right to fire back on you without consequence no matter the sec rating of space they are in.if the corp is not in fleet ops at the time they are fighting, then the militia cannot get involved. then it is just between the corp's. this would apply to both hi or lo sec.take it from me, in r/l if you fired upon any group of soldiers, sailors, airman or marines, they would not care if you were ""whistlers mother"" - you would get a complete retailitation from the entire group. in r/l when you have are taking fire, you always returned fire and then figured it out later.simple - end of story."
9/10/2008,i agree with this. i just don't like the fact that an alliance can war dec corps that have to leave fw to form an alliance as well when they are already in a quasi alliance.it simply allows the alliance to spend very little money to fight a very vulnerable enemy that by and large has less experience than themselves.in turn the corps can seek out help but the cost is astronomical for them and not for the alliance.
9/10/2008,i would like to see corps insure ships in the corp hangar(for an increased price) so that anyone in the corp can fly that ship and if it is lost the insurance money goes back to the corp. this would allow corps that supply ships to their pilots to supply bigger ships without as much risk.
9/10/2008,you already can.put the ship in the corp hangar and try it.

9/10/2008,"i was just curious what you people think of a wreck timer-roll over the wreck with your mouse and it tells you how long it has been there as well as the distance, size, corp ticker, etc.this would help a lot when you are running a harder mission and are not sure when the wrecks are gonna disappear(it's after two hours, correct? o_o)"
9/10/2008,"that's a good idea, in my opinion, and could be extended to both jetcans, as well as wrecks.let's say a mining team is jetcan mining, and has been doing so for an hour or so. if they haven't named their wreck with the time (i.e. 02:30) or if they're not playing close enough attention, they might lose a full 27,000m3 worth of precious ore."

9/10/2008,"i could ask ank to mail it to me, but i'd prefer a public list, for people less forward than i. ultimately, i'd like to see every submission the csm makes to ccp cc'd to jpsc, and then updated with responses when they're available, so that there's a single easily-accessible list of them(as well as keeping a sticky on top of jpsc with links to all such threads). and serenity's list is ancient - i don't think it's been updated since mid-june. i was keeping a daily update of new threads, but when it became obvious that i was talking to a wall, i quit, and nothing has been done since except incorporating them in and deleting my posts a month or so later."

9/10/2008,"so if i were to say invade your space, i'd have to have my entire fleet pay a isk per every gate we travel for the duration of the entire campaign until you lose sov?that's a horrible idea no offence. sounds nice ata a glance, but if you think about it for more then 5 seconds, theres too many reason not to do it.if you want isk for people in your sov, you have to have a station of your own to charge them to dock. charging for gate jumps is just well.... no."

9/10/2008,"he was, i think, responding to anikadir's bit about one character per alliance. if that rule came in, then people will run with transparent alts in other corps. it does us no good to have(for example, bane may well have better taste in alt names than i) darius johnson and bane'sgloriousalt as the characters on the csm when it's the same humans. even if you consider it morally wrong for two members of the same alliance to be on the csm(which i don't), the rule is unenforceable and thus worthless."

9/10/2008,this was already suggested and we got the preliminary answer from ccp yesterday. please hold on a few weeks while the official minutes from the forth-coming ccp-csm discussions are made.
9/10/2008,"cool, keep us updated."
9/11/2008,"you have not heard from them at all? or have you heard on some issues and not on others? if you have not heard from them at all, it is not a big deal, since i would give them a while to go through the list and do their stuff - however - if you have heard something on other issues, and nothing on this, well, then i be starting a riot soon, with pitch forks, and tar, and feathers."
9/11/2008,we have heard from them. but it's a preliminary answer which i'm not sure if is covered under nda or not. so i won't say anything till i'm sure.
9/11/2008,t2 short range is lol. please make it not-suck-so-much!kthx
9/11/2008,"you know, i realized something when someone pointed it out to me.where the nerf on an ammo effects a weapon (increased power usage, tracking reduction, range reduction, ect), only that single weapon is affected and it is only affected once, by the ammo it has fitted. the weapon is not adversely affected by the other weapons also loaded with the same ammo type.where the nerf on an ammo affects the ship itself (energy regen, velocity, handling, ect), they stack, one on top of another until the ship is so crippled it makes absolutely no sense to use those ammo types except in very closed situations (typically pve).this is something ccp seriously needs to look into, for it adversely affects missile users beyond any other ammo type. hail also has stacking penalties to the using ship (cap recharge)."

9/11/2008,"maybe we should have multiple sized stations for the different races.much like airports evolve from grass fields, to metropolitan, to hubs, to international.of course, the larger the station, the higher the taxes :) i think something needs to account for the average number of ships docked per minute which would dictate the size spanned over a monthly average."

9/11/2008,for!
9/11/2008,"first, i do not think this is a great idea of bringing in another ship that can transport large amounts of cargo.lets first focus ourselves on fixing the jf:1. give that ship a possibility to fit rigs or a cap.tractor beam.2. give it low or med slots to fit something of a tank. flying a 4 billion isk ship with no slots is scary. i know there is some logic behind this, so flame me for that :p3. if you are really going through with this: first boost the jf with first 2 points :p"
9/11/2008,randomly seeding more t2 bpos?lottery all over again....hasnt ccp already failed enough....adding more t2 bpos at all is dumb. make another blunder to try and make up for your original blunder? pathetic that this is even a topic of discussion.
9/11/2008,"i think that new manufacturing skills should be introduced when new items or tech levels are introduced, and apply only to those. it doesn't strike me as right that a player should have to learn new skills to do what they can already do now, or continue to be competitive at it if they are now.be careful with componetizing t1. t1 components are used in t2, and if you have to build components to build components to build something, that's too many slots that have to run for any player to be able to do it effectively, unless you increase the number of slots a player can use.you should only introduce t2 bpos as a rare result in research if you plan to transition items away from invention after they've been in the game for a while.you should deal with empire only players by giving them a more gradual path to integrating with the rest of the community, not by giving them additional incentives to stay in high-sec. right now, the difference between high-sec and low-sec is distinct a barrier. players should be incented to gradually accept more pvp risk as they progress. i think many empire players' perception of pvp is worse than the reality of it, because their only experience of it may be having been blown up at a .4 gate camp."
9/11/2008,"doesnt have to be that way. just make sure the timing on a bomb going off is less time than it takes a small gang to warp or get to the gate, and more than it takes for a battleship to do the same.problem solved, right?"
9/11/2008,"my sentiments, as well. this doesn't have to break the game, ccp. you want a player-driven market, we need ways to securely implement the purchase/sale of stock."

9/11/2008,"are you sure it is only transactions? have you confirmed this?in economic circles, the market average of a stock is defined as, ""the sum of all current values of stocks in the group divided by the total number of shares in the group.""by extrapolation to commodity markets, the market average should equal sumof(price*volume), divided by sumof(volume) for all buy and sell orders."
9/11/2008,"it's based on transactions, not on orders, because orders are massively variable and often bear little resemblance to market prices. look at a market where someone has a buy order up for a million kronos at a penny each, and the ""market average"" would be about two cents if it was the average of orders. or look at a market with no orders up - it wouldn't have an average if it was order-based, but it just takes the value of the last (set of?) transactions and carries it forward."
9/11/2008,i agree. eve sound needs some work...lots of work actually. it would be nice to have the ability to add your own songs to the jukebox.

9/11/2008,"btw i spoke to ccp reps and gms at the pax08 convention in seattle and was told that a major rework of the forums was in progress.shame i had to ask in person instead of just checking the development page, eh?"
9/11/2008,"ferris bueller, you're my hero."
9/11/2008,"that's exactly what i'm proposing. the balance is implied in that you only get back half of the skillpoints that you discard, and since it takes time to unlearn a skill, the difference in attributes have no effect.to a certain extent this is true. however, all this will do is give a slight boost to the training of one skill at a penalty of unlearning the other skill.no, all this does is give a boost to training the skills you want at the cost of some other skills you may not want. you'd only be able to use half the sp of the skill being unlearned into a skill you're training, and it would be a very gradual process since the skill you're training would only gain sp at 1.5x the current rate.by doing this, you minimize any damage (""my friend logged on and had me untrain xxx skill for this useless one), since it takes a long time to unlearn a skill, especially one at level 5.the cost was simply thrown out there as a way for people to not do this at their whim, but having it require some effort (a 256k sp skill would cost over 12m isk to untrain). this can be discarded to make the idea work better.if i didn't phrase my original post adequately, i'll revise it. i'm looking for a way to allow people some freedom with their character (such as mining or salvage drone operation skills) in a way that minimizes exploitation and satisfies the respecification crowd."
9/11/2008,"i'm all for the remote rep thing. but if a neutral goes into a complex, they're not combatants; they're tourists. it's not until they actually do something there that they should become free fire targest."
9/11/2008,"yeah, assisting a war target in any way should flag you to the opposing side. that should be true of any war, not just fw.neutrals? meh. yeah, they're probably spies, but in my experience so far, the problem with fw is in getting fights, not getting too many. let them spy."
9/11/2008,"agreed, then, the 30 day timer may be a little steep.i also like the idea that the declaring corp has to pony up a chunk that rides in escrow as reparations should they terminate the war. unfortunately this does not allow an amicable termination of the war.i have been a part of wars where both sides were so impressed with each other, or through what ever other reasons, that the declaring party withdrew the war and let them alone with no ransom paid. under the reparation contract the declaring party would never be moved to recind a war.at the end of the war period, if no surrender terms have been agreed upon, the contract would then... what? expire, no reparations, with the only costs incurred being the declaration costs?and under the yulai terms how would mutual wars be declared... that one i had not thought of.the declared party may, perhaps, be able to put up a counter-contract within the opening 24 hours, with no outlay of isk, demanding their own war-termination requirements. if the counter-contract is fulfilled the war ends in 30 minutes (not instantly, to prevent concord hostility traps).these are just perhapses, maybe a csm will poke their head in here to do something other than p*ss on another csm's tree and actually respond/accomplish something."
9/11/2008,"sure you can have an amicable finish. you just need mutual approval to do it - make the contract end with a null payment via contract. it's only if you want to end without mutual consent that you need to pay the escrow. i think this is a bad idea for other reasons, but the difficulties of an amicable truce are not among them."
9/11/2008,"for the love of all that is holy no. i don't want to have to deal with kidnappings in addition to everything else that can go wrong. the last thing i need is to long on to find out that i have been utterly betrayed and oh, by the way, in the middle of highly hostile space.i know, just leave and get podded or use a jump clone, but still. it'd just add another aspect for newer players to get screwed by."
9/11/2008,"agreed.a 'rider' or copilot who can have a function (their skills increace certain limited ship functions) or just sits there and runs the camera for all of those fraps fans out there.i would also like to stick my egg in a ship and then go to a movie, log off, what-have-you and when i come back i'm wherever the ship ended up. if they log off and i log on i end up wherever i am in my egg (station/space).if the ship goes pop my pod e-warps normally... if it's bubbled or what-have-you i come back to find myself in my home clone station. too bad so sad for me."
9/11/2008,"just bring some ""ship maintainance freight containers"" in the game..problem solved. drag and drop your assembled ships in the special container and *voila* !"
9/11/2008,why bother with that? you already have a cargo hold.
9/11/2008,"basically, a propoal to move empire away from being a ""starter zone"" and toward being more consistant with the rest of eve and its back-story.to read the full version, click here.short version:access to the more lucrative resources and services in empire space would be limited through various mechanics to player corporations and alliances. war decs would be moved away from sanctioned criminal activity in high sec to be a way to contest access to resources with enforceable surrender conditions."

9/11/2008,"so missioners, traders, and freighter pilots don't get to play unless they do it your way. and you're not allowed to mine a belt, anchor a pos, or dock unless you can win wars. is this actually your proposal?"
9/11/2008,"this is an old, old issue, and ccp has stated repeatedly that it can't be done for reasons of database efficiency - in essence, it'd require another bit be given to every single item in the database, whether it's a blueprint or not. i'm slightly confused by this response, but they're the programmers and have access to the code in question, and that's the party line. if you need more information, consult the sticky in f+i."
9/11/2008,first of all avatar is the wrong word. icon is the right word. also this is already covered in a really good thread in features and ideas discussion:
9/11/2008,"i have read most of the dev posts about this issue and by that i know its dificult/undesrirable to implement this.still i see this as a must be done, i don't care how its done but this should be resolved. even client side solution is better as no solution.greets mabari"
9/11/2008,"they need to implement an overlay rather than a different visual affect, though this will indeed put a good bit of load on the server process calls.bpos should show me/pe with the 'infinity' loop.bpcs should show me/pe with the remaining runs available.if nothing else, put an infinity loop on bpos and make bpc's gray rather than blue (just put a code in that de-colors copies, no new graphic needed)."
9/11/2008,i for the removal or learning skill.
9/11/2008,"interesting conceptas for possible bonuses how about scan probe duration bonus, probe accuracy bonus, probe launcher fitting bonus (to not give the ship imbalanced cpu amount), hacking success bonus or something along these linese.g. you could have a cruiser sized ship (or even bigger variants) with the same scan time as a covert (or at least faster scan time as in 5% per level) but without the cloaking benefit, advantage would be that you could run certain plexes directly after scanning them out without having to change shipsanother question is what skills would these ships need? two (or even more) empire faction skillsets (e.g. all races cruiser to 2 for the cruiser sized craft) or would they need a new unique skillset like the ore ships (e.g. exploration craft skill rank 4 or something like that) ?"
9/11/2008,"just to add, if this ever does get put onto csm for suggestion i would like to add that not only should this work when you roll over it in space, but it should work on the overview as well.it would be nice to know how much time you have left before your mission wrecks expire."
9/11/2008,"while i like the idea, i don't believe it should constantly update on the overview (unless you mean a static ""can/wreck will destabilise beyond recovery at 23:26, 11/09/08"" instead of a constantly updating ""time till destabilisation: 1h 34m"") mostly due to lag reasons.if it was to be a dynamic timer it should be restricted to the currently selected object in the overview, that way it minimises the impact on server performance as it should only need to call the database about the object you're looking at instead of all the objects on grid simultaneously.having said that, i'm no database designer, i could easily be wrong about the impact on the server."
9/11/2008,"i like this idea a lot! if it couldn't be a standard countdown due to lag or whatever reasons even attaching a ""this wreck/can will expire at such and such eve time"" would be an improvement. go get them jordan, make this happen!"

9/12/2008,"there are a couple of false comparisons here. first of all you don't have to stare at your ammo being built, so yeah, the faction stuff may appear favorable in raw profit per hour, it probably doesn't compare so favorably to profit per hour played, and yeah, as someone pointed out, lp aren't free, since you could have bought something else with them that you could either use or sell, so they need to be factored into the cost.aside from that, the ""over farming"" argument doesn't hold water. if they were truly ""over farmed"" they'd be dirt cheap, and you'd have nothing to complain about. i guess you could argue that if they were even less common, they'd be really really expensive and nobody would use them.all that aside, yeah t2 ammo (especially torps) need a boost to be comparable to faction, or at the very least attractive cost/benefit wise compared to t1."
9/12/2008,"just two things.1. gang storylines are not a good idea imho, as it would make having a high (or low) faction statnding absolutely trivial.2. from an rp respective, to get past -5.0 with a certain faction, you may have literally killed millions of their ship crew members and destroyed thousands of their ships. i wouldn't get over that for anything, and i can't imagine governments/pirates can either."

9/12/2008,they already are. concord rats attack you when you run pirate missions.

9/12/2008,"on a side note, why do i get a standing decrease with serpentis for doing nothing but defending myself. they prefer i run away? pretty soon i won't be able to buy my drugs."
9/12/2008,"a very interesting topic, i support. oh and a few other ideas. hi-sec could be auto-update too, since it is suppose to be high-security and ran by huge empires.also, if not implemented at least give cloakers the ability to stay off local chat, maybe even constellation and stuff to, i dunno. i haven't really looked into the balance for that to much, but i hate being seen in local while cloaked."
9/12/2008,a non-rigged itty v gets 18km3. a max rigged ittyv gets 38km3. the smallest freighter is 750km3. there needs to be something in between there man. that doesn't cost nearly a billion and is insurable.
9/12/2008,there are already enough skills. they simply need a use besides being only a prereq or have some use in t1 production.
9/12/2008,i support the request also!
9/12/2008,"support, why hasn't this already been implemented anyways?"
9/12/2008,supported
9/12/2008,"meh.why should we add more useless information for kb queens, e-peen wavers and chest beaters around the eve galaxy?"
9/12/2008,because they make up a majority of the player base between them?
9/12/2008,this
9/12/2008,@ all the people that say it isn't worth it.you may be all cheery when you know you killed a faction bs or something. you know yeah i caused damage to that guy . and you can totally act like the 1337 pvper and stuff....but if you kill a guy with snake/sla
9/12/2008,"the reason its hard to do is because implants arent actual fittings to a pod like rigs and mods are fitted to a ship.they are effects that work upon implemntation, giving you bonuses and arent actually a physically manipulatable entity..if ccp finds a way around this id definatley be happy :d"
9/12/2008,not supported. i would rather you didn't even get to see what was on my destroyed ship in a km.
9/12/2008,"mods and ships have value, pods do as well, we should be able to see that. would also help figure the 'value' of various implants due to their creation/destruction."
9/12/2008,"unfortunatly, i think the average also counts the days with zero transactions, thus the average is lower than it should be with items that have a lot of quiet days."
9/12/2008,"no the average just doesnt change because there are no transactions. the market average changes when there are transactions at zero isk, not zero transactions."
9/12/2008,"sry for necro, i missread the date of the last message."
9/12/2008,"unsupported, if anything jumpclones should have 24 hours at max skills, never shorter."
9/12/2008,"why? that's not snark, i actually want to hear your reasons."
9/12/2008,"edit: plz read thw hwole post before commenting ;)now we all know in the real world that great feeling of seeing a yummy cheque that makes you feel less anti-establishment from all that tax.when we get taxback in rl we can breathe easy a moment, the extra cash helps with financial problems for a little while and one can maybe invest it somewhere, save it for a rainy day etc.what id like to see is tax back in eve :dif say, 0.01% of our income per session (ie ratting session, market sell order etc) was capped off our wallet and sent to the ded or something, i doubt many of us would care..if this was implemented, we wouldnt see a huge difference in our day to day eve doings, but wed have a rather nice bonus awaiting us, each year the amount that was capped from us would be re-imbursed in a lump sum (tax free of course) and \o/ we can buy that shiny new ship weve been saving for...the amount returned would be, like in rl, in comparison with what was capped, so if you earn only a small amount per year, youll get it all back, plateauing at a certain point so that only a maximum can be returned..now i hear some ppl screaming inflation! the market will die! etc etc on return day but no, i dont think that at all. if tax return day was spaced over a few weeks (say over fanfest, how fitting hehe) and your return date was categorised against char name alphabetically, the returns will be spaced and less spending in huge amounts at a time will occur.further more this could act as an isk sink for ccp, as one only has their allocated day to get tax return or they get nothing.p.s. this relates in no way to corp tax, and is only similar in the word tax, nothing more (sort of like the concept of jump clones vs. med clones)thoughts?"
9/12/2008,brrring on the tax back :d
9/12/2008,and what good purpose would this serve apart from giving players free money?
9/12/2008,"if you want tax money back, talk to your ceo, not to the csm."
9/12/2008,save loot for 3 months and then melt and sell it. nice little savings if you are a ratter.
9/12/2008,read the end of the post first before commenting plz
9/12/2008,"it is not giving htem free money, if youd have read the whole post youd realise that with this you actually lose money or only break out even as you do in rl. but i think the benefit of a lump sum outweighs this fact"
9/12/2008,your throwing a fit over chump change!this is utterly a total waste of time.if your looking for money... go do some level 4's.this tax return doesn't make sense considering how easy it is to get that kind of money.give the csm something worth there time.... not this stuff./me thumbs down
9/12/2008,"i can't imagine many eve players living paycheck to paycheck, and i don't think a sudden injection of isk will stimulate an already buyer's market.can't say this upgrade would improve the game as a whole"
9/12/2008,"i agree with everyone else, not supporting"
9/12/2008,sureno
9/12/2008,"how stupid is it to break cooperative teamplay elements in a mmo?i think your proposed changes are ill-thought out and they heavily focus on the aggressor having completely unfair advantage. you do need a chance or a way to opt out of violence, because you shouldn't be able to force people to play the game your way. why would you even form a corporation ever if all it takes is a fee to be shot on sight for 30 days?this would completely destroy any sort of corporation based in high sec (unless they were gankers themselves) to appease the empire pvpers. no freaking way."
9/12/2008,"not supported, your 'surrender' option will only encourage mafia-style extortion on a galactic scale and would make it almost impossible to have a small corporation."
9/12/2008,"have you ever been involved in small-corp wardecs? extortion exists as-is. the thing is, virtually nobody pays - gamers as a group have a wholly irrational reaction to threats, and are generally willing to pay five times as much to a merc as they are to an extortionist. or they'll hole up and deny a fight until you get bored. but they don't pay, no matter how easy the game mechanic for surrender is."
9/12/2008,"not me personally as i don't want to be in a corp, but i've had plenty of people that come to me that whine about wardecs. but now that ccp thinks that wardecs equates to pay-to-grief, i think we can better wait to see what their plans to overhaul the current mechanics are.the reason noone pays up now is of course because if they do, they got no guarantees, plus, the next corp can just come along to dec them again."
9/12/2008,remind me to vote for you next election./me thumbs up @ csm
9/12/2008,"the reason nobody pays now is that people have a moral opposition to giving into extortion, and you can't usually inflict sufficient pain upon them in-game to make them want to pay up. it isn't even particularly irrational - it's ultimately a form of collective defence, since if nobody pays up, nobody is going to bother trying to collect. there's some suspicion about whether you'll actually leave when they pay their danegeld, but that's not really a big issue. the mechanics used to organize surrender have very little to do with it. yes, a surrender contract will remove the possibility of fraud, but fraud is a minor concern for most targeted corps. if people continue their pigheaded refusal to pay up - and they will - then no mechanic will make aggressive wardecs popular, at least not on the level of small corps."
9/12/2008,i support this!
9/12/2008,"seems like a solid idea, i like it.i never thought of kidnapping, but that is pretty cool"
9/12/2008,did you read? the purpose would be to put an assembled ship in the fake sma can so it could be hauled because no ship can be hauled in a cargo hold assembled
9/12/2008,and my proposal is to evade that restriction by eliminating it entirely. why use hacky workarounds when you can just make things work logically?
9/12/2008,"this issue is for the csm to present to ccp our support, recognition, gratitude, and acknowledgment of bane glorious being a great csm, especially as measured up against present-day lame duck csm chairman, jade constantine.feel free to discuss your motivations for supporting this issue, be it his inferior perspective on game mechanics or his racist remarks on other forums (you know where), but please be aware that although individual reasons for supporting this measure may vary, all are equally valid."
9/12/2008,bane ****ing rules quote this
9/12/2008,"a fine csm if i do say so myself. popular and a man of principle, what more could we have asked for?"
9/12/2008,"finally, an issue i can get behind."
9/12/2008,"""don't blame me, i voted for kodos""?"
9/12/2008,"bane is an extremely unselfish lover who's unwavering faith in the csm concept is to be respected and admired. i am shocked by, and quite disappointed with the recent behavior of a certain individual who appears to want nothing more, for what can only be described as a focused campaign of petty slander, than to drag bane's good name and stellar voting record through the mud.a regrettable development to be sure, and one that casts a slimy shadow of stink upon the entire process that cannot be easily or quickly washed away.for shame. i'd have expected far more honorable behavior from a well-traveled master of the british arts."
9/12/2008,"no this issue is just another silly flamebait, with no other intention or content whatsover and should be reported and locked promptly."
9/12/2008,"excellent suggestions there. combined with a general change to missions, i'd say that would solve a ridiculous number of issues. ****, even without the mission change it would solve an incredible number of issues. something would need to be added as far as mining goes, but other than that it's a solid list ccp needs to implement.supported."
9/12/2008,"i can see where you're coming from, and i do actually agree with some of the proposals. some excellent suggestions to help deal with some of the ""perceived"" problems with high sec - i particularly like the suggestion about making lvl 4 & 5 agents only want to deal with privateers (rp reason... a pc corp has less obvious affiliations - why would a gallente aligned agent want to give lp and cash to someone in a caldari starter corp for example? same applies to a lesser extext to npc corporations of the same faction.)i was about to hit 'post' when i just thought of something regarding mission runners in npc corps. tried 4 times to put it into words and it's being tricky, so please bear with me!premise: as per suggestion, level 4 agents will only respond to members of pc corporations.suggested corolary (sp?): the starter corps have their own lvl 4 agents which members of that corporation are free to use, but they are of poor quality.this would make it so that those players who just like the 'npc corp missioning lifestyle' can keep on doing their thing, but those doing it for isk/farming reasons are better incentivised to get into a player corp, even if it's just one they create themselves.however - getting back onto track, the reason i say ""perceived"" problems above is because there are a lot of empire dwellers who don't see these as problems. there is a substantial base of players who like the way empire is set up, like doing their own thing in an npc starter corp without the hassle of having yo join a player corp, who just play the game because they enjoy missioning/mining/sitting in station smacktalking the corp channel. this represents a large chunk of income for ccp and i don't think they would be prepared to risk losing it. also, as the ideas as proposed go further than i am comfortable with in what should be high sec and relatively safe space, i can't give support to this... but some excellent ideas scattered through the post, might have better success separating them out and proposing them individually."
9/12/2008,"not agreed with anything in the npc corporation change. there is a huge amount of players that want to play the game solo, and it cannot be justified to remove even more game content from them (npc corp players already cannot set up poses, which is a severe limitation). creating a one-man corp is not an alternative, with the war-dec system being the way it is now.i understand that people use alts in npc corps as income source or for criminal activities, and i agree that this is a problem, but we shouldn't nerf an entire legitimate playstyle because of it.as for the second part, i fully agree with the intent you have.but what is to stop players from using these new mechanics against random weaker corporations for extortion? and what is to stop rich grief corps from contesting multiple regions (or whatever new region the victim chooses as new base of operation) to completely cripple the defending corporation?all of these 'change wardec' suggestions are only focussed on the attacker, and i won't support any of this until weaker corporations get game mechanics to harm random griefers back."
9/12/2008,"good feedback so far. i had no doubt that this would be a controversial proposal when i made it. the way i see it, right now, eve is headed toward two virtual ""shards"". there's the empire ""pve"" eve, and the low-sec/nullsec ""pvp"" eve with player bases that are interacting with each other less and less, and increasingly demanding different versions of eve that fit their play styles.in the recent meeting minutes i see that ccp is floating the idea of introducing even more content for ""empire only"" players. i think that's a shame. at some point, you might just as well shard the server. what they really ought to be doing is providing smoother integration of the entire player base. empire shouldn't be ""safe"". it should be lawful. they aren't the same thing. the same player conflict, politics, and power plays should apply there as apply to the rest of eve, they should just be governed by the rule of law, where as 0.0 space is essentially ""lawless"". empire also shouldn't be a licence to meta-game and protect your pvp gotten gains from pvp using npc corp alts.i know this isn't the direction that ccp is heading in. they are hell bent to make a pve eve, and a pvp eve, with a decreasing amount of interaction between the two. i just thought i'd offer an alternative vision that i think is more consistant with the spirit of eve, and its back-story.i did update the war dec mechanics part with something i meant to include in the first place. that is that once a corp surrenders, they may not be decced by the same agressor again for the duration of the surrender terms, which the surrendering party gets to choose.thank you for your comments."
9/12/2008,"my proposal is twofold. first, as a new player, you should be able to play the game at a basic level without coming into conflict with other players until you learn you way around, make a little money, and get to know people. as a veteran player (or the alt of a veteran player), you should be potentially subject to competition/conflict with other players if you want access to the parts of the game that are attractive to veteran players.second, war-decs shouldn't just be an open-ended licence to kill in high-sec. they should be wars, not crime. in eve, the society centers around cut-throat corporations competing for resources, with weapons if necessary, so consistant with the spirit and back-story of eve, concord sanctioned wars should be about resources, and denying access to them."
9/12/2008,"while i cannot in any way support your idea in it's current form, if you were to present them as 2 different ideas i could at least support the wardec idea which i quite like. but the changes to npc corps as you suggest them are completely without merit.i actually like the war dec suggestions, as an industrialist i would find having to move my operations out of a system or constellation far more damaging to me than losing a ship and staying in a station until it all blows over.however i would suggest some protection for a corp that loses the conflict, as it is the same corp can't redec for a set period, but any half decent alliance could potentially do a rolling series of war dec's with each member of the alliance take a turn and thus forcing the surrenderer not only out of the system but the next system and the next and the next .... a bit excessive.also i disagree that the surendering corp should be able to set the period of the surrender, after all to the victor the spoils, if the surenderer dosn't like the terms of the peace treaty don't ratify it."
9/12/2008,thats some very big changes amd its probably way too radical for eve. but it shows many of the current problems with high sec and solves them. so if nothing else its a good starting point.
9/12/2008,"well, thing is, i think they work together, which is why i proposed them together. putting the war dec changes in by themselves would somewhat hobble random griefing, but it wouldn't really achieve what i believe needs to be done. i'd like to get new players into the game and integrated with the player base, rather than having them stall out at running level 4 missions and squatting in high-sec because the game beyond those .4 gates is so much different from the empire game. i'd also like to push the meta-gaming of pvpers using npc corp alts out into the open. if you're going to be a pvp player, corporation, or alliance, you shouldn't be able to shield your money making or logistics from pvp. i think that at a relatively early point in their career, new players need to start learning the facts of eve life, which is all about player competition and conflict, and having to choose sides, and make friends and allies if you want access to the ""good stuff"". like i said, i think that the path we're on right now is going to lead us to two virtual shards, with two completely distinct player communities who are barely even playing the same game. at what point does is start to make sense to just shard the server into a ""pvp"" server and a ""pve"" server, and be done with it?"
9/12/2008,"perhaps the disscussion of your perceptions of the possible problems facing eve would be better suited to the general disscussion forum, where threads similar to yours pop up every day or two.however i think on your changes to war-dec you underestimate their impactacctually i think they would add much much more than simply hobbling random griefing, they would add a whole new layer of economic pvp to the game. why undercut your opposition when you can temporarily dustrupt their ability to actually produce or sell?what do you think it would mean to a corp to be denied the ability to sell their produce through jita as a result of a surrender in a war dec? you would quickly get large groups of corps forming high sec alliances and hiring merc corps to go at each other over valuable market hubs. (it could certainly help with the lag around jita )if anything your proposal could very well bring more pvp, both economic and combat, to high sec than you'd at first imagine and what's more the people involved in that pvp would be the people who want pvp, rather than forcing a majority, in all probability, of players to play the game in a way other that what has been the accepted norm now for many years.edited to include obligatory comment about lag in jita"
9/12/2008,"i think it would be awesome, and great for the game if that happened. if you implemented the war-dec changes alone, though, it wouldn't. corps would simply drop their freighter pilots out of the corp into an npc corp and it would be business as usual."
9/12/2008,"there's a lot of good stuff there and it actually addresses the problems in a sensible, non partisan and story based way.i like."
9/12/2008,"i see where you're coming from here, and i even agree to some extent. a lot of the appeal of eve is the utter brutality of the play model, that makes it actually feel real. i don't like the idea of empire turning into pve territory exclusively, and i like your view of ""lawful, not safe"".however, you run into the fundamental objection that empire dwellers have to losing their stuff, and the fact that there's so many of them that ccp literally cannot afford to annoy them en masse. while you can't give everybody their own game to play, you need to give them the ability to play the game that does exist however they want to play it, and that's where your proposal falls down. if somebody wants to be antisocial and do missions in secure space, you need to let them do so, in one fashion or another. i am not, philosophically speaking, a carebear, but i can't support any proposal that will eliminate or seriously impinge upon those who are. there needs to be bridges between 0.0 and 1.0, but there needs to be separation too."
9/12/2008,"this should be an easy one.when you open the (3d) map - it by default opens the map with a ""side-on"" view - completly useless.so each time you need to re-orient the map to get the usual n/s/e/w orientation/display as used everywhere else.a quick fix so the 3d map opens up in the ""proper"" orientation would be nice.alternativly have it remember how you had the map oriented the last time you had it open.either would do."
9/12/2008,this would be an amazing change!
9/12/2008,small enough you could probably bugreport it. been broken since forever. one of those things.
9/12/2008,thumbs up.
9/12/2008,"i 100% agree, good argument for it btw."
9/12/2008,"when i started playing eve you where pretty low on skillpoints / trained skills, and it took me quite a while to get to where todays starters start.in my opinion that change was allready not the best idea.this game has a very high learning curve and having a lot ofskills right from the start doesnt make people think about whattheir doing.today you see alot (more) of noobs flying in battleships or battle cruisers in lowsec, while they dont even know enough about the game mechanics. those pilots get angry & frustratedwhen you shoot 'em, and they dont do the most important thingfor eve: learn your game. this is alot more important then havinga quick start skill-wise.removing learnings would remove another learn-your-game timebuffergiving a even faster start skillwise, but will still not help 'em tolearn why they should not put a 100mn ab, an xlarge shieldbooster, a few smarbombs, a plate and some cpu enhancer on a phoenix.so totaly wrong idea.instead of thinking how you can get 'em a faster skillwise start, youshould look into finding ways to interest those guys for training,to teach 'em and to use the given time to have pilots that knowwhat their doing at the end."

9/12/2008,probably easier to have one master thread of submissions - we don't want too many stickies clogging up the place. i'll go make it.
9/13/2008,"so, did you clarify the nda issue with ccp, where are we here?"
9/13/2008,why isn't this implemented yet?
9/13/2008,1
9/13/2008,"one of the big things missing in eve is the people! it does make alot of sense that there should be some form of planetary colony as well as people transportdifferent planets could have afinity for different types of produceables,, some might be grain or cattle while others might be some metal or ore while others might just be good stratigic base locationsa well stocked planet mught have several cities a couple of planetary defence weapons, a planetary shield and a couple of military bases (2 marine and 2 fighter squadron) and a factory or two,, these planets would indeed have needs to function, and produce goods for their owneryou could even make it possible for small raiding parties to come in and steal a portion of the goods you might even have players deticated to maintaining these planets/moons"
9/13/2008,"those are some really great ideas. you could have an enemy come into one of your systems and ""raid"" planets. it would bring a whole new element to to pvp. it would also be great if you could go to a planet and it would give you missions based on what resources they have. say they need cattle for example, in this case you can either go to enemy space and raid one of their planets for cattle, or you could go to a friendly planet colony and trade for the cattle and bring to back for a reward."
9/13/2008,"this is a great idea, and now we might actually have it happen with the csm in office. i've seen other ideas where the planetary interaction was limited to a simple 'ship fitting' screen so you could allocate people to specific projects.this would tie in well with my original concept of training 'livestock' to different roles. that way, you could train the homeless to work in geology (scientists) over time and with some expendature of resources.another idea is the quality of output could be based upon an insubstantial 'happiness factor', where giving them livestock instead of frozen food would let them do more. this would still ensure a demand for items from empire space, and so the logistics of running a null-sec empire would remain."
9/13/2008,"i don't know about the 'happiness factor' thing. we want to make this easy for the owning alliance, the last thing anyone wants is extra work. maybe things imported from empire could be more of a bonus more than anything. remember, there is a potential of dozens, even hundreds of these planet colonies for each alliance. we want to encourage them as adding to the games fun, not makeing it harder."

9/13/2008,"so you want to take isk from people, then give some of it back as a lump sum. why ?"
9/13/2008,the same reason why people have a savings account nad the same reason ppl have college funds etc..so u can get a big wad of cash at once ($.$)
9/13/2008,"..im not throwing a fit, just proposing an idea, go troll somewhere else plz.."
9/13/2008,"that would be the following reasons: - those are safe places to keep money. safer than keeping it lying around. but the eve wallet is secure, so this doesn't apply. - because money in those accounts earns interest, thus giving more money than you put in. but you clearly don't want that applying: - so they can prove they have that much money by showing their bank statements. but the api key takes care of that.and what exactly are the benefits of getting a lump sum of money when it is, at best, the same amount that you earned slowly in the first place ?not being able to touch those funds for a while is a disadvantage, and i see nothing to make up for it.why would i want a big lump of cash at once, when i know that it is, at best, the amount i put into it in the first place ?"
9/13/2008,"interesting thing i just noticed. apart from this line (which is clearly an edit he added on):his post is in nearly in complete english, very few abbreviations. but his other posts have a lot more problems with them. like they were written by someone other than the person who wrote the suggestion itself.biggestt, where did you copy and paste this idea from ?"

9/13/2008,no. i pay money to the man already. i don't want to do it in game too.

9/13/2008,"hrr how about npc corps charge 20% tax to fund the storyline wars or something, making it worthwhile to start or join a corp (and thus being wardecable)"
9/13/2008,"i concur...but you need to remember one little thing.what's to stop the cycle from repeating for those corp's who do pay up.it's one thing to war dec for the sake of pvp... its an another when you do nothing but grief them for no reason other than ""your bored""i understand the necessity for the sandbox and all dat.but i'm of the ""honor in combat"" type camp.. so call me oldskool for my reasoning.somethings gotta give somewhere!"

9/13/2008,do not supportb. glory-ious has been wrongly credited for the titan nerf. he is just a a big headed nerd!
9/13/2008,"incorrect. our congress in the united states passes bills like this all of the time, whose only intent is to recognize or credit an issue or person. as the csm is my electoral body in eve, i find it entirely appropriate to at the very least propose similar measures."
9/13/2008,i'm sorry... but what was the point of this topic? and how does it encourage positive aspects in eve online again?all i see here is political trolling.which should be handled anywhere... but here./me thumbs down
9/13/2008,our congres doesn't.caod ----> that way?
9/13/2008,omg another e-mobbing campaign

9/13/2008,theres several videos showing either a noob getting poded or how boring the game really isshows two ships shooting at each other pew... pew... pew... pew.... pew....shows miningshows skill leveling lol funny but very sadyour gonna need 10 more tv commercials to make up for vids like this.
9/13/2008,"yes, youtube has snarky videos about eve, just like it has snarky videos about everything else. i'm a fan of ""eve online is for bob"", myself, but your mileage may vary. what, precisely, is your point? are you suggesting that the csm recommend to ccp that they run 10 more tv commercials? or do you just want them to allege copyright infringement and get the videos taken down? in future, please post pointless whine threads on eve general."

9/13/2008,"no, your right your idea isn't in itself the perfect solution, but it is a good base to start a disscussion from.as for dropping freighter pilots to npc corps the solution is already in game for that problem, suicide ganking, this is still a very valid mechanic it's just no longer economically viable to a large extent, but then this is war and not random opportunistic ganking so the economic downside of doing this isn't as important.the real problem is identifying those people in npc corps to gank, for that i suggest these ill thought out game mechanics.guilt by associationthe ability to include specfic named individuals from npc corps at the time a war-dec is declared. they would be subject to the same conditions as the corp being war-dec'ed and would probably be treated in the same way as if they were a single player corp. they would be bound by the same surrender conditions as those put upon the losing player corp at the end of the war. the winner of the war would not be able to impose a seperate agreement for each named individual and would not be able to carry on a seperate war with different individuals after the corp named in the orignal war-dec has agreed to surrender.now as with war-decs as they currently are (regardless of if this is unfair or not) members of a dec'ed corp can disband and form a new corp, so individual players in npc corps should be able to do something similar. therefore if the player in the npc corp forms their own corp or joins a different player corp then they are removed from the war-dec (but of course at that point they are war-decable anyways)will random people get caught up in this mechanic .... probably. will someone find a way to use this to grief .... always.this of course still dosn't cover the main problem of who is guilty by association, therefore we have ...forensic accountancya new skill which allows you to discover and add specific people to a war-dec. since the aim here is to include individual's in npc corps who are actively supporting a specfic corp you can't just add anyone you like to the war-de, they must be guilty by association.how possible the following mechanic is in terms of coding i have no idea but it would work something like this. after a succesful check of the forensic accountancy skill at the point of war dec the person declaring war will be presented with a list of players in npc corps who fulfill one of the two criteria1) has been part of a player to player trade with a member of the corp being war-dec'ed.2) has created a private contract to either the corp being war-dec'ed or a player in the corp being war-dec'ed.the level of the forensic skill will of course determine how far back they can examine the records for such transactions.the person declaring war would then be able to say if they want each person to be included or not.all in all not the most elegant solution, and probably not even possible to implement, however i think a better way to be able to stop people hiding away in npc corps while actively supporting a corp under a war-dec. there are ways around this, i'm not presenting this as a perfect solution far from it, and will be open to griefers and exploiters, as would any mechanic introduced into the game. but better, i think, than your blanket npc corp nerf which i think would ruin the game play for so many innocent solo players who are in npc corps and who at the end of the day pay the same subscription fee to play this game as you and therefore have as much of a right to play the game, within the games current framework, as you."
9/13/2008,"one thing that would be good to create is ways for smaller weaker,less financed corperations to hurt or raid larger enemy corps.currently in general the bigger corp has the most combatants and the most money and will allways defeat an equilly skilled enemy of a smaller guild to say nothing about how vulnerable all non-pvp corps currently are.many pvp corps are 10x 100x larger than similar non-pvp corps because the wardec forces players to quit to npc corperations and to misson as far away from low sec as possible such places like jeta."
9/13/2008,"little thought in this idea, right? you want to know how it can be exploited to death?- create alt corp- wardec it and select every member of npc corps that you want to grief- offer the worse conditions possible to your alt corp for surrender- accept them within 5 minutes from war declaration, the npc corp members are bound by the therms of surrender.it make your first suggestion a bit better if it is applied at the start of the war, but still is too open to grief play. in every instance, invert the order of your suggestions, putting guilt by association fist kill your proposal at first reading. i doubt there is much people reading the second part after reading a so little thought first part. as the only thing making the idea vaguely reasonable is the second part changing the order will make people at least examine your whole proposal."
9/13/2008,"the fighting style in eve is strategy. everything boils down to statistics, which is great don't get me wrong, but i think that having statistics that are based on physics as well as wonderfully agile ships at our disposal, we should work on doing what we do best. flying.now obviously we don't really know how to jump into a raven and bombard enemies with missiles, so obviously we can't be expected to maneuver our ships with ease, manage enemy distances, and increase/decrease transversal velocity of multiple ships at once. especially if the tools to do so aren't at our disposals.tell a guy to drive a car without a wheel and you quickly get where i'm coming from. he may get out and push but he won't get very far.now for a rough draft of a proposal:- maintaining distance from multiple locked targets, if you are keeping distance from one ship and moving towards another ship you can keep distance from both, thus your ship will turn left,right,up,down looking for an alternative.-setting the interval the increase/decrease velocity hotkeys do.-a new movement, zig zagging. this allows you to increase transversal velocity (handy for missel boats fighting gunners) while keeping distance from a target.if your velocity is 300ms, and his is 200ms, your ship will travel in little zigzags or straight until you reach the keep distance then zig zag maintaining distance.-show a max range of missiles using their speed/time in the tactical view, much like optimal gun range/falloff.-a setting to toggle between showing the bounty or the threat level of rats.if you can think of any more i've no problem with adding them to the proposal!thank you for reading in advance."
9/13/2008,"a couple of those already exist. your ""zigzag"" sounds a lot like orbiting, and generally speaking rat bounties are directly related to rat threat levels."
9/13/2008,"lo all,well the title says it all, give the corp chat channel an motd, so your members log in and see the message of the day!! this is very simple very handy and i should think would be implemented very quickly as ccp obviously already know how to do it :)the reasons for this are simple if you want to get orders out quickly there's no better way,. if you want to give orders for your corp to go out and get 15 kills that day then you just change the motd. all people with the communications officer role, all directors, and obviously ceo's can change it :pthoughts?lunn"
9/13/2008,this is a common request that the csm has dealt with. it was a part of our issue package we sent about 2-3 weeks ago.so you will hear something soon.
9/13/2008,cool thanks
9/13/2008,somone uses the 3d map? wow
9/13/2008,tech1 ships scan bonuses are similar to covert ops the tech 2s go albit furtherno empire faction skills required just archeology to a certain level and spaceship command and will get thier own skill set.anyways the idea is posted in features ideas and discussion now its a very long post and still have alot of construciton going on.
9/13/2008,"the over use of dreads and other caps in pos warfare.i do think there is a problem. i am going to use the benchmark of a dreadnought fleet that can melt a large tower in one siege cycle as an example. its a given that the top ten alliances in game can field such a fleet given advanced notice. with a capital fleet like that the only time a support fleet is necessary is to remove one pos module (the cyno jammer).imagine that you have a medium to small size alliance with one outpost. a hostile alliance is attacking your cycno jammer attempting to bring in capitals to seize your outpost. now you have managed to defend your system cyno jammer from battleship fleets using bubbles, snipers, and capital support for several days. you log off to go to sleep. then, within 8 hours, while you were sleeping, a coalition battleship fleet incapacitated your jammer. you now have 6 death star pos in reinforced, including the tower containing your jump bridge and jammer. your outpost services are all offline and there are several large anchored bubbles on the outpost to prevent undocking attempts. hostile 40+ support fleet on the outpost and there is a hostile cap fleet active in system continuing to reinforce remaining towers.the swiftness an alliance sov can be torn down is totally counter to the arguments that pos warfare takes too long. for the smaller alliances, sov only needs to be taken from the outpost systems to win. it should be a very lengthy and costly make or break effort for a alliance to attempt to siege another. when larger alliance can come in and in a matter of weeks take two regions several outposts and displace three alliances its too short. it lends its self for 0.0 to be too much of a risk to new alliances and prevents them from taking space and prospering. instead, they only become renters of the larger top ten alliances and never owning space of their own.= new level of constellation sovereignty of the little guys.right now if an alliance don't have sov 4 the attacking alliance only needs to break the jammers and take away sov in outpost systems to kick a alliance out. the fewer number of outposts the alliance have the easier it is.we need a easier, more basic, and less restrictive level of constellation sovereignty for smaller alliances.>one outpost at sov level 3 and 50% of the constellation under its sovereignty.>cyno jammers in outpost systems are invulnerable until 50% of the sov in that constellation has been lost.>defending alliance sov can be regained at downtime if the number of towers claiming is greater.= the dreaded focus firethere needs to be some dps loss given when focus fire is used, especially when its used by capital ships. there should be no amount of dreads that can melt a tower in one cycle. that takes away the need of the support fleet and allows the reinforcing all sov towers in a system in hours not days. if there is a point where the gain of an additional cap isn't worth bringing to bear it would lend it self to the use of more support ships and/or smaller scale pos warfare."
9/13/2008,"how about changing the link in item #1 to direct a person interested in the actual dev blog regarding the ludicrous speed issue, thereby allowing the educated person to make their own decision. posting a link to the thread against the change makes the op appear biased (did i read something to that effect already?), unless there is another link for the changes to the ludicrous speed issues the dev's clearly elaborated on.ya, this is late. no, i don't care."
9/14/2008,"fits in nicely with small anchorables, so i think i'll bring this up in a later meeting."
9/14/2008,could be a good idea if they produced a lot of pos fuel - like if one colony in a solar system could produce enough fuel to run every pos in the system (even then i'm not sure if it'd be worth it - depends on what the real bottlenecks of pos logistics are). otherwise it just sounds like it'd be a lot of extra work for nothing.
9/14/2008,"and, the longer a colony is established, the more self-sufficient it becomes... let's say a starting colony has a lot of needs - food, water, oxygen, personnel, electronics... big list.but, as the world is terraformed, the need for oxygen reduces, eventually disappearing completely as the colonists can breathe the air full time. as more land is made available for agriculture, less food & livestock are required. seams of ore get found, factories get built, and so on and so forth. the larger the colonies, the more likely they are to be able to fill specialist personel needs from their own staff... etc.this would mean there would be a vested interest in keeping colonies active and growing, because in the end they will become net exporters (i figure this process should take quite a while).heck, just hire sid meier and have a civilisation mini-game in eve edit - oh, and make it available in high sec as well, with the same requirements on standing as you need for pos at the moment."
9/14/2008,against
9/14/2008,"yeah i like this. i mean i don't jc that much, but there's certainly been times when i've had to sit around waiting on the next clone jump.also it would help people with multiple clones with implants, managing them more like a module than a rig if you see what i mean."
9/14/2008,jcs already make the universe too small. no.
9/14/2008,"the way it is now, the regular clone jumper needs to plan ahead and coordinate his/her jumps at least a little bit. this is good.reducing jump intervals sounds very, very much like the lazy option to me. eve should be made more challenging, not the opposite.apart from that, with everyone involved in some fighting jumping around every 14 hours, aka pply every time they log, there'd be even less loss of implants, ruining that market even more..against."
9/14/2008,i'd like to see this. i'd also like to see mods/rigs that increase more drone related things (like rigs that increase drone bay size).
9/14/2008,yes!i can't even believe this problem still exists. the stupid tactical situations caused by ships travelling at implausibly fast speeds was one of the reasons why i stopped playing for a year.
9/14/2008,come back here where i can catch you.
9/14/2008,and a bump towards ccp - an update on what they currently think about what's said so many years ago would be niceyours truly
9/14/2008,couse its chribba and miners need lub to
9/14/2008,"sounds like a sheer pwngage ""look at my killll"" option.need? no.want? only by those who want/like just that. i'm not on that boat, however."
9/14/2008,"what i wonder now tough ,will the csm talk about this idea with ccp ?"
9/14/2008,i guess we are talking about two different things.i think you are talking about the chart and table average.i am talking about the average that's listed in the window where you enter/change the price/duration/quantity of the sell/buy order.
9/14/2008,"are they not the same? i couldn't tell you whether it's the 5-day or 20-day that the order window uses to tell you how reasonable your price is, but i assume it's one of the two."
9/14/2008,"pretty sure i heard some ccp guys talking about the effects update including new sound effects, but just in case they're not, it needs doing"
9/14/2008,bump for great justice
9/14/2008,good idea on more than a few points.tower capture == less tower production necessary == less boring grinding bs and more playing the game.
9/14/2008,"eh? a tax just so you can get a refund? dumb idea. go get a r&d agent and then only cash in the cores once a year if you want a yearly ""bonus"".you probably are one of those types that spends every single isk you have and are perpetually under 5 mil in the bank. (in rl as well.) take this as an opportunity to learn some budgeting skills.the easiest way to do it is either save up all your loot for a few months at a go and then finally be able to get enough cash together at once to buy what ever it is you were wanting, or do like i do and set up an alt. every time i log on i transfer 1mil isk to that character and every time i finish a mission. it adds up very quickly."
9/14/2008,"ahh, well then sounds like ur saying tax back in rl is a dumb idea? fair call i spose x)i personally dont mind the tasty check every july, tho of course i can see why its not excactly the best idea..oh and your right i dont often have more than 5 mill in my rl bank account but i im not that poor in eve either, still not excactly rich thoedit: typo"
9/14/2008,hmmmmm not bad at all.
9/14/2008,"when i think of rigs, i think of crazy bull**** like fitting a v12 merlin in a pinto.give us rigs for that kind of thing, then you'll see some specialized setups with really tricky behavior.oversized engine mounting -- -50% ab pg requirementmagnum shell chamber -- +50% damage -80% tracking. a matar junk rig that's for slinging oversized ammo at amarr ships. requires beefing up the turret mount to compensate for the increase in propellant.what'd be really cool is if rigs would respond to certain ship bonuses. i.e. gallante ships with hybrid damage bonuses have dedicated cyclotron hardware that can be jimmy-rigged into boosting plasma smartbomb output.brutor hobo tents -- brutor tribe engineers who are laid off from ccp fly around in spaceships collecting parts of other ships and attaching them to your ship until you're flying a naglfar.chimera's 'r us -- strip the guts of one hull and replace it with similar systems from another ship. thorax with bonuses to small projectile turrets for efficient support swatting?limit to t1 hulls as the stuff has to be simple enough to begin with in order to be mated without major headaches.launcher tube extensions -- fit multiple missiles in a launcher by ripping out the rapid reloading mechanisms. -400% rof but 200% damage increase. sb fun rig :-)oh, and my absolute favorite candidate for rigs that can truly make some cool ships:pinpoint defense calibration -- shield systems on the ship are turned off and instead used in conjunction with the armor system, intercepting incoming fire that armor is bad at handling, applying shield resists to armor. shield base resists and shield mods apply somewhat to armor in exchange for zero base shield.harmonic containment destruction -- hybrid turret optimal cut 50% and damage increase of 30% plasma containment collapses on itself at short ranges, causing an even more massive explosion.ammo overfeed -- sacrificing accuracy for raw output, mini engineers jack up the ammo feed rate beyond the turret's vibration damping capabilities. +25% rof, -50% sig resolution.analog launcher control -- reduces cpu requirements of launchers and lowers missile explosion velocity as missiles no longer do higher order trajectory corrections.barrel extensions -- +25% kinetic damage of projectile ammo -50% tracking +20% falloffecm failsafe removal -- sacrifice shielding systems designed to protect an ecm boats own sensors for increased pwn. -50% sensor strength +30% jammer strength. for pulling off really intense jams where counter-jamming is less of a concern.just slewing out a bunch of numbers, but yeah, rigs are really kinda boring and don't offer any real increases to ""interesting"" setups with single-minded purposes."
9/14/2008,"i had this idea about a week ago, not sure if it was new or not..but still would be helpful.i would like to see a notice when wrecks and cargo canisters are going to expire. that way, i know how long i have to loot or salvage wrecks before they poof into nonexistence.basically, you roll over the item in space or on the overview with your mouse, and it tells you ""expires in x amount of time"" or ""expires at xx xx""(eve time).idea posted here:"
9/14/2008,"personally, not too keen on this. i can see how it would be convenient in some circumstances, but it just seems a bit easy mode for me. i would prefer cans to have a random duration before they pop (or ""destabilise due to the ravages of space"" or whatever it is).as for the intel-gathering aspect... from a role playing point of view, you see a can floating in space, how to heck are you meant to know when it pops? do they have a digital timer on the side counting down?not supported, even though it would make my life easier"
9/14/2008,"your proposal is surrender terms. while they make it so you cannot be scammed, you need to put in a clause such that the winner may not re-dec the loser for 6 months or whatever. or else you can re-dec them and laugh at them again. also how about if the aggressor gets bored and retracts the war, then he owes the loser 50% (or whatever) of the 'surrender' fee. of course i don't think we are getting any impovements short of an entire rework of war declarations and objectives."
9/14/2008,"hello, i will try to be brief and concise.public pos issue i know that it was stated that this would not be possible as there are many concerns about ownership. but what about a contract that allowed temporary access to a specific function of a pos. so say a corporation with extra slots available could place one of those slots up on the contract system for a price per project basis.the party that gets the contract then has rights to use but not ownership of that single slot. this could turn into a corporate financial model with out the need for ccp to expand current facilities.war decsas a victim of wardec griefers and extorters, i agree that there needs to be a few fixes. corp size may be one things that only corporations of a set size can do war decs or be the victim of wardecs. but more then that, a way to end them. the best way i can see would be to use the contract system to create treaties. a proposed treaty could have both penalties and terms. terms used to cease the war while penalties to make sure parties that violate the treaty are punished. works for the rest of the world, why not a game.secure cansconsidered useless except as billboards. i would like to see them useful seeing as the flagging system is useless in my experience, at least to the small time miner. so the idea, allow seccans to be anchored and then expanded in space. this is used in ships to save space. why not allow a seccan to do this after it has been anchored.simple really, you take it out in a indy. plop it where you want it, then anchor. apply your password and expand the can. a can is after all nothing more then a box with allot of empty space inside. it does not ned to be assembled in transport. and this in no way would harm the current method of cargo expansion as this is only for seccans.size wise, this would allow a seccan to compete with or exceed the jetcan. a huge sec can could have double the capacity of the jetcan and protect form thieves and griefers that would pop the can for fun. just a thought.other thoughts:- limited capitol ship licenses for high (ish) sec areas. industrial and the such, hey you do it for pos's.- point defense array: hot topic, the thought is simple. array has x% chance to hit incoming missile. skill in pd array boosts chance by x%, total not to exceed 20-25% total. defenders could then be removed as useless any way. arrays could use faction standards for ammo, with standard ammo possibilities and effects.- point defense drones: pd drones would do the same as the above. higher chance to hit and kill, but are vulnerable to attack and to be killed by other ships or drones.(i remember the days when i could use a smart bomb to pop missiles, when missiles could be seen as entities with speed and distance readouts...i miss that.)- where are those ""true"" asteroid belts we were promised so long ago. i am tired of empty belts, it is annoying and no, i am not interested in low sec.- and speaking of lowsec, a better way for small groups and corps in empire to contact and gain passage into a lowsec sovereignty with out being podded on the spot.- finally, what about allowing players to purchase licenses for a set amount of time so they can hunt bounties in highsec. thus making bounties worth the mechanic."
9/14/2008,"feedbackin short, some think it's a cool idea, but some don't believe the damage mitigation capabilities would be sufficient for the t2 roles and that it's still just a 1bn liability that won't see the light of pvp.role insufficienciesokay, so i have these cool mods that i can use to give solid buffs my gang mates as long as we fly with marginally superior coordination when compared to a bunch of jackasses, but one big problem: i'm supposed to be mitigating damage while trying to hold a formation together at the same time. isn't this quite the paradox?how much bling should a blinged ship bring?well, as a bs, it can become too much if it's given too many tools to function in its t2 roles, but doesn't this remind you why siege modules have penalties? imbalance isn't uberness. imbalance is uberness without concessions.the solution: t2 roles <--flip switch--> bs rolesactive stealth. deactivates weapons and reduces signature radius by ~75%. comes with an inertia/agility penalty. stacks. takes up the same slots as the fleet maneuvering modules, so you can mix and match how much damage mitigation and special bonus mods you want to fit and tailor the ship to your gangs needs.this is probably ideal. it can be either really good at the t2 role or pretty okay at the bs role with the same fit, but not at the same time. that's tactical flexibility and something i think pilots would enjoy/expect from a t2 bs.squadron vs starfleet marshallsquadron marshall gets only two slots for special mods. with one active stealth array, it has room for one special role, and also does okay in the bs department when it's not having to worry too much about damage mitigation. if everything goes to hell, flip the switch and get a cruiser sig radius while trying to buy time to get to a gate or for the rest of the gang to do their thing.most likely i would see squadron marshalls taking on the role as warp-in interceptors, using their special warp signature detection mods to get a wtz for the gang while being able to probably tank whatever they fly into. being able to detect ships warping in before they actually show up on grid isn't a bad perk by itself.starfleet marshall has four slots for special mods. can comfortably fit two active stealth arrays and two formation mods. if an absolutely essential formation mod is desired and you only want to bring one ship, you can go with three active stealth arrays and take nearly zero damage while doing your thing. on the other hand, if you want lots of tricks up your sleeve, you can go with three formation mods and one active stealth.a word on formation link effect strength:command mods are non-conditional, as in you press a button and your gang gets the entire bonus. formation links require coordination and will actually impose penalties to ships flying against the grain. formation link strength should be set in light of the fact that they sacrifice tactical flexibility for tactical focus. potential bonus should be larger than simple gang mods can offer. you have to be doing something right to receive the full bonus, and in eve i think this is referred to as either ""skill"" or ""teamwork"" and is looked favorably upon in some circles."
9/14/2008,"woudlnt mind having own music through the jukebox and tbh a full sound overhaull would be awesome, i dont want my strip miner sounding like that civi mining lasser i used to use all those 4 years ago"
9/14/2008,"opens up a whole new world of spying opportunities, but hey, sounds kind of cool"
9/14/2008,******ed idea.
9/14/2008,"seems to make sense to me.obviously it would be nescessary to allow the passenger to simply eject if something went wrong (taxi driver ctds, or decides to go berserk).it would be interesting as a proffesion for people if a secure isk exchange system was implemented for it. an escrow system could release isk after a person has been transfered from point a to point b for example."
9/14/2008,"interesting but it has pretty limited use. combat functions would be pointless because they're hardly taxing as it is, plus it would pretty much assume perfect implementation for it to be worthwhile (i.e. no extra lag). space taxi type stuff could be neat though - for either shuttling pods with implants around to bringing people between trade hubs and 0.0 gateways. it'd be an interesting sub-profession to pilots with great nav skills (especially blockade runners). that said i'm not really sure if the demand for something like that would make it anything other than a quickly forgotten novelty."
9/14/2008,"what about standings? i could see this being easily exploited by alts as a way to temporarily deal with war decs and standing. both occupants would have to adopt all the wardecs of both and the lowest standings of both to avoid abuse of this.on the whole, though, this is an interesting idea. i'm pretty sure it's been suggested before, though, and never went anywhere then. i'm betting it would be extremely difficult to implement."
9/14/2008,"in all honesty this should have been done with the birth of carriers motherships and of course the titan, if you can fit a ship in there why not the pod as wellthis should be fairly easy to impliment."
9/14/2008,looks awesome. but it will need some tweeking so it doesnt get exploited.
9/14/2008,"i see why they did the assembled and disassembled states. and really i agree because it allows the transport of more goods with less space. i some what disagree with the destruction of rigs though in the process...but a solution still is needed so here are my two isk.proposal for fix: a rigged ship can be disassembled with out damage to the rig. but the cost comes as a increase to the disassembled space taken. so for each rig that is on the ship, more parts of the ship must remain assembled. this would mean that your custom ship can be packed and transported, but to do so is more costly but less costly then replacing all the rigs or taking the time to transport the ships one by one."
9/14/2008,visa guy doing a better job then any of em tbh.
9/14/2008,"no goons, thank you for visiting the csm topic. goons should not have control over anything that can change the turn of the game. we have seen what your representative does on the csm, as such, the only reason a goon rep is there is due to your own numbers, because no sane ""regular"" eve player would ever vote for a goon. i am fairly certain that if we polled every single person in eve with the questions: ""should all goons be banned unilaterally by ccp?"" we would receive about 80% of yes. i was hoping most of you went to warhammer."
9/14/2008,locked.troll.
9/14/2008,"is there any update on the issue?oh, and yes, signed. the background for the third bloodlines was promised more then two years ago, but then pushed back and forgotten."
9/14/2008,"awful idea. one of the nicest parts of eve is that your attributes don't really control you. started off as pve but want to go into pvp? no problem! might take you a bit more time than someone who went pure per/wil, but you'll get there and be just as effective. shoehorning people into certain roles because of their stats is way too much like every other generic mmorpg out there. honestly, i like where things stand with attributes and learning skills. if you really want to get into the whole min/maxing thing to get the absolute optimal training times, then yeah you can do the learning skills thing. if you don't, that's cool too. if you have good sp in gunnery, it won't be any more or less effective just because you didn't bother with learning skills beforehand."
9/14/2008,"not discussing if we have to remove em skills or notbut i keep reading: there is no practical ways to do sohere is a practical way_let's say we've find a way to enhance the pod interface and it now gives a perma +5 or +7 or +10 (weee!) to all attributes_remove the learning skills from the learning tree_allow each existing char to self-reassign the number of sp he had in the learning speciality(like if you had 1,2m you can right-click > instant train the skills you want till you've spend it all.)maybe double the bonus of cyber learning implants: +2/+4/+6/+8/+10 instead of the actual +1/+2/+3... to keep significant differences between playersthis would lead to a general decrease in skill-training time, meaning you'd have to train for only 15 years to get all skills to v...well ccp if you don't like my idea, you can as well x2 everyone's sp/hour !much appreciated! thanks!edit:train of the skill spelling level ii completed."
9/14/2008,la vista... you better not let it slip this time
9/14/2008,don't worry. it was a part of the package we sent for sure
9/14/2008,"quick question thoughim trying to peice together a 'project' (fancy word for a 15 post idea in features and ideas discussion fourm) and its not done yet, how much time do i have to the next meeting or pass up?"
9/14/2008,"1,5 months."
9/14/2008,thanks for the heads up ill try to get done in time then
9/14/2008,an updated ui would be great
9/15/2008,rolling this back on up to p1 so that maybe someone who gives a damn will take a look and make a comment.t2 inferior to base t1 = bad.
9/15/2008,"i think planets would have differences based on their conditions im not big on the idea of tereforming as much as adaptability to a particular planet.sure a jungle world will be easily populated but a stony moon? i dont really see that being tereformed as much as exploited ive also seen icy planets, jupiter gas,,saturn gas, volcanic stone, earth like and many of these are different (like an earth world with storms, or worlds seemingly covered in lights. i do believe that colinists should have a morale and a faction so that after war or after a new owner takes over morale and loyalty will be low as will any production and will need to be rebuilt this might mean bringing in medicle supplies or luxuries above any basic needs.these colinies could also have random occurances like diasters like floods, factory explosions, riots, plagues, solar flares, ect that have to be delt with by players sort of like naturaly occuring quests which would bring alot to richen the stark and boring world of eve and make it more personal and less spreadsheety."
9/15/2008,"this should actually be the alternitave to moon mining. having people to do it on the planet/moon may not get you much to begin with, but over time it could become more efficient then with an array.this topic is endless."
9/15/2008,"excellent idea,/supported"
9/15/2008,still no update for us even with recent update to the in development bit really would be nice to know what the deal is.
9/15/2008,"i love this whole concept! i'd be able to wake up and jumpclone to screw around with my cousin way off on the other side of the galaxy in the morning before class, then later in the evening i get done with class and work and jc back to wherever at the end of the night."
9/15/2008,"you leave amarr space?oh, and 'supported'!"
9/15/2008,"planetary flight opens a large can of worms that i am not sure ccp wants to deal with. admittedly, it would be cool, but the issue is once you have it what good is it? ok, you can fly around a planet...ummm...ok. this is the can of worms, to make it worth wile they will need missions, they will need models, and terrains...planets and planets of terrains. atmospheric effects, structures, ground clutter, little commuter ships and shuttles, the list just goes on.i think it would be good, but it would have to be done right. and there is just to much to do it right now. especially once you do do it, well...then we are going to want to land the ship and wander around. do clones even count if your eaten by something and you ship is derelict on some distant moon?i frankly would rather have them implement real honest to god asteroid belts in systems instead. i am just so tired of having no rocks to mine in empire cause all the ""belts"" are mined out of existinse. i am a miner, i like to blow rocks to dust and sell my minerals. darn hard to sell something i can not find cause they have been picked clean. and this one predates castor...yeah."
9/15/2008,"this is just an idea, but while recruiting, i experienced a lot of players who stated that they want to stay in npc corp all day cause they have no tax and can't be wardecced. this seems a bit odd. /me thinks that a flat 10% tax (or even a dynamical rate depening on the time the player stayed in npc corp) would be good for eve, as it would encourage some people to join a player corp and play together. and on the other hand (considering the complaints about high sec carebear farmers) we would get a fair system and an additional isk sink. if players don't want to get wardecced, they stay in npc and pay taxes like everybody else in a player corp. if they don't want to pay taxes, they can join a player corp or build their own, though having the risk of beeing decced.sure, this wouldn't help if the player would go back to npc corp when wardecced, but that would be another problem to solve then. maybe something like a 7 day 50%tax rate after leaving a player corp?pleased to hear your opinions"
9/15/2008,"sensible, but no proposal that nerfs isk farmers will ever be accept4ed."
9/15/2008,"you know the phrase ""no taxation without rapresentation""?in this situation it will be: ""no taxation without services"". if a player ina npc corp can open hangar to share with his alt/friends, plant up a pos (possibly with pay for use services for the corp members, sharing a pos service in one of the npc corp would be wonderful), it will be ok to pay a 10% tax rate (and even get some form of war dec against against the corp or individual in it). as long as that is not implemented, there is no corp service you should pay with your tax."
9/15/2008,being made immune to capsuleer corp wardecs is a service well worth paying for.
9/15/2008,"i agree with daelin - being immune to the entire premise of the game should have a cost.10% for the first month or two, then 20% for another month or two, with a daily increase in tax rate of 0.5% (allowing someone to remain in an npc corp for 200 days before they're at 100% tax) after two to three months.leaving an npc corp reduces the tax rate toward that faction by 0.5% per day while in a player corp. standings for refines in that faction's stations would be, after leaving the npc corp, based on the character's standings against the established tax rate they accrued while in the npc corp.college corps (i.e. newb schools) should limit players to tier 3 skills max, level 2 agents max, and completely bar their members from lowsec (i.e. newbs should not be able to jump into lowsec/0.0 at all). in an rp sense it's because the colleges simply cannot afford to train pilots to such advanced levels, and for their own personal protection the gates deny passage into 'dangerous' space.non-school npc corps could allow jumps into low/nullsec and have no limitations on the level of skills that can be trained.but freighters or capital ships could not be flown (just trained), and all mining lasers yeild only 50% of their peak efficiency.level 4 quality 0 agent cap.in the end... get players out of npc corps, by any and all means available."
9/15/2008,"you can't force people to make themselves vulnerable to pvp, too many will just up and quit. what you can do is impose sufficient penalty that it does not remain the common sense solution for all players and alliances looking to do trade, industry, logistics, or missions.the npc corp residents pay through taxes, the rest pay through the risk of being wardecced. so long as wardecs either lock players into their corporation for the duration or remain active on players after they leave their corp for the duration this could work quite well.i'd also go so far as to suggest outright banning certain ships from use while in an npc corp such as cov-ops, recons, exhumers, freighters, and carriers (i'd be all up for all t2 and capitals but that may be considered too harsh). to avoid the use of npc corps for high level logistics, scouting, and mining. this leaves only pure industrialists and station traders unaffected and they really aren't going to be greatly effected by a war-dec anyway.i strongly believe that while npc corp protection and concord need to exist to support certain player groups they should not, by any means, be free. otherwise there's little practical reason to ever expose yourself to risk.a sensible npc corp tax amount would be around 20%, 10% more than typical player corporation tax."
9/15/2008,"my opinion is that there is no tax that you can impose that will cause a dyed in the wool pve player to do anything other than gripe, or quit. make it too low, they'll just gripe, and keep right on doing what they're doing. make it too high, and they'll quit. so, unless your objective is simply to punish them because you don't like the way they play, i don't think you're going to achieve anything.here is the fundamental question you have to ask: do pve only players belong in this game? if your answer is no, sure, make it as unattractive for them as you'd like. if your answer is yes, what you really ought to be doing is improving the pve content in empire, 'cause it sucks. the fact that we have pve only players in this game at all is just a testament to how deeply averse some players of mmos are to pvp.i proposed something similar here recently. it didn't get much support. i doubt this will get much support. ccp is moving in the opposite direction. they're floating the idea of enhancing empire, to give the very players you'd be trying to discourage with this encouragment to continue what they're doing, and for more of them to sign up.as my grandpa used to say, i think you're trying to shovel **** against the tide here."
9/15/2008,esp with fw there's now a perfect rp reason for taxes. the empires need to pay for their wars so no more free rides for capsuleers. personally i think 10% is too low but i support the principle.
9/15/2008,this.supported 100%
9/15/2008,"i can agree that the npc corp should have a negative effect for the privilege of staying out of corporate pvp. the issue is that some people just are not interested in pvp and the npc corps fulfill that roll. some people just like to hang out and rat or mine. nothing wrong with that.the issue i have though is that npc corps are used also by experienced players to cause trouble and escape repercussions. while others use an npc alt for their corporations gain (scouting and the such). so the question is, how to you maintain the play option for those that just want to spend their $15 a month doing that. while getting rid of those that exploit the safety and anonymity it provides."
9/15/2008,"20% for non fw npc corps if your character is over 2 million skill points, or 3 months old. 10% for fw npc corpsi think drawing the distinction between fw and non fw is important. however before the differing tax rates are implemented it needs to be much harder to join/leave a fw corp at will. keep in mind tax rates do not harm real newbie activities at all. low bounty amounts are completely untaxed by the games tax system for example."
9/15/2008,"i like the sentiment (encourage people to leave npc corps and join player corps, and take more risks), but the stick is entirely the wrong way to do it, as has been observed here already - if the penalty is small, the npc corp community will gripe, not change; if the penalty is large, the npc corp community will leave. neither of those outcomes is good for the game.the carrot is a much better answer. improved pve and empire content (and fw is a good example of both) legitimizes the npc corp community and gives them more to do. an improved 0.0 experience (i think overhauling sovereignty rules will help a lot with this, to reduce newer alliances' entry barriers) will encourage players who can handle risks to take them.sorry, not supported."
9/15/2008,devs... may be yours post answer on this thread?

9/15/2008,definatly worth the coding effort i think!
9/15/2008,"techlab is invaluable.if closed i can well see the only possible compromise being a sticky thread on the gamedev forum with the title ""for information about the eve api and player generated tools"" and then simply have a link to an externally hosted forum.do ccp really want to push this information onto an external forum - and make it harder for new devvers to find?"
9/15/2008,i'm very sure that is not the case. at least not with the items that see a lot of quiet days.
9/15/2008,how are you sure? a dead day contributes to the average at the price of the last transaction. i'm referring to the red and green trend lines in the price history display.
9/15/2008,you stole my i dea i posted this idea weeks ago still supported tho
9/15/2008,"totally supported... offline towers that take ages to blow up is stupid and the idea of being able to steal these assets is very appealing. the only change i would make is that i would make the timer much shorter before a tower gets tagged as abandoned, maybe 24 or at a push 48 hours. by doing this, an extra layer of depth would be added to 0.0 territoral conflicts as aggressors of territory would now have the ability to attack space by holding gates preventing fuel from getting to such poses until the pos is labeled abandoned, then simple going up and switching ownership (though obviously this would be only done in weaker held territory such as systems where only 1-2 poses are claiming sov)"
9/15/2008,"simply no. you want the moon? you wardec the corporation and destroy the tower (in high sec) or you can destroy the tower even without a wardec in low sec/0.0.towers of closed corporations are removed from the game but as long as the corporation exist the tower should stay anchored.as a added note ccp love you for destroying towers, as they are sold by npc and so a isk sink."
9/15/2008,supported!
9/15/2008,cargo cannisters? yes.wrecks.... nah.maybe a generally well known fact as to how long they [wrecks]last? ok.but your going to add a major load to an already taxed system.: o /
9/15/2008,"supported, this would be helpful. this is no more an easy button than it is for the market window to display historical sales data - it's useful context which is already available to the player but at the moment you have to go out of your way to calculate. it makes life equally easier for everyone - the people creating wrecks/cans and anyone trying to steal from them .i don't think it would tax the servers at all. clearly, the timestamp already exists, since the can/wreck vanishes at some point and the servers already know when. no additional server-side calculations are necessary, even: the timestamp (time created) can be sent to the client computers, and the client computers can calculate how much time left until any visible can/wreck expires."
9/15/2008,"after my previous post yesterday, i figured i would place this as a single item. i will do the others at a later date.the purpose of this proposal is to look at a retooling of the secure cans and their purpose. this is not only to make them more useful, but to reduce load on the servers and to fulfill their original purpose. that being to protect miners from can flippers and thieves. this would be done through two key methods, increasing the seccans m3 to surpass that of the jetcan and allowing a new function in space, assembly in space.addendum: this proposal could also be applied to the ""drop can"". the drop can is an insecure container deployed by industrials. and was originally intended to be the can for mining. but was never used due to the free nature of the jetcan.historyas many that started this game five or more years ago know, the jet can was never meant to be used for mining. the only reason it has been is due to it's massive capacity. something that is it's self a remnant from the early stages of the games development.later the secure can was created to combat ore thieves, something that was much easier way back when. but due to changes in the system, this has become a moot issue due to capacity sizes.m3 increaseseccans suffer from a lack of space, this limiting factor is their primary failure. their lack of capacity limits their usefulness by miners as miners would need to place 7.05 giant seccans to every one jetcan. by increasing the seccans capacity to surpass the jetcan their usefulness will be more evident. a giant secure can could feasibly be double the capacity of a jetcan and thus fulfill its roll.but this opens a problem, what could be large enough to cary this huge can. the answer is simple!assemble in space!a can is nothing more then walls and empty space, why does it need to be assembled before it is deployed and anchored. players planning to use the new cans could do so simply.1) drop secure can in space2) anchor secure can3) assemble secure canwhen your done using it, you reverse the steps. this would allow an industrial to carry a giant seccan in the hold. even if the seccan was just a 10x reduction in space. one that has a capacity of 55000m3 (double the jet can) could compress down to 5500m3 for transport, just 500m3 more then a disassembled frigate. and far less then the capacity of even a moderately outfitted industrial.this alteration would mean that can swapping, flipping, and thieving would be reduced. and with fewer entities in space, less activity, and more security, miners can do their jobs as intended when the secure cans were originally created.oh and almost forgot, it would give the animators something to do as they could probably come up with a really cool animation for it assembling and disassembling in space.edit: all values listed are for example or proof of concept only. if approved and fulfilled, values will probably be different."
9/15/2008,"let start out with why do you think miners are entitled to worry free mining with out taking some loss in productivity?tbh i think is too easy just to sit there and mine away as it is. npc's pose no real threat to most miners in highsec, all they have to worry about is the occasional can flipper and even then if they are paying attention and aren't complete noobs they don't run any real risk of getting destroyed.miners currently have the choice to avoid the whole thing by fitting expanders or mining in to secure cans. for this they pay the price lower productivity and thats how this game works you get rewarded for taking risks and the last thing we need to do is to remove the little risk that is left in mining."
9/15/2008,"i do not believe that entitlement has anything really to do with it. can flipping was a side effect of a faulty fix. criminal flagging was a product of the insecure nature of things. the developers originally created the secure can to help stop ore thieves. some thing hat was much more common after beta. but because of the size of the cans, they never were popular.can flipping came about with the criminal flagging system, that being an attempt to make thieves more accountable for their actions. but given miners rarely mount enough weapons any way to stop an ore thief and that the one ""fix"" opened up another can of worms, flipping cans. it just opened another hole to cause grief to people that sit there for hours repetitively mining.the goal of this is just to close those holes that ccp tried to close in the first place but could not through five years of work. and frankly, everyone benefits from miners, even the pirates and griefers.plus, eventually many of us will find a group and goto lowsec or 0.0. at that point it is not our ore on the line but our ships and pods. i just feel in that situation that our ore be safe (relatively speaking) and that any losses be recuperated through it's retrieval. this would allow that and hey you get your kills and our stuff."
9/15/2008,"it is my understanding that jetcans were never meant for mining, and that originally, there was no such thing as 'jetcan aggro'. this meant that if you discarded of anything in space, and someone else picked it up, there was no aggro.doesn't sound like a 'faulty fix' to me, since ccp has stated that jetcan mining is a byproduct of someone's original thought, and not a reason for having jetcans in the first place."
9/15/2008,nope. that is what the bears asked for. they wanted the ability to kill the thief. because thieves were snaking cans and could nothing about it. and they got exactly what they asked for. and the jet can was never and intended feature for mining. so you have a balance.
9/15/2008,"jetcan mining came about as a byproduct of ccp giving the jet can a ludicrous 27,500m3 capacity. the intended cans could not compare and were relegated to obscurity. but ore thievery was becomming an issue in those days.ccp created the secure cans as a way to fight that. but the capacity of the secure can was nothing compared to the jetcan. eventually, ccp created the criminal flagging system (cfs) that made jetcans and things killed by a player that players property.that did little to really stop thieves unless the mining op was heavily armed. and created the can flipping griefer, something that had not existed before the cfs. that is why i stated that the cfs was a faulty fix, as it did not completely fix ore thieving and created can flipping."
9/15/2008,"you, yourself can fix ore thieving by simply using the 'intended' cans, yet you're looking for the 'perfectly secure' method with huge returns and no risk. suck it up, and either take that risk, or mine smarter. have an alt or a buddy in a hauler pick up from a secure can, as you fill it.there are already a huge number of solutions. you're just looking to complain about the lack of the one you want."
9/15/2008,this is my understanding of it as well. jet can aggro was only added after miners complained about not not being able to defend themselves from people taking their cans now they have the option to fight back. its there option to fight it doesn't force the engagement at all.regardless i think that the idea of these super large secure containers atleast in highsec applications completely distorts the risk/reward ratio.that being said i wouldn't mind them for lowsec/0.0 useage cause there getting you can stolen is the least of your worries and could be quite useful in a number of appilcations.
9/15/2008,"what you are asking for is a no risk afk mining solution. there is a myriad of different solutions. yet those solutions might be too inconvenient for you, you might be required to play the game."
9/15/2008,"we keep running into each other, and seem to share the same ideas. i'd like to subscribe to your newsletter."
9/15/2008,"i am not complaining. i have merely stated a fix to the original solution that did not work. and i accept that there are those that will dislike it because it closes off their mode of fun.as stated, if miners are happy to mine in high sec for piddles, then so be it. let them have their piddles. but if they want to goto low sec or 0.0, then they can assume the risk out there. it is after all high sec.why should pirates and griefers have an easy time of making havoc in an area meant to be secure from that sort of thing. it's not like there are not enough ways to drive people nuts besides this method."
9/15/2008,this is where you logic fails. repeatedly ccp have said highsec is ment to be safer not safe.you either take the safer route and lose some productivity or you take a little risk and potentually lose some ore but bring in larger sums. this is how risk vs. reward works and it is the idea that this game is built apon.
9/15/2008,"it's not meant to be secure. even the gm's say so. it's meant to be safer than lowsec and nullsec, but not safe."
9/15/2008,"true, i used the wrong term. but even this does not guarantee safety. if the player in in a player corp, they can still be war dec'd. if the player is not paying attention they can still be popped. heck some one in a retriever can be easily suicide ganked even with the new concord revisions.and the list goes on and on. heck, given the restriction on anchored cans right now, there is no perfect safety short of staying in a station.but in all honesty, and here is my assumption, are you two at all after the ore? or are you just fighting it because you do it to cause havoc and the occasional isk pay out by a noob for the hyjack of their ore. judging by the resistance, you guys actively are part of the pirate side of things. so what do you loose?"
9/15/2008,"anything involving containers is not afk. the no-risk afk mining solution already exists, and it's called ""hauler with a miner ii"". dock up once every 2 hours, and make a good million or so every time you do. the rate of income is pathetically low, but it's easy as falling down, and risk-free with a proper setup."
9/15/2008,while i dont really steal cans anymore in my first 6 months or so i used to steal cans for profit. used a rifter to pick it see if i could get an engagment if nothing happened i would bring in my alt to scoop up the can. but still i ran the risk of losing my ship and i did a few times (rifter vs. hulk == fail). it ended up being a fun way to make isk and its an easy way to introduce yourself to pvp. alot of pvpers/pirates have grown up in this manner.as a side note to this story the guy that i used to raid his can alot actually starting training pvp skills to fight me and we had all sorts of fun hes acctually joined my corp and now almost a year and a half later we go kill stuff together.
9/15/2008,"well then with this insight, what might you suggest. the securecan suggestion was to help miners hold onto their goods. but that does put the thief completely out of business. heck it is almost out of business as it stands.but what might make the pill easier to swallow. may be tie it into something else, may be allowing a potential pirate to decrypt the can and access the good inside. so while secure for a short time, not completely fail safe. that could start a lucrative business of thieves, where people are foolish enough to leave there goods and some one can come along and with a little work and time break the lock to the safe."
9/15/2008,hacking skill. w/hacking and analyzer mods.
9/15/2008,"ok, i know there are 1 million posts on this and i'm sure somebody has already posted this idea (or something similar) but going through pages and pages of threads to find the right one to post on is quite dull so i'll start a new post the idea is quite simple: change local chat from ""immediate mode"" to ""delayed mode"" and then add a line of text under the system information (at the top left of the screen) which would show the status of a systemfriendly - only corp/alliance members and members of high standing in localneutral - system contains players of neutral standinghostile - system contains players of negative standingwarzone - system contains players who are at war with youfollowing the system status would be a number which shows the number of statistical contacts in local for example: if a system has a ""hostile"" status, then the number would show the amount of hostile and neutrals in system.of course there are those of you who would say that this simply puts the problem of local chat in a different format (ie. an early warning tool which makes players near uncatchable). indeed you would be right, so to facilitate this we add a simple timer to it by making it only update every 30-60 seconds. this would mean that when a system status changes, there is the risk that hostiles have had this time to search you out making it too late to allign and warp out while still giving ratters/miners a little bit of warning which doesn't make things totally impossible for them.advantages of this changelocal chat is no longer a requirement freeing up screen real-estatelocal chat can still be used to post intel on nearby gatecampspromotes the use of scouts while not forcing meta-gaming levels of gameplaywould not add to lag as the information for status is obtained from data which is already sent to the client by local chatpromotes the use of scouts again but allowing the possibility of gangs hiding there numbers which adds a level of depth to fleet based pvpother changes that would be neededthere is one change i think that would be needed to make this work. currently scouts are able to post intil into channels by dragging names from local to intel chat channels. with this change this becomes very difficult so i propose the ability to drag names from the overview instead. this makes the role of covert-ops scout even more important as he would need a physical view of hostiles to get good intel to fleet commanders"
9/15/2008,ive been looking around but i can only seem to find notes for 1 meeting?and when are the next ones?
9/15/2008,"next meeting hasn't been announced - last i heard, the csm is having discussions with ccp on the replies to the last batch of issues, and has decided to hold off on more meetings until after that's concluded. foolish, imo, but that's what's happening. as for meeting minutes, links to the chatlogs for all the meetings have been posted in the relevant meeting threads, and minutes have been posted under csm on the left sidebar for a couple of them. unfortunately, the chatlogs are scattered from hell to breakfast, because they cannot possibly be posted on the eve forums(given character limits), and that ccp and serenity have both fallen off the face of the earth when it comes to posting what they said they'd post in terms of supporting documentation.frankly, i think your best bet might be to evemail ankhesentapemkah, and ask her to either post the minutes on the forums or email them to you personally. she has, apparently, been submitting minutes for all the meetings, and she'd presumably have copies. actually - ank, if you're reading this, please post the meeting minutes in the meeting threads. if ccp won't, we get to do this stuff ourselves."
9/15/2008,the next meeting is actually this wednesday. it's just not announced because ankh has arranged it due to lack of meetings otherwise.but you are right. we need all the other minutes. i assume they are stuck at ccp.i'll try and figure out where they are.
9/15/2008,somebody give that lady a medal.
9/15/2008,i just suggested in an another thread there should be a 1 to 2 week cooldown period after the end of a war'dec.6 months would be a bit too long... but anything longer than a week would give the victim/loser a chance to repair and regroup.would actually put the challenge....in war dec'ing for a change.even the small fry's need a chance to eliminate the big fat juicy corps.otherwise you get a very boring and stangent(sp?) game.
9/15/2008,"old-school?! what matter of reasoning is this time period from. ""honor in combat"" is some mythical notion of paper and pen games.that notion of reasoning is used to make peeps feel good about themselves while they bury their heads in the sand.war is ugly, ruthless and with no other reason but to destroy your target. period."
9/15/2008,"public poses have been brought up before and submitted to ccp. their response was that it wasn't possible given current mechanics, though i've heard rumblings that those mechanics will be changed in midas, meaning that we may see some progress on that in some months. wardecs i agree, though i'm pretty sure similar topics have been broughyt up here before. your secure can idea is actually very good. anchoring multiple cans together to form a mega-can in space, with effectively no change in functionality, but less need for clutter, would be a great change. also, it'd probably be good on lag. the ore thieves and flippers won't like it, but there are people who will still jetcan either way(if only for cost reasons), so they shouldn't be completely out of a job. capships in highsec, i might allow rorquals under some circumstances(maybe let them use the ""civilian cyno"" that's been mentioned somewhere previously for jump freighter use). but no combat ships - that's just bad. point defence, i favour defender fixes instead. they're a very plausible mechanic, they just need to not suck nearly so hard. belts, i'm not sure what promise you're referring to. lowsec, i'm not sure what mechanic you want. also, if you get podded easily, you're doing it wrong - when your ship is dying, spam the warp button. and bounty changes, dierdra had the definitive thread on this topic a month ago, and it's already been forwarded for ccp consideration - we should see their response soon."
9/15/2008,"pd weapons, i am not sure the defender missiles can be ""fixed"". the reason is that the idea of two projectiles traveling at their own speeds hitting an intercept coarse, even if fudged, requires allot of processes to work out. that is probably why they fudge up in the first place. combine that with the fact that not all ships have a missile hard point ( punisher, thorax, omen, harbinger, etc. [yes, i pilot mainly amarr]) it makes them of limited use.where as a pd array requires less calculation (missile in range, fire, % to hit -failure-, missile hits). and it uses the current weapons systems and really any ship can use it. now i am not interested in invalidating certain ships, just adding another option. as well as i do not condone that there can be a 100% guarantee that a missile will be downed. that is silly. but missiles always hit when in range (mostly) where as all other weapons can miss even at point blank. this would just make misses more possible.as for real asteroid belts. before castor (and subsequent page revisions) the devs were talking about real asteroid belts. but when castor went live, they were not to be. they held the promise of ore when you wanted it, and as a miner, i like that idea.i think the real glitch was the navigation points. after all how do you work that when you have a huge ring of rocks floating around a system. interestingly, that is simple and there have been talks of fixing the navigational ui also.if you want to break from the usual waypoints, one way would be to create a ""orbit ring"" around all celestial bodies. when your planning to warp, you can select a point (click or drag) and a coarse along that circle will be plotted and you then warp to that point at what ever distance you choose (warp to zero, and your right on the ring). this means that when it comes to a belt, you choose the belt, you click where on the ring, and you warp! hey a new use for that zoom out and see the system ui.as for detection, nothing would change. players can still be found and killed. hiding is never really an option any more. but it would mean that there would be plenty of rocks for us all. and the macro miners could be more easily detected, after all, they are the ones that have just been mining for three days strait and cleared one au of belt single handedly."
9/15/2008,"pd weapons are an option, but i dislike deleting segments of the game that already exist, since there is no practical way to give people respecs in eve. intercept trajectories aren't particularly difficult(at least not when everything is inside a computer). i posted a thread on this topic a while back, and i think it has a reasonable solution to this problem. as for belts, i really like that idea. have rats scattered around randomly, respawning daily - would certainly make ratting a more interesting adventure, as you short-warp around the belt hunting for officers. a belt the size of sol's is only about 1.5 billion km around - you don't mind doing 10 million jumps to clean it all out, right? i wonder how many people would go crazy when you told them that there's hundreds of officers floating around in-system with them right now(and even a couple in a highsec system!), and all they have to do is go find them. also, to make use of the belts sane, just draw half-planes centred around the axis of the belt, and you warp to the point where that half-plane cuts the belt. it might look vacant towards the end of the day, but that already happens as-is, and this kind of empty is at least fixable by moving around, maybe building a safespot."
9/15/2008,"well, the only real reason i even thought about pd's is just that not every one has a missile launcher. defenders only work if you have a launcher and the skills. if the defenders could be made to say get close then explode with a smartbomb style explosion, say about 100m. then as long as the defender is 100m from the target missile it will go down.but if defenders do get fixed, then where is the equivalent? where is the anti missile system for other races that are not missile oriented? ccp likes balance, i think this is really why defenders do not play a roll right now. if they fixed the defenders, they would have to balance out the rest of the races with something else.that said, lets see. asteroids and seccan modification are good ones. lets go from there as i like a shotgun effect for ideas. sorts out the crud from the gems."
9/15/2008,"did anyone consider tacking on a ""cooldown"" period to prevent a repetitive war dec?for example... require a minimum of 1 to 2 weeks to force a greifing corp from war'decing the same corp per incident?example... corp war'decs....gets its satisfaction via any number of methods...but can't war dec the same corp again without having to wait 1 week minimum.this would put a nasty little grinding halt to the repetitive nature of war dec's that may crop up.not to mention gives the victim half a chance to regroup and rebuild.even then... most griefers would get distracted or bored or go off and war dec someone else.attention spans tend to be shorter than one would expect."
9/15/2008,"i see a certain trend here.mainly you forgot one category to received bonusses from a 'fleet' commandship. you have short, medium and??? wait, nothing?sorry, but i find your proposal lacking, one sided and an attempt at 'nerf balancing' long range fitted ships.when you have a good idea how a fleet command ship on the 'other' side could be used to a) counter your fleet command ship or b) boost his own long range ships do tell."
9/15/2008,"snipers can already gain utility with the ships in their current form via the enhanced deployment capabilities allowing them to get to short range faster to use high damage ammo or sending support on top of an incoming group to pin them early. there are a few other situations where the needs of snipers and short-range bs's overlap, like getting out of bubbles quicker when trying to deploy or retreat from a fight, so it's not all bad for snipers.as far as counters, the answer is support. below tier guns will still be hitting for full damage in most cases. paint to get the sig radius back up a bit. web it, bump it into a low transverse heading, and try to bring it in front of full sniper fire.i'm aiming for a ship that provides means of increasing the effect of movement and coordinated maneuvers in combat as well as providing enhanced means of deploying friendly forces in combat.the main advantage of having lots of support is increased control of where combat takes place and when it begins/ends. by supplementing the effects of mobility, what the ship would really do is increase the importance of support.i would like to develop some dedicated formation links for snipers to do their thing. however, the problem is sniper bs's can align towards xyz and perform their function just as well, regardless of what they are shooting or how they want to position themselves in relation to it. since snipers don't benefit from movement to a great extent, how can you enhance the effects of their mobility? so far the only solutions i've come up with are things like ""armored front"" or ""broadside fire control"" which require snipers to at the very least face a common direction to gain some beneficial effects.another great problem for dedicated sniper mods is that snipers don't typically fit for mobility, and that means they're not going to be able to move effectively in formation compared to short range bs's. even if they are given links, a fleet marshall boosting sniper bs's is going to have to fly at a crawl as not to leave its own group behind. no transverse = no damage mitigation.so, as you can see, it's not that i'm on a hate tirade against sniper bs's, but rather symptomatic of the low importance of mobility for snipers to begin with. they sacrifice mobility for the advantage of not needing it, and thereby can't really gain much from it and have little to apply to begin with."

9/16/2008,this ^^^^and the fact that some players have a hard time finding a pc corp that they would like to join.
9/16/2008,"if they don't like what's on offer, they can start their own corp and run it how they want to.it was suggested in another post about looking at empire, that at least the mission-running part of the npc corp membership can be enticed out of npc corps. the solution there is to make the best level 3 agents and almost all level 4 agents not respond to members of an npc corp, but they will if a pc corp member has high enough standing for it.this way, those who are solo mission runners because that's what they like to do without being decced, can still do it (although their earnings will be cut as the agent quality decreases), but those doing it as an isk earning mechanism to support other characters are more likely to join a pc corp in order to gain access to better agents and better rewards."
9/16/2008,"i like the progressive corp tax rate over the months that way it doesn't burden our nooblets who just found eve, but it still encourages people to join corps because each month they loose isk and unlike in a corp it doesnt go anywhere after there taxed."
9/16/2008,"how about everyplayer over 6 months goes into a decable corp. you're way is making it harder for people to make the leap to a player corp as if they not like it there'll be no way back to the safety of a war dec free npc corp ! the service's a npc corp offers it's members is a tax free income and the safe knowledge that they safe from harm as long as they not get baited or afk around. not everyone saying tax them (very few i wager) are looking for war targets as nothing is easier than baiting one player knowing he got no mates waiting to spring the trap etc. tax them, why should they get 10% extra income from missions etc."
9/16/2008,i like this idea but like some others said before being in a npc corp has drawbacks as well.you can compensate this with eg.cheaper insurance at your npc corp stations.cheaper clones at your npc corp stations.cheaper repair costs at your npc corp stations.cheaper lab slots at your npc corp stations.maximum standing bonus refining efficiency at your corp npc stations.
9/16/2008,"well, thanks for your replies so far. i just want to make clear, that my intension was not to nerf nor force players to anything. if someone enjoys playing alone, that's fine. but he shouldn't get rewarded for that! all serious player corps have taxes (except those holdings...). giving them immunity to pvp and zero tax at the same time is unfair compared to the casual players.if possible, it would be cool to have dynamic taxes in npc corps. they should raise either by total time spend in npc corps or by skillpoints.0 - 5m sp = npc with 0%tax5- 10m sp = transfer to another npc corp with 5% tax...20-25% tax should be maximum imho. they would still be free to make their own corp, it's their descission! and this would be fair for the industrialist next door, giving him the opportunity to do something about that competitor ruining his prices with mission loot fe.thinking this further, it would also be a good idea imho, if player corps could join an npc alliance, like it's actually implemented with fw. joining the specific faction alliance would render them invulnerable to wardecs, which i find a good thing for new corps. i hear a lot of new players complaining about a pirate corp with 2 year old players just deccing and ransoming. this is not good for eve, as some of those players might quit rather than sitting docked in a station all time till they pay.of course, they would have to pay a tax as well. and after a certain ammount of time in a npc alliance, maybe some 3 months, the taxes would rise above a level which isn't reasonable affordable."
9/16/2008,this be verrrry dangerous ground.be careful and tread lightly.i like where your going with this idea... but don't go overboard.also... not every corp has a tax rate.: o )
9/16/2008,"another fine example of a ""people don't play this game the way i want them to ccp fix pls!"" kind of idea.an idea like this will end 1 of 2 ways - mission runners happily eating a small tax, or forming a 1 man corp to dodge restrictions if they're any stricter than that. yes, this makes them technically vulnerable, but i can't imagine a 1 man corp is terribly appealing to any corp looking to wardec (especially when the 1 target is going to do what they can to avoid fighting). still, i guess it's a nice way to screw newbies over until they get into a corp of their own."
9/16/2008,screwing noobs is never a prospect i wan't to see in any game at any time. unless it's someone who refuses to learn....
9/16/2008,"and that's the attitude that leads to these stupid suggestions - this idea that people have to play the game a certain way. if some random wants to stay in highsec and run missions or mine scordite all day, what's the harm?mind you, there's definitely a problem with missions in empire (the risk/reward ratio is completely screwed up), but players in npc corps are just a small symptom of that problem. changing this will fix approximately nothing."
9/16/2008,and what is my reward exactly? being serious or not as nothing to do with a corp taxe and if those casual player feel this is an unfair advantage all they have to do is join a npc corp just like i did. but no...i have to change to way i play the game to meet there need right? i believe that would be the perfect time for ccp to answer this simple question. i m not holding my breath on this; i know they wont answer. but that would take care of the issue regarding the npc corper and the level 4 mission.edit: and obviously not supported

9/16/2008,"that's all fine and good, but this idea doesn't even begin to fix that (and never will). all this does is punish anyone who doesn't want to join a player corp for whatever the reason.if people don't join your corp simply because of tax, then ask yourself two things:1. does your corp suck?2. do you really want someone that obsessed with their own wallet?it's not fairness and balancing at all. corps charge tax to pay for whatever corp functions and benefits they may have. npc corps don't offer anything but protection (which they do at the price of never really being able to do much of anything outside of highsec). it's clear where the support of this idea comes from - it stems from the issue of lowsec being completely worthless and pirates having fewer and fewer targets because of it. that's a big problem, and it's what needs to be solved. players in npc corps have next to nothing to do with it. transaction taxes on all market transactions done within a station + cuts of refines + office rent from player corps renting in npc owned stations. that's how they make their money in a rp sense."
9/16/2008,"the issue is they don't like people camping out in high sec.... they think it removes the fun from lowsec and 0.0 space.fewer targets to gank....fewer prey.... smaller profits.and to some degree i have to concur... but only on one little point.causes an endless cycle of said actions to take place in high sec space....which means traffic..lag...and greifing.there is no easy solution to this conundrum.i personally don't see a problem with players of npc corps playing a small tax for benefits.but to what end will it achieve anything?nothing really... isk is easy to come by.this also segways into the mindset of ""lets torture the noobs and force them to come out and play""sorry for the derailment in light of that."

9/16/2008,"a tax back in rl is dumb too. that's why i usually end up paying the man about $600 every year around tax time. of course it doesn't hurt that i typically make $200-300 (the best i've made is $700) in interest by investing monthly what the gov't would have taken as a free loan and then graciously given back to me in the form of a ""tax back"" (well this coming year i won't be seeing that much, more like $50.)if i could i'd take 100% of my monthly tax and put it in bonds for the year and let the government pay me 4-6% instead and cash them all in at tax time. unfortunately they won't let you do that.even with the market crash, fifty bucks is fifty bucks, and all you have to do is check a box to change your deductions. it'll get you a case of decent beer and a large pizza. (sorry for those of you who live in the uk/eu, it'll only get you a pizza and maybe a pint.)tax back/tax refunds whatever you want to call them are a rippoff of the citizens and the various governments know it!"

9/16/2008,you may think that... but if you've not looked into the science and logistics of such a task... you'd see my point.each time you tack a clock on to an object...you'd have send that information to a number of places...that same information is also going to be broadcasted to your corp mates for example.so what you have is an exponential rise in information... compounded with the unknown and yet astronomical number of wrecks created in the world of eve both ncp and player...and the number of cargo can's.if a dev would be kind enough to post the statistical data of any one given number of can's and wrecks... you'd find out that's a very large daunting task.oh sure... the data's there... its one thing to store it..its an another to broadcast it and put it on display.methods are always easy..... but implementation.... is a whole different ballgame.now if they already have the structure for said function... more power to im.
9/16/2008,"fair enough. perhaps any particular player can turn the clocks on the display off, so that that information isn't sent to them. it would be useful information in a mission setting, but probably less so in a fleet battle where lag is a serious problem. by default, it could be left off.if it's really unworkable, then ccp will say so; right now it seems like there's still enough room for compromise that we can have a discussion the merits of the idea and let ccp work out how best to implement it if it makes it that far.(still supporting)"
9/16/2008,"this is what i do, drop a container at the start of your mission and give it a name corresponding to the time you dropped it ( and maybe bookmark it for when you're in another room, you can always see how much time left).no need for timers if you can solve it yourself easily i'd say."
9/16/2008,i've noticed that.... granted it means more work... but you got an answer there for your needs of tracking time.wrecks however... should be dropped entirely from the proposal.there are likely to be millions of wrecks at any one time... that's going to be obscenely hard to track.if everyone knew the time limit for any one wreck... it would at least give you a rough idea of how much time you have before they expire.
9/16/2008,"so pretty much there would be no issue with huge secure cans as long as they can be broken into some how. ok, that is reasonable. the question is how long would it take to break into the can. and under what conditions. after all can't have them pop open with no effort at all. i mean it is secure after all. not safe but has to put up some kind of resistance to the efforts to break in.that would be the interesting problem really. how long to be fair to all sides?"
9/16/2008,"the ""intended cans"" are 4 years behind the times. they were created when bs mining was the top of the mining activity, so they were never intended for use with the mining barges. the rule that block can for being at less that 5 km from each other or any astral body is acceptable for cruiser and even bs mining, not for barges that can fill a secure can in one go."
9/16/2008,"you forgot a word before idea, ""stupid"". you don't even know what you are speaking of. afk mining can't be done using a jetcan or secure can as you need to drag and drop the ore. for afk mining you need an oversized cargo hold, not a external container."
9/16/2008,"mineral stealing has become less common for 2 reasons:- minerals have a low value- hulk have a good cargo size so docking every time they are full don't cut so much on the mineral production.the hacking idea was suggested several times and it is reasonable, even giving the chance to the ore thief to remove the can after opening it would be reasonable. as things are today ore theft is more a form of harassing hoping for a fight than a system to get isk. those that are interested in isk do ninja salvaging, better return per hour and almost 0 risk."
9/16/2008,"not supported. oh and high sec is already being made safer due to concord buff. and now you want secure mining cans with huge amounts of space....... seriously eve is a harsh place, that is its appeal and it should stay that way.in ending having such secure cans would make eve one step closer to wow online. i apologize for saying the ""w"" word as i know it can cause severe ear strain to many of my fellow hardcore eve players- ds"
9/16/2008,"i take particular offense to you calling anyone ""stupid"", thank you very much.for the record, if you're saying that the word ""stupid"" should appear before the word ""idea"", then perhaps you'd like to reexamine your grammar. secondly, if you are redirecting your next comment to farrqua, you should have addressed him, as it would also seem that you are saying i'm not abreast of the conversation at hand.(yes, i know exactly what you were trying to say, and am calling you out for not knowing how to address the issue properly.)"
9/16/2008,"i take issue with this because of how it was stated. as you may have read, i was considering alternate methods also that equalize gain vs risk.second, the concord buff was only to prevent the suicide gank and to make malcontents face a better punishment for their efforts. obviously, you count as one of said malcontents due to your own comments, admit it. the concord buff though would have not relevance on this due to the fact that the pirate would need to attack the can.if hacking was used to break open the can, i do not see that as an attack, more of a subversion of the cans processes. if you still feel like suiside ganking...goto where it belongs, so has spoken ccp. other wise, find another way to have your fun and get your gank on.edited for insulting comments...sorry. i have to remember to be a good boy."
9/16/2008,first off... while everyone here is slugging out there ideas and thoughts with proposals and counter proposals and arguments and counter arguments... you need to keep a few things in mind.1: minieral theft is very much alive thank you very much.just ask any of my corp members and they will tell you there are plenty of can tippers.i hear it all the time and i've been victim of it myself.and don't get distracted by the fact that its called mineral theft... the whole point of it today is hardly the minerals that are stolen... its to gank your ship.they come up and steal what would be considered wholly worthless and then while you may assume the ship they are flying is hardly considered buff.... they kick your butt to kingdom come. i'm quite certain this has happened to every miner at least once.the point here is they can tip you because they are bored and want to grief you. they don't care about anything else and are nothing but a bunch of spineless cowards who have no sense of honor. they could make an obscene amount of money if they did some missions or went out to low sec space but have no courage or care or concern to do so... they just wish to make your life a living hell.2: your proposal for a larger secure cargo can is something i'm keen on seeing... but you got a couple of problems. the afk miner could just as easily script his ship to dump cargo in any number of very large can's. the mining barges (and there brothers the exhumers) have extremely long range turrets.... it would be a walk in the park for them to park near a bunch of can's and just mine away. the other issue is your bunch of moaning and whiny can tippers who yell and rant and rave claiming your ruining the game when in fact its hardly the case. there was nothing relevant about can tipping to begin with... its entirely a greifing system.if they wantted to steal minerals in the first place... they would do it with a ship capable of hauling a ton of rock.i mean seriously.. so you steal a 1000 units of ______. you honestly going to tell me you can make a good pile of isk off of that?hence the comment made by someone pulling in with a hualer.... you have to put alot on the line to do that... and its a waste of resources and time.which is why i have such a negative view point of such a tactic...i mean id rather encourage a bunch of pirates attacking a mining barge at that rate... at least your getting a bigger bang for your buck... oh wait... can't do that... concordoken would be the last thing you want.so they find underhanded ways to get around the system.if your going to push this idea.... you need to put in a balance to qwell both parties.as this will be an never ending gripe fest.already its been suggested that the can should be hackable... good. thats ok by me.means you need skills.but i think we should spice it up.grant kill rights to the victim.not this 1 to 2 hours crud..... full blown 24 hours or whatever the standard rate is.at least this way.... you can can tip all you want.just be prepared to face down the victims whole bloody corp when they come ah'knockin.and that point.. everyone's happy.and balance is restored.ps: im not attacking anyone in particular... but being the victim of such griefing... the logic behind it tends to annoy the heck outa me.so give me some room because i gave you filthy brigands a way to enjoy your little sport... but at least this time.... you have the very strong possibility of getting your but whupped.... or maybe not. as opposed to no consequences period.
9/16/2008,"i agree completely, that is why i have not been fighting the pirates, they do have something to loose, though not as much as the miners do. any game mechanic must be balanced to achieve the purposes of all that may use it.so i have no issue with can hacking. and really the retaliation for it should be fairly long. i think this then comes down to""1) how long should it take to ""hack"" a can?i say this because it should be a descent amount of time to do. short enough to not be a dead mechanic. but long enough to deter can flipping.2) should there be conditions to that time?so if a can has not been used in a certain time frame it is easier to hack then if it has been used in say the last 30 mins to an hour.3) repercussions?bounties, security hits, kill rights? what is fair for the crime. this is touchy though as either we have the thief on one side. or the miner looking to protect his/her living on the other.hurm, forgot something. as for the hated macro miners. i doubt anything would really deter them from doing there thing. so really anything you do will just enable them to do it better. so really there is no point as using that as a for or against. they will still do it no mater what you do."
9/16/2008,what i think might be cool is to make the time of hacking a can dependent on the strength of the password.so something like this:no password: 5 secondsweak password: 3x (15 seconds)medium password: 9x (45 seconds)strong password: 12x (60 seconds)uber password: 30x (150 seconds)times could be tweaked but i think i like them where they are atm.it keeps cans at poses pretty safe since you've be destroyed before cracking it.
9/16/2008,make the cans take a full minute to hack and the attacker start flashing red on my overview. that gives me time to respond and do something about it. any more than a minute and the afk miner gets too easy.also using a macro or script is bannable anyway so it is kind of pointless to try to defend against it this much.
9/16/2008,nice idea....but i still say instead of flashing red.. kill rights should be given. (with the flashing red part)1 hour isn't enough to round up a posse.theft shouldn't be given a free ride in high sec space.that's an invitation to trouble there.

9/16/2008,"meh, would rather see more learning skills to train up which i hear is in the works ^^"
9/16/2008,you forgot one disadvantage: defies any form of logic or coherent reality.as a game mechanic skillpoints may be a arbitrary measure of knowledge but in reality knowledge can't be converted from one piece to information to another. unlearning knowledge will not gain you any new information. it's like burning books to have magically appear new ones in your bookshelf. it. does. not. work.
9/16/2008,"nonsense. at a rate of 2 for 1 (or even 1.5:1) it's not going to get abused on a regular basis: 8 million sp moved around would turn into 4m (or 6m) sp in the new skill. do it again and you'd only get 2m sp (or 4m sp), do it again and you'd only get 1m sp etc.it would not discourage specialization, but rather encourage it: players who skilled up randomly while learning the game could refocus their abilities, but at a steep cost."

9/16/2008,"it's amazing that a csm responded to this rather wacky idea, albeit a sound concept using the escrow interface already existant in the game, yet not make any mention concerning more pressing issues?"
9/16/2008,"what was that? i couldn't hear you with your grunting and club banging.war dec's should be a 2 way street.i believe that if your going to maintain this supposed system and keep your little sandbox world you should also have the ability to kick the ### of any one bully.so before you ""grunt"" again.... you might want to try reading first before you respond.i don't have a problem with war dec'ing... i have a problem with the way people exploit its ability to commit acts of extortion and refuse to allow new opponents and new challenges to rise up to make things change.people these days don't like change....they want to keep there little comfy worlds.that would be rather boring.also note that i said the cool down period should be relatively short.... not 6 months.try 1 week at most."
9/16/2008,"two way street. hmm so what you are saying is that if i war dec you. you would have to be agreeable to it then. is this what you are saying?club banging, nice. yep i like to swing the club. and i do my far bit of grunting. but i prefer that than listening to your whiny high pitched shrills because your frilly things are in a bunch.now, i have an opposing view. and i did not in any way shape or form insult you. if you want to debate then fine. but if you want to continue with this eye poking, i am game."
9/16/2008,"i think by 2-way street he means that the declared party should have the opportunity to fulfill the yulai terms set out in the war declaration, or respond to it with a counter-condition of their own.the only party that pays the declaration fee is the declaring party (there are no 'mutual' wars, someone must pay the yulai charter).the yulai charter would be modifiable throughout the duration of the war, so that amicable terms can be set and agreed upon if that is the desire of both parties.perhaps there might be a function within the charter system where the declaring party can have the war rendered nul before it even begins... a method that is nothing more than a big isk sink for both parties. the declared party fulfills the concord nul terms, they are out the isk and the declaring party is also out their declaration isk. this could be an acceptable way to limit (not prevent) extortion to some degree?also, if the yulai terms are met by the declared party the declaring party cannot declare on them for 8 war cycles (weeks). if the concord nul is enacted the declaring party can immediately re-declare but the 24 hour timer resets.if either party accepts the yulai terms (or the declaring party terminates the war escrow and eats the declaration costs) the war ends in 30 minutes. if neither party accepts the terms reaches it's close and there is the normal 24 hour close-of-war timer. the declaring party can re-initiate within that 24 hour window and immediately resume the war, otherwise they cannot re-declare for 1 war cycle (week)."
9/16/2008,"not true. yes, combat tends to be carried out for the purpose of killing, destroying, or otherwise defeating your enemy. but that doesn't stop there from being honor in war - be it treating pows humanely, following through when you say you'll end the war for 100 mil, or graciousness in victory or defeat, honor can be maintained despite bloodshed. it's not all about lining up in huge obvious straight lines wearing bright red uniforms*. * - actually, this is a bad example, because that tactic was actually a quite good one, given the technology of the era. but still, there's nothing else so stereotypically dumb to illustrate ""honor in war"", whether the stereotype is accurate or not."
9/16/2008,close enough....oh and mister xerox... /me thumbs upjust about sums it up...quite eloquentlyfarqqua:what does agreeing to a war'dec have to do with the price of quafe in jita?that has nothing to do with this entire discussion.care to try again? i suggest you re-read what i said... then attempt to make sense of what i said.don't make assumptions.... it helps.
9/16/2008,"herschel,i do want to debate the actual aspects of war. especially in a controlled make believe environment setting we all log into. just for sake of arguemnt, honor and bravado goes out the window when the first shot is fired and you **** you first pair of shorts. actually what is spouted with in the game is the ""fair fight"" as being honorable combat. to sides willing to fight each other with conditions of victory. flagging if you will. its too restrictive. a far as surrendering conditions...that leaves out the option of non coditional surrender. if you had done something to warrant all out war on your corp, i should have the option to grind you into the dirt so you will never ever cross me again.off topic:and as far as the lining up in straight lines wearing red uniforms (british red coats if you will)was actually a bad tactic. it was from the old out dated ways before the invent of the fire arm. wellington realized this when he had his troops laying down and suck napoleons crack troops into a faint which came about as a slaughter. as far as the treatment of pow's, the geneva convention was only observed by governments willing to observe them. and it was normally ignored for the most part. until we are allowed to have keep pows in this game, that one is out of the window also.the notion of the honorable duty bound bravado are usually found on recruitment posters and john wayne flicks and guys that sit with gear in the rear."

9/16/2008,"really, really simple. ccp gets a full month of players paying without any drag on their systems from players actually playing. unfortunately, this also drives off many potential new players. i have introduced several friends to this game. even with me providing a lot of stuff at the beginning for free, they indicated they were exceedingly frustrated with the amount of time they had to wait before being able to actually use their character.to clarify, they have no problem waiting for bigger ships, they have a problem with having nothing for them to do for a week to a month in the game.give everyone all the learning skills trained to 5. most people have lvl 4 on their advanced skills, so, i for one wouldn't be bothered by the loss of a month of training (to skilling up the initial learning skills). it would be like a badge for old players - ""yup, i remember when you had to do the learning skills. didn't that suck?""get rid of them. give everyone the attributes of fully-trained learning skills. put it to a vote."
9/16/2008,"if you want newbs to learn the game, improve the actual tutorial. newbs first experience with pvp is wandering blindly into a gank. insta-pop style. half the time, they don't even know what happened until it happens to them again. that was what happened to me, i have since learned about smartbombs. provide newbs with a pvp arena. they have to die at least once. let them experiment with the different fittings. the vast majority of this game revolves around pvp. provide an arena for 1-v-1 and 3-v-3 combat for players based on their total sp. don't shy away from it. show people ""this is the fun part of the game, whether it be successfully avoiding pvp or blowing up someone else's ship, this is what eve-online is all about!"""

9/17/2008,"i dont think there is anything wrong to give an incentive to join a player corp as an individual player. keep in mind, a new player isnt going to care about being able to anchor pos's, or research using pos's, or conquer space. however a corp can help a new player along much better than the help channel ever will. in addition it facilitates friendships that gives an incentive for someone to stay. i would say that people who play with a group of other people are far more likely to stay with the game over the long term than someone who just plays solo. so i want ccp to adopt policies to make joining player corps attractive. a tax is one way to do that. this tax shouldn't ever be prohibitive but it should even the field from the players standpoint between player run corps and npc corps. keep in mind that bounties that are too low are not taxed. that is, any ship a newbie will be able to kill solo in his first week will likely have 0% tax anyway due to that minimum rule. increased players in corps, will likely mean more corps. this means it is much less likely for an individual corp to be wardec'd. i also think the wardec system needs to be modified but that is another issue."
9/17/2008,"i don't see how this benefits anything.will this encourage people away from npc corps? probably but only into 1 man corps to avoid tax, they'll still be in high sec doing missions. frankly the entire idea is simply trying to force people to play the ""right"" way. since ""right"" is purely objective i have to say two thumbs down on this. people that want to be carebears should be carebears. if i want to hide behind concord until you turn your back then shank you, well that's life. :)"
9/17/2008,"i like the idea, although i would drop a 20-25% npc corp tax. i'd give new players a 90day exemption on the tax. fw corps have 0% tax. this would give a nice incentive for people to join player corps, most corps have 10-15% tax rate and they give their members services/benefits.people are right this may not do anything, but that is the point. people always say that the stick is bad and people need encouragement to go out and explore eve, the encouragement is now a lower tax rate in a player corp. npc corps kicking out players over 6 months old would be forcing people, a simple tax rate is hardly forcing anyone."

9/17/2008,"completely nonsense. sorry pal, but how can you say 500m is overpriced? i sped 35 $ for it, spend it on a single navy raven and loose it the next day. and how fast do 0.0 players earn that 500m? a 3 days work? if you ask me, 500m is still underpriced, not overpriced. you see, it's all relative therefore no to fixed prices, things are just fine as they are. 30 and 90 days gtc would be fine, but that's a decicion of ccp only"
9/17/2008,"fixed prices? you joking, right? what is this communism? i agree on 30 day and 90 day, i wish they were back. oh, and i do buy gtc to support my eve habit, and i do pay the ridiculous prices."
9/17/2008,"it's a good thing i'm all nuclear then, don't care for the gtc/oil 'issue' at all, it's not even remotely important since none of our members are paupers."
9/17/2008,"leave it alone.introduce 30day/90day, increase anti isk seller activity all ok in my book, but setting a fixed price is stupid and should never be done."
9/17/2008,mabe you never noticed but the prices went up with 33% for a 60 day gtc. no wonder people want more isk.. there is nothing fake about buying or selling gtc. if youd ont want to pay for the gtc then buy your own game time. your playing for ingame isk and are still complaining.. **** like this ****es meh off.
9/17/2008,"this is my 4th mmorpg and it its the first time i have ever seen it possible, to pay for an mmorpg with game money.if you cant pay for the game with rl money dont play mmorpg and tbh this issue shouldnt even be consuming neither csm or ccp's time. you should be playing guildwars."
9/17/2008,"bring back 30 and 90 day and the problem would fix itself.the problem is the per month cost in real money went up on the gtc, so, guess what? people are going to ask the same amount (or more) of isk that they always did per unit of real life money. meaning, the cost going ""up"" in isk is largely an illusion. paying for the game with gtc is now the most expensive way to play (per month) in many countries, including the us. if you play with gtc your going to pay for it, either in rl money or in isk. period. ccp obviously wanted it this way.imho, ccp should not have gone with this move at all. but, they have never once in over five and a half years listened to me, so i doubt they are going to start now.bottom line: we (the community) are going to loose accounts over this; there is no question. and, ccp doesn't care or they wouldn't have done it. so, if they don't care if they loose accounts over this why would they care enough to fix prices to protect your isk? my point? that this thread has no point. bring it up with the csm if you want to, but its a waste of time. ccp isn't going to do anything about it."
9/17/2008,ccp already spoke. they said that eve was worth it.
9/17/2008,when is ccp going to start locking mission gates to keep invaders out? the area around matsu and dodixie is overun with ninja salvage corps.its intolerable and easy to fix if its not your mission or your not in fleet with the mission runner the gate wont activate.
9/17/2008,"not going to happen. ever. the most that could ever possibly happen (and i heavily doubt even this will happen) is that salvaging will flag you to the owner of the wrecks.even if that does happen (which it wont), all it will do is get your missionship ganked.see you in your next mission."
9/17/2008,"here's a thought - if your mission hub is overrun with undesirables, get a new mission hub. there's more than enough high-quality l4 agents to go around, assuming you get out of the ""navies are the only corps"" mindset."
9/17/2008,"hopefully never. or do you suppose that mission runners schould be invulnerable to wardec, low and nullsec ect once they warp trough a gate? really, if this is disturbing your game experience, move somewhere else or join a corp and fly missions together."
9/17/2008,"i sympathize entirely with the sentiment, since i enjoy missioning and get annoyed with ninja salvagers myself, but i also think that ninja salvaging is a legitimate operation. as others have said, if ninja salvagers are a problem, just move elsewhere; i'm in the far fringes of minmatar space and can find plenty of missions in less-traveled areas. if mission runners voluntarily unclumped themselves, ninja salvage corps would have a hard time finding enough work and would fold out of boredom.apologies, no support."
9/17/2008,"oh wow, thats how we got can flipping and the whin session after that, could you even imagine slavage ninjas? and the dramabombs that would ensure you sir, a re tarded"
9/17/2008,"some say its the newest thing next to threadspamming...i think its something only noobie corps do--> ninja salvaging.go get a life!seriously, i dont get it whats fun about it. you risk of getting your corp decked or get a bad name, offc totally depends if you're allready into such sort off a corp.ccp should lock up missions, only fleet mates should be able to get into those...or just make salvaging wrecks of other players also a criminal fact so the owner make attack if he desires without getting concorded.i know people will say stfu get a life, but this is just my own point of view on ninja salvaging."
9/17/2008,"i support making wrecks non-salvagable in highsec. you're desecrating a war grave, just for petty profit, come on!wrecks should only be salvagable in lowsec, and doing so should give a gcc."
9/17/2008,"if you dont like having your wreaks salvaged in one system just move to another salvaging is legit and in all honesty it should be encouraged though not taking someones mission wreaks is pure curtosy, salvagers keep our space clean and reduces the lag fromt he hundreds of mission runners who just leave there wreaks in space and not bother to salvage, if your not using them why not somone else, but if its really that much of a problem why dont you salvage the wreaks yourself in mission, not that hard to fit a salvager on your ship insted of an extra gun"
9/17/2008,50% reduction in jump clone time delay at skill lvl 5 would be nice.
9/17/2008,"it limits the worth of your intel and the degree of consequences for the enemy.if you find out someone is zipping about in snakes and gear up to kill them and they all come out in something different entirely, sure it can still happen but shorter cooldown just further facilitate the between act dress changes. also if you pick a fight someplace by jumping in there you should be somewhat committed to it. so you argue even 6 hours is committed enough, possibly so if you're there all the time but if you have several accounts zipping in and out in hostile territory wrecking havoc and then leave the defenders there staring at your afk ass while you go and do the same till you can zip back out again. i really don't see how this could promote gameplay of any consequence.if the jumpclones get a shorter timer and we can file up even more of them then we may as well just sign up to queue for some battlegrounds and be done with it."
9/17/2008,it really should be about a 20h reset timer so that you can jump clone at the end of your gaming sessions and then jump clone back at the start of your next day gaming session.
9/17/2008,"ok, a few suggestions:- make a sound effects volume control. currently it is impossible to turn the gate jump sound off and the ""skill training completed"" voice on unless you are running evemon on background - some sounds are really annoying in eve. the gate sounds and even the turret / explosion sounds. these sounds have something in common: their spectrum. high-frequencies are at high volume and low frequencies need a boost. if you have a nice hometheater system at home you will understand what i mean when you do not hear your subwoofer working as intended while playing eve.graphics were upgraded in eve. what about sound upgrade too?"
9/17/2008,"i understand that grav sites always spawn the next better roid fields. in high sec you always get omber, kernite or jaspet, right? if this is right it's stupid. i already have 9m isogen and i don't need anymore. i need zydrine, megacyte, morphite ... :)seriously, i don't do grav sites anymore. imho it would make much more sense to have it more chance based, something like that:50% chance of low end field (veld, scordite, pyro) still nice if you find a large field25% chance of plagio, omber, kernite15% chance of jaspet, hemorphite, hedbergite and gneiss10% dark, spodu, crokite, bistot, arkonor5% mercoxitof course ""multiplied"" with system sec status. like the above rating would be for a 0.5 system, whereas a 1.0 sys would have 85% chance of low end and so forth. not to forget the different size of the field/roids.this way scanning for grav sites would be much more useful and enjoyable. and no, it wouldn't influence the market in any way with those few spawns of good ore."
9/17/2008,"3 jb's per system please (at a minimum)---max 2 jb's per system is rather restrictive, and leads to all kinds of annoying compromises.with (max) 2 jb's per system, you end up with ""rings"" of jb's (anyone who has dabbled in planning jb networks (rings...) will know what i mean), which end's up being pretty frustrating, as there's no way to connect two ""rings"" wihtout, well, making it into one big ring, which often is not desired (as it ruins the connections)with just 3 jb's per system this would be solved to a very large degree.more is ofc better, but i'd definatly settle for getting the 3 jb's per system.would allow to actually create a *network*, and not the endless rings..----just 3 jb's per system would allow for more efficent setup of the network, decreasing the jumps needed to go to wherever it is you want to go.aka need for less fuel - and 0.0 logistic is tiresome enough as it is.with the current ring structure, you often have to jump through 2-3-4 unnecesary systems (and thus have unnecessary fuel usage) to get to your destination, due to the ""logistics"" of the ring setup of jb's today."
9/17/2008,you could always learn how to plan out your logistical jump bridge plan we probably have the largest jump bridge chain in eve and 2 seems to work fine.
9/17/2008,"why don't you read what i wrote instead.i have no problems planning it.----i'm simply pointing out it could be more efficient - on several fronts.one being : less jumping around = less db load (probably a minor influence, but none the less)with such a small change as allowing one more jb per system."
9/17/2008,"i'd wager that this is intentional - jbs are supposed to supplement gates, not replace them. that said, i don't know that this is the case, and i'd like to see it brought up, to see what the devs have to say, since they'd know a lot better than my intuition."
9/17/2008,\o/
9/17/2008,"(bumping to ensure the topic stays alive until it's followed through on by ccp.)i fully support my erstwhile foe's proposal to allow corps to join fw while remaining in alliances. some assorted thoughts:* obviously, such corps should (at least) be required to meet the same requirements that independent corps must meet (ie, faction standings).* i'd even support making the threshold a bit higher (frankly, i think the standard threshold is far too low).* while i'm not opposed to being asked to sacrifice sovereignty rights for ability to join the militia, i think this would give my side too strong an advantage (u'k, em, and others could join; cva could not).* i don't particularly feel there's a need to make mechanisms to prevent corps from joining opposing factions; this should be easily handled by the alliance leadership, if necessary.* if such limits are found necessary, then all that is needed is for each alliance to have a radio selector to allow the alliance to 'show support for' one side or the other. corps in the alliance can only join a faction that their alliance 'supports', though standings restrictions would still apply. further, this selection cannot be changed so long as any member corp is enlisted in a militia. (note that if this is done, support should be visible; u'k will want to know about all alliances supporting the amarrian faction.)"
9/17/2008,"what will be the downside of being able to keep the logistics wing out of the militia, standings going to **** across the alliance for affiliation with the warring faction?"
9/17/2008,"i recently received this in a petition:the petition system is the primary means by which players make their in game concerns known, requests made .. etc. therefore the petition system is an excellent indicator of what type of things should be fixed .. where the bugs lay etc.how is it that the petition system and the developer have absolutely no ties? is anyone else finding this a tad hard to believe?can i suggest that some mechanism be made which tracks the most frequently reported or requested items in the petition system that feeds into at least the qa side of development? this might result in development being done that more directly addresses frequently recurring player issues."
9/17/2008,linkagei am not sure if this helps. but that's all can come up with.
9/17/2008,isn't this what the csm is for? why have a dog and bark yourself?
9/17/2008,"wow, you are telling the gms that they are wrong?the petition system is not so players can have interaction with the developers. it is so that players that need support with the game can get help. billing issues, stuck, reimbursement etc, etc.if you have a issue then there is ideas forums and other sections for whatever you would like to bring up with the community.while a direct pipeline from consumer to developer would be awesome, it is wholly impossible due to the vast number of consumers and miniscule number of developers."
9/17/2008,"then lets see. here are my thoughts.breaking into a secure can has three parts.1) time: secure cans have a 5 minute hack time. for every rank past the first in hacking reduce that time by one minute.2) hacking a can makes the hacker blink red to the owner of the can (player, corp, or alliance).3) the players being hacked get kill rights for a term of eight hours. not to heavy handed, and the thief can escape. please note that i believe that being offline should stop or slow that clock so that they can not just escape."
9/17/2008,sounds fair enough.
9/17/2008,i can support that. if they train to hack my secure can they can even put it in their cargo.
9/17/2008,"i might not go that far. but gaining access to the ore would be good. the other benefit that i found was that if a lowsec or 0.0 mining op is taken out. then the aggressors can get an extra prize.instead of having to blast away at the can for hours on end. they can hack the can and grab the goods. this means there may be more incentive for disrupting operations. or, for people to set traps for the potential attackers. ;-)"
9/17/2008,"not only that it is not arqueable in rp content to ""unlearn"" skills, it's imho also way too much work for little benefit."
9/17/2008,"the arguement that this does not make sense in roleplay terms is completely irrelevant. our characters live in a universe where their consciousness can be teleported hundreds of light years away instantly, with no damage to the host or destination clones.in this case, the neural network in the brain (as it is so well mapped out) could be 'scrambled' in certain areas to make way for new neural pathways. since these neurons already have some charge, the relearning process could easily achieve the 50% marker i described while a new skill is learned.doing this would make character buying more palatable, as you could unlearn a few skills you didn't want in order to boost your learning in other skills you want more. i'm not saying that it wouldn't take some effort, but given the skill system as it is, these minor tweaks shouldn't take too much programming effort."
9/17/2008,i support the idea of a skill capacitor of 1-2 days.
9/17/2008,"no, i don't want them to leave low-sec. i want some way to tackle them. . any way we could get a second module for a hic that would throw up a weaker bubble that could be used in low-sec but that would only effect things the size of a mom or bigger? likewise a new kind of probe for regular dictors.if people are going to use these things in low-sec, there should be some risk to it. yes, i know, one or two have been killed in low-sec, but stupidity shouldn't be the only reason one ever dies."
9/17/2008,"maybe we could make a some sort of script for the hic bubble, so it only points a single ship, over-riding supercapitals' ewar immunity, and can be used in lowsec?"
9/17/2008,"that'd work too. i don't know if introducing a new script would be easier for the devs, or not. if so, it's probably a better solution, since you wouldn't have to have two mods for your hic. i just think there should be some way of tackling these if they're going to be used in low-sec."
9/17/2008,you can already scramble super-caps in low-sec by using the focus scripts for the hic.
9/17/2008,"aw, sweet. didn't know that. thanks. i'll pass it along."
9/17/2008,"hmmm. i thought it was a good idea as well. so i just msned my dev friends, and they posted a new devblog. expect to see the script on the market very soon indeed. cool eh?"
9/17/2008,well the sad part is that i build and sell the damn things. never really looked at flying one.
9/17/2008,"i wrote this up on another forum, and was asked to provide it here. regarding more in-depth tutorials: yes, i agree with that particular aspect to a point. far more information is obtained via metagaming (out of game tutorials, older players, etc...) than the tutorial provides. a basic x tanks y way guide would do wonders.there should be a sort of guidance in the game that allows for a player to ""see the light ahead"" so to speak, rather than just try an aim for it.i like the sandbox idea where no one is shoehorned into any specific role, but i think it is somewhat detrimental to just dump the new player into the game-world without some sort of end-view. sounds odd, but i'll give you an example of what i think would be a great boost to the ""new player experience"".simulators. yes, simulators. as in expand out the tutorial agents, and have the players earn loyalty points with them, that they can then spend on specific one time use datacards, that provide the pilot a ""what could be"" for specific ships. i.e. pilot gets moved to a controlled no-gate system, provided a mission that addresses the capabilities of a ship, and provided said ship. a liberal use of a system similar to jump cloning would work best to provide time limits on players and all that.then diversify the cards out amongst different ship roles and develop missions in line with them to give new pilots a ""taste"" of a potential future.for instance, logistics ships, interceptors, stealth bombers, etc, etc... don't allow them to impact the game, but give them a chance to see what they may want to do in the future.^^that sort of stuff is what gives players long term goals.regarding mission money making: money making in eve should be skill point oriented, not money invested oriented. i.e. if i spend x time to get into a drake to chain lvl 3's, or i spend x time to get into an interceptor, there should be a relative payoff line that is more or less equal to the amount of training involved. i.e. l3 fast ""pickup"" missions where the objective is to dodge getting obliterated by the enemy, haul ass to an objective, pick it up, and deliver it in x time.^^dunno how hard that would be to balance, but yeah, surging up to ravens to squirrel back down the pipe to get a ship of choice just feels like a clunky mechanic.apolluon"
9/17/2008,"i have posted a thread over on jita park for discussion and solutions to some issues that have become apparent over the past 4 months. please take some time to have a read and, if you have constructive thoughts or ideas (or think i've missed something), add to the discussion."
9/17/2008,"sincerely, i don't want any metagaming information in eve. local chats and the buddy list (which tells you who is online/offline, specially your enemies) are metagaming, and these features must be removed from game asap.this would give us a sensation of playing in a more empty system, although this is not true. people are concerning that eve is getting crowded. maybe the local chat is inducing people to that opinion.it should also be renamed to ""system"" chat or something like that to get in line with constellation chat.probing would have to be revisited, since it would become much more useful."
9/17/2008,"well, i just got feedback from our dear csm admin.it would appear that they simply haven't received all the minutes. so either they simply haven't been sent or there's a misunderstanding in how the minutes are handled.either way, i have pushed for all minutes to be collected and zipped over to ccp. we have also got green light to publish all chat-logs there. so i will be collecting all the chat logs possible and they will be included for publishing on the website.thanks for making us aware of this ""bummer"". hopefully it will be corrected shortly."
9/17/2008,something apparantly went wrong in the communication as i did send off the minutes. i'll have them resent asap so expect them online in the next few days.
9/17/2008,"you'd think ccp would have yelled at somebody by now if they weren't getting minutes. oh well, as long as it gets rectified."
9/17/2008,"i agree with the last few replies. aiding a war target should flag you, being in an fw complex shouldn't. (though if they are sitting in an fw complex, i think there's good odds that they will be flagged to you soon.)on the other hand, i think it would be reasonable if attacking the npcs in a complex counted as aggression toward the allied militia.back to the first part -- doesn't remote repping a wt or pirate flag the repper? if not, this sounds like a bug."
9/17/2008,"/signedi hate learning skills, but i'm not stupid to stop training them.an idea:first set all old players' learning skills to lvl 5. new players start with all learning skills set to 5.second: for those players who already trained learning skills, give them some kind of sp wild cards which can be partially/totally consumed to finish the training of his/her next skills. this would also be a useful functionality for skill training time reimbursement petitions.the amount of sp wild cards received depends on how much learning skill points were trained. i don't have a good idea for a formula yet, because when you start learning the learning skills, you do it very slowly, since your attributes are very low. i ask for suggestions on how to calculate these sp wild cards... any idea?ps: the objective is to remove the learning skills, but make it fair to those who spent game time training something that didn't make them shoot faster or earn money quicker for lots of days... the training of learning skills realy sux a lot no matter what one will say. their existence is a terrible mistake and i do think more ppl would play eve if they don't have to train these skills to have a good character. no one wants to compromise itself training these skills, specially the advanced ones to lvl 5... you never know if you're gonna have to quit eve for some real-life problem. you just want to have fun, and learning skills are definitely no fun at all."

9/17/2008,"good topic of discussion. maybe the problem is not the pos warfare itself, but the aliances' size. thousands of players in a single alliance means hundreds of capital ships fighting for sov. what if alliances' size were limited to a lower number of members... i don't know, maybe some problems happen just because there are too many players in a single alliance... and so many players in eve don't like this, and they still want to have the sensation of owning some space in 0.0 together with their friends/small alliance mates."
9/17/2008,"the purpose of this discussion is to come up with ideas (or ideals) that we would like to see from a csm. the current interaction by csm members with players ranges from good to downright non-existent. i see a number of issues, which i'll try and state:1. i think an ideal for the csm is for all members to represent and interact with all players and discuss issues brought forth on the merits of the issue. this is via the forums, in meetings and with other csm members outside of meetings (via in-game channel, mailing list/private forum etc).currently, from posting histories, this area has been poor for many members. discussion of issues outside of meetings has been limited, with some members seemingly just showing for meetings when required.players may try to justify this behavior as beyond the control of the csm, blaming tools available (we have all heard the poor forum arguments etc). i dont buy these excuses really; some members (and alternates and interested players) have excellent thread discussions and interaction. you make, imo, the best possible use of the resources available till better comes along.2. as expected, some csm members have personal or alliance agendas (which may be just to occupy a spot to stop others doing so), and cant look beyond these to serve the best interests of the majority of players. to a degree, voters are to blame for this. however, different viewpoints are essential to meaningful discussion, so this should enrich the ideas and solutions that the csm puts forward. by this, i mean solutions will take account of different facets of play and play style, so that the best interests of the majority are met. good issues and ideas would stem forth from meaningful dialogue; bad ideas and issues might not make it to the agenda. at least discussion prior to meetings would give an issue proposer a good idea of where csm members stood and could adjust the solution to take account of other perspectives. it would also probably make meetings run a little faster and smoother.a solution to involvement of csm members in discussions is holding regular discussion meetings, with major issues or topics on a list for discussion. these meetings would help clarify a particular problem (many issues that make it onto current agendas have poorly defined problems or are too broad, hence fail to be escalated). proposed solutions or new ideas could also be developed in these meetings.3. meetings, especially of late, seem to have been a little infrequent, hence make held meetings longer. this may be a product of some csm members bringing poor issues to the agenda, pursuing their own agendas and disregarding the wider player issues for the sake of their own. bugs, tweaks and ship rebalancing issues also fill the agenda. this makes for long meetings, tests endurance and generally sees many issues fail to get escalated. (cntd)"
9/17/2008,"id propose that the next csm holds weekly meetings, with at least one being a discussion meeting per month. the dates and times, of course, all published at the start of a csm tenure. 4. how does the csm interact and reach out to the majority of players that dont use the forums?i come across these players every day. many dont even know the forums exist (some are 3 yr old characters). now, a good chunk of the eve players just dont care about the csm or forums; they just play the game. however, i cant for one minute entertain the idea that those that care or could care all visit the forums.what other methods can a csm use to reach these players?anyway, post away (try and be constructive) your ideas and suggestions to improve these areas. if ive missed something, please be sure to add it! i firmly believe that the csm can be an effective voice for the players, and its not just a publicity stunt by ccp!i also firmly believe that being a member of the csm is a privilege and carries with it a responsibility to serve the players (not just the voters that elected a member). if you run and dont really participate, you miss an opportunity to make a difference. if you dont believe that, then i believe you shouldnt be on the csm.take care,arithron (bruce hansen)"
9/17/2008,i agree.
9/17/2008,"much as it may occasionally seem otherwise, this is not a kafkaesque bureaucracy that likes to make a secret of the fact that something is secret. the nda is publicly known, and discussions around it are not privileged, to the best of my knowledge. this might not be the most effective medium to ask the question, but it's not as immoral an act as you seem to be suggesting. and the idea that he's asking this question as part of a re-election bid is just silly - who makes a point of voting for someone robust in the public defence of the nda? it's probably a good thing that he does it, but i can't see it swinging even one vote."
9/17/2008,"even by your standards this post was poorly thought out and completely out of hand. guess the glimmer's gone... that would explain why eva had to step up and assume your ""role"" for you. it's cool dude we all get tired of our toys at some point and look for new ones."
9/17/2008,"oh, the irony.is it not you who has taken any chance possible to make me look bad over the last month or so? talk about crusade.the csm is supposed to be as transparent as possible. limiting the actual use of the mailing list is only positive as i see it.why would i be fuzzed about the alt's turning up or not? i would like to see as many people as possible turn up. but i got confused from the op post and asked the question rather than somebody getting in trouble because somebody made a mistake."

9/18/2008,"what are the strengths of all the other minmatar ships? speed. speed. and a little more speed. what bonuses do their carriers get? shield transfer. how about some speed bonuses on fighters?what bonuses do their dreads get? a split weapons system that requires more training than any other race. because the minmatar ships not only have to be kept together with duct tape, but they also have to have a clumsy multiple weapon type setup. bonuses only for projectiles are in order."
9/18/2008,is there a csm or someone that can let us know if anything is going on about this. at least a update. there are many post about this date and that date we will know. everyday i come on and look and nothing. i have a minny dread and it is all battle ready but the torps. i would like to know if i need to train them or not. thank you for your help.

9/18/2008,"just an additional idea;when will the train time of the skill be indepandant of your jclone you are currently in? i think the medical clone has to be leading, most players have their finest and most expensive implants/etc plugged into their medical. when jcloning into a non-implant clone i think the training time must be based on the med clone. unless the jclone has better implants. just an idea :)"

9/18/2008,"i would prefer to see a cooldown period aplied to each clone so that you can only jump to a clone if it has not been ""jumped"" to in the last 24 hours. so if you had 3 clones you can jump from clone 1 to clone 2, then you can jump to clone 3, but not back to number 1 until the 24 hour cooldown period has expired. but other than that a skill to reduce time would be nice"
9/18/2008,i would love that skill if it allowed multiple jumps within 24 hours. wouldn't use it if it just decreased the wait time. i probably would use my jump clones a lot more than i currently do. not sure if that is a good thing or not.

9/18/2008,"i agree that some people will be forced out of npc corps due to tax increases, but the flame wars would be insane if this went through. that, and it wouldn't affect most members (macroers don't pay taxes, nor do low-sec pvpers).i remain in npc corps to help new players out, and i should be penalized for that? yes, i do run missions, only because killing bits of data relieves stress after a hard day of work.other penalties could easily be applied, such as skill or ship limitations, but even those would be incendiary. if it's not broken, don't fix it."
9/18/2008,"oh, really? so being in a npc corp will protect you from ninja salvagers, loot thieves and suicide ganking?"
9/18/2008,"if you are a high sec player there is very little reason to join a player corp currently. increased risk (can be wardec'd)decreased profit (if corp has tax)and you still can't shoot salvagers stealin your loot. and thanks to concord changes you are far less likely to get ganked, although being in a player corp or npc corp has no effect on the probability of you getting suicide ganked. npc corps are broken is because they break the risk reward model of eve that should be followed. people making 1 man corps to get around this is fine, you can still play solo and get around the tax. but if someone thinks you are a farmer they can wardec you and go after you. keep in mind if you are in highsec it is extremely unlikely you will use a pos. and sure corp wallet and hangers are a handy tool, but are hardly worth the added risk for highsec play. essentially i think veteran players in npc corps should have to pay more for the additional protection they recieve from wardec mechanics."
9/18/2008,tax is only one weapon that npc corps could be nerfed with. others include:-limited flyable ships(no freighters or bs)-limited market/trade/contractual transaction types/sizes-limited duration of stay(players older than x months kicked to fw)-agent access restricted
9/18/2008,"both from an rp and balance view, npc corps should be taxing people something. i saw several people ask ""what are my rewards?"" really, really obvious! it is the very reason you don't want to be in a player corp: you can't be war dec'd."

9/18/2008,"as a member of a role-playing alliance i am continually frustrated that we are completely excluded from joining in with fw. when you right down to it, this war is the reason why the ushra'khan exists and we waited years for it to come about.while i appreciate that pretty much no-one wants to see bob/goons/whomever storming in with hundreds of pilots just for the lulz of ganking everything that moves on a free war dec, there are many long standing rp based alliances that should be able to participate.at present there are only three options available to alliances that want to take part.1) war dec fw corps. this is expensive, restrictive, and alliance members still cannot help to secure territory. as most fw corps have small-mid sized member counts so the number of targets tends to be limited and the target probably feels griefed as well. it is also not very good from an rp point of view, why can i shoot this corp but none of the others who are guilty of the same crimes against my race?we ran a two week campaign doing this and found it highly costly and after the first week frustratingly limited. you are unable to assist outside of your alliance effectively and run a high risk of getting concorded while trying to help.2) rotate corps out to fw. we have had a few corps rotate out of the alliance to fight in fw while everyone else pursued other goals. those that left began to feel distanced from the alliance while the main body is impacted by the loss of man power. while corps can move between the two theatres of operation it leads to disjointed game play and is disruptive to the community.3) disband the alliance. this simply is not acceptable. a good alliance is more than a mere chat channel, it is an identity which becomes an identifiable entity with a personality, reputation and history. disbanding to join fw simply means that you are left with a bunch of corps, you lose the cohesion and cease to be something more. you are simply one of many corps.a good alliance is more than the sum of its member corps. corporations can come and go but the alliance persists and retains community. that community is more valuable than a game mechanic and that is why rp alliances have not disbanded and do not want to disband. it is the community that has kept my interest in eve for over 4 years now. it is the people around me that make the game fun over such a time span. but, we are an rp alliance and we want the option to do what we were created to do. to fight for our faction.i think that there is quite a simple solution to this and it should allow for rp groups to get in while keeping out most of the groups who are not interested in the rp behind fw.* introduce and alliance standing for factions based on an average of all member corp's faction standings.* set a minimum faction standing required for the alliance to enter fw. set it high. set it high enough that the vast majority of alliances simply won't hit it. make it high enough that in order for an alliance to get in they will have to show a tight focus on supporting that faction. most alliances will have members from all over the place diluting their averages, if it is hard enough to maintain this high level then most groups simply won't bother grinding out the missions unless they are seriously committed to achieving it.* allow the alliance executor to select which faction their alliance shall support and only then may the corps within the alliance opt to join fw. but only allow corps within an alliance to join that one faction, and then we will not see an alliance with corps on both sides of the conflict.i first proposed the concept here:there has already been some discussion on it so we have some additional insights worth considering.cont.."
9/18/2008,"*disparity of rp alliances.it was pointed out that there is not an even spread of rp alliances across the factions. the minmatar/amarr factions have several each while the caldari has no well known rp alliance. i would argue that in the current form of fw we are unlikely to ever see new rp alliances forming. if anything, we will see their decline.we are now in a time where the rp support from ccp and the direction of the rp conflict is dominated by fw. that is where the war is, by definition of prime fiction. anything else is ultimately a side show, in truth there is little slave trade in 0.0 for the ushrakhan to fight, amarrian reclaiming is dominated by the upstart slave population of the republic. conquered caldari prime is in high sec and the provists march there. why would any rp group knowingly form an alliance that excludes them from the meat of the rp? they wouldnt, so they wont. we may see some rp-based industrial alliances form but they wont be joining fw directly anyway, they will be about building, not fighting. but, if it is possible for fw corps to organise themselves and to share an identity, without losing the right to support their faction, then i think we may yet see a caldari rp alliance rise from the masses and forge a community. and it is community that is the life blood of eve. and then, then there will be competition.*how high a standing is high?i initially proposed a stupidly high number of +5.0 standing (average of all corps within the alliance) as bar to entry. this was ofc picked out of thin air to illustrate the point  that the figure must be high and must be hard to achieve. what is moree, it must stay high in order to prevent the doomsday scenario of a thousand bored 0.0 vets pouring into fw and breaking the whole damn thing  just because they can.let us look at some figures. i have picked four alliances and worked out what their averages would be towards their closest faction of the four empires currently in fw. i only totalled up the one faction for ushra and cva, as rp alliances they are only ever going to back the one. ;)the ushrakhanmember corps: 11total member count: 384average members per corp: 34.9best standing average : +1.15 (republic)cvamember corps: 20total member count: 943average members per corp: 34.6best standing average : +2.94against all authoritiesmember corps: 13total member count: 1945average members per corp: 129.5best standing average : +1.03 (caldari)goonswarmmember corps: first 18 counted. my soul died trying to count them all (87!).total member count: 6329 (851 in count)average members per corp: 77.3best standing average : +0.36 (caldari)so, the best result returned is for the cva where all corps have a positive amarrian standing, all but one being above +1.5. even then the average is only +2.94. our sample 0.0 heavy weights result with standings heavily dispersed across their member base.*how to screw with the system.the ushrakhan results bear further analysis and arguably indicate the best method to screw with this system. we have one corp in the alliance with just 2 members and a horrid minmatar standing of 5.33. if this corp were removed our standing rises from +1.15 to +1.63. that suggests that the way to game this mechanic is to form a bunch of 1 man corps each containing a single mission runner with high standings. you can then artificially bump your average standings.something else to consider in the ushrakhan standings is that our corps, which are currently outside of the alliance on fw duty, would come home. so our revised averages would look like this (without removing our 2 man caldari corp):the ushrakhanmember corps: 13total member count: 465average members per corp: 42.2best standing average : +1.69 (republic)cont.."
9/18/2008,"even this may surprise some as being rather low for an rp alliance. well, when you consider that we have been based in 0.0 for as long as we have then you might consider that there are surprisingly few republic agents in providence. as most of our pilots live in 0.0 space they are not running many missions. this will also bear true for most 0.0 alliances out there, their standings remain what they were before their pilots moved out of empire and are not notably improving. bob for example are not likely to stop all that warring for a month to go grind their standings, are they? ;)*the solution?this could well be a bit contentious, but i think the solution would be to exclude small corps from the standings average. say any corp with fewer than 5 members. while you could still attempt to game it, the task becomes harder as you need to pool a significant number of high standings characters together into one corp. the most likely source of characters to do this would be mission alts, and how many people will want to place those alts into the main alliance like this? they are usually kept apart in order to mission ***** in safety, they would lose a degree of that by becoming embroiled in fw.*in summaryyou may be wondering why i am pointing out the achilles heel of the plan and suggesting minimum standings that are well above my alliances averages. it is because i do not want to see fw laid waste by joy riding gankers. i want it to be available to those who genuinely care about the roleplay element without unleashing massive imbalance. and i want to find the flaws and solutions before it is too late.i think that this system would be straightforward and only be used by the alliances that are genuinely behind one faction and interested in the storyline of eve and fw. grinding standings to such a high level would simply not be worth while for anyone else and only the most dedicated of griefers would bother to try exploiting the system. even then their numbers should be small as shifting the standings of large alliances is going to be impractical. if the group is relatively small then their impact is much reduced anyway. it would seem more realistic for these groups to just rock on up as individual corps and skip the grinding entirely. in that case the present system allows for them to do that anyway.there will always be a flaw to any system, the trick is to minimise it. fw at present is not what it should be or all of what it can be. there is a place for alliances in this system and it has been the greatest disappointment of all my time in eve as a committed rper to be so excluded from fw after waiting so long for it to come about.the role-play community has had a raw deal for a long time, there is no event program any more and even fw has been denied to many of us. the future of rp is locked into fw and we are locked out. there are solutions, but the present reality is far from it. please give this concept some consideration and thank you for taking the time to read all that. :)"
9/18/2008,i ofc meant to put a link in there. the original suggestion was posted here:ideas forum.
9/18/2008,"believe me ugleb. i have strongly argued for this from almost day one of my csm term. i argued it across the table in iceland, and i've managed to get two separate csm issues on the subject voted through the council and sent to ccp urging this to happen. to my eyes its a clear and necessary change and i think its of the utmost importance to the success of fw and roleplay consequence in eve online that this happens sooner rather than later. be assured i'll be saying as much again in iceland at fanfest and am very much with you 100% on this.my only concern - is that by making it standings dependent rather than simply allowing alliance corps to join fw by clicking ""join"" is that it will involve additional programming and ensure this will not happen for 6-9 months rather than the ""by the next patch"" that could conceivably be accomplished just by removing the existing code switch barring alliance corps from affiliation."
9/18/2008,nice job ugleb. pretty clear.
9/18/2008,while we all want it fixed quickly i do not see ccp simply flicking the fabled switch and risking opening the flood gates. there are genuine concerns on the issue out there even if they are probably overstated.while my programming knowledge is based more on mythology than science i wouldn't have thought that this would be a complicated thing to implement so could be with us within a reasonable time frame. ofc pigs might travel by jump drive for all i know.
9/18/2008,"well said, ugleb."
9/18/2008,"your post is well thought out and presented, and i respect how frustrating it is not to be able to participate in something that seems tailor made for rp.i still have the same concerns about it that i did when you presented it in f&i.if you let these established 0.0 alliances in, fw will immediately become a rp war between them. everyone else will end up marginalized. do we really want to see hot-drops, fleets being bridged in and capital fights at the entrances to minor fw plexes? if you do this, everyone other than the major players might just as well pack up and go home, because they will instantly be irrelevant to the outcome, and they will.once again, there is every rp reason to do it. it makes perfect sense, and yes it does suck for the established rp powers. the only reason not to do it is that it will totally step on the notion that fw is entry level pvp for people get started with, and learn.i've been flying with some fw fleets for a couple of weeks now. yeah, they're very inexperienced, from the fcs on down, but many of the people flying in them never strapped a pvp fit on a ship before fw. if they get marginalized and end up cannon fodder, my concern is that they'll just go back to farming missions and forget about pvp.there needs to be something other than capital ship dominated big-blob warfare in the game. fw has been that, but it almost surely won't be if this goes through."
9/18/2008,"i think that is where the fw concept started to go wrong tbh. turning the rp scene into pvp with training wheels was and is an utter slap in the face to the players who have been behind the rp scene since day one. moving on from that however, i get your concern over capital ship blobs. however we already have a star fraction titan based in black rise. i have already seen several engagements containing multiple militia capitals in the field. capital ships are firmly part of eve warfare and they are not the sole preserve of 0.0 alliances. the ushra'khan is the largest pro-minmatar alliance in eve today and if you look again at our member count we will not be bringing capitals by the score to camp plexes. cva have a whole lot more than us but given their member count being triple the size of ours they will find it difficult to get into fw under this system. so would we. and everyone else likely to come would be smaller than us.even without us capital ships and more so blobs are a problem for the game designers to take on, one they have recognised. and militia activity levels are in decline globally. i think the most likely impact of alliances is a more rapid response gang mustering and a resurgence in the systems vigour."
9/18/2008,"this i agree with completely. i'm sure that if the rp community got involved, plexing and the actual goals of fw would get far more play, rather than it just being random pvp. there would be a lot more plexing, and a lot more attacking/defending of plexes, because flipping those systems would matter a lot from a rp point of view, whereas the bulk of the players currently playing don't rp, and don't really care.if the dev's intent is that fw is a mechanic to support rpers, then by all means, they should let rpers in, and the rpers should dominate it with whatever means they can bring to bear. i didn't get that though. it looked like their intent was to provide lower-commitment, easier access pvp to those who are either too inexperienced or not ""hard core"" enough to want to sign up for 0.0 warfare and it's 5 hour (or more) pos defense ops.so, i guess that's the question. ccp, what's this mechanic for? how they answer that should determine how they respond to this issue."
9/18/2008,i'm in agreement with the op.
9/18/2008,"i disagree. i do empathyze with your situation and it is regrettable, but allowing alliances to pursue both 0.0 and lowsec ambitions easily would give an unfair and distinct advantage to a certain entity and, honestly, ruin the spirit of factional warfare. just look at the latest news: star fraction unleash erebus class titan in black rise. case in point. the reason i don't like the ""minimum standings"" idea you proposed is because it, too, is easily fudged. make a corp in the alliance with one person who has fantastic standings, have everyone who wants to participate in fw join that corp and tell them not to run missions, and viola. imagine cva being able to partake while simultaneously reaping the benefits of 0.0 a paltry four jumps away - all while giving up nothing and making no sacrifices. it is just too easily exploitable. at the moment factional warfare is relatively devoid of pos warfare, cap warfare, and hellish blobs. it would really be a shame to see fw turn into a plaything for the rp alliances. i really mean no offense to uk; you guys have been around and doing your thing for as long as i've played eve. i don't think you guys would ruin fw, but it's eve - you know someone would; it'd just be a matter of time before an entity like goonswarm would say ""hey i'm bored, let's go do fw with 300 people for the weekend."" and who could blame them? the tools and mechanics would be in place for them to do it."
9/18/2008,"this is what fw began as, years ago, the realisation of the storyline and rp driven conflicts. a bridging between 'safe haven' high sec and ruthless null sec. at some point in development that is what fw became branded as. in fact i could probably dig out the dev blog where that became apparent and i started to get seriously worried. the problem is, they also locked the rp content into fw. so we can't just walk away from it. it was the reason we founded these communities in the first place."
9/18/2008,"ok let's see if i can sway you and clarify a bit here.my concept is based on an alliance average of all corp standings within the alliance. if you total them all up and fall short of the set threshold average then no corps in that alliance may enter fw at all.so you cannot simply create one corp with artificially high standings that meets the minimum to get slip people in. the entire alliance must be up to scratch.i also mentioned the possibility of excluding very small corps from the average so that you cannot create dummy corps containing a few mission alts to bump the alliance average. half a dozen 1 man corps each with a +9 standing character would quickly screw with the numbers, so exclude corps of say 5 or less members out the counting. i think that the required standings should be high enough to exclude almost everyone, forcing an alliance to earn their way in by sucking a long hard mission grind.you would not see the goons day tripping 300 members over to screw with fw for the weekend as their entire 87 corp (6,500 man) alliance would need to drag its standings up to a very high level. do you think that this is likely? they would have to chain thousands of players to empire mission agents for weeks if not months to achieve this. they could be doing something far more fun like suicide ganking miners instead. they could form a secondary alliance but that involve pulling corps and pilots out of the main alliance and grinding that up to high standings. in which case it would be much easier to just have corps use the existing system and cut out the pve grind. it should be unpalatable to any but the most committed who have a real and valid reason to go through all this.sf's titan is already in black rise and it becomes no more efficient by being in a militia. it could be in a militia now if jericho fraction dropped from sf and joined the militia directly. it can jump bridge anyone in the same gang as it and grant its bonus abilities regardless of militia loyalties. this is true of any capital, the only tactical difference to the ship's use is whether or not a gate gun will shoot at it for engaging a militia pilot. hardly decisive.to put your 0.0 resources point into some context, the amarr militia has rather good access to providence as it is held by the cva who want to see the amarrian militia succeed. you don't have to be a huge alliance to access these resources, just a well organised corp - and those are already allowed in fw."
9/18/2008,"i don't think there's much question that you'd be including highly motivated rp alliances, and keeping others out. once those alliances are in, though, they would surely dominate fw. they're just plain bigger, older, and more motivated than the corps and individuals who are engaging in fw now. fw would then essentially come down to a struggle between the established rp powers. those in the npc militia corps and the smattering of other small corps that are currently engaged in fw would end up basically sidelined watching the rp powers duke it out.you'd also be de facto creating a ""weak sister"" faction, since there isn't really a caldari rp alliance with the size and strength of those that represent the other three factions. who'd want to play for the caldari faction at all? with the rules you are proposing, you're basically trying to claim fw as the rp community's content. your rules would make the existing rp alliances the ""power players"" while keeping the more powerful 0.0 alliances out.if ccps intention was or is for fw to be rp content, for rpers, then i think it's fine, and it was a mistake for them to exclude you to begin with. if their intent was for it to be a fun, low commitment pvp content for pvp novices, i think doing this would be a huge mistake. it really comes down to what ccps intentions for fw are. i guess you'll find out soon enough, as jade seems hell bent to promote this to them regardless of what the community feedback may be. i fully support you having your ""day in court"" as it were. lets see what ccp wants to do with it."
9/18/2008,"i am, of course, 100% in support of any plan to give rp alliances access to fw.if access is determined based on alliance-level settings, however, i think that the mechanic needs to be that if the alliance chooses to align with a particular militia, it should automatically force every corp in the alliance to be enlisted in the militia, including industry/logistics specialists. in a normal wardec, those corps would be vulnerable to enemies, and it should be similar here.as to concerns about 'gaming the standings', the solution seems obvious to me: instead of using an average of each corp's standings, simply use a weighted average. a two-man corp with a +10.0 in an alliance with a thousand-man corp with a +0.1 results in ((10.0*2) + (0.1*1000))/1002 = +0.12. simple. alternatively, just do a straight average of the standings of every alliance member."
9/18/2008,"i suppose i did miss part of your standings plan, and i do agree that that would sufficiently eliminate foul play. there would still be work-around, yes, but it would be needlessly difficult. still, i think it sets a very dangerous precident by allowing entities to follow 0.0 aspirations (let's face it, having an alliance is practically required to live in 0.0) and fw simultaneously. the current system is heavy-handed, i agree, but it doesn't totally eliminate the possibility of rp alliances tinkering in fw. again, star fraction are showing that. they do, as you pointed out, have a titan in black rise and can jump bridge people around, but since they are not in the militia their ability to communicate is hampered, their ability to see potential targets is clouded, and they have to either pay for wars or take sec hits. they are paying the price, both literally and figuratively, for remaining an alliance who can - even though they don't - maintain 0.0 sovereignty and high-value moons. they could choose to leave their alliance and have a place-holder alliance keep it active, but they haven't. and they haven't done that for a reason. i don't know precisely what that reason is, but they obviously value it quite a lot.i guess my point is: why would you risk ""breaking"" what exists when getting around it is easy? in your case, your member corps would be required to leave the uk alliance. as you mentioned, an alliance is far more than a chat channel - but it's also far more than a name. you, apparently, want to jump through hoops purely for semantics. if you allow alliances into fw, you open to door to these potential abuses. i'm not saying you will abuse it, or sf will abuse it, or bob will abuse it; what i'm saying is there will be the possibility for abuses. needlessly."
9/18/2008,"where to start.ccp makes the same amount regardless of how much isk you pay for a gtc. the price in real currency is set by them.i'm not sure that bringing back the other denominations would help anything. at the end of the day, it all comes down to how cheap does isk need to be in real currency before people are willing to buy it.i doubt very seriously that anything like 50% of the player base is paying for their play time with isk. have you seen that statistic somewhere?if it's starting to feel more like a job than a hobby, maybe you don't need 4 accounts?i don't want to sound like a cheerleader here, but i think it's really cool that ccp allows time rich, cash poor players to pay for their play time with isk, and time poor, cash rich players to pay for isk with money in a way that doesn't break the eula. if they tried to ""fix"" prices, what you'd find is that demand would go down, and you'd have trouble finding someone to sell you a gtc for isk at all. the communists tried the price fixing thing. it didn't work out so well. lead to empty stores and long lines to buy toilet paper.there is a price at which those who sell gtcs will run into resistance, and find no buyers. the market will determine that price. not much ccp can do about it, other than make isk more scarce, which would have serious in-game side effects."
9/18/2008,its ok with whats happening in real life eve might soon shutdown i mean ammerca's major bank has gone bust all airports are going bust all prices are still increasing less and less jobs are happening so sooner or later the whole world will be affect buy this wich it will happen soon and then eve among other things will shutdown because no money so enjoy eve before there is no eve :dbut yea it needs to be sorrted eve have made the worst decision ever on this
9/18/2008,exactly this.
9/18/2008,"i just checked. 60 day gtc are at 650 million atm.although this is expensive, i think what the post was about is that it cost more to buy a 60 day gtc then it does to pay monthly. (since i last checked)but i dont think ccp should make someone only get 400 million for a 60 gtc, its supply and damand."
9/18/2008,"in factional warfare, there are systems to fight over. for those who are not well acquainted with this, here's how it goes down. a pilot scans a system with the onboard scanner until a complex appears (complexes are not always there, and sometimes there are several), and then you fly into the complex (there are four different sized ones), and there are npcs there. if you are defending a system the npcs help, if you are conquering a system the npcs attack you. while there, you have to be withing range of a ""button"" which starts a count-down timer for anywhere between 15minutes and an hour. after capturing enough of these complexes, the system becomes vulnerable and you attack a bunker and the system is yours. i haven't done the appropriate legwork, but it seems like one needs to capture about 20 of these complexes. mind you, if someone from the opposing militia finds a complex and defends it, it's one more complex that you have capture as the attacker. basically, it's a pain in the ass. surely there must be some reward for this, right? wrong. there is no reward, not even a minor one. i actually benefit by not running the complexes, because they are ship-limiting arenas that people can fight in. so, my idea: a militia member cannot dock in a system with hostile occupancy. it would give a tangible benefit to occupancy, and it wouldn't be entirely crippling. or, if that is too severe, then replace ""cannot dock"" with ""cannot use services""."
9/18/2008,"cannot dock is right. the faction should reward the capsuleer ""privateers"" for securing the system too (in isk and ""war booty""). there should also be an ""end-game"" where, after a faction secures a certain percentage of the contestable systems, the other faction is forced to capitulate (with antoher big payoff for the players in the winning faction) and the whole thing resets starts again.this would make it fun, and give it urgency and a sense of accomplishment. i'm sure ccp is gun-shy about doing it, though, because it's exploitable, and there are certain entities in the game who wouldn't be above exploiting it, and are big enough to do it.as it sits it's just a license to pvp in low sec without having to pay for a war-dec or take sec hits. *yawn*."
9/18/2008,"i endorse this idea because it is good.seriously, let's get some kind of reward going for capturing systems. npcs sitting in plexes shooting people that go in them is not a reward to be spoken of. npcs sitting on the gates? maybe better, but still pretty lame and kinda defeats the purpose of lowsec (a non-patrolled area)."
9/18/2008,this.
9/18/2008,"23,5 hr would be enough too"
9/18/2008,i already promised i will be submitting an issue about this.i'll try and make it for this weeks meeting.
9/18/2008,dolby surround sound
9/18/2008,"eve-online is the only game i play with the sound turned off. if you are going to have sound, give me a reason for turning it on. for most other games, it gives you an audio prompt that something is about to go wrong (i.e. you are about to be attacked), something is happening (in case you didn't see it), if not changing the music to something more appropriate for a battle. there's a bit of a disconnect when i'm in a massive battle and the music in the background sounds like something i should be meditating to."
9/18/2008,jbs already make it too easy to move around large areas of space. we do not need more of them.
9/18/2008,what we need is less boring pos stuff.supporting everything which gives better chance of developing eve!
9/18/2008,how about...0 per system
9/18/2008,"jb's increase blob warfare, remove jb's from game."
9/18/2008,how about:two jb max in systems.constellation capitals get an additional one to connect to another constellation.only constellation capitals can connect to another constellation.this would make the jb rings interconnected rings instead of complex webs.
9/18/2008,"so i remember reading a thread about missioning loot and tech 1 market. i just wanted to say the same goes for ratting. i am a ratter, but i also have a background from mining and simple production, and i think the wast amount of loot dropped (even though it's nice for me now) is making it really hard on people who want industrial career as miner or producers.at the moment loot is also totally not logical, you can get the strangest loot from npcs which does not reflect what they really had on their ship. (kinda like world of warcraft!!)so here is what i suggest: remove some or all of the loot, and replace it with [insert random new item used for some new industry] or increase bounty for rats. or make it so that you gain some sort of loyalty point with someone for every kill.now ratting feels like mining, because you get so much loot you can refine."
9/18/2008,"just a friendly bump.i didn't expect to get a small dialogue going on here about this idea.if ccp can make aggro timers work for players, then there should be a timer for cargo cans and wrecks-right next to the name. it seriously shouldn't be that hard to do."
9/18/2008,"from jita park:all the cans already have a timer running on the server, so if the retrieval of that information took more than a simple roll-over, it wouldn't be a lagfest. perhaps the timer would be on the info screen?your computer already is making a call for the information attached to that can, might as well pull the de-spawn time with it. it wouldn't take much to then turn that into a countdown timer based on the difference between the current time and the de-spawn time. so, the lag would not be very different than the slight lag already associated with pulling up the info on the can."
9/18/2008,so noted.... but tracking wrecks is still not something that would be too helpful in that situation.but if such a thing is already implemented but just hidden... then so be it.more power to yah guys.you got my vote.
9/18/2008,"bad ju ju.ffs, we already have an alliance fielding a titan to try to control the outcome of a war that's mainly being fought by people who are new to the game, or at least so new to pvp that they really have no clue how to fit a ship. there's a whole big galaxy out there for end-game pvp. fw was supposed to be entry-level pvp. ccp, follow your initial instinct and keep 0.0 e-peen out of it. it's clear that if you open this gate, the folks out there just trying to fit an entry level cruiser and have some fun will be completely overshadowed by 0.0 politics and power plays.i understand and respect that the established factional powers who rp out there in 0.0 feel like they are entitled to get in on the fw action, but there really isn't any way to do that without them simply taking over and pushing the little guys out. if that wasn't clear before we had an erebus out there providing logistical support for noob plexing gangs, it's damn sure clear now."
9/18/2008,"it's not all about experience level. yeah, some pvp corps from 0.0 signed up and played for a while. they got tired of too-easy ganks and left.that's a different kettle of fish from having cva, and ushra, and star fraction being able to sign up. if that happens, fw is going to become all about a war between those established players. everyone else will end up marginalized, especially those fighting for caldari, for whom there is no sizable established rp alliance.alliance doesn't necessarily mean big and powerful, but, once again, we do have an erebus being fielded by one of the entities that is pushing this change hardest. something tells me that when the established players show up, they won't be showing up with cruisers and frigs. there is every rp reason in the world why this change should happen. the only reason it shouldn't happen is because fw was supposed to be about entry-level pvp. if it becomes 0.0 lite, which it will if this goes through, that's pretty much out the window. a player just trying to learn to pvp will end up just as much cannon fodder in fw as they would by just moving to 0.0. jade et. al. will get to wave their e-peen and be big fish in a little pond, but that's not what fw was supposed to be for."
9/18/2008,!
9/18/2008,to much power for the super alliancessuper alliances will have to much influance and it will end up with alliance v alliance instead of faction v faction and the smaller players will get overwelmed by blobs
9/18/2008,"first, the existing version of fw has seen every ship up to motherships in use by corps in fw, and i'm fairly sure that the only thing that has prevented titans from being prominant players is the perception (true or not) that they aren't useful in lowsec combat. further, i've seen militia battles with significant numbers of capital ships on both sides, as well. this issue has nothing to due with alliance vs. corp as a unit of entry into fw.second, the size limit for entry into complexes provides a natural limit to the usefulness of large ships, whether they are capital ships or even battleships.third, the lack of rewards provides a limit to the attractiveness of fw for the big powerhouse nullsec alliances, or even smaller alliances that don't have an rp reason for involvement.fourth, look at the size (number of members) of, say, ushra'khan, then look at the size of the minmatar militia. if you are concerned that ushra'khan will somehow dominate a group of pilots ten times our number, then i think that's more an indictment of the militia than of the concept of alliances entering fw.last, regarding the concern that if alliances like cva and u'k were to join, then fw would become all about the war between them ... you've got this exactly opposite of the truth. ccp created in their backstory the war slavers and enslaved, and u'k has been fighting that war for years, with no support from game mechanics. that same war has been given mechanics now, and ccp has written us out of the storyline. it's not that there's a risk of the militia being drawn into some proxy war, it's that ccp has evicted us from the rp war we've been fighting for years."
9/18/2008,get rid of bacon and others like it
9/18/2008,/signed
9/18/2008,"they need to just get rid of local, and yeah, anything that looks like local or works like local. don't stop with this third party add-on though. get rid of it completely. you have whole classes of ships in the game that are supposed to be ""stealthy"", but they aren't, because of they all powerful eye of local."
9/18/2008,".. follow your logic a bit further ...what is one very common reason players need support? things are broken perhaps, or not working as intended?and if you have to post bugs and possible exploits to the forums (that may have effected game play) it doesn't make a whole log of sense ... and if the development team does not receive input from the petition system where many problems with the game undoubtedly get noted .. it doesn't make a lot of sense."
9/18/2008,"bugs and exploits already have a good system, there are bug reports you send to ccp and you can tell ccp of exploits via the petition system.i'm not sure how to explain this to you, but for example if you feel that ninja salvaging is broken, then that is your opinion. it is ccp's game and they make the rules. if you feel it is broken then use the ah or any of the forum sections. just because a lot of people petition something saying it is broken, doesn't mean it should be changed.the forums are a great tool in which ccp uses to receive constructive feedback. a petition system that people would just spam whines in would not be productive and would take resources away from people who are actually having critical gameplay issues preventing them from playing the game properly."
9/18/2008,"we need new aggression mechanics for out side of stations to force pilots to commit to fighting and prevent docking games.get ride of the 1 minute aggression timer that we have now as ships are stronger and can tank for alot longer.what i propose, while you are at a station you are under its protection and may dock at any time (with in the boundary's of the session timer). if you commit an act of aggression you are not allowed to dock, simple as, as the station wishies to keep the fight out side its docking bay. does not matter if you are at war, pirate or casual ganker, the rule applies to all.if you warp away from station it will forget who you are and when you return your be allowed to dock."
9/18/2008,for some reason the option to copy a linked url from chat was removed. i found it very handy to copy a linked killboard url to have a look on the kill or other links posted by alliance mates. it was a very nice feature. i wrote a petition about the missing of the copy url option and got an answer that it was removed with the last patch. no reason was specified. i find this feature was useful and must be brought back since now it is a bit complicated. u have first to delete the text from the copy to get the actual link. bring back copy url otpion!
9/18/2008,"already fixed internally, going to be in one of the next patches. read up on an issue before you throw it around for voting."
9/18/2008,not supported!!
9/18/2008,"dumb idea....unless of course i got the skillbook returned to me and automatically unlearned the skill.then it might actually be usefull when i'm broke.otherwise, crap."
9/18/2008,"while your getting your head in the clouds and flapping your gums.... did it occur to you that when you unlearn a skill... that the said skill could cause a chain reaciton and invalidate a skill you learned down the line? oops... guess you didn't think about that one did you.that's just the tip of the iceberg.don't make assumptions or begin to guess at what kind of trouble this would cause in the programming field. i seriously doubt your even capable of comprehending logistical structure let alone algorithmic methodology.as i've said many times in my field.... its one thing to come up with an idea... its a whole different matter to implement that idea.what you are asking for is a can of worms that i'm very sure ccp is not interested in getting into.your asking for fluff... and its going to end up suggestion/idea number 10,000sorry... but there are far more important things to look into.all i see here is a poor excuse to speed up training and you obviously took a wrong route/path.even if you came up with a good way of implementing the solution... you have to deal with the glitches and chain reactions of said actions that could really cause hell on the developers.hence why its getting ignored.... for now anyway.as i can't pretend to understand how the system runs.but i do know this much... its never as simple as people love to pretend it is."
9/18/2008,this must have been proposed before but seeing as i can't find it here goes:change the local chat settings to have the option to remove portraits and just have the name of the character.this would have the benefit of increasing the amount of viewable players in local without having to scroll up&down all the time
9/18/2008,was suggested for the first meeting indeed.
9/18/2008,one of the best few ideas in last month
9/18/2008,well!heh.
9/18/2008,"an interesting idea, but the natural way to implement this is via making singularity skills be editable by players, as many have suggested in past."
9/18/2008,"at the risk of offering kind of odd advice, why don't groups like suddenly ninjas simply establish a policy of courtesy and work in tandem with mission runners?if they're jerks, you can still do the ninja thing. if they're courteous, then you can work out an equitable business arrangement. going in and starting work without even the courtesy of a convo is going to frequently get someone's back up even if they're ordinarily a nice person (it would mine) but if someone came in and asked politely if they could do the salvaging for a reasonable cut, say 50% or something, i might very well not only let them do it but let them know when i'm running the next mission and gang them so they can come along.loot and salvage is boring and a lot of mission runners would love to have that service as long as they were still getting a cut of what they see as 'theirs' (regardless of ccp's designation).a few such equitable arrangements and everyone, runner and salvage crew alike, will both benefit and make even more isk as well as probably enjoying the game more and making some friends.radical concept, i know but i thought i'd throw it out there."
9/18/2008,"[x] the ninja salvager should be aggro'd to the mission runner after the first wreck is salvaged, because the mission runner owns the wrecks, and i feel that ccp needs to change the current dynamic.[ ] the ninja salvager should not be aggro'd to the mission runner after the first wreck is salvaged, because i support ccp's current ruling that salvage is free for anyone with the proper tools to retrieve from wrecks.if they can take something you worked to get, you should at least be able to shoot at them. why can they salvage and not loot? if anything, this becomes the same as ore thievery. which is to say ""i'm going to **** you off so you attack me, then i will get my big ship and friends to gank you."" benefits everyone."
9/18/2008,"i didn't tell them what to train. i simply gave them a better frigate, some weapons, and let them go. after a few days, the inevitable question arises, ""how do i train faster?"" i then explain the learning skills, evemon, and implants. and things go downhill from there."
9/18/2008,"this morning, my itunes started downloading a new ted video. it's an awesome place for finding interesting talks.this morning, i received a speech about the moral mind. i was watching it on the train on my way to school and i thought i had to share this.you can find it here. watch it right away.i found that it was extremely interesting from the perspective of csm. it describes the exact problem which the csm has - lack of cooperation.there's 2 parts to this speech which you should take note of:1. moral purity - the battle against good and evil he talks about stepping out of the ""moral matrix"", which i think fits quite well. there's no right and wrong. 2. cooperation - making the csm cooperate for making the world a better place. he shows an interesting concept of how punishment increases cooperation. there's a nice slide around 11:00 into the video. please note that i'm not justifying punishment in the csm.you can easily identify certain people from the csm in this speech(the opposite of offense intended). it just goes to show that the csm is no different from the real world. so we aren't doomed at all.now that you have watched the video, i will let you make up your own mind. but i will make these points, which i think we should discuss:1. csm members should be pushed by the community to represent them while contributing with their own experience.2. by giving the csm incentive to work together, the csm can be taken to the next level. is this so, you think? can we achieve progress in the concept of csm by stepping out of the moral matrixes and be encouraged to cooperate."
9/18/2008,puff puff give
9/18/2008,"ted is great and all - bert rutan's speech from 2006 is one of my favourites in a long time - but i'm not wholly sure of the applicability of this one. assuming you don't intend to poll csm members on their political inclinations, about the only piece of actionable information is that punishment for antisociability yields more sociable behaviour, and unless you intend to declare war on the goons to punish darius for not posting on the forums more often, that's not especially practical. and the one member whom indirect punishment has been tried on - jade - has proven wholly impervious to that pressure, with no sign that he viewed it as anything other than half joke and half dark goonish conspiracy. also, the bit about ""there is no right and wrong"" is absolute nonsense. aside from the blatant contradiction(a statement that, if accurate, destroys the entire concept of accuracy), it is also a direct attack on the entire structure of human thought. i can buy the talk's implication that most societal debates should be treated as less of a shrill moral imperative than it is currently, and that stepping back and analyzing issues dispassionately is a good thing, but abandoning the entire concept of right and wrong turns your brain into oatmeal."
9/18/2008,"1. a student at a british public school who is required to perform menial tasks for a student in a higher class. 2. a drudge.just because it means gay in america doesn't mean that was the intended meaning. remember, a large majority of the eve-online population is european. if they speak english, it is the queen's english, not american.honestly, the other meanings make just as much sense in the context as the homosexual definition.if you are going to start putting word filters in, the limitations are endless. there is bound to be some language or people-group out there that finds any given noun of adjective offensive. the offense is only determined in the way the word is being used.people go through an entire graduate school program to know these cultural differences for words, phrases, and symbols, you can't expect everyone to know that you don't like certain words."
9/18/2008,"you will always lose members to apathy and attrition - it's virtually unavoidable. either they find the job to be harder than predicted and thus find themselves unable(or unwilling) to make time for it, or they just wanted it to pad their resume in the first place. there's nothing you can do about this, except to elect better people next time. regarding meetings, the current lack of them is ridiculous, and i shudder at the thought of your next agenda, and at the thought of how many good ideas that would normally have gotten advanced are going to be ignored because they're now a month old and on page 15. regarding reaching players who don't use the forums, i think ccp's in-game advertisement of the elections are your best path here. the current csm should ensure that the next such announcement includes links to jpsc, and to the past accomplishments of the first csm(and i mean things actually implemented or about to be, not just talk), as well as other info that would be good at reaching out to non-forumers and getting them involved. that said, don't expect miracles here - most people just aren't going to care, no matter what you do, and if we ever see even a 20% voter turnout i'd be surprised. just make sure we're here to implement good ideas and weed out bad ones, and to listen to people who raise concerns, whether it's their first post or 10,000th."
9/18/2008,"it's utopia to think that we can interact with all players, despite how awesome it would be. i would love more interaction indeed. but the current structure of how things work does not promote discussion in any shape, way or form. the assembly hall threads gets filled with /signed, making it impossible to discuss anything.but yes, it can always improve if the members of the council wants to. just a bloody shame really. you can't fix this, it's democracy. we might find that some things are just better done by the developers rather than people with personal interest.but i do think we represent a wide area of people. i can't think of any which isn't represented. i agree. too much discussion happening which should have been done before the meeting. lets put the blame on lack of a ""good"" place to discuss issues before a meeting.i also discussed about streamlining the process and putting the issues into catergories. you note the bug, tweaks and rebalancing filling the agenda, which i agree on. it needs to be sorted.i would put people into 3 boxes:1. the people who don't know about csm but who is interested2. people who do not care about it3. people who are already interacting with it to some capacitythe problem is that you want to reach the 2 first groups of people. of course, it goes without saying that some people who aren't aware of the forums, simply do not care about it. we can blame this on the poor quality of the forums and posts on it.but some people we simply wont reach without help from ccp. our only option is getting in touch with corporations and people in random local areas. while i'm considering that to be an option, it's a very time consuming process for little reward on the large scale.i think the idea of a discussion meeting is ""ok"". but the text format is really poor. just look at all the chatlogs so far. it would have to be done over ts/vt. or it should be done on the forum during the week. the csm is not supposed to be busy only on weekends when there's meetings.i'm personally in favor of the forum discussions during the whole week. it's a lot more transparent as well and it doesn't turn into a pig with lipstick on, hunting for it's own god damn tail"
9/18/2008,"hey man, anybody can talk to me any time they want, so get off my case."
9/18/2008,"simple question; requires a simple answer.edit: where does one announce their candidacy for the next election, is it here or another forum? as i recall, prior to this forum's creation it was in gd but i am uncertain where and/or when to post.i'm under the impression that a candidacy lasts six months; the last lot were... what, april..ish? that places october as the next elections; when do candidates start (re)campaigning?"
9/18/2008,"i know announcements and candidate threads are properly located here, though a lot will cross over into eve general for added readership. as for dates, i'd like to know as well."
9/18/2008,"i like the concept of a big gun. i was thinking more along the lines of guns similar to pos guns, but capable of hitting targets surrounding the planet. something expensive, large, and takes a while to online/offline. a planetary defense system shouldn't be something easy to toss up. it would slowly start pounding away at the red poss and could hit ships coming in to defend/take them out.though, i assume this isn't possible due to grids?"
9/18/2008,where in the hell are you flying at? a belt in .7 sec or lower?obviously this could be tweakd so that it doesn't affect anchored cans.
9/18/2008,"all the cans already have a timer running on the server, so if the retrieval of that information took more than a simple roll-over, it wouldn't be a lagfest. perhaps the timer would be on the info screen? your computer already is making a call for the information attached to that can, might as well pull the de-spawn time with it. it wouldn't take much to then turn that into a countdown timer based on the difference between the current time and the de-spawn time. so, the lag would not be very different than the slight lag already associated with pulling up the info on the can."
9/18/2008,"the 0.0 threads have quieted down quite a bit. going to start tossing around some ideas on this for a while and try make a proposal out of it.somebody who likes all that mining *$&% please clean this basic idea up a bit ;-) in essence, more autonomy for 0.0 empires is desirable.also considering a self-manufacturing mechanic. the system constructs itself out of early production materials. can be sped up by feeding raw minerals. production takes about two weeks or so to hit maximum. something like that...ya know, but more specific.second ideal goal is that it does produce useful things, but will produce much more when fed minerals/ice that come from regular economics, allowing production power to keep its place in 0.0. keep basic theme of using minerals to make more minerals. rp reason is that planet materials must be combined with asteroid materials in the extraction/refining process.utopian design goals:1) increases economic power of 0.0 empires and drives the game towards less grinding and more pew-pewing in expensive gear.2) forms the mid-size gang target in the measured loss of production model.3) production strong alliances will gain yet more production.4) in no way promotes grinding. no weird mechanics to control the population. we have dreadnoughts for that."
9/19/2008,"ok csm is has been 8 days, since we heard: ""we will check on possible nda issue."" what is the ccp's answer to this ongoing issue?"
9/19/2008,bumpin this
9/19/2008,"i wouldn't hold your breath; like most of the other pvp-focused balance issues (e.g. black ops battleships) there's very little incentive on the part of ccp to do anything about the naglfar/nidhoggur. the number of players who can fly the ships and who consider them unbalanced is small, and moreover have enough time/skillpoints sunk to not quit out of hand about it."
9/19/2008,"i support this. i like matari ships, but they need to be brought up to balance with the others."
9/19/2008,i'm not at liberty to say any kind of update one way or another.
9/19/2008,"best i dea i have heard is to make the 625% damage bonus also effect the missle hp.in addition remove the -92.5% explosion velocity from the siege mode. they are slow as dirt anyway and cant catch fast target to begin with, and any smaller ships are already getting resist vs the missle and size vs the missle, even a speed bonus vs the missle without the explosion velocity being gimped from siege. a rocket fired from a siege mode dread wouldnt have the explosion velocity to do full damage to a bs with a after burner, let alone the slowest of all the missles."
9/19/2008,"i don't see where there is anything in the patch notes, in testing, in development, or on the drawingboard for black ops. amazing. but they will address it soon (tm).slow as smoke offa cold ****!/signed as far as previous suggestions."
9/19/2008,"slow? slow you say? it aint moving, its frozen solid.guess that is the problem to be based on iceland :("
9/19/2008,"you know honestly, the only thing black ops really need is to be able to fit a covert ops cloak. that would be a huge boost just in and of itself. t2 resists would be nice but aren't needed. we really do need a fuel bay too, their cargo bay size limits them to about 4-5 jumps before refueling and maybe 3-4 jump bridges as well, and that only leaves you with enough space for about a day or 2 of pvp ammo. (i have about 3500 various missiles, enough fuel for 5 jumps, and 3 jump portals.)aside from that they are pretty good ships, stat wise.my skillsmy configalso making covert jump portals/cynos work in cyno-jammed systems sounds like a good idea, but... it's kind of pointless really. since you need to get a covert op in the system in the first place to make the covert cyno, what's the point besides making a warp to spot for your fleet? which you an already do now anyway. i see no real point in this. honestly i don't really see any point in covert jump portals except if you had an entire gang of only coverts/force recons. maybe if they added the ew frigies to this too it would be alright. or maybe just all frigates and force recons and logistics. i dunno, but something needs to be done about covert jump portals to make them actually useful."

9/19/2008,"not a good idea.why tax someone for virtually nothing? they get nothing from their corp. so, they should not be taxed.if you dont like the idea that they can not be wardeced, propose that npc corps can be wardeced.and watch how that turns into 1-day-player massacre. hence, no can do.and why should they not be allowed to stay in an npc corp for more than x ammount of time???? does anyone force you to switch player corps every once in a while?!?!it's clever use of the rules. not an exploit of the rules."

9/19/2008,"nice post ugleb, i support your idea wholeheartedly.with regards to capital blobs.... the minmatar militia engaged an amarr militia pos a week or so ago. this engagement saw cva and 0utbreak caps fielded, regardless of fw mechanics. rumor has it that the amarr militia make use of cva quite often (although i cannot offer any evidence to back that up), so the risk of 0.0 alliances and corps intervening is already a reality. while limited in their scope, of course, 0.0 aliances can already hotdrop capitals with the current mechanics. all that is at risk is their security status, which is easily fixed with a few days ratting in their sovereign space.introducing the mechanic that ugleb suggests wouldn't change the probability of this happening, in my opinion. but it would allow the serious rp aliances to join in with the major rp storylines taking place in eve today.bravo, ugleb, bravo.matt"
9/19/2008,"i agree that the current system is sub-optimal, and would agree that it ought ot be changed. speaking for myself, when fw hit, it was agreed that we would 'mothball' our 13 day old alliance and form a specific fw corp (which wasn't the perfect solution, as people can come to the most obtuse of conclusions when they see that).that said, you've posted an idea that has clearly been well thought out. however, i am still undecided as to what the best solution is, personally, as there are so many factors to think about. i'll support, i suppose (though my support is irrelevant, as this will inevitably be brought up!).i'd like to comment here:i would suggest that not only should the alliance's overall standing reach a certain standings mark, but there should also be a threshold for every single corp in the alliance to meet (i.e. none of the alliance member corps can have unsatisfactory standings). that said, i still think a lot more discussion is needed :p"
9/19/2008,"has my total support. keep pushing for a result guys, don't let this slip off the radar."
9/19/2008,"no support.as much as the subject seems controvertial, i can't see any positive outcomes of allowing alliances into fw. so far, the only institution that could get profit from it is ushra'khan and i believe that it justifies the ops thread.i'll put this perspective in details:fw is currentely a side feature of the game where corporations of medium and small size are able to participate in a positive and significant way in eve. actually, the only feature where such corporations have this chance.the introduction of alliances inside would make this dissapear. it wouldn't take a weeks time to see alliances completely dominating statistics and battlefields underscoring the mere reason of fw to exist at first place.another point, besides ushra'khan, i see no other entity of similar impact that would benefit of joining fw. i doubt that cva would be interested on leaving providence just to enter fw because they would feel almost as an obligation to do so. caldari doesn't have any hardcore rp firm alliance, the same stands for gallente and even small associated alliances with both factions wouldn't benefit leaving their 0.0 business for it.incase the main alliances would be allowed and decided to join let's say uk x cva we would simply be turning fw in an yet another copy of the same conflicts and theater we have been watching for the past years here including these both factions for example. why would we want to do that and why ccp would make fw for this? i don't see the point.exploit by other alliances. will happen as soon as the system opens. standings are too easy a fact to manipuate in 24 hours time dissolving and joining the right characters for it. i believe many would take the easy way.to resume, i see the cost risk x benefit far too great to become a point to be considered. i respect and understand ushra'khan<U+FFFD>s feelings on the matter, but changing a full game mechanism to this extend just because of it seems unwise to me."
9/19/2008,"the amarr all ready rely heavily on their respective alliances, it won't change a damn thing. (except maybe the minny militia will finally get some help from ushra.)"
9/19/2008,"tell me, dear one. what evidence do you have that makes this true? perhaps 10% of amarr achievements can be attributed to the influence of the amarr-rp alliances? no, that's far to optimistic. more like <1%"
9/19/2008,"um, station sim extraordinaire???how about allowing for compression of minerals in station? however, apply production costs like heavy water to run the production line? (or some other fuel). still require the industrial reconfiguration skill as with the industrial core, but allow for it to be done in station."
9/19/2008,90% of 0.0 have ore like empire imbalance ? fix empire ore to be veld only and remove refining from empire missions.
9/19/2008,"my concern with this is that it'll just accelerate the cap-ships arms race that's going on.capital ships should be hard to build, and take a lot of logistics. given the massive wealth of the ""top tier"" alliances right now, if you remove most of the logistical challenges to popping them out like frigs it's just going to lead to even more server busting fleets than we have currently.if the servers better supported these massive capital fleets, i'd be all for it. given the current state of the servers, though, being able to casually field hundreds of caps doesn't make much sense."
9/19/2008,"the issue of capship accumulation i don't think is tied to economics. instead, consider these two known issues:1) entropy isn't working on capitals because carriers effectively support more carriers and are impossible to attack without obscene dps on the field. another ""broken"" ship is the ddd nano-titan when used in a cyno-camping role.2) there is no accumulation of other ships because the more that fly, the more that die. entropy favors wrecks over ships. only caps are seen as exceptions, and only in certain cases.economics aren't what create capital creep. imbalances in eve entropy do. provide a capital sink and the entropy will go away such that capital production will balance capital consumption to a more healthy extent. at that point, 0.0 wealth can be raised without too much concern over creating a power imbalance between empire and 0.0 ""empires.""op is cool with me. creating logistics nightmares doesn't make the game fun or fare. let us move tons and tons of stuff and build and fly and get blown up as many times as we can stand. grinding is not a fundamental principle of mmo's."
9/19/2008,bump...
9/19/2008,"love it, got my support"
9/19/2008,"well while not an expert on this subject i honestly not heard of many miner's having kb's for veldspar nor misisoner's for the npc rats and definately not seen any traders have a killboard for their killer deals though perhaps they should as trading is probably the most hardcore pvp in eve. so while their piwate or pvp alts maybe, i am saying they carebear charactors aren't kb *****s ! ( thought if you could the little cool face for no reason i could as well !"
9/19/2008,"don't try to fight it, just do what we do. typically the ninja's will jump in after the fight is well under way, though we had one that was waiting for us at the gate before we even get started, so there are plenty of hostile npc's left, cap and armor tend to be running a little low, and if you are smart your cargo should already be pretty full of stuff. along comes the ninja(s) so we jump out. if he wants the salvage pretty bad he's gong to have to fight the npc's to get it. i've never had more than 2-3 wrecks looted using this tactic."
9/19/2008,"well, i don't do exploration, i'm just a prospector. but i also decline when i get offered to mine a grav site cause:i make the same or even more isk by mining plagioclase, pyro or veld, and don't need lots of isogen for production as well. so yes, fully supported."
9/19/2008,i don't find this proposal better than what already exists.
9/19/2008,if anything it decrease blob warfare.butand removing jb for easy traveling wouldn't solve any problems. hai2u big blobs + titan.
9/19/2008,"...says the cva blob member. thats quite funny, you guys have got to be the most effective at using the jump bridges to get blobs from point a to point b."
9/19/2008,"so why is it small gangs get out blobed by alliances due to the fact they can get there fleets to zoom accross the map via jb's, how does this decrease blob warfare, please explaine."
9/19/2008,"thank god you said jump bridge, i not have a clue what he ment ! cause you said no then i will just for that reason"
9/19/2008,"dreadful idea.they're supposed to be worse than gates, otherwise eves stellar cartography essentially means nothing. dead-end pipe? not so if its linked to 10 other constellations.jbs are ruining roaming and small gang warfare, with blobs essentially materialising out of nowhere for little cost. increasing that tactical flexibilty tenfold by adding more jbs is a horrible plan."
9/19/2008,jump bridges dont ruin anything. they are a nice advantage for taking and holding space if you can't deal the go live in npc space.
9/19/2008,"#yeah, i already did, cheers. you are entirely wrong, of course, but note i'm not saying remove them, just hell no dont make them vastly more powerful by having cross-linked networks putting blobs everywhere."

9/19/2008,"the feature mostly consists of getting a third-party program and plugging in your full api data(not the one you use for evemon, the other one). the one i use, for what little i do industrially is eve-meep, but there are probably others that i don't know about."
9/19/2008,"thx alot herschel, that seems exactly what i was looking for :-)"
9/19/2008,nice
9/19/2008,"it has everything to do with it. the entities that would be allowed in if this is approved have vastly greater resources than those who are participating now. there is little doubt that if this is acted upon by ccp as it is proposed, the rp alliances will determine the outcome of fw. fw will become the domain of those aliances. everyone else will be also-rans who have little to no impact.if that is ccp's intent, cool, but they just need to understand that if this goes through, they can pretty much forget the notion that fw is going to be attractive to empire dwelling novice pvpers. uhhhh... ever heard the saying ""never bring a knife to a gun fight""? yeah, you can't get a carriers into a minor plex, but you can sure cover the entrance to one with them. i cover the gate with cruisers, you bring battleships, i bring battleships, you bring carriers, i bring dreds to kill your carriers, you bring dreds to kill my dreds. not long until we have cap ship battles over minor plexes. please. i think you could say the same about providence. yes, i understand that nobody but the rp alliances will care (except maybe goon, since they'd like to make you cry). yes, i understand that you'd like the rp alliances to own fw. lets see if ccp would like that too. uhhh.. you're joking right? most of those folks are marginally active at best. since outbreak and some others left the militias are lucky to raise fleets of 30-40 during the week, maybe 100 on the weekend, and those fleets are comprised of mostly novice pvpers and fcs. yeah, i think you'll dominate it. easily. if you join, it will become all about you and star against cva. the caldari faction will be a weak sister whose players will probably stick close to the cva amar fleets so they don't get steamrolled. controlling the entrance to plexes will become cap-ship affairs. in short, it'll become 0.0 lite with better mechanics for the rp power players. the npc militia corps will become irrelevent. they won't get invited to your fleets. they'll just wander around getting ganked until they empty. i'm not saying that's a bad thing necessarily, but lets not have any illusions about what making this change would mean."
9/19/2008,"no support, for several reasons already presented here.to resume, alliances in eve already have their space and eve machanisms to explore and play against each other. leave fw for the small and medium size corps to play with now. allowing all corps inside alliance to enter is the same as allowing the alliance itself.allowing 1 corp inside an alliance to enter could be exploited as they could change members between one corp to another, not speaking about the mess that previous alliances war decs and sorts could bring along inside a gang militia.i don't see why fw should be yet another feature to see wars of the past repeating itself inside. yet another theater for cva x uk and megablobs at space making the corporations and militia itself nule in terms of play and influence."
9/19/2008,"so, to summarize, you are concerned that, if such a change is made, that an alliance like cva will abandon their nullsec holdings so that they can park a carrier in front of each and every minor installation and gank noobs in t1 frigs? even if they did that, they'd also have to park an interceptor with each carrier. then, of course, the pair of t1 frigates with a stab each laugh at them as they go in and cap the plex in perfect safety. less than a million isk just pwned over a billion isk. where else in eve can such a thing occur? you mention the knife in a gunfight analogy, but a more accurate analogy would be a knife vs. a halbard ... in a dense jungle. who's gonna win that fight?in any case, you word these sorts of things as fears that might come to pass should the big bad alliances get their way, but the fact is, that such ships are already being deployed in fw without the involvement of alliances, with just as little effect, to my view. i've seen the amarrians play station games in a small handfuls of carriers, but the only damage they did was to bored pilots who didn't feel like ... i dunno, just not warping to that particular station. then there was a pos battle where an unknown (to me, but over a dozen) capital ships where involved, but none were lost on either side. early on, i think it was ra who tried muscling in on state turf and lost 2-3 carriers to a bunch of noobs in t1 frigs and cruisers.yup. there's clearly a danger here...regarding providence, i think there's a great parallel to be drawn there. with a few (brief) exceptions, the only people that ever fight over it are cva, u'k, and their allies. why? because it's worthless, beyond it's rp value. any large alliance could walk in and grab it at any time, if they set their minds to it. don't get me wrong, it wouldn't be easy; cva is well entrenched. but it would just be a matter of how many lost ships it would take to dislodge them.i think that fw would be treated similarly. if the bbas wanted to screw with fw, they already can. the goons could drop a 50-man blob in every fw system today, if they had the motivation. sure, they wouldn't have any wts, but that's never stopped them in the past. sure, they'd have gate guns firing, but do you think that would really matter to the capital blobs you're so fond of pointing out? the only thing they gain from joining the militia is the one thing they could care less about: the ability to cap plexes. not having access doesn't stop them from interfering with fw; apathy does. there's just no reason to do it, especially since they'd have to spend weeks or months grinding standings first, and by joining would give up half of the potential targets they'd otherwise have.rp alliances like u'k want to be in this fight because we've always been in this fight, until we were evicted by ccp. would we dominate fw? well, i'd like to think that we'd have some impact, otherwise what would be the point for anyone to join fw? perhaps our more experienced pilots and fcs would pass on some of their experience, for example. but as far as 'taking over' is concerned, the worst thing we could do to those unwilling to bow before the awesome intellect of our benevolent dictatorial rule would be ... well, i suppose we could not invite them to gangs we organized, which would leave them ... uh ... right where they are now.so basically, your biggest fear is that the hordes of novice pvpers in fw might learn something?besides, the bulk of the fw playerbase is pirates and alts of bba members, anyway. why not let in some people who actually give a damn about the storyline to give a hand to the novices who might actually learn to enjoy the storyline?"

9/19/2008,"my opinion is of no value, please move on. hey! i'll give it anyway:- the csm members were elected to work together- csm issues surrounding 'working together' are much harder to resolve if spotlights are shed upon them in the public eye. one of the important rules of diplomacy is to not make your 'opponent' lose face. this mistake can be made if one takes the public approach in resolving personal/other issues between csm members.- lastly, i call shenanigans!"
9/19/2008,"have to agree. absolutely nothing can be resolved with public discussions between csm delegates when many are obligated to play up to the reputation and leadership roles they have elsewhere in the community. nobody wants to admit they are wrong, mistaken, or that the other side has a point. hell even the non-leadership experienced delegates got elected in the first place by having robust argumentative attributes and ego combined and its a bit ridiculous to expect any of them to check in that ego at the door when debating passionate issues on the eve forums.making a public challenge or attack on another committee member invariably leads to the spectator sport of baiting and trolling and further reduces to ability to actually get anything done.there is a reason smoke-filled rooms are the places where things get done."
9/19/2008,"quoting the exact opposite of how any democratic system should function. smoke filled rooms are where roaches hide. sunshine is the best disinfectant.pot calling kettle black is another one. i'll edit this if i can come up with some more old sayings that apply to the quoted post.:edit: *goes out of his way to insult, degrade and berate other council members in any venue he can access**posts lamenting how everyone else just can't get along*"
9/19/2008,thanks for illustrating my point so perfectly.
9/19/2008,"your point was ""we should do everything in secret"". i disagree. don't like people not agreeing join a council made up of only yourself. i've just as much a right to express my opinion to the contrary as you did to agree. maybe you should go back and read the mailing list, shc, your irc logs, and anywhere else you posted where you became the only person on the council guilty of what you're posting against here (and likely the very topic of this thread and post).sorry if you feel you should be able to say whatever you want until it comes back to you, then claim some moral high-ground as if you're above it all when in actuality you're the first one to sling mud and sling it dirty. that world just doesn't exist so get over it."
9/19/2008,no my point was that you can't discuss anything civilly in public because you are acting as a cheer-leader for 5000 goons.
9/19/2008,"i am a cheerleader for 5000 goons (a base a few thousand larger than your voterbase fyi). you, on the other hand, are a hypocrite who likes to throw stones then feign moral outrage when they come back in your direction. the difference between us is i'm not pretending i'm something i'm not."
9/19/2008,ah well not a very productive discussion really. end of the day people disagree with each other - not altogether a surprise.
9/19/2008,"personally, i find that this level of discourse is beneath the decorum of the csm, and i shall retire from further conversations until such personal attacks cease to pollute it."
9/19/2008,"hey saint you missed the ban button. i'll give you a hint, it's the one you pressed on darius for the same reason. i'll give you a second hint: you were wrong on both counts."

9/19/2008,as pointed out in the thread. in public people are too conscious of their reputations and notoriety and pride. nobody will give an inch on these public forums while their alliance mates and audience are measuring each word and nuance and cheerleaders are performing rap-posse chorus lines to whip up the crowds. whereas in a private smoke-filled room deals get done. take the uk house of parliament as example. no deals happen during pm's questions. the real politicking occurs out of the public view because thats where politicians can actually meet in the middle and engage in horse-trading outside of the sight of the partisan masses hurling abuse at each other.
9/19/2008,you're confusing the uk with a true democracy. online space games don't need some fancy private lounge and that's counter-productive. ccp employees already have that. we don't need a council that mimics the opaqueness of ccp. if you can't handle having your actions and their results scrutinized in public then don't make them.
9/19/2008,quite obviously you are mistaken - since this csm has run into the problem where csm delegates are incapable of having a respectful and civil discussion on the public forums because one side feels the need to play up to it's member base and bully and verbally harangue the others. this csm has been crippled by the mutual animosity of members. and that has only been made worse by the involvement of 3rd party partisan flamers and trolls through the process. these forums have not been a decent setting for debate since the election and your alliance (goonswarm) has to bear a lot of responsibility for that.
9/19/2008,"maybe if they are egotistical asterisks. this is internet spaceships, if you are taking it that seriously, you have mental problems."
9/19/2008,so where do you get off alleging mental problems exactly?you don't know anything about me. why can't you have a discussion without getting personal?why is it neccessary that virtually every single discussion i have with a goonswarm poster on these forums ends up with flames and personal attacks? can you answer me that?

9/19/2008,"well i don't want to get involved in the specific discussion of moderation in this thread - but i think this jita park/assembly hall pair of forum sections has been a problem for forum management since the outset. there has been a lot of flaming and bad behaviour perpetrated here - and part of that is responsible for the death of actual debate between csms and the community in these forum sections. i can understand why it happened and why it was felt these sections should be ""hands off"" so as to not interfere with the democratic opinions and discussions that were meant to happen here - but with virtual mudslinging so thick that you can't see opinions and debate for the actual mud its all a bit silly.i certainly feel strongly that i literally cannot post anything here without being abused, insulted, flamed and trolled at the moment. and thats a ridiculous situation for a player, let alone a csm rep, let alone csm chair to be in. we were promised some private forums to conduct csm business in but circumstances have gotten in the way of that and its nobodies fault end of the day. but the fact we need private forums is a bad reflection on the climate of the forums in and of themselves. the community does have some responsibility in not exercising appropriate peer pressure on individuals and organizations that promote flaming as an ordinary style of discourse. problem is that any moderation system can be ""gamed"" to a degree. and you don't want lawfully elected csm's getting removed due to some underground mob ""report"" flood. its a very difficult thing to measure. i think ultra-strict moderation is not the answer. i think community peer pressure is."
9/19/2008,"you get your voice and your vote every election cycle. that's your opportunity to speak and be heard. you continue to have that opportunity to express your opinion here on these forums. however, to suggest that elected representative's opinions should be controlled by ccp is hilariously offbase when discussing a council whose very creation stems from ccp's negative actions.allowing ccp to sway the discourse of the csm in any way whatsoever, including via ""moderation"" is a ridiculous and dangerous prospect and sets an awful precedent."
9/19/2008,"when you flame, attack and abuse others you should expect nothing but the same in return. playing the victim doesn't excuse your own actions, nor even deflect from them very well.:edit: i'm glad to see you've changed your tune on the moderation angle to one of community policing. i do seem to remember you mentioning wanting community members to be able to ban people in some form as well. a concept which seemed to gloss over the fact that in this world you also wouldn't be able to post."
9/19/2008,oh i still want that. i think it would be a great idea for the leaders of organizations to have collective responsibility for the posting standards of their members. i think eventually an organization that seems to promote pointless flaming as a default posting standard for its membership on eve online forums - should probably face temp-banning at the organizational level and be expected to improve.
9/19/2008,heh jade talking about posting standards. really? i guess you dont need to be here anymore.
9/19/2008,"well yes i will talk about posting standards. case in point - you know that igs forum here - the one tagged ""roleplay discussions"". when i post there i do so in an ic voice and respect the in-character nature of that forum and the characters posting there. this afternoon we've seen a lot of ooc smacktalk from the goons posting there. i think thats simply bad and your leadership should ensure that your members are taught better standards not encouraged to break the specific forum posting rules and spoil the forum experience for other players who want to roleplay their characters and organizations. i don't care that goons think roleplay is laughable. i do care that you don't respect the posting rules for specific sections. hence i think it would be good if there was some kind of collective responsibility for an organization that seems collectively incapable of maintaining decent and responsible standards."
9/19/2008,"so, it wouldn't have anything to do with the content of your posts, then?"
9/19/2008,i'm glad you support a proposition whereby the weight of numbers would free us all from your posting forever.
9/19/2008,newsflash - your standards are not everyone's standards. get over it.
9/19/2008,i'll have you know that the smack talk is in character for goons as we are role playing the *******s of eve.
9/19/2008,"i never stated their opinions should be controled in any way shape or form.i've clearly state that their opinions should be delivered in an appropriate manner suitable to the postion of of a csm. if the csm is unable to deliver his message in a respectful manner his post should be removed as any other poster, but face harsher penalities.i'll ask you to re-read my posts from the begining, it should help you get a clearer picture of what i am saying."
9/19/2008,in that case i'll ask you to take your role play to the role playing forum.
9/19/2008,i did read your posts and responded directly to them. unless a csm violates the eula they are within their rights to act however they wish. your opinion on what is acceptable and what isn't is irrelevant. people are different and neither you nor anyone else is the arbiter of morality or post quality.
9/19/2008,see this is where i think you are wrong. the eve community needs involved in some way as arbiter of post quality (even if simply through the aegis of peer pressure) - because the community here is something worth preserving and we have seen a terrible reduction in post quality on these forums and something does need doing about it. its simply not acceptable to see these eve forums turned into sa forums mk2. it has to stop.
9/19/2008,"or you could take things that work from sa. pertinent to this, how about an ignore list? don't like the user, add them to your ignore list and you never have to read their twaddle again. pretty straight forward and egalitarian."
9/19/2008,so in your view a csm should not have to be respectful? diplomatic? mature?
9/19/2008,"well i can see some problems when i end up adding ""goonswarm"" as an organization to my ignore list and can't see issues that darius or bane want adding to agendas. but aside from that - there is the role these forums play as a ""shopfront"" and advertising venue for the game of eve online. if it devolves to flamers flaming flamers (but protecting themselves with selective ignores) how does that look to joe public taking a quit peer at the forums? and is it fair to put the burden on administration on the ordinary player that just wants to see a decent standard of debate and discussion on these forums?"
9/19/2008,"should is a nice word. the world should be buttercups and puppies. however, it seems to be economic meltdown and posturing at the moment. the csm should be able to comprehend proposed game balancing and changing for the betterment of the game. however, it seems that some csm members have little to no ability to understand how the game works.we can maybe fix the game but fixing people..?"
9/19/2008,"respectfulness, maturity and diplomacy are all subjective concepts and aren't an enforceable requirement of the eula. if they're listed there as requirements that thing's a bigger piece of garbage than i thought."
9/19/2008,"your choice, your problem....they look like a bunch of angry weird nerds getting really angry about internet spaceships? plus, who the hell looks at the forums for a game about blowing things up in space? watch the promo vids, dl client and get 2 weeks free.pressing one button is a burden? wow, the poor players actively deciding for themselves. we can set up helplines and stuff."
9/19/2008,it most certainly is not.i'm saying a csm should be those things.
9/19/2008,"don't sweat it champ, that's already been rectified by ccp via ""report"" button."
9/19/2008,your completely subjective and unenforceable opinion can and should be noted. however your calls for administrative sanction based on that are what i take umbrage with.
9/19/2008,rep system for the eve community. that's fine. i'm simply letting you know that what you're asking for is a world you'll be excluded from. what you do or don't find acceptable is irrelevant. these aren't your forums.
9/19/2008,"until you re-word your post/posts, in a more respectful manner, i will not debate or reply to you. if you do not wish to be respectful, i'll ask you to leave this discussion."
9/19/2008,that was a direct response to what you said and there is nothing remotely disrespectful in there. until you can accept a meaningful discussion whereby you debate your points without crying offense when someone disagrees with you in a completely respectful manner i'll ask you to leave this forum.
9/19/2008,"odet, santaria is correct. opinions are subjective. you may or may not agree with how they are expressed but that is up to you. are you telling me that you never heard anyone say something you thought was absolute hogwash and expressed as such to them.personally, if i think someone is talking ****, i tell them they are talking ****. i get hit a lot less often than you might think, somewhat bafflingly."
9/19/2008,"i agree opinions are subjective.the thread is not about your actions or my actions, or how you or i express them.it is about how the csm's act and express themselves.yes i have heard certain peoples opinions that i do not agree with. and i personally myself would tell them they were full of it.but, if i were in the position of a csm, i would show restraint and not let my personal emotions or opinions get in the way of a debate. since that is what were discussing, is the csms."
9/19/2008,then were you a csm you could be a shining beacon for all that is good and right with the csm. personally i don't feel the csm should be held to any higher ethical code than anyone else and anyone insinuating that it should or ever will be otherwise is living in a fantasy.
9/19/2008,perhaps a luxury you wouldn't afford others wherever you were to have the power to do so
9/19/2008,"you're a walking drama bomb with paper-thin skin. of course you feel picked on - you start fights and then feel put out when people fight back. the problem isn't people picking on you unfairly - you get made fun of when you say stupid things, the same as everybody else. god knows i've had my share of it on forums over the years. the problem is that you're delusional about what normal interpersonal interaction looks like. you set out to make an enemy of two of the people on your council, and then you're surprised when one of them fights back. what, precisely, did you expect? darius is not a particularly subtle or courteous man, but he's supposed to take your limitless abuse without saying anything in response? what fantasy world do you live in that that possibility is even worthy of consideration? seriously, quit playing the ""oh, woe is me!"" game. you are the single most powerful eve player in the game - you're one of nine who gets direct access to ccp, and the head one at that. so what if people pick on you on the forums? is your ego really so fragile that you can't take it? what does it matter to you if some avatar on the forums, who you'll never meet or even know the real name of, says unpleasant things about you? you should have known going in that you'd face abuse - politicians are routinely subjected to public inquisitions into the personal lives of family members, accusations of every criminal act that an opposition member think has the slightest chance of sticking, abusive lawsuits by the dozen, and the odd assassination to cap it all off. you're nowhere near so big or important as a president or prime minister, but you preside over the eve forums, not a civilized nation. the only surprise thus far has been how little abuse you have received - you are being held accountable for some very shady actions by ten thousand anonymous, angry individuals(with far above-average numbers of guys and youth, for added self-restraint), and there's only been half a dozen threads that compare you unfavourably to jack the ripper. you should be glad, and instead you're acting like a whiny little emo kid, complaining that nobody knows how hard it is to lead exactly the same life as everybody else. congratulations, you get abused on the eve forums. you want a cookie?"
9/19/2008,"i brainstormed a quick draft for a founding ideology of a set of proposals that will be aimed at the issues of boring pos warfare, boring pos management, and lack of significance to 0.0 sovereigns compared to the empires.and there were mmo'sgrinding is a way of life. all shiny gear, bling, and toys will require xyz amount of time to acquire. ""balance"" will dictate that things you actually want will require masochistic devotion. let us emulate the ideal of a never dull, open-ended game through placing pots of gold at ever farther rainbows and hope nobody notices.and then there was evegrinding!? no! skills will advance steadily with diminishing returns. new players and old players will be separated by mere 5% increments. isk will flow like a river. instead of the carrot-sticking fear of player enjoyment, eve will be recycled as many times as tritanium can be reprocessed from the wrecked hulls of our opponents.and then the devs f&@^!d uplet there be pos's. to control their spam and limit the infinite empire, we will infuse them with the time-honored mmo mechanic of grinding. masochism will be a metric of alliance contribution. ded hate mail will let no player escape the mmo rite of insanity.what went wrong?positive game control mechanics rely on the natural influence of the existence of opponents to act as limiting factors that will keep the game fresh and challenging. you can get that shiny t2 gear, but ownership is transient in a pvp rich world.negative game control mechanics rely on making the road to level 70 long and arduous out of the tacit understanding that creep would outpace development of new content if that content (carrot) wasn't kept out of reach with a long enough stick. these mechanics are only necessary where assets accumulate because of a lack of entropy.eve devs, afraid of scope creep and imbalance of 0.0 against empire, instead of implementing the proper positive mechanics via player driven interaction, decided to make the game do it for us via the negative mechanics of pos grinding such as fuel. this is also why cargo is limited. this is also why asteroids are tiny.give eve back to us!more independence of 0.0 empires. why limit cool 0.0 entities like sansha's nation to game fiction? why are robotics parts so hard to produce?more production in 0.0 with additional balance via pvp mechanics. more ships and more pew-pew. (this is where i'm going with that planetary production platform idea.)no stupid-ass reasons to go to jita. region specific isotopes? moon mineral distribution? these were dreamed up as mechanics of limiting the strength of 0.0 entities and creating more markets. all it does is require yet more grinding to maintain whiney towers and makes the deep-nullsec life a pain. our opponents can do that in far more interesting ways.whacha think? on target with where pos's went south? can scope creep really self-manage itself via entropy (ships blowing each other up and the natural progression towards ships becoming wrecks)?what does ccp think about this analysis?"
9/19/2008,"just two notes from breezing over this list. imo...passive income streams are already capable of being disrupted. there's nothing to change here. perhaps there could be more variety or dynamism in how those streams occur, (no details as it's deep) but suggesting that passive income streams can't be disrupted today is an outright fallacy.the solution to 0.0 being boring is not to increase the logistical payload and thus make it... more boring. it takes 8 hours to online a deathstar. that's just ridiculous. ccp's first attempt at minimizing the scale of empires was to increase logistical burden and all this will accomplish is even more of a degree of difference between the haves and have-nots as well as making more people hate eve and burn out.jump bridges and such are already vulnerable to non-sov threats. hell you don't even need a capfleet. so... perhaps i'm not understanding what you're hinting at there.i agree implicitly with the statement regarding making sov meaningful and have been working on an entire proposal surrounding that as i believe it to be a core problem. i'll have it done soon (tm). skipping back to the top... i don't get this insinuation that small/medium gang warfare doesn't occur in 0.0 and has no objective. it's an outright fallacy that keeps being repeated. ask unnat whether small gang warfare or income disruption happens. ask ex-rise. ask bruce. it is possible and we do it all the time. the game can't play itself for you.re: the last bit. artificial barriers on fleets will never work. the guy with more ships will always have an advantage. creating make believe objectives for small groups to accomplish is factional warfare. you have that now, go play it."
9/19/2008,a relevant question: is it not true that the passive income gained by datacore farming cannot be disrupted?perhaps it ought to be changed to demand player involvement for their production? edit: read: 'continuous player involvement'
9/19/2008,"this is about 0.0. there are no agents in 0.0 and therefore no datacore farming. i will agree with you that empire is a joke and that things such as datacore farming could be disruptable, but it would be completely off-target."
9/19/2008,"@dariussome of the proposal points at the top are pretty out of date. we can take the phrase ""small gang"" out of discussion from here on. that discussion is going anywhere. i agree with all your points. i'm after something a little different at this stage"
9/19/2008,"just thought of a very quick and accurate analogy for describing the difference between positive mechanics and negative mechanics. skip to the end or read my thought process for kicks:negative mechanics are where players race to throw time and money into a giant rabbit hole.positive mechanics are where players race to build mountains of shiny things.while both allow a comparison of relative uberness, you have nothing left from the rabbit hole but have the entire stack of shiny things at the end of the day.the paradox for devs of all mmo's is that people will stop playing if they win. negative mechanics try to delay the onset of winning. positive mechanics paradoxically would operate such that players can do nothing but win.entropy is the solution. with pvp entropy, there is a sink that operates through mechanisms of fun to keep the game recycling its own content.resultant analogy:negative mechanics keep the game fresh by using an appropriately long stick and a heralded carrot. all players race each other on a treadmill to nowhere and the only allusion to success is when one's treadmill is set to a higher speed, but still going nowhere.positive mechanics keep the game fresh by giving the players lots of carrots. players eat the carrots and are happy, but then must obtain more carrots. some will have lots of carrots from time to time, but other players will come and eat their carrots. nowhere in this mechanic do you find a f&!&%@*g treadmill."
9/19/2008,mmos are a form of mind control! (semi-serious)
9/19/2008,"on this i disagree with you in a number of ways. there is a great deal of imbalance regarding wealth between empire and 0.0 but that's because the risk vs. reward equation is tilted, and continues to be greater skewed, towards the empire side. i would posit that the reason for so little variety in 0.0 is that the rewards aren't there. there's simply barely enough money to be made to continue funding conquest and nothing more. at the end of that you're left with? a merit badge. a space on a map that can only serve to feed itself.sure you can get officer spawns, but you can't run missions. your playstyle choices are actually less than those of an empire dweller and the profits are higher only when comparing apples to apples. it's actually in the long term more profitable to run missions in high-sec with absolutely 0 risk.there shouldn't be balance. what's more difficult and riskier should produce a higher return and it should be higher on a scale that makes it worth doing. i believe this is why 0.0 is so sparsely populated."
9/19/2008,"agreed. i think we're on the same page more than you think, but that i'm at too much of a conceptual stage for it to be obvious.big general for instance:self-assembling structures for 0.0 that are raw material generators. fueled by materials from those, self-assembling production facilities with capability to build npc fuel etc and other crap that was before only available through empire. using components built by those and shipped to self-assembling research structures, advanced final products can be built.go with the kind of modular stuff proposed in the ""pos flogging the hoarse"" thread. have lots of really customized installations developing favorite modules and ships. sprinkle billboards and such at stargates with alliance driven content. granted the alliance logo submission process is a horrible indicator of how good something like this would go.... but yeah, player styled space would be a nice touch.brainstorming up some stuff. i'll post up later."
9/19/2008,"pre-emtive eti: i know this may be early - however people were campaigning for csm positions long before the official voting began last time. this csm is up within two months and voting will commence before then.boy, i'm not sure where to begin here, so please bear with me over this long post.i started playing eve over three years ago. my first character, roczenjka (who has since been biomassed to make room for alts) was a gallente. when i created him, i clearly didn't have a clue what i was doing.i came into this game after playing freelancer. i enjoyed that game; i was one of the first to buy it - i had it on pre-order. in fact, i played a similar game when i was younger; wing commander: privateer (had to edit there, i wrote ""privater"" - silly 8.3 dos file names!) which itself was based upon elite.elite was the first computer game that i bought - or rather it's more appropriate to say my parents bought me, back in 1986. i was four years old at the time and the highest rating i ever got on that game was ""deadly"" - but then we sold the bbc micro on which i played elite. looking back, i wish i'd kept the game for posterity - i had the original box, the poster, the instruction and the novella which i have to admit i'd never read (being four to six, it was a little involved).so fast forward to freelancer in roughly 1999-2000. the game had multiplayer servers which originally could take up to, i believe either 64 or 128 players at any one time - this was a big deal - counterstrike could only comfortably support 32 players at any one time due to most of us being on 33.6 or 56.2k modems.it was fun; i played on the jolt servers and for several years flew around with random characters and such - joining clans and fighting against other players.at some point in 2004/5 i was typing away in the system chat to someone i was fighting (i lost!) and i was commenting upon how i liked freelancer but the one thing that annoyed me was that no matter what you accomplished in game, it had no affect on, well, the game. i could, for example, lay siege to a system and with the help of several other pilots we could blockade entire areas of the universe from players entering. but it didn't accomplish anything; diamonds in cambridge were always the same price even if we cut off the supply from leeds - it was a static market and a static universe. think of eve's ""high sec"" systems (where soverignty can't be changed) but with a static market - prices always frozen."
9/19/2008,"so i'm lamenting away in chat and someone mentioned eve online. i'd heard of it only through lancer's reactor (a freelancer website) and i'd noticed the adverts. so i looked it up. by now i had broadband so the 550mb (ish) client download wasn't that much. and heck, there was a free trial. sign me up!so i joined and within two days i'd paid for the first month - looking back that was silly because i ""lost"" the remaining 12 days of free time, but no matter.i browsed through the races. i didn't like the sound of the amarr very much; i have nothing against religion or anything but seriously; religious fanatics who kept slaves? meh. there was the caldari; extreme capitalists and militaristic in nature. i liked the blue colour scheme but it wasn't my favourite colour. there was the minmitar but they looked more like klingons to me than anything else.then there was the gallente. hey, a democracy! they seemed to fit, more than any race available at least, my views in real life; this is a ""role playing game"" afterall, so i signed up for them. sure, ok, they're french (i'm from the uk) but it did say that it was in the distant past. besides, they were the most attractive. so great.so i've got my gallente character and i now have to pick the stats. i'll admit i did no research so i read through the descriptions. charisma seemed important because it looked like a skill that would help me work with others. this is a ""massively multiplayer"" game - social skills must be important here so i picked a base of, i think, 13 or 14. there was perception as well - i can be perceptive so let's put that high too. i can't remember the base stat but i do know that by the time i'd finished and trained some of the learning skills to level 3/4, i had perception of 19, charisma of 18 or 19 - willpower and intelligence i can't remember but i do know that after training instant recall to level 4, i had a memory stat of ... 8.boy was that a mistake!but i didn't know. so, i undock and... zomg wow. this station was huge. oh, aura was talking in the background. back then, the tutorial was nothing like it is now. i had 30,000 skill points, a shiny ship (looked a bit odd, though; the velator's wing was ""unbalanced"") and the entire universe in front of me.and wow that station was big.there i am floating in space, listening to aura and she said something to me. something like ""but do not fire on another pilot as there will be consequences"".so naturally the first thing i do is open fire on another player. and... i'm dead. what? huh? i redock and get a new velator and undock. and i'm dead.this repeated for about 2 or 3 minutes and i got bored and quit. i came back about an hour later and i was able to undock without dying. *shrug*. so i go off and finish the tutorial; kill the drone in ""dead space"" whatever that was, and mine 100 units of veldspar.i can't remember everything from back then but i joined a corporation... beasts of burdon i think which were ... an alliance? corp? i wasn't sure. but i mined away and helped out on either a mission or complex - i couldn't understand why they kept telling me not to fire on all the rats - i didn't want to listen - i wanted to blow things up! (now of course i understand the importance of not getting full stage aggression when you're doing a 7/10 complex!)."
9/19/2008,"but anyway, this corporation wasn't for me but i had a friend who'd joined colossus technologies - ""the oldest corp in the game!"". kewl!so i went to 0.0 and ratted away, mined a lot (they are / were a mining corporation). the people were friendly enough but they didn't like combat (i have no idea if this is still true, you'd have to ask them!). eventually myself and another player got kicked out of ctec due to our wanton disregard for the corporation's rules of no piracy. i didn't really understand what piracy was (and to be honest, we weren't being pirates, we were just pvping but hey ho - it didn't fit with the corp's ethos and that was that). by now, i'd realised that my original character's attributes were, to be honest, terrible. so i re-rolled and created an achura character; 10/10/8/8/3.so i formed a corporation with my friend and went off into the unknown. didn't have much success but eventually he went off to join iron and i joined oxide, part of the ""north"". and, if we put this story onto x64 speed, he joined triumvirate, i did a while later; i left, went back to empire to do some missions, went back to triumvirate, tri split, we stayed with my corp, left for a bit for faction warfare and other interests and then came back <3.why do you want to know this? well i'd like to give some background as to what i've done in eve. i've been a miner, a trader, a pirate, a pvper, a 0.0 citizen, a suicide ganker, a scammer, a trader, i've been a corp thief, i've built and produced ships, i've moon mined (and my god, complex reactions in a pos... never again!) and i've run a corp. i've been corp-robbed, i've had a spy enter my own corp with the intent on taking me down (revenge for my previous corp theft!) - and successfully - i lost a very expensive deadspace raven to that! i've been in 200 vs 200 fleet fights with titans, motherships and carriers, i've taken part in faction warfare, i've done roaming gangs, nano gangs, recon/sb gangs and i've soloed. i've done exploration, i've missioned for empire races and pirate npc's alike, i've done complexes (both as firepower and tank).at this point in the game, i've done just about everything i can think of except pilot a capitol ship (and that's coming along on my alt, at some point in the next couple of months).and if there's one thing i've noticed in this game, it's buggy as hell! it can be very confusing and there is almost no documentation on how to do, well, anything.for example, when i was doing moon mining and complex reactions, do you know what i had to do? i had to work out by myself... well... this:"
9/19/2008,"hi, my name is matthew newton and i'm 25 years old. i live in nottingham, uk. by day i am a network and it technician for a top 10 accountancy firm. my role is to keep our company's network operational; anything from single computers to multiple thousands of pcs, laptops, wireless devices and more. i help run our firm's ip phone system and generally spend a lot of time doing very technical stuff; bug hunting in our propriety software, writing some code here and there and dealing with end users who need x sorting out because y wont function (hint: turn it on!).now, a lot of the csm for the current council came forward with specific issues and goals; some want(ed) to change how certain aspects of 0.0 warfare work, some wanted to look at high sec space and how it functions and some wanted to look at balance between either different ships, races or play styles. i'd like to concentrate my campaign on something which i think is different; the technical aspects of the game.i don't stand for any particular cause or play style - i'm more or less of the mind ""each to their own"". sure, i have an opinion on whether level 4 missions in high sec need changing or whether nano-ships needed a nerf (no! :-d ) but i don't think there's anyone, so far, who has wanted to look at the bugs in the game as their main aspect of their campaign.for example, i'd be looking at why certain skills don't always function properly. i'd be looking at issues with the forums and website. i'd be looking at how come when you do x, y happens (when it shouldn't).i'd also be looking at the documentation and implementation of new player experiences.now i just want to raise my hands here; i am not looking to ""dumb down"" the game in any way. i like that eve is complicated, i like that eve has it's .. um .. ""little ways"" and ""features""; but these are things that i've picked up over time through trial and error, not because the manual told me.i'll give you a good example; when i'm in the fitting screen, sometimes i'm dragging a module across and it sort of ""freezes"" on the screen - it ""ghosts"" the image of the module in the middle of the screen and it won't move - even undocking or changing sessions wont change this. how do you get rid of it? move another module or an item in your cargo bay! that removes the remnant.another example: sometimes a ship will ""stick"" on my overview; i can change sessions, jump systems and so forth but there'll be a ship and pilot's name, at, say, perhaps 9,370km away from me, all the time. the ship isn't there, it's just that the overview hasn't updated itself. how do you fix it? double click on the overview title (to make it truncate) and then double click to expand it again and voila.why does it do this?i don't know.but i want to find out. and i want to fix it. all those annoying little bugs that don't really affect the game; i mean, sure, having that ship there wont alter anything but it's... annoying.ya know?and that's what i want fixed, that's what i want to pursue. i want to investigate issues such as this.i want to know why when i refresh an item's market details, my ""sell order"" or ""buy order"" screen gets pushed behind that window so i can't click on it.i want to know why my drones don't behave properly or do as i tell them.i want to know why on some missions releasing drones is fine but on others i get full stage aggression."
9/19/2008,"i'd like to know why the text layer (overview, the drone's 'x' symbol, general text on the screen) causes graphical lag on the client and a big drop in fps.why hasn't the sound effects been updated much; why do my heavy drones (which fire ""neutron blasters"") have the same sound effect as my small drones (which fire ""electron blasters"")? and so forth.that's what i want fixed and since, after... what, 6 years almost, they haven't been fixed, i want to be the person to stand up and say ""no more"".don't get me wrong; i am also for new content. i do not wish that new content be delayed or not implemented in order to fix these bugs - expansion and new content is what drives this game and any mmorpg. without it, people will get bored and leave. but at the same time, i think issues like the ones above need to be addressed. they need to be brought to the front of the queue and they need to be looked at. can they always be fixed? perhaps not; but i'd like to know why. i'd like to be able to speak to the programmers and database maintainers and find out exactly what causes these issues.some of them cannot be fixed; i don't doubt ccp has people looking at these issues but i firmly believe that they can be complacent. i think over the years they've been caught up in adding new content or spending time looking at some things whilst ignoring other things; small things - they aren't game breaking by any means, but they're there at the back of my mind.now, after all of that text, here's a tldr;i want to fix the bugs and i want to make it, not necessarily easier, but more accessible to new and old players alike.maybe i'm wrong, perhaps i place too much emphasis on it; perhaps these issues do not bother you. if that's so, then obviously, don't vote for me! but if they do bother you, if you do have an issue with something - even if you've bug reported it perhaps it hasn't been fixed or you've not had an answer to your satisfaction, i'd like to know about it.even if i don't get elected to the csm i'm going to start a database of these errors submitted by the players and i'm going to be sending this information to ccp. i'm going to do what i can to get the gears moving regardless of whether i get my free holiday to ic... err, i mean, join the council or not. these issues have been, if you'll excuse the pun, bugging me for a while now and i cannot think of a better way to look into them than being right there in iceland to take a look and the big picture.i apologise for the lengthy introduction as well, i do have a tendency to talk a lot :-) but i felt it was important to give you some background on my experience, how i've joined this community and what i have to offer.if you have any questions, by all means, please contact me or reply in this thread; i'd greatly appreciate any feedback you can provide."

9/19/2008,"npc corp chat works wonders, as you get a nice selection of random people.i had quite a few discussions in the aliastra channel in the past, and now i just approach random people in local or the militia channels and try to get them involved.i used to have a blog but that got hacked and spammed to hell, still need to fix that if i have the time for that some day, but at least we'll work on a wiki soon, i think that benefits the csm more than individual pages.just waiting for people to come to you doesn't work very well, you actively need to approach people."
9/19/2008,the current csm will still be in place at fanfest. but around that time the election will be held too. so i would expect some time late november.sadly i don't have the exact dates.
9/19/2008,call early elections! forget about the polls!
9/19/2008,thanks :-)
9/20/2008,"agreed, though if they were given larger cargo bay/larger drone bay instead of seperate fuel bay i think it would be more interesting forcing a degree of compromise on fuel/ammo/cap boosters (ie, more uninjected setups that are only good in combat for a minute or so before they have to bug out and recharge, due to having more fuel/ammo instead) - these ships are (supposedly given espionage role description?) meant to stay behind enemy lines for a while, so they need space for spare ammo/spare drones/fuel, the covops cloak is needed because burning fuel to get about as the only way to remain off scanner till engagement is ridiculous."
9/20/2008,"eccm is underpowered even if you fit two eccm mods to a battleship and gimp it's midslots a fully fledged falcon still has around a 50% chance of jamming you every 20 seconds and not to mention it has about the same on two cruiser class ship with low sensor strengths. so even if you fit to counter these ships it doesn't really work majority of the time unless you get extremely lucky, drawing me to conclusion that this method of counterattack is not viable & you may aswell not forsake your midslots to use these modules."
9/20/2008,..mate ecm is only viable on ships like the falcon and scorp specificaly because they get bonuses..without those bonuses ecm is completely pointless and useless.point:most battleships have a sensor strength of 22 plus points..try to fit the equivalent of 22 points ecm on any other ship than a falcon or scorp or kitsune and you fail.e-z answer and quite effective is of course drones..ive seen plenty of falcon pilots fall due to drone aggro.
9/20/2008,unoriginal whine-troll is unoriginal.
9/20/2008,did it occur to you that the guy you where up against had high skills in that area and that his ship had super bonuses on it?/me thumbs down
9/20/2008,"i have no problem with looking ata slight buff to eccm, but ecm has already been seriously nerfed to the point that it's only feasible to use on very specialized ships. so thumbs in the middle."
9/20/2008,"one falcon, with all-v skills, faction jammers, 3x sda ii, and a t2 jam strength rig, gets 65.3% jam chance against a hyperion, and an 86.4% jam chance against even a kronos, assuming both have 2 overheated eccm. assuming you mean t1 battleships, and your guess of 2 minutes is accurate, you just wound up on the wrong side of a 0.8% chance - it happens, about 1 time in 130. if you mean to suggest that this is the case reliably, i might suggest that you fit the correct kind of eccm in future."
9/20/2008,"having an alliance is practically required to live in nullsec ... but alliances need not live in nullsec. take electus matari as a prime example. to my knowledge, they still have no nullsec aspirations beyond specific campaigns; they're stated reason for existence is homeland defense of the republic. they are very different in focus to u'k, and both are nothing at all like the nullsec alliances that you have in mind. we are both very small alliances, broght together by mutual interest in rp -- the same rp that we are now being excluded from.why does everyone keep bringing up sf in these discussions? frankly, it doesn't seem likely they would enlist in the militia if they could. their stated policy is that all militias are considered red, regardless of faction.the reason is that they, like u'k, couldn't care less about sovereignty. in fact, they moreso than u'k, as they are opposed to concepts such as regional sovereignty.but you raise an interesting point. consider that goonfleet could, if they chose, seperate from goonswarm (leave the alliance with alts in charge) and join fw. they are a corp with well over 3000 members, and quite a good many capitals and titans (plural to an unknown degree), yet the mechanics would allow them to join fw, but not u'k. does this make sense?yes, it's an identity. a family, as such. if you were travelling with your family, would you stay at a hotel where each family member was assigned a seperate room (even the babies) and could only talk with each other by phone? if the united nations ruled that all countries would have to break up into city states in order to be un members, would such a demand be considered a matter of 'semantics'? if ccp said that even corps had too much power, and that to be in fw everyone had to join the npc militia corp, would this be a minor change; mere semantics?some alliances are just a name and a set of blues, but rp alliances, in particular, are a bit more than that. asking us to just discard our history and our identity in order to rejoin the war the alliance was created to fight is punative. the big nullsec powerhouses don't care about capturing complexes, and they already have access to everything else fw has to offer: they can already cyno in their capital fleets and camp the fw territories all they want without joining fw. why don't they do so? because there's no motivation for them to do so. they're endgame is territory control, and fw doesn't offer it. our endgame is participation in the storyline, and we've been evicted from the story."
9/20/2008,1
9/20/2008,1
9/20/2008,"i'm sorry, i just don't want big 0.0 alliances in my fw. i feel the requirements you posted are insanely easy to meet and you even tailor them so you specifically can join into fw.if alliances are allowed to enter fw at all (which i hope they never do) i hope you receive some severe penalties"
9/20/2008,"i think you are missing something here. and it is important.i have given statistical analysis of our current standings average and compared it to some other alliances, one is considered an rp group the other 2 are very firmly not rp groups.of the 4 the ushra'khan is the smallest and a very large margin (we are one third the size of the cva and they in turn are smaller than the other two). feel free to look at groups you consider likely to join fw, i think you will find that they have similarly diluted averages.i have stressed, that whatever the threshold average standing should be, that it should be very high. you and i think someoneone else have both implied that the system i propose makes it easy for the ushra'khan specifically to access fw.i return your attention to our current minmatar faction standing average. +1.15. this is not at all high. this would not satisfy my own criteria to allow alliances in. we could not get in without forcing our own members to grind away at missions all day for a significant period of time. i think it would take us months to reach the sort of level that i think should be required to access fw.now consider this. every time we want to recruit a new corp, that corp will need to have high republic standings. if they do not then our average is pulled down. if we want to recruit new members then they will need good standings else our corp average is pulled down.this system becomes increasingly difficult to achieve the larger the alliance gets. even for an alliance of our size, and we are not at all large, fulfilling the criteria set here would be a herculean task.i have even identified a method of tricking the standings and suggested a method of blocking it. if i were trying to bias the system in our favour then i shot us in the foot right there. i could have simply not pointed it out and used it to get us in.for the ushra'khan to get into fw under this system all of its members would have to drag themselves over the equivalent of broken glass for a long time. our membership is pvp based, they are not big on mission grinding at all.so i'm going to lay my cards on the table for you with an unpleasant truth. i have real doubts that the ushra'khan would fulfill the criteria i am laying out here. so, you may ask, why have i proposed such a system?because the current system is unfair. the current system forbids us from doing what we and all of those other rp groups out there set out to do all those years ago. i ask that it should be possible for us to earn our right to do this. there should be an opportunity.but, if we fall short, then that is our problem."
9/20/2008,"i would point out that the fourth district - a caldari rp alliance setup in the january time frame - did actually 'dissolve' (holding corporation in place) to participate directly in factional warfare. the intention of the alliance was specifically for factional warfare organization and training.anyone who wants to argue that capitals and pos should be kept out of fw did not pay attention during the 2nd month of the conflict in black rise. foom, a 200 man gallente militia corp, established a death star pos with capital fleet in black rise. foom had previously been a major component of a 0.0 alliance from my understanding. keeping alliances out does not keep capitals and poss out of fw."
9/20/2008,ccp tries to take this game way too seriously.not letting them go on space whales. won't stop pushing for this until whales are recognized as the only intelligent life in eve.
9/20/2008,"no!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! macross 7 was the gayest incarnation of macross ever!!!!1!!elevenon that note, i'm all for macross plus, macross zero, sdf macross, and macross frontier (missing any?) especially plus. plus was the best. i think they actually took a swipe at macross 7 being <U+8D85><U+306E><U+8A71> or ancient history or something like that in macross frontier. if i were asked to comment on macross 7 by someone interested in macross, i'd tell them ""macross fans do not speak of this disaster. it is a dark moment that will slide into forgotten memory."""

9/20/2008,hell yes.
9/20/2008,"it's not that it'll make things easier for macros but for new people to use macros. some people are to lazy to learn macro languages or macro logic, your making it easier for these people to macro. which just brings even more macros into the game.yes other games fight macros, but eve's u.i makes it difficult for these things already and ccp already has a lax policy on macros. i'm sure that eve in comparison to wow has less bots, why add more to ccp's workload just for a few / commands?"

9/20/2008,yes
9/20/2008,"yes, sorting functions in this game need a buff. while we're at it, can we please, please, allow prioritized sorting in the market like any other table in existence does(i.e., i sort by price and then jumps, and it returns items in system in order of price, followed by a price-listed group 1 jump away, etc., instead of putting the prices in random order)."
9/20/2008,"this is an excellent idea, well thought out and documented. increasing the bonus from the marginal rigs and introducing new, clever rigs (drone bay increase please!) is a fantastic idea. ten thumbs up!"
9/20/2008,well with the discussion of balancing blob warfare and returning to smaller scale combat in recent months i felt that maybe the addition of a new cruiser the hvy bomber might go a long way to addressing this problem..picture if you will a cruiser able to fit 2 bomb launchers or 4 cruise missile launchers. instead of explosion radius bonus rather a rate of fire bonus.of course since you could use the cruise missiles in high sec then this cruiser has utility there as well as in null sec.this platform would probably be best modeled after the recon class of course.
9/20/2008,"proposal:instead of all these complicated multi-vectored approaches to stopping nano, i have a simple proposal:kill agility.i like the mwd. it should make you go fast but prevent you from turning well (think about when you mini-warp). currently the mwd increases mass, and that's fine and good. what i'm talking about is slashing agility 90% or more on activation. this would allow using a mwd to get in range or escape, but prettymuch only in a straight line. if a pilot bothers fitting inertia stabs it would be possible to orbit, but they would lack the slots to complete the nano, preventing the ship from reaching ccp's ""ludicrous speeds"". more likely than not, pilots would end up using afterburners for orbiting and mwds for closing."
9/20/2008,"there should be a way to deal if someone have many factions as negative where its impossible to be able to fly in all empire spaces without problems.long time ago ccp have an idea with interbus faction. that faction have all four basic faction as positive, so doing storyline missions for them could rise all of it. but there is no interbus storyline agents afair. it could be a good idea to give back storyline agents, at least lvl1 so people with bad empire faction standings could rise it a bit.storyline missions for concord assembly could be very usefull too because security status got boost each time (something like +10%)."

9/20/2008,"one idea that i quite liked was have rats drop bpcs for meta 2+ items in place of t1 loot.that would simultaneously stop the ""free"" drops pricing t1 industrialists out of the market and provide a large source of demand for those same t1 items.however the biggest reason to refine 0.0 bounty rat loot is to provide low end minerals. a reduction in the tritanium supply, coupled with an increase in demand, would make veldspar even more profitable that it is at the moment."

9/20/2008,"transparencytransparencytransparencywhich of course is fully defeated by your desire to be able to giggle and whisper in private.and the folks you represent i'm sure appreciate being referred to as ""partisan masses"".and of course comparing the csm (and by extension-yourself) to the british government is a pretty good fantasy. oh...and transparency. save the groping in smoke-filled rooms for your rp mates.**edit**eagerly awaiting lavista slagging you off in true janus-like fashion ."
9/20/2008,"so i take it you simply don't agree with the point that people play up to an audience of their mates in public and are generally more reasonable and open to negotiation when they are in a private conference with other delegates then?put it this way. in iceland we had zero histrionics - zero personal attacks - zero trolling and flaming across the conference table in the formal meetings. sure part of that is that face to face people are far less outrageously insulting than they tend to be on the internet - but also because they are removed from the gaze and urgings of their mates they are able to function in a less combatant role.this isn't alien technology and bizarre philosophical pipe-dream theory i'm telling you here. this is how human beings function, its how groups interact with groups. go and talk to a group of beered-up arsenal fans on saturday night about the failings of their midfield game you'll get laughed at, you'll see group dynamics, hostility, hell, if it was millwall fans you might get a serious kicking (especially if you were wearing some other team's shirt). but meet one of those guys on monday at work round the coffee machine you'd get an entirely different attitude and might even have a decent discussion.people play up to their mates. in eve you have a situation where that group of ""mates"" can be 5000 strong and you simply aren't going to get any kind of decent discussion with people playing up to 5000 partisan supporters against in-game enemies and hated rivals."
9/20/2008,"1-in iceland you all were there on an all-expense paid boondoggle with ccp's stars in your eyes. of course you will be happy little friendly bunnies with ccp footing the beer bill, giving you tours, nodding sagely at your sugestions, and telling you ""you really matter and will make a difference"".on return from iceland-hello reality of not mattering. nto to mention the outcome of certain discussions, votes, and statements made by yourself and others on the csm.2-the crap you run on about (and the corporate hogwash our schoolboy lv has recently discovered) is exactly why engineers, technicians, cops, firefighters, nurses, bricklayers, hod carriers, farmers et all will always be more relevant and useful than you annoying double-speaking non-productive cerebral types otherwise known as marketing and communication types.a hod carrier can turn around at any time and point to the building site rising out of nowhere from his hard work. all you corporate advisors, marketers, and related rubbish types are capable of is filling rooms with hot air, killing trees due to reams of analysis leading to coffee stains as corporate logo's, and hogging bandwidth on forums in some effort to make yourself appear relevant and important.tl;dr?hod carriers>you.and your inability to get along with others on the csm is your failure...not the fault of non-csm outsiders. also...in case you missed it:transparencytransparencytransparencywhich was the supposed original intent of the csm. trying to do ""deals"" without full view of the folks who play--and pay for--this game is utter bull**** and smacks of elitism.**** yeah **edit**darius is right btw...read this again in case you missed it:smoke filled rooms are where roaches hide. sunshine is the best disinfectant.word."
9/20/2008,then we'll agree to disagree. end of story and pointless to continue debating it.
9/20/2008,"there'd be no need to do 'deals' if the issues were discussed before getting to a voting meeting- actually, there'd be no need for discussion unless the ideas/issues were actually decent and well thought through first!a lack of informed discussion has resulted in the current situation in the csm. darius and bane have had good opinions and input (maybe not often enough for some, see below), despite being accused of a multitude of sins. personal issues with csm members need to be put aside, and respect shown (i'm a believer in respect gaining respect) to other opinions.i'm all for transparency in all csm dealings. i've stated in other areas that the current tools work if you want them to work. open discussion with players (which would inevitably involve some compromise or at least acknowledgment of opposing opinions) on issues would naturally seem a good idea if the csm wants to be seen as working on behalf of all players. thinking through issues and discussing their ramifications outside of voting meetings would also be seen as a positive thing to do (as issues reaching voting would be more refined and stand a better chance of successful escalation).personally, i'd work with anyone if voted onto the csm- simply because we'd all be there to try and get player voices heard, and we might just all want to also see the game we love playing develop. if current csm factions aren't participating, it's prolly due to a lack of respect shown or a lack of invitation to join in. disregarding others simply because they have opposing or different viewpoints and opinions is just plain childish.expecting co-operation and all csm members actively participating might be idealistic, but thats at least something to strive for.take care,bruce hansen (arithron)"
9/20/2008,rofl...because you would prefer the csm to morph into your own private little club where you can scheme away and then present the outcomes as a fait accompli to the rest of us only further proves darius right.perhaps pointless to you...but transparency in your csm dealings is not pointless to the rest of us .
9/20/2008,"hi, i currently work - but sadly unpaid - in the area of creative stuff that you can't exactly point to. i have been in a room with people who come across like jade comes across in these forums. there was no moderation.why do you waste energy on a fruitless endeavour? jade is never going to change the way jade acts. ignore the personal attacks, that's just how jade is. pay attention to the message, not the messenger and respond accordingly."

9/20/2008,"anyone can make suggestions to ccp. the only difference is they actually have to sit down and listen to the csm (sorry ccp devs).jade has absolutely no ability to effect the game itself, only an easire way of persuading the devs."
9/20/2008,which is still ahead of anybody else.
9/20/2008,no point whatsoever me addressing the specific bias and personal attacks herschel yamamoto. all i suggest is that you run next time and put yourself in the spotlight.but i will repeat my point. the absolute worst thing about this csm experience is the interaction on these forums. there are some players who have tried to interact decently with the delegates and bring good issues to the forefront - but many many others that simply see it as an excuse to flame people without moderation and feel entitled to treat delegates like circus freaks for their amusement.nothing i say to you will put a fault line into your sense of entitlement herschel. therefore next time around its for you to demonstrate you can take it as well as you give it.
9/20/2008,"bias? are you seriously trying to accuse me of bias? i voted for you! i supported you on these forums against unwarranted attacks for months, and for that matter i still do whenever i feel them to be unfair. i never claimed you were the only problem on the csm, and in fact i have explicitly stated the opposite repeatedly. i've just gotten sick and tired of your ""oh woe is me"" facade, your paranoid conspiracy theories, and your constant picking of fights with those you're supposed to be working with. your policy is often great, but your personality is toxic."
9/20/2008,"its a very easy claim to make and you are not the only one to make it. i've lost count of how many weird sounding ""alts"" claimed to have voted for me then suddenly decided what a bad idea it was the first time i ended up disagreeing with any of their personal issue threads. spooky. i've seen nothing but bias and general attacks from you since meeting 3 and that was a long long long time ago. but its fine, you have a right to an opinion as do i - and that opinion is that i hope you'll run next time and put yourself into the firing line and i hope you will demonstrate what a paragon of humankind you are able to be under fire from a host of people on these forums. ultimately its easy to scapegoat, its easy to play to the chorus, not so easy to retain a sense of integrity and do what you promised to attempt in an election manifesto. and i've gotten tired of your continual snipes and bias. what you consider ""toxic"" is doubtless the fact that you've reached the limits of my patience for dealing equitably with personal attack and trolling. as i said earlier - you seem to believe you are ""entitled"" to behave poorly in respect to csm delegates elected to this institution. i don't recognize that entitlement. nothing i can about that though save consider your comments in that light and resolve not to vote for you if you decide to stand next time. but rest assured, i'm not exactly wounded to the quick by your assessment of my personality. i'm not crushed by goonswarm value-judgments either. end of the day i'll live, i'll flourish and keep on enjoying the game of eve online. i hope you find a way of enjoying it too. the environment is big enough for us both - and perhaps once you no longer feel ""entitled"" to flame and troll me at will then i'll stop considering you in such a negative light as a consequence."
9/20/2008,"please note jade is speaking very much for himself there and he has made his feelings very clear. he does not speak for me nor, so far as i am aware, anyone else in this.iz"
9/20/2008,"actually, you missed the important word, should have been;show respect when posting and interacting with fellow players...respect is what is sadly missing...take care,arithron"
9/20/2008,"it occurs to me at this point to ask a question of you, jade. now, my understanding is that you are not seeking re-election in the next round. it thus follows that i wonder as to your demeanour after stepping down.are you going to accept the decisions of the csm or are you going to refer to your days as chairman and make with the ""well, what i would do..."" and all that lark?"
9/20/2008,"i can show you messages of support in your campaign thread, chatlogs where i tried to get corpies to vote for you, and repeated messages of support between the time i read your manifesto and the time you decided muting was fun. even then i limited my criticism to the act at hand - i stated that i didn't regret my vote, and that i wanted you to stay on as a csm member when many were saying otherwise. my public record is clear, and whether you choose to believe me or not is utterly immaterial to me. who said i'm a paragon of humanity? i'm a total jerk. the difference is, i'm a jerk towards people's ideas. you're a jerk towards people. i've had plenty of low-level wars in committees i've sat on in the past(and i don't mean forum sniping, i mean face-to-face, and in one rather bizarre case a fistfight between two friends of mine), but at the end of the day i could go out and have a beer with anyone and everyone involved in those fights. as for me running, you'll find out one way or the other by the nomination deadline, and that's all i'll say about that for now. here is a selection of quotes from your candidacy thread, all from april or may. as well, there's a rather nice quote of yours from earlier in this thread that the mods deleted, and thus that i won't quote directly, that basically admitted that you had an anti-goon bias from the beginning - see here for what i mean, specifically post #7. considering that that was precisely my complaint about your personality - your simultaneous desires to pick fights and stay aloof from the consequences of them - i feel justified in my accusations. you are entitled to your opinions, i am entitled to call you on them, and vice-versa. we're both adults, we both live in free countries(well, mostly), and we both have our right to freedom of speech(well, mostly) - we're entitled to be mean to each other, whatever our positions."
9/20/2008,"i remember a guy i went to highschool with who fervently maintained that there is honor in counter-strikehmmm....hate to play breakdancer's advocate (<U+7B11>) but it's hard to imagine owning 0.0 ever becoming rewarding in any real since considering it's all a damned video game. i can't seem to figure out a way to do it. any implementation would require not only the suspension of disbelief, but a soul-driven assertion that there is significance in what is accomplished in eve. as breakdancer, i know such assertions can only exist where, rather than a derived impetus, the choice is a spontaneous function of natural senses. attempting to force the connection in eve would probably lead one instead to observe no reward and keep coming back to the game over and over with the aim of willing such meaning into existence. for the real world, this works pretty effectively, but it's doubtful such a phenomenon can occur in a video game.0.0 is wrong place to search for meaning. as a natural consequence of non-deterministic volition, the only value in eve is derived from playing and having fun. there lies the basis for what can be sold through ccp's universe."

9/20/2008,"more bug fixes and tweaks...excellent, that'll get the meetings to run to the alloted time quota, and make the csm appear as a useful, forward thinking entity...arithron"
9/20/2008,"i believe the csm is an excellent idea gone awry. the basic discussion format of proposed changes seems to me to be mostly under-utilised. in addition, we have had an expansion from ccp that seemed to ignore a lot of the hot topics the csm are trying to bring forward.now the basic founding principle of the csm - to me - was accountability of ccp to the players, i.e., what the hell are you guys doing? additionally, a core principle of the csm should be transparency, i.e., this is what we are doing, when we are doing it and why.now, speaking as a 0.0 dweller, i feel a shade ignored. most of the press for this game focuses on 0.0 and its shenanigans. nevertheless, i see a lot of empire fixes, so to speak. i realise that the vast swathes of players occupy empire - along with 0.0 alts - so catering to your extant playerbase is a no-brainer.on the other hand, exactly how many empire dwellers love running missions and such? how many have enjoyed faction wars? how many of those have developed a taste for trying their luck out in 0.0?it seems to me that the simplest way to learn about what people want for the csm and ccp to come up with a questionnaire, and advertise it when we boot up the client - ""what do you want from eve?"", leave it up for a month and then collate.as regards the inner mechanisms of the csm, well, people will be people, even in internet space. much like in real life, toleration of idiocy, laziness and downright rudeness will get you more of the same. it is up to the csm as people to deal with it."
9/21/2008,"someone from csm needs to come over here again and actually tell us what they heard from ccp, on this issue. this is day 9, since you guys heard something from ccp, 9 days is more than enough to pass along the information.... or are we screwing around again, and the issues miraculously ""slipped through the cracks, again.""come on guys, don't make me bump this thread over and over and over over and over again......"
9/21/2008,"no, not at all.but right now there's some issues with planning a meeitng with ccp for discussing these issues. thus, we can't do a whole lot right now.until then, i'm afraid i can't say anymore.also, i swear i posted here 3 days ago"
9/21/2008,"okay, let's rotate this back to the front of the que to be ignored again by the csms."

9/21/2008,"this. totally agree and do not want to see a nerf to ecm or boost to anything else. also i dont think anything needs nerfing at the moment, so why fix stuff that aint broken."
9/21/2008,"i'm really confused what a lot of the proposed changes on this thread will do -to the no barge comment - you do know you never really need to dock and a corp can be disbanded whilist you are out in space, right? on overall taxes -a 0% tax for 3 months, increased by 5% a month to 15% max sounds about right. on restriction of buy-sell orders - are you serious? anyone can have a buy/sell alt in jita that never undocks and can make a one-man corp. that really can't be fixed.freighters - that i can kinda see why, but at the same time, dropping the freighter pilot into a one-man corp would work just as well so as long as you just made one for the purpose of a run and then closed it. i can't see the deterrent there. sorry, just poking holes into good ideas where i can so they can become...better?"
9/21/2008,you can't force people too leave npc corps. there are people who don't like/want too join a player corp and be vunarable too pvp.
9/21/2008,"as a new player i think the npc starter corps are a great idea. they allow you to find you feet in a hostile universe without the worries of war decs and player corp politics.taxing in npc corps might sound harsh, but i think it's fair considering the protection they provide.this subject does raise horrible issue of should seasoned players remain in npc corps. staying in an npc corp does allow a player to isolate themselves which really isn't in keeping with the spirit of the game. it's also a ideal habitat for isk farmers and macro miners. however, making people leave npc corps does seem wrong when you are a active member of the community."
9/21/2008,"ok i admit it, i want players to be encouraged to play with other people in a freakin mmorpg. mmorpg are not solo player games and eve which is built around confict and player interaction should certainly be different from the wows of the world. read it again dude. read what i linked again and again and again. claiming that you know what ccp really intends is bull****. you aren't ccp, you are not psychic, you don't know what they intend. i read what they wrote and npc corporations are for the following:-new players-players who left a corp and looking for a new onei don't care if you play the game on a small, casual solo-player level, that is completely supported. but you should not have benefits in doing so, you should have some restrictions. no one wants people forced out of npc corps and shoved into 0.0 entry systems, but a small penalty for remaining in a npc corp longer than you probably should is certainly reasonable.i want new players to be encouraged to go out and make friends, make enemies, make havoc or make empires or do whatever. but for thousands of players to sit in one system and grind for hours upon end and receive no encouragement to venture outside is just bad. eve is a wonderful universe and a lot of people are missing out and quit after a few months due to boredom. they need to be shown the path of awesomeness that is eve, not herded in high sec and given no reason to ever go outside."
9/21/2008,"will have to agree with this idea, progresive tax is the way to go imo.eve should never be 100% risk free like it is for some ppl."
9/21/2008,"progressive taxing over time is but one step to limit npc corp campers.not being able to close the spammed-to-death npc corp channel (can't minimize it, only shrink it to a fixed size like your cargo window).limit the agents that a npc corper can use, and their quality, for nuub schools and npc schools.limit the hull classes that can be used.what is the 'rp rationalle'? simple, nuub schools cannot afford to support pilots in larger ships, and their 'schools' are inadequite to the enhanced training needed for higher tier skills. npc corps, likewise, cannot support the advanced technologies used by the member, and have to tax heavily to support their numerous stations/planets/police, ect."
9/21/2008,"this.and on the matari/amarr front, i've heard of several capital battles, including one with at least 10 and as many as 30 capitals, i think, though i'm not sure the exact numbers. and if they wanted to, the nullsec powerhouses could throw capitals into the fw regions without being in the militia any time, so long as they don't care about having to rat their sec status back up (and assuming they care about sec status at all). that they haven't tells me their interest level.on the matari side, nmtz did the same thing you did, by the way. i'm not really sure they even exist any more, thanks to that. i could be wrong, though."
9/21/2008,"i strongly support this, thanks for raising it, ugleb.an alliance, so long as it meets a strict standings requirement, should be allowed into faction warfare."
9/21/2008,"as i help a lot of people out on missions, i think it would be good to be able to do the following:if you're in a mission as part of a fleet and someone comes in to grief / pirate someone, then all members of the mission runners fleet should be able to fight against the intruder as assistance. this is how things would work in the real world in theory, not just having to sit around watching your mate getting attacked.this would also enable a mission runner a chance to get some assistance if he was being held to ransome by asking in his local (or other channels) for help, getting a fleet up and running and having backup coming in.i think this would make missioning more safer (and fun), and increase the options available for people who aren't in ships suitable for fighting a pvp ganking ship."
9/21/2008,mission piracy? are you in highsec when this is happening? how are they fighting - suicide gank?
9/21/2008,"yep, been cases where griefers come in and demand ransoms etc and things like that.it could also be used for when people steal miners ore etc."
9/21/2008,"a fleet can engage the hostile, but they have to flag themselves hostile to him first... generally this is accomplished by remote-repping/supporting the target.the aggressor will eather enjoy the increased target pool, or get frustrated that he can't break the target and exit the mission."

9/21/2008,regulate the gtc traders cos these prices are insane rl price still the same and isk price goes up to the border of insanity
9/21/2008,i support :)
9/21/2008,"alternatively, please get a better job so you can afford to subscribe/buy your own gtcs and not have to support isk inflation via real money trading (isk inflation which ironically increases how much isk the gtcs are worth) - and also contribute to the continuance of ccp by giving them money they can spend on development. as someone who pays in game money for game time, you are adding precisely nothing to the game except using bandwidth and increasing lag."
9/21/2008,"someone suggested this earlier this week.my stance is that's supply and demand. a fixed prices would be worse for eve as a whole, in my eyes.a better option would be to remove gtc's completely. but that's just a lesser evil really."
9/21/2008,try to live in hungary...what i buy gtc on forums that bought from ccp in real money so i support the ccp in that way
9/21/2008,just check the forums so many people buy gtc cos they cant pay in real moneyand if you remove that option lots of accounts will be closed and ccp lose more money
9/21/2008,"they are actually adding just as much to this game and to ccp as everyone elsedont understand why some ppl have such a hard time understanding this.and as for the fixed price issue thats a big no really, its all about supply and demand just like everything else in eve"
9/21/2008,"no, no, a thousand times no. it's pure supply and demand, in an optional market. if you don't want to pay you don't have to, and if you do want to pay then the prices obviously aren't too high.what? how do you figure removal of gtcs is a good idea? gtcs for isk is one of the single best ideas ccp has had making this game."
9/21/2008,because gtc --> isk is causing inflation.isk for gtcs on the other hand is ok.
9/21/2008,"no. gtc --> isk does not cause inflation at all.what is cause inflation is the fact that farmers uses gtc's to pay for their macro's. due to the low barrier to entry which gtc trading causes, the economical growth that comes from these farmers, it's bad for eve.but my point that removing gtc's all together is not to say i want them removed. but the point is that the applications for gtc's are limited. i can only think of the people who can't afford for eve, where it's a ""solution"". the only reason the gtc system is there today is because you can't stop it, so you have to regulate it."
9/21/2008,"a lot of the price is market manipulation. i can go and pretend to sell 10 gtc's to ten alts, thus making everybody think the prices have went up. i can also post lots of fake wtb gtc adds at certain prices to lock in the minimum value of other traders, who will decide to compete with wtb prices insted of wts prices.you could ask for 30 day gtc's etc, so you get less and pay less for it. perhaps this is what you want? more easier to manage sums of isk rather than massive pill to swallow every 60 days?"
9/21/2008,what ya complaining about if u dont want to pay the isk for it buy your on time card.. or use the normal ways how you should pay for this game
9/21/2008,"there is nothing to regulate - ccp gave you tools to securely buy/sell gtc, and the means to make isk. free market handles the rest. so long as there is high demand, with low supply - the gtc will be dear."
9/21/2008,"well maybe its a good time to start banning macro users, not only pasting same answer ""we will investigate it.."" specialy if someone is sending petition after petition with same nicknames mining ice 23/7 for 30 days in month?everybody knows locations with tons of miners, everybody knows that most of them are macro characters (nicks ggfdvvwgtgh mining all time), everyone except gm's..."
9/21/2008,"if you don't like it, don't pay it."
9/21/2008,"these windows have tabs like quantity, volume and so on. but none is helpfull at least, since they only sort opened asset tabs (the items in the selected station).the only option for all is the name sorting function.what we need are options that let you sort by jumps, quantity, volume or overall volume of the all asset hangers at once.so we can easily see what deliveries are close to my route, what asset has the most oer less quantity of an item or which hanger/delivery is fully loaded for a freighter run.that would really help to run the supply chain for your corp or let pilots on travel easily see that they can pick up a small item on their way.thx."
9/21/2008,"i support the extra jb idea, 3 would be a good ammount, although not needed it would be nice."
9/21/2008,"because you need bigger blobs. in fact many larger blobs trying to providence runs from smaller cva blobs. ofc jump portals is a great psy game, making people unsure how many people are gonna show up in that system.jump bridge creates more action for sure. but it also means that you need less blobing. and, the fact is that jump bridges are here. so making able to have 3 in one system does only improve logistics and management. it will not make it cheaper to have jump bridges, it will marginally make it safer. in the end the bigger gang will always be accused for blobbing, and smaller gangs may if they intrude wrong regions get blobbed. sometimes cva have maximum fleet size to not outnumber the enemy, but understandably not every 0.0 holders have that, and cva does not all the time either. but blobbing has very little to do with allowing 3 jb in same system."
9/21/2008,"we are effective in providence when running smaller fleets for sure, we get a lot of training in that. sometimes we outnumber our enemies, sometimes they outnumber us. thanks for the creds :)"

9/21/2008,"stabs should never be effective on combat ships (and now they are very limiting with the scanres/range limits), but they should make non-combat ships very difficult to catch, which is something they do not do.along with the drawbacks they should provide considerable maneuverability and mass benefits to make aligning and getting away a lot more swift. this will enable ships fitted for 'getting way' to... well... get away."

9/21/2008,"capturing space at current doesn't really allow one to do much. here are some proposed structures with quick sketches of various seriousness for new structures to add value to player empires.exhibit aself-constructing structures for 0.0. built by gallante drones, brutor tribe mechanics (the same ones that re-bolt artillery to the hull when tracking targets), amarr slaves, or nine-to-five lemons looking for the lime. all of these structures should be self-constructing. adding minerals can speed up the process, but the self-construction option is to take the grind out of space. (can be attacked to pause/reverse process)exhibit bspace hookah bar for space whales. attracts more space whales to the local system and also allows space whale research to be carried out. raises standings with space whales. attracts roaming gangs. protect your space whales.exhibit cplanetary production platforms. amarr uses a giant space laser. caldari use star-ladders. gallante have harvesting drones. matar have tribal nomad miners. these are used to produce either a gas complex or a mineral formation. using either moon materials or asteroid minerals, it's possible to perform extraction of special materials for space bling. space bling should be cool gear that is more directed to the tastes of individual alliances and requires blueprints created at research facilities (not pictured) to manufacture. not more powerful than faction and never available in huge quantities, but making alliances like sansha's nation more than cute game fiction. like in the colony thread, they should also be able to produce npc fuel. why should player empires rely on big-four empires? are robotics parts really that complicated?exhibit dto spruce up deep space and allow a more individual touch on one's territory, proposing unique entertainment oriented structures. pictured here are a space karaoke box and chribba's amarr pub (with space go-kart track). these are for passing time in 0.0 when busy neglecting pos's. if you've ever been to japan you know that in the future all buildings will be incredibly stylish and a few centuries later will catch up to tokyo. other proposals are for space pizza delivery, space csm bars (where servers dress up as jade constantine and give massages), and space bowling. space pubs should have support for anti-boosters that cause ships to fly erratically for 0.0 drunken racing and drunken jousting.these structures should be dependent on sov and take time to construct, but not much by the way of materials. self-construction method requires a planetary production platform and skims off the harvested material stream. function is limited mostly to cool shyt. more functionality as ambulation matures?"
9/21/2008,"exhibit emodularized capitol structures. function is straight up coolness. once constellation sov [insert in-depth discussion] is achieved, capability to deploy an egg that self-constructs like the others. builds a really cool monument to alliance success. style is based on modularized components that can be arranged in a manner similar to the flogging the dead horse proposal. each alliance has one potential style, giving a uniform, unique feel to alliance space. all structures should take on the style of the capital once it's deployed. big four empire styles should be available, but focus is on individual style. the usual array of color pallets and sliders. can custom arrange the location of sub-components. store the result in a compact datafile that the client reconstructs (a very fast 3d operation. don't lag-whine) the capitol on display.exhibit fthe capital is built according to alliance specific data-cores that control the nanite construction and maintenance routines etc. successful attack on the capital [insert pos-like battle system] opens up the structure to salvage, which will extract the data core from the battered structure. all structures in the alliance then slowly begin to wither away into non-cool junk. salvaging the datacore takes it to one's own alliance capitol, where it must be captured back through a slightly easier operation in order to retrieve the alliance's soul. this is purely for bragging rights and being more hardcore. let's face it, it's not about the titans. uberness and fun are the only true commodities in eve.exhibit gin order to facilitate exploration of one's own territory in a more interesting manner, space dolphins. unlike space whales, which were developed to store the information of the pre-collapse society in biologic data cores, space dolphins were bred to explore the galaxy and develop new transportation routes. becoming friendly with the dolphins leads to rises in standings and they will potentially reveal the locations of random wormholes to cool places. dolphins are capable of long-range folds and will occasionally play practical jokes, dropping you off on the other side of the galaxy.exhibit mthe space colony. right now, there is no separation between stations and a place to live. let an alliance have separate infrastructure to support renters. higher tax rates on refines. separate market systems. no access to prized outposts. ability to kick out any tenants and all their loot within a 48-hour period. increases 0.0 population without causing excess headaches to owning alliance. owners gain taxes/rent through more formalized and visually appealing means.xzibit nspace radio. alliance deployed billboards with the alliance radio station logo and concord announcements. right click. select station. client works through shoutcast plugin or similar interface (if afraid of legal crap, just activate winamp remotely.) when traveling in an alliances space, capability to tap into the local radio. alliances responsible for their own shoutcast servers."

9/21/2008,hmm well maybe better to give some much needed attention to the battlecruiser..how many cruiser classes do we need? i'm thinking black ops bc or better yet marauder style bc..sorry cant support this idea atm.
9/21/2008,i think a 3rd bc is favourable...i dont see a need for a cruiser doing sb stuff...
9/21/2008,"nano does not need to be fixed, the weapons system do.leave 'nanophaggotry' as it is now, but increase the explosion velocity and radius of missiles (as many can indeed catch a speed ship, but their pointlessly useless explosion radii & velocity means that they don't even scratch the energy field surrounding the ship.. i.e. shields).make drones capable of keeping up with the ship they've overtaken, and introduce small & medium web drones.lower the bonuses of mass-reduction fittings.don't change webs, don't make scrams turn off mwds, increase the inertia modifier for mwds.switch the bonus percentages between halo & snake sets.problem solved, but speed is not dramatically impacted."
9/21/2008,"how many times must you people re-post the same crap over and over, learning skill's are not ""forced"" on people, it's a choice like implants, it has benefit's only if you invest time in it which applies to the whole of eve so if you can't see the beneift of time investment then this is not the game for you."
9/21/2008,"eve is a world where might is right. perhaps some of you are feeling that this is not right in real life sense, but eve is a role play world where those that have more experience, friends, skill points, and isk stomp on the weaker opponents. to protect new and casual players ccp has given you the npc corporations, which coincidentally also harbor tons of isk farmers. so when you join an npc corporation you toggle the ""aggression off"" mode.i have a lot of respect for fellow eve players but once you are out of npc corporation for me you have toggled the ""aggression on"" mode. if you would like to never concern about pvp you either stay in ""aggression off"" mode i.e. the npc corp or you make enough isk to hire someone to do the fighting for you"
9/21/2008,again! please stop misleading other pilots!from what i have seen there is only the one member of the csm who is - completely incorrectly - bring ig/ic issues into what should be an ooc/benefit-of-*all*-players environment.the rest of us would like to get on with the task for which we were elected and represent *all* pilots in space. we've not had meetings the last few weeks as you couldn't lead and this hiatus ended when ankh took the reins that you are unwilling to hold.the csm should be and *can* be a force for good in eve. the attitude displayed here however is actively preventing that from happening. work with everyone until the end of your term of office please>inanna zuni
9/21/2008,"yeah, you condeming/belittling and attempting to isolate jade in full view of the public, yet again, does what to strengthern peoples perception of the csm? do you even know how to communicate in private in a productive and civil manner?"
9/21/2008,"communicating in private from those you are representing is a privilege, not a right. the people you represent need to trust that you're going to make the right decisions behind closed doors, and if they can't see that in public first, where is that trust going to come from? blind faith?"
9/21/2008,"i don't think wqe've had any truly terrible csm reps this time around although i do feel that some have performed their elected role better than others. my opinion on their performance is below. i'm not saying i can do the job better (in fact, i am sure i couldn't), i'm just being an armchair analyst here.(note - this is based on what i've read on the forums and chat logs, but i know this is not the whole picture because i got bored after about chat log 5, and as an empire carebear tend to not bother reading posts about 0.0 mechanics or pvp.)1: jade - started out well but i feel has deteriorated under the pressure of being in so many cross-hairs (something he has admitted himself). didn't help himself by his willingness to engage in forum wars.2: darius - started out not too good (i couldn't see much evidence of constructive discussion in the first few chat logs) but i feel has gotten slightly better. has been a little too keen to take shots at jade.3: bane - not the best. he seems to have some good ideas and clearly has knowledge of 0.0 mechanics, but seemed unwilling to want to discuss them either in the meetings, or on the forums. posting record is sparse and sometimes aggressive.4: lavista vista - has had good forum presence and has shown willingness to engage in debate. one of the better performing csms.5: hardin - i had trouble remembering the 9th member of the csm... i don't know if he's just been active in the threads i'm not reading, but i don't remember much input in the chat logs either.6-9: serenity, ankhesentapemkah, innana, deirdra - seem to have quietly gotten on with the job. a little more forum interaction would have been nice though.i have two accounts and already know who i will be voting for, if they stand - one is a serving csm (and the same one i voted for in the original elections who got in) and the other is someone who every time they post i find myself agreeing with pretty much every word.i think people now have a much better idea of what the csm is for, and what it is able to achieve - i do hope though that next time around we get as decent a cross-section of the playing public as we have had this time, but hopefully with more individuals able to push their election platforms through while not being blinkered to the big picture. i don't have a problem with issue bias - heck, we all vote for csm members based on the issues they support - provided that they don't lose sight of what is good for the game as a whole."
9/21/2008,"the fact you take any and all oppotunities to make sly remarks/innuendos against jade at any/every oppotunity kinda makes your personal feelings/maturity real clear.@ jade constantine : i personally think you have gotton a bit of a raw deal, for starters you have to deal with some of the most immature players/alliance and you have become the subject of many a witch hunt however it's partially your own fault. you always rise to the bait, you never let it slide, always gotta shove your point down people's throats which just irritates and wind them up.the csm has 'failed' (in my eyes) becuase there is no true accountability and let's face it, you get what you paid for and in this case we got a bunch of un-paid bickering emotionally stunted net nerd's invovled in what affect's them soly who have clearly bitten more than they can chew.i voted for that young lady with a long name, starting with an a (i think, not seen much of her at all), poor thing, shes had to be sidelined whilst you children moanded and groaned.if there was no free trip, would anyone bother trying for the next council?"
9/21/2008,"i don't see why everyone's so hung up on the trip. a trip spent in committee rooms is hardly a trip worth fighting for. i mean yes, you get to go clubbing in a foreign country, which is nifty i guess(though i imagine it'll be a ***** to order drinks), but to me the primary appeal is that it's two days spent with people who i can talk about eve with without having to compare it to wow. well, that and having an opportunity to get an answer to what the heck the devs are thinking on some issues straight from the horse's mouth. but don't think that just because it resembles a vacation that it actually will be."

9/22/2008,"if you look back a few pages, you'll see that this issue was approved by the csm many weeks ago."
9/22/2008,"right. the real question is whether ccp are actually doing anything about this, or any other csm-debated topic. i don't doubt that some form of discussion was had by you guys, and maybe suggestions passed on to ccp, but it's the last step which has all the uncertainty. you say you can't update us on that (which i don't really understand, but it's presumably not your call), so i guess we're going to keep sporadically bumping this thread until ccp decide to tell us the score."
9/22/2008,please fix.
9/22/2008,"i like this idea. it's a pain to log onto sisi and notice that your character is already behind on skills, and the new mods/ships you want to try out you can't even get into since the skills you needed to fly the ship you can't even use."
9/22/2008,"i highly support vista's idea, and just for safety, i wish to echo and point out what was being said earlier, namely this:if skills are going to be trained in mere minutes to an hour or so at most, then this is a very good precaution and a system that would probably work."
9/22/2008,"the fact that people are roaming around systems apart from a fleet makes this really nice. jumping between systems and sneaking around being unreported is pretty nice. think covert for this. it's not to move fleets or anything, but to move small groups of ships around undetected. it's not just for getting around gatecamps."

9/22/2008,"ecm hasn't been nerfed what the hell you all talking about it was given a boost if anything and now is by far the most effective form of ewar everyone knows that. it seems i have a bunch of whineass caldari frickin trolls responding to this i like flying solo from time to time and if i can't counter one ship effectively with any tactic other than bring in more people it effects this part of the game negatively. as a test i fit eccm knowing i was up against it & i fully expected to die so it's not a whine in that sense, only that i couldn't take anyone down with me for using the right tactic it felt a bit lobsided.i have run the figures a fully fledged falcon pilot has between 46-55% chance of jamming a battleship with two eccm which is basically only a dominix if you still want to tackle etc. and yes i did fit the correct ones herschel you're doing great work here on the forums but lay off the trolling mate. i have come to the conclusion that eccm needs a boost as opposed to the other and i am rewriting op to sound it off."
9/22/2008,"if you're fitting two overheated eccm, and you still get jammed reliably by a single falcon for several minutes at a time, you're fitting the wrong eccm. it will happen occasionally by chance, but as i said, the chances are very low, being less than 1%.as for buffing eccm, i don't especially have a problem with it - two overheated eccm is a massive investment in sensor strength, and the fact that you still get jammed out 2/3 of the time with that(albeit with a very specialized setup) is kind of scary. i made a post a while back about logistics ships designed for remote eccm, and i'd love to see something like a sensor strength skill, or even four(though you'd have to lower baseline sensor strengths a little to compensate, so that you have to get the skill to 3 or so for parity). i was criticizing your numbers, not your objective."
9/22/2008,"i have no idea where you pulling these figures from fella you should perhaps look into things a little more before spouting rubbish, eft figures show a falcon is capable of jamming a bs fitted with two eccm 49% of the time every 20 seconds. the other 10 seconds is spent trying to get a lock so you have 10 seconds lock time every 40 unless you get lucky, if that's too hard for you to understand maybe you should try another game. eccm is underpowered and useless ccp please fix this countermeasure."

9/22/2008,"val you can say encouraged as much as you want, buy your suggestion are about forcing people, not encouraging.what should encourage people to play in corporation is the people in the corporation and the support they give. most corporations instead don't give support to the players but only demand things from them. if you are so lousy as a ceo that aren't capable of giving better support to a player than what he get in the npc corp, you should not get a hand from ccp to recruit people. corporations have all the instrument to attract players, but they need to be good corporations. lousy corporations give nothing. edit: btw, speaking of coherence, why you don't put the face of someone in player corporation here? at the moment the person hiding in a npc corporation are you."
9/22/2008,in support of the op
9/22/2008,"i'm sorry, but that is the worst rationalization i've ever read. you're saying that if you leave your alliance your family unit will be magically parsed and destroyed. how you came to this conclusion i cannot even guess. you can leave the alliance, create a chat channel and a mailing list called ""alliance replacement"", and tada - you have all communication back, you have everything back. if you don't hold 0.0 aspirations, who cares if you're in a collection of corps with a unified goal and unified communication, or if you're in an alliance? you are not being excluded from fw, you are excluding yourselves from fw. an alliance, especially in your case, is just a name. why not just shelve it, do the 45 minutes of work to have every ceo set blues/reds and send out corp mails, and be done with it. you don't even have to talk to the militiamen if you don't want to, just set blink off and do your own thing. your ts doesn't change, your killboard doesn't change, your chat channels do change (in name only), and your blues/reds list takes a little bit longer to update. you can even continue complaining that you think alliances should be able to join fw, the only difference is that while you're moaning you can actually be doing something. the point is: if you actually feel strongly about it, then you shouldn't care about the little bit of extra work that would go into it. it's sure as **** a lot easier than getting every corp to jack their standings up, which you all seem to be more than willing to do. you are the only ones keeping yourselves from doing this - understand that.and when history looks back and wonders why, for a few months your member corps were not in the uk alliance, you can just tell them that you had to work around the game mechanics. you know, like when alliances didn't exist."
9/22/2008,"your logic is fallacious. keeping alliances out of fw doesn't necessarily keep capitals and poses out of fw, that is correct. however, if you allow an alliance to maintain a 0.0 presence and an fw presence, you increase the likelihood that the entity in question will drag more poses and capital ships into the equation. why? because they can afford to."
9/22/2008,"and when ccp do not allow alliances in? then the ushra'khan, the identity, the history, all of that, is done. it no longer exists.if there are no alliances waiting to be allowed in then there no longer exists the reason for the change. and it won't happen.the alliance means far more to us than a chat channel or the conenvience of simplified standings management. it is an entity that means more to many of us than our own corps. i am now in my third corporation with the same alliance, the previous two underwent mergers and each time we have improved on what went before. but the alliance remains constant. you may not have had the same experiences that i have had, but for us the importance our alliance goes far beyond game mechanics."
9/22/2008,"before alliances even mechanically existed in eve, they were just a group of people who acted in unison and followed the same ideals. maybe i'm wrong, but ushra'khan still existed and fought against cva. i remember a time when you two were sick and tired of having to pay war fees and pushed hard for a ""mutual war"" option. guess what? it happened, but in the meantime you kept on paying the bills and fighting the good fight.you argue that if you aren't in an alliance the history of your corp and all your accomplishments are gone. that is a stupid argument, and it's wrong. case in point: pie. they leave cva to pursue fw, do you think anybody has forgotten everything they've done? are they now more anonymous than they were before? i think not. they look at them as a corp who wanted to fw so much that they left their alliance.if you want to play this sad song that leaving the alliance destroys its history, then you're free to - but if you want to convince people it's true, you're going to find that nobody is going to sing along with you."
9/22/2008,"it is not griefing, it is called piracy silly.it is for your protection, as a decent pirate will whoop your ass even 5 to 1 and/or still take all your ore, etc. but alas, if you really want this to happen, if you belong to something besides a npc corporation, your corpmates can respond to acts of agression fyi."
9/22/2008,im a firm believer in any acts of theft or piracy should grant kill rights to the fleet for as long as your a member of that fleet... and definitely the corp.not a bloody 15 minute timer.they have it waaaay to easy.... we want to fight back just as much as they want to pirate.i don't have a problem with someone attempting to gank or pirate...so long as we get our chance for blood for more than a paltry 15 minutes...how about 24 hours.: o p

9/22/2008,"so what you're saying is that low-friction nozzle joints and inertial stabilizers have a role in this game? any ship above an ibis has more than enough low/rig slots to fit both stabs and istabs, you do not need to merge the two."
9/22/2008,"so, wait, you want your miner ships to not be able to target anything so they can't mine? nice.also, this is lame. blockade runners have +2 warp core strength, and miners are weak. it's the way of the game."
9/22/2008,"it actually ranges from 0.75 au/sec(freighters) to 13.5 au/sec(speed interceptors). and most of the problem comes with accel/decel times - for a 20 au warp, even in a 3 au/sec battleship, you spend about 3/4 of your time at far less than 3 au/sec. it's only really for capitals and freighters that warp speed really matters outside of the biggest systems."
9/22/2008,"no, the increase in interceptors warp speeds would be ******ed. your doubling the warp speeds, so your ok with inties warping at 27 au?isn't eve small enough? why shrink it more.i'm not sure why this is even an issue for you, most systems, short of a freighter, are covered in 30 seconds or less...30 seconds. i know its a pain to have that much of your life sucked away, but here's hoping you can deal with it"
9/22/2008,"thank you for clarifying herschel yamamoto, i was unaware that warp drives differed in speed. honestly its not something i pay attention to. i still would think that a fine tuning of eve warp drives might need to be addressed.as for you, your mastery of argument has one me over. let me look at your wonderful augment again1. my idea is ******ed2. therefore i want to increase int warp speeds to twice the normal speeds, which would mean that they would arrive a whole second less, so therefore my idea is stupid3. its only 30 secondsway to argue cicero. so, i should waste 15 secs every time i warp for the next 3 years, warping 25 times a day. that is 45 minutes i'm wasting a week in eve. that's 20 hours wasted if i played every other day of the year. 10 of those hours could be saved, if only ccp spends a few hours changing a few statistics to balance out the speeds.and now i should worry that that interceptor is going to make the jump in 4 secs instead of 5? that the extra second could have some importance in a pvp skirmish? that we should only care about the 1 out of every 1000 jumps are going to a pvp engagement? yeah, genius."
9/22/2008,i see no harm in increasing warp speeds
9/22/2008,"bad idea; makes it nearly impossible to respond to raiding parties as they can get in and out too fast for a response force to gather (better raiding groups can already get in and out too fast, if this changed so everyone could do it, they lose a hard-earned advantage, and soon nerf whines would be heard).it also damages immersion by losing the sense of great distances travelled."
9/22/2008,if your going to find a way to kick in a higher warp drive speed... id rather go for the mid level slot mod or something....that way you wont mess up the balances...at the price of a slot.
9/22/2008,"i'd rather the accel time be dependent on the warp speed. so freighters take a while to accel, but ceptors get up to speed much more quickly than is currently done. differentiate the ships more so that warp speed actually makes a big difference."
9/22/2008,"oh yes, i wouldn't mind seeing a similar filter system like the market either. i never want to see contracts over 35,000m3, i never want to see contracts in low sec according to my autopilot. i never want to see contracts over 20 jumps.courier contracts should have their very own tab in the contracts screen, a majority of contracts searches used for purchasing items is never going to fit couriers.give it a tab by itself, have filter and search options."
9/22/2008,"i've seen some members of the csm mention the lack of a private forum for them to discuss ideas and organise discussion. assuming this still does not exist, i would like to offer the csm a vbulletin forum free of charge for the exclusive use of it's members. i would also like to offer independent moderator services for the csm to ensure topic discussion is not clogged down with off topic posts.the forum itself would be 100% secure and all efforts to maintain security, privacy, confidentiality and most importantly impartiality measures would be taken to ensure piece of mind of the csm."

9/22/2008,"space blingfinally figured out how those pesky empires have such good faction loot. while capsuleers have to scrounge around for meteorites and moon garbage, they have access to the minerals and gases available on planetary settlements. in losec, these planets are unavailable as the empires insist on making people run missions in cnr's for hours on end.with the introduction of the modular, self-constructing planetary production egg, it becomes possible to obtain these same materials and, with the properly invented blueprint (from specialized research facility) to produce faction level gear...with a catch.every alliance has their own specific modules that can only be fitted if you are in alliance. before you go off on the no! database!!!one!!! rant, here's how it would work: no actual modules are introduced. just ""pointer modules"" to high-meta gear. the database only sees one version of every potential high-meta product just like now. to pilots, they see ""hydra alliance warp core stabilizer"" and it has a special stat that is the alliance ticker. to fit the dummy mod, you have to have the same alliance ticker (be in that alliance...duh). these faction level items will only be available in somewhat limited quantities and, to be honest, aren't particularly magnificent compared to t2 gear, but will contribute a great deal to alliance ""loot factor."" once the research facility is started, low-meta blueprints become available. with invention over time, higher and higher meta's are produced on the modules, but they also require more and more planetary production goods to actually manufacture.there ya have it. cool space bling that seems really uber, but won't f*@& up the markets for faction gear or set 0.0 alliances unduly ahead of the rest of the game."

9/22/2008,"i like how you put representatives in quotes as if they're not... they are whether you like it or not. you have the power to remove them in the next cycle, but whether you like them and their actions or not they do, indeed represent you.as far as not liking how they act in public that is certainly your purview, however i don't see how that has any bearing on their accomplishments.it's a forum. if you don't like the posts don't read them. if you don't like the candidates don't vote for them. bickering about them repeatedly and waving your hands just turns into sour grapes after a while.i'll also note that lumping ""all the representatives"" in there is unfair and fallacious. most of the csm seems to get on just fine most of the time."
9/22/2008,"try all you like but you don't 'represent' the majority of the 'people' when only 5% (or there abouts) of the people in total actually voted. if they put the same energy into actually looking at the real issues and not just what affects there gameplay style only on the same scale to which they have *****ed, moaned, backstabbed etc... and tried to re-define the csm as a whole, then perhaps fewer of the people who actually bothered to vote last time would not feel completely let down and never bother to vote for this nonesense again."
9/22/2008,"they had their opportunity to participate and they chose not to, therefore their representatives are not whom they may necessarily have chosen, but like it or not they are indeed their representatives. nothing you say or post will change that, nor will any degree of bitter footstomping.to the contrary i expect a much better voter turnout the next cycle and only time will prove me right or wrong. also, if you have a problem with your representative you should take it up with them. nobody's going to pity you simply because your pet issue hasn't yet been covered.to be frank, in your entire post all i see is sour grapes that has very little meat regarding the actual functioning of the csm. the csm had to do some definition because it wasn't provided with any. the next csm will do the same. instead of crying i'd recommend you mobilize and do something about ensuring it lives up to your standards."
9/22/2008,"i utterly despise this argument. as long as you had the right to vote and the ability to do so practically, a decision not to vote is an abdication of responsibility - you are accepting the results that the rest of the electorate chooses to give you. there is truth in the old maxim of ""if you didn't vote, you can't complain"". or, if you prefer rush, ""if you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice""."

9/22/2008,"first off, i'm glad to see something happening here. secondly, due to the immense amount of time since the last meeting, i'll make up a list of threads started after early august that have at least 10 votes and that aren't already dealt with, to help the csm members choose issues that they want to bring forward - i don't want to see worthy threads get lost in the shuffle. the number is their current vote total. this list obviously isn't definitive, but hopefully it helps. probes losing ownership 12ankhs crazy 0.0 ideas 22track who accepts a character to a corp 16new crossfaction battleships 14insurance expiration notices 14friendly militia on overview 12ship fitting made easy 42colour-coded fleet chat 24profanity filters 20lack of focus in fw 15insecure station container 12ccp should fix bugs 10ankh's mission running topic 36thumbs down on ah 12improved overview sorting 24salvage drones 18personal wallet divisions 44broken overviews 10neural network 290.0 overhaul 10risk/reward of empire 74free slaves 35event tools 14capital clone bay 50rat avoidance 16pirate faction standings recovery 14(continued...damned character limits...)"

9/22/2008,"i'm pretty sure my sarcasm detector is making beeping noises at the moment so forgive me if it needs a mechanic individual bugs and small technical issues aren't something that i think should be brought up in the meetings; by that i mean if we had a discussion about every single one (and there's hundreds) the meetings would go on for hours and hours over what they should.so no change there, i guess no, what i intend is to bring bugs and errors into the light and to make it transparent. the known issues page for example, has stuff on there dating back years - what my role would entail is communicating with the devs and programmers, keeping a tab on some of the more sensible ""how to fix lag"" issues and bring suggestions forward to the devs.basically, it would be like acting as a point of call and a ""go to"" person to discuss and present these issues.during meetings, items and concerns could be brought up and discussed however there isn't really anything on which to debate; a bug is a bug - a graphical error doesn't need a vote or a discussion - it's just that - an error that needs fixing.with that in mind, i can't see how it would delay meetings any more than anything else does with the csm - it's not an issue such as, say, nano-ships where there was a debate on both sides giving forward their arguments and these were discussed at great length.as for the csm being useful; i think this could be an incredibly useful position or an angle from which to campaign; who doesn't want the bugs fixing? it's about the only issue on which nearly every player is in agreement."
9/22/2008,"good luck with your campaign. and you are targeting the ""bugs"" which is one of the universal issues everyone deals with from time to time. however, if you would recall the result of the meeting with ccp, it was considered niggling and not what they are looking for from the csm."
9/22/2008,"this is also my understanding. i don't think ccp is looking for the csm to report bugs to them. they already have systems in place for that.i do think the bugy nature of eve has been a huge issue for years now, and needs to be seriously addressed. i just don't think the csm is going to be able to do anything about it.you might want to do a little more research as to the nature of this council and what its role is."
9/22/2008,"you are correct. ccp does not want to hear about ""bugs"" as there's already a method for reporting them. giving people the same information via 8 different directions is annoying. the same goes for ""lag"". they know."
9/23/2008,"now thats what i call a pos, not that stick with some thingy`s around it. (and for implemantations: just convert all the pos`s into the new form, randomly. but offcourse with the modules they put on to it.)"
9/23/2008,i support this. now using an arazu/lachesis is almost laughable ecm was nerfed and specilased ships boosted why did this not happen with rsd's
9/23/2008,bump?
9/23/2008,this would be very nice
9/23/2008,jump freighters should be able to cyno to high sec:
9/23/2008,sounds cool to me.
9/23/2008,"yes please :)i would also like to see colony hubs become mini-stations. the main thing they would have is a cargo hangar. approach within 1.5 km of the service module and you can access your cargo hangar and deposit goods and take things out. the hub's owners could setup buy orders at the hub for things the hub needs and sell orders for things the hub produces.colonies should be able to be tailored a bit on what the produce as well. in addition pos products they produce more of what they need, but not everything. so slotting in a marine training school to your colony would make it produce marines or having your colony be focused on farming to produce wheat for the rest of your colonies. a simplifed version of civilizations cities might work well for a model."
9/23/2008,give some power to the aggressed. any power whatsoever.
9/23/2008,"actually, it is 100% your fault. it's your fault for piling your corp full of unskilled new players who can't compete. if a company irl did that then they would fall to a competitor that had good employees with a diversity in skills and abilities. same as in eve. the current wardec system does not need a rework. if you do, you are shifting the game away from an unrestricted capitalistic society."
9/23/2008,no. the aggressed should have already been prepared for war. hence they are on equal footing already. if they aren't they are weak and deserve to fold/disband.
9/23/2008,"simple, you prepare for all possibilities. you have a pvp/combat wing in your corp and don't focus 100% on mining and industry. if you do focus entirely on industry, then suffer the consequences. it's nonsense that you are defenceless. you only need to recruit players who can fulfil a combat role.the arrogance of some corps who want to compete in industry without being able to defend themselves is astounding."
9/23/2008,omg please can we get a new process to submit alliance logo's!
9/23/2008,support + custom corp logo`s in the future?

9/23/2008,qft.
9/23/2008,"everyone thinks that black ops ships are fixed by a further jump capability or a fuel bay.does no one realize that they are only cloakable, cyno-capable versions of their t2 variants? it's completely stupid to buy one of these ships unless you're just going to haul meaningless crap through low-sec/0.0. look at the sin, is anyone actually going to use a 600mil ship with a **** tank and bad dps as a bloody dominix with a nicer skin? why doesn't it have a dampener or warp disruptor-related bonus like the arazu?the widow, damn that ship can jam, but you're buying a ship that does the same damn job as a falcon and can't even warp cloaked. none in their right minds would actually try and fight with a widow. you can 8-slot tank a scorpion and use it to jam a lot easier, with insurance guarantee. plus you can jump bridge falcons in to do the same job better.the redeemer, energy turret tracking?! you've gotta be kidding me. give it a neutralizer and nos range bonus on top of it's tracking bonus.the panther. lmao lets buy a 600mil ship that is just a ******ed typhoon that goes 25% faster with max skills.i thought csms were supposed to listen to community suggestions? having cyno-capable deep space transports adds an awesome dimension to the game, but it in no way fixes black ops ships. these ships are less logical combat ships than even marauders, because at least those pos ships do massive amounts of dps."
9/23/2008,"have read the first page, don't have time to read the other 3. still, here is my idea, sorry if its been mentioned:-new ship class - tanker.ship would be same hull type as dst, but less slots. it would be modified to be able to jump along with the jump bridge, and would have a large fuel bay. it should be unable to jett' fuel from its cargo, but should be able to ""link"" with a black ops, and by doing so fueling all jumps through that ships bridge, via its own fuel bay.hit points and agility should be similar to a dst, but less pg/cpu and less slots. the reason i don't think they should be able to jett' cans is to avoid them bringing a lot of these ships to haul ammo/pos mods into enemy space, while still allowing it to loot. it should be able to cloak, but not have any bonus to it. its cloaking ability should be just like a normal dst.or, you could just change the dst to be able to jump (as many have suggested) and allow it to link with a black ops."
9/23/2008,get this into your head: these are not frontline ships ... their dps and tank is second to their logistic abilities ... otherqise you would create an overpowered cloaking ship that can jump long ranges ...
9/23/2008,signed
9/23/2008,ill support any and all buffs to black ops.simply speaking they cant get any worse then what they are atm
9/23/2008,"this is easy to demonstrate.-take some period of time (the last 3 months, for example.)-get the logs.-do a couple of searches to look how many people logged in, changed skill and logged off in a period of less than 5 minutes vs. people who logged in, changed skill and stayed longer than 5 minutes.-give us numbers. prove your point with data.because, from what i read and my own experience, a lot of people just log in, change skill and log off. and a lot of people lose time because the skill training ends while at work, or while sleeping, or similar obnoxious situations (a group of short skills are the hardest to train if you can only connect at a limited timeframe.)so, if we are a minority, and this is not a problem for most of the player, at least some data to prove it would make the situation more bearable to us."
9/23/2008,"so, you're flying your uber bs towards the gate, having bravely fended of hordes of attacking pirates, then limping the final kilometer, you make it just to jumping distance....then, a tiny ship flying at 8000 m/s 'bumps' your kilometer long battleship out of range to jump...um excuse me, wheres the significant but not deadly explosion as the interceptor crashes into your huge superstructure? this game mechanic is not only a much abused tactic but is ridiculously unrealistic (and yes i know this is an internet spaceship game), and you can say ""oh its collision detection stuff onboard your ship"" but lets be honest, the tactic is too powerful and much abused.i think the actual result should be the smaller ship ""bouncing off"" the larger ship. i see that having actual collisions could be very difficult so this i feel is the sensible result.the smaller ships collision detection bumps it away from the larger ship. the larger ship is no affected. simple. the only difficulty may be when ships of the same size are bumped.or it could be that you are not bounced, merely stopped at a distance from the ship you 'hit'."
9/23/2008,"bumping is stupid, ccp really need to work on it."
9/23/2008,the ships must be equipped with repulsorlift coils.//end star wars reference
9/23/2008,"end the need for bumping and you eliminate bumping. currently there are so many mechanics in place to avoid pvp it all gets a little boring. (ie redocking, re-approaching gate and jumping out, about to get worse with web nerf.)"
9/23/2008,"i think someone is compensating for the lack of bumper cars in their youth. yes bumping is lame as all hell. collision damage now and let the small ships worry about staying out of the way of the bigger ones.it goes without saying that the docking game needs to get sorted, it's on the 5+ year short order list."
9/23/2008,damn the torpedos!ramming speed!*frigate smacks into destroyer killing both in a glory of explosive pwm4g3*that would change alot of things...but before you go off on the bumping thing..did you bother to take into account undocking at a busy station with ships stacked on top of each other?oops.. didn't think about that did yah.might wana fix that first..and then some...before you visit this problem.
9/23/2008,"proposal for jita 4-4? also, its been explained several times before. you are not being bumped, your ship is re-aligning itself to avoid collision. this game mechanic is working as intended."
9/23/2008,"if my ship can re-align at that speed to avoid a collision, why can't it align at the same speed for entering warp?"
9/23/2008,"no, didnt think about the busy undocking thing, but thats fine anyway, they just stack up, no one bounces about like a tom and jerry version of space combat!im not saying do collision damage, just get rid of the ability to 'bump' ships around, it is only a valid tactic because it has always been in the game. if it wasnt then another tactic would be used, maybe people would actually use 'tactics' instead of dumb as hell game mechanics.sorry, but i just dont see how a little frigate could possibly make a battleship/dread/freighter spin around and be bumped away by ramming it.if it is supposed to be collision detection, then the ramming ship should be the one stopped/moved not the target of the ramming. or, like i said, the bigger ship is unmoved. so yes, a big ship could ram a smaller ship aside, but how many times do you see a bs fly at you at 14000 m/s?it gets a little boring hearing people moan about unfair/unrealistic tactics being removed from the game.this is a game, but in the scheme of things it is supposed to be quite realistic feeling environment, and bumping is probably the single most unrealistic factor in eve. and no, ive never been ganked by being bumped so im not just moaning, the only time ive ever had it done to me i was in an ares and just flew back to the gate and jumped anyway... im addressing it purely because it dumb."
9/23/2008,bumping has already been nerfed so that smaller ships cant really bump bigger ships as well as in the past. also there is warp to 0 so no need to slow boat to a gate so the scenario you offer is flawed unless you took the risk to ap through a hostile area in which you were given a popup asking if you want to proceed into said dangerous area. so in the either case warping through or jumping into a dangerous place does require consequence. - ds /me hugs
9/23/2008,emergency-only uses? you're totally arguing for something that is easily defended by role play reasons
9/23/2008,"bumping and the consequential ""realignment"" should simply take the mass of the bumping objects into consideration. divide mass by the speed of it and you get the power of impact applied to the mass. an interceptor bumping a battleship should go bouncing way off that way while the bs's navigation system still calculates what caused its ten meters deviation.since it is the way it is now, it's also a valid tactics, too. no need to not think about improvements, though .supported."
9/23/2008,"your tank is failing, why can't it emergency re-a;ign then?, maybe the ship blowing up isn't an emergency?you can't say one thing but ignore the other ""role play"" reasons, now i hate role playing, but if you can get a bs to move at stupid speeds and say it ""oh you havn't been hit, your just moving out the way"" and with that move take no damage nor use cap when why can't i under the same ""idea"" have my ship move at that speed for other emergency reasons?i'm not saying that your wrong, i'm saying teh game mechanic is stupid and needs looking at."
9/23/2008,"proposal: let jump freighters jump back to high sec from low sec. why does one have to risk a 4 billion isk ship that is not capable of fitting a tank?offcourse you can drag all your corp mates to the high sec border system for some defense so you can jump back to high sec using tha t gate. i think jf's should be able to jump back to high sec using a jf cyno similar to the covert ops cyno gen. or use the same one but then being able to create a cyno in high sec. there are game mechanics and restrictions, i know. but still, isnt this not something that could be taken into consideration?"
9/23/2008,/signed
9/23/2008,agreed this needs to be done
9/23/2008,i'd like this too.
9/23/2008,"of course, this would be very handy to have.but we have to consider if this isn't going to make it overpowered. are you guys open to the thought of there being a considerable cost involved in this, maybe even a standing requirement on behalf of the corporation/pilot?"
9/23/2008,that last part would be out of the question. you should just be able to open the cyno for the jf. no messing with standing requirements on behalf of corp/pilots. out of the question.
9/23/2008,"if you can't anchor a pos in high-sec without standings, then why should the empires even dare letting you open any kind of cyno in their areas of space?what about f there was a jumping delay? you would be stuck for x minutes(decreased with skills) before you arrive in high-sec, in which people can attack you and disrupt the jump process?it should not be a risk-free thing to do."
9/23/2008,"also no mate. if a ship has no slots to fit something of a tank then you should just be able to jump without;-standing requirements-jumping delay.if you do want something of that, then give jump freighters a 1/1/1 slot layout!"
9/23/2008,"but you are assuming now that a jf is not supposed to be having any kind of backup whenever it's jumping around.that isn't right, is it? i mean, it would benefit me hugely if i could just jump right into high-sec. but i doubt ccp agrees that it would be nice, from a risk vs. reward point of view.there has to be some kind of compromise if this is to happen. there's also a reason that a jf can use gates."
9/23/2008,"i still say that in the low sec system where it will jump from to high sec will be mostly a system where your corp mates are based. so a pos or hq over there, this makes it allready a different situation. in case of some other low/null sec system where you dont have a pos or hq you should bring corpmates to defend your jf as well, so it can safely jump to high sec.you are assuming ccp will decline this proposal without a hassle, i mean; we havent even heard an answer of ccp what they think of it. but i agree with you there should be something of a compromise.otherwise i propose this:a pilot should jump in an instant to a high sec cyno..but:1. the jump from low to high sec demands more fuel to make it happen.2. a jump freighter should not be able to make a jump to high sec from out of null sec. only 0.1 - 0.4 sec. systems. something like this?"
9/23/2008,"we are getting much closer indeed.how about a consumption of empire charters as well, just like it takes to run a pos in high-sec? that means there's a slightly higher barrier to entry in high-sec but it's less time consuming in the end."
9/23/2008,"that would be agreed upon;-a jf is allready a ship that requires to have some isk in your wallet, by that i mean isotopes and creating cyno's etc..-using empire charters with liquid ozone to create a cyno in high sec would be a good combo. also something good for the mission runners to buy the charters from the lp store if you agree to this we might have a great understanding mate"
9/23/2008,"big no on this. this would allow jfs to move about high sec using cynos. this would make eve a terribly small place as goods can move freely between regions in an instant. 0.0 space is very spread out, that is why jump drives are needed, most of high sec is packed into a small area (at least ly wise).if you fly a jf correctly, i don't see how you can possibly die. jump to low sec -> dock/pos up then warp to high sec gate. in high sec -> scout gate then jump through and cyno away."
9/23/2008,i agree.
9/23/2008,as i read this you dont know you can jump from out of high sec to low sec. ccp could build in a restriction of not being able to jump from high sec to high sec. my point is to be able to jump from low into high sec. nothing more. period.
9/23/2008,great
9/23/2008,"and you dont know that under your idea you can jump from high sec -> low sec -> high sec which would be fairly similar to high sec-> high sec without too much trouble (one more hop)jfs are meant for low-sec and 0.0 sec transporting. they are not meant to do any sort of moving in high sec space. transport ships are meant to be slow, making an instantaneous huge cargo space ship in high sec space would be very broken."
9/23/2008,ok you got a point on putting restrictions of high-low-high jumps. for example; the high sec system after the low system should be the same as the first high sec system you left from. and im pretty sure i didnt mention i was or was not happy with the current speed of freighters/jump freighters.
9/23/2008,a very big no.why in the world should a jump freighter be perfectly safe just cause it cost a lot of isk and cant fit a tank.if those two things are such a big problem for ppl then the simple option for you is to not fly it.
9/23/2008,why not. its the whole idea of creating an entire new concept within eve..i think that if such a ship is meant for low/null sec and is not able to fit a tank it should be compensated/balanced.
9/23/2008,"the issue is that you're asking for the elimination of the single biggest risk in flying a jump freighter. all ships should have a counter. i mean if my viator had +infinite wcs instead of +1, it's be great for me - i could fly it pretty much invulnerably anywhere. fantastic. also insanely overpowered. and that can only more 3750m^3 at once - your jump freighter can already cyno from pos to pos in virtually perfect safety, carrying a vastly larger cargo.it's as if you're asking for battleships to be as agile as frigates: great for battleships, leaves no niche for frigates.can you provide any justification for your request for a very significant buff for your ship class other than that you'd really like it?"
9/23/2008,"its like flying an unfitted bs into a lvl 4 mission. pointless.jf's/freighters are also point of subject in high sec with gankers. you should see when im flying my jf from jita the constant locking and cargo scanning :p, 10 torp ravens and its gone. why not give a ship with no slots a little adventage?"
9/23/2008,"they already have an advantage, they can jump to cynosif its as pointless as you say, why use it? why do ppl even bother flying such a ship?you have yet to come up with a single valid point for your idea, the only thing you have made clear is that you want a ship that can never be killed"
9/23/2008,why did ccp even brought this ship in the game? please answer this one
9/23/2008,"you're doing this wrong. you're supposed to be giving reasons why this change would benefit eve, not asking us to come up with reasons why that shouldn't happen.and let's face it, this is an utterly pathetic carebear idea, violating current mechanics and removing the minimal risk involved in flying a jf. it would be to the detriment of eve and it's really little more than ""wah wah make my life easier"". you'll be asking for a lowslot to fit a dc next."
9/23/2008,"hey why not quadruple their hit points and give them rig slots as well this is a ridiculous idea i'm sorry, and you should be ashamed for even mentioning it.lets face it, all you're saying here is that you don't want to risk you ship because it ""costs so much"" and you're just scared of losing it stupidly.this thread is now about evanga growing a pair, or going to play hello kitty online (that's the standard insult for people who want their hands held around here isn't it?)"
9/23/2008,"you are on the wrong track here, all im asking is to give the chance for jf pilots to cyno right back to high sec under certain conditions. or to give this ship some sort of a tank. so either cyno to high sec or to give this ship a slot layout of -/1/1 or -/-/1.this is not a question to make my life easier, just an idea what would ccp think about it and to take something similar into consideration. so quit the yabbering of ""this is an utterly pathetic carebear idea"" .. go back to your anti-nano nerf thread."
9/23/2008,"with the nature of these ships being mainly to get things in and out of 0.0 a certain level of risk should be associated with it.being able to jump from highsec and back to high sec removes too much of the risk.if you can afford a 4bil ship, and have enough people to control some 0.0 space then you should be able to secure a low sec system long enough to dock or jump(through a gate) your jf out."
9/23/2008,"the op makes no sense anyway. the current risk is minimal - you don't need to secure the system or gate at all. just cyno in next to a station, then warp to the gate at zero and jump. if you're not paying attention, then you might drop out of warp in the gate and bump away, than get tackled before you can jump or warp - but in that case you deserve everything you get.i think the op really wants to jump between highsec systems, thereby utterly removing any risk associated with suicide-ganking (not that there is much with the new mechanics) and wardecs (likewise with npc corps).mind you, if this really isn't anything to do with just making the op's life easier and safer with no drawbacks, then i'm sure he'd still support his current proposal if it was accompanied by a 90% cut in the jf's cargohold."
9/23/2008,"you also could have just give a comment how you should fly that ship back to high sec instead of giving these retarted comments.nevermind this topic please, for it could have been locked after the last comment of the csm.....so please do lock it."
9/23/2008,"the op might have a carebear wish but its interesting to see where its going.cynoing into high-sec is prohibited because of having caps in high-sec isn't allowed by the main factions. (and you don't want to have moms camping high-sec gates either, although having them concordenned would be funneh.)freighters and jump freighters can happily dwell in high-sec. besides they don't require the capital ships skill so even though they are capital ship size they aren't real capital ships. and they are not offensive because of lack of slots.if you have a jf cynoing into low-sec or 0.0 it still is risky because they might get ganked, bumped etc.so when a jf wants to travel back it still have to cyno to a low-sec system 1 jump from high-sec and run a 2nd chance of getting ganked.still its impossible to light cynos in high-sec because of the capital ships. you then should either need a special cyno generator (civilian?) or a pos module version that only allows jf. the module doesn't have any disadvantages. the pos module version requires a (deccable) corp with standing. besides setting up a pos just for jumping requires some logistical planning. you even could have a mini profession by setting up jf cyno posses.then my mind wanders off and starts wondering about jf cyno bridges all over high-sec but that would be just plain wrong since it would allow entities to move large quantities of supplies to move through empire very fast. so high-sec to high-sec cynoing is baaaad.yet it still seems to be overpowered but who knows when everyone owns a jf the whining for this possibility makes ccp give in to these people and give them the option to cyno back to high-sec."
9/23/2008,"op is closely akin to ""i want my ship to be able to safely move, even if i am solo""...sorry, but this is a resounding ****ing no...stop with this ""my ship isnt safe"" ****"
9/23/2008,not supported unless i can jump my dread into highsec. oh and **** and pillage pos's with it
9/23/2008,"i have a jump freighter, and i don't want this. i have +9 caldari standing too, so i'd still get to use it under ""compromise"" being floated here too, and i still don't want it.logistics shouldn't be risk free, and freighter logistics shouldn't be a solo activity. you should need an escort, and you should run a considerable risk if you don't have one.one of the reasons that we have the state of affairs in 0.0 that we do today, with cap fleets in the hundreds and unplayable blob warfare is because logistics are too quick and easy and too invulnerable to attack.if you can't afford to risk a 4b isk ship, don't use one, or at least don't try to use one solo. it's the same for flying any ship in the game. the price tag on these ought to be a clue that they aren't meant to be used, and risked, by individuals.this is an mmo, folks, not a single player game. one of the things that ruins mmos as they age is constant demands that things be made easier to do solo that get listened to by the publisher. not supported"
9/23/2008,"im a firm beliver that rats should shoot you regardless. they help ccp detect macro accounts. besides, for you non carebares out there, rats are the only sort of excitment when it coems to mining, lets not make mining more boring shall we?edit:on a related note, it would be awsome to buy standings from npc lp markets"
9/23/2008,"i was going to start another thread but this one seems the logical place to talk about the issue i believe the base problem here is that falcons are running around totally permi jamming entire fleets iv been in a lot of fleet fights recently and no fitting iv been able to come up with has been effective at all ,even a scorp w 2 sens booster 2's 2 calderi eccm 2's and 2 backup arrays and rigs ,a huge gimp on fittng btw and still permi jammed by 1 falcon rediculas. i propose the answer is to set the ecm modules the same as ecm burst modules in that u should be able to have 1 ecm module active at a time period. permi jam with no hope at all is happening because falcons are doing max chance jamming by filling all the mid slots with ecm's and then running them in sequence like 5 seconds apart. this is totally a overpowered situation with chance based ecm that really isent taking into account relative sensor strengths and eccm /backup arrays/ anti jam rigs fitted. tbh i feel that the falcon as the force recon hull that also warps cloaked and everything else is kind of screwed up as well because something that has that kind of ability should not be getting the covert ops bonus's as well with that kind of sensor strength inherent to its hull. a cov ops cloaking ship should have as minimum sensor strength as possable so it isent giving itself away with signal leakage. seerindarkness lfa ceo"
9/23/2008,nope but i also didn't take into account eos link bonuses mindlinks or anything flowery just the base stats. if you fit a countermeasure it should work that's the bottom line for me.
9/23/2008,"and why can't you just all join the same corp and play fw? you don't have any need for 0.0 or sov, so what's the difference?sorry if you answered a question like this already."
9/23/2008,"i very much support the idea here, wishing they would let alliances join in on the faction warfare. cva, pie, uk, em... there's alot of us that wouldn't mind the chance.i'm not overly concerned about this leading to any sudden jumps in cap engagements for simple reasons: a cap fleet is about as mobile as dog droppings, and easy to dodge. during my time in the militia there was constantly a few carriers hanging around a select few stations already, and very rarely did they ever dare enter a fight. cap fights are expensive, and not something you like to risk on a daily basis for something as mundane as fw. there's no profit in it.setting up a cap-camp on a complex, gate or, anywhere is kind of moronic anyway, as you can just say ""fine. sit there."" and go capture another complex instead. there's usually several of them about to pick and choose from. besides... how effective do you think a few caps really are in stopping a swarm of frigates diving into a minor with microwarps engaged? you could be webbed and target painted to kingdom come - and a stupid punisher would still deal more damage than most cap-ships."
9/23/2008,"neither the ushra'khan nor cva were created for the purpose of sov holding. in fact i can't thing of a single rp alliance which started out for that purpose. we were all empire based and the alliances were founded to create a greater sense of community and were about sharing goals. before alliances neither ushra nor cva existed. it was a little before my time but as i recall the facts the amarrian rp scene was dominated by one uber corp, pie. they were the solid core of cva when they formed it as everyone else were dwarfed by pie. for the minmatar, there was a corp called oracle and a bunch of others (amarr will eat itself for example) but no big daddy corps like pie. an alliance offered the minnies a way to build a stronger community and bring together the disparate groups. i think that the lack of a group like this is why the gallente and caldari rp scenes have always been weaker and ill-defined.years later, cva moved into providence to 'reclaim' it for the empire. back when they started to do this it was the only thing they could really do to affect the game world and carry out their rp. fw was a mere pipe dream so there was quite literally nothing you could do in empire space to alter the world. other than the occasional aurora-run event you could blow each other up forever, but you couldn't hit at the empire or republic. there was no end game. the ushra'khan went to providence to oppose this 'amarrian expansion'. we also couldn't do anything to attack the empire directly and 'come for our people' there. so we pursued the slavers. now an awful lot of history has unfolded with the rise and fall unity station in 0.0 but despite doing all of that it was not the reason why we became an alliance. we did it for community, not sovereignty.if you need another example, take electus matari. they have really never left empire, so why be an alliance? scagga mentioned earlier in this thread the ammatar rp alliance set up specifically for fw only to be canned when the mechanics excluded alliances. if their goal was set on fw, why be an alliance? alliances are not just about holding chunks of 0.0, sometimes the community you forge within one is the reason you bring it into existence."
9/23/2008,"if you think it's even possible to manage standings the way you suggest, it's clear that you have no understanding of such matters. we can start with the very simple fact that a corp has limits to numbers of standings far too low to duplicate those of the alliance, and move on to the absolute impossibility of dealing with allied organizations who would now need to set ten standings instead of one. you've never engaged in eve politics if you think this is even possible, let alone 'easy'.and since i've actually tried it the way you described, one of us knows what he's talking about.alliances bring nothing to fw that isn't already there. i find it particularly funny that you use the 'capital ship' argument given that over 10% of your corps kills against the matari militia have been by your carriers. the mega-alliances have been free to apply their capital power against the miltias since day one, and have largely chosen not to. why? they have no reason to want to, and every reason not to.the only alliances that care are those who have been involved in rp since before the first mention of fw by ccp years ago, and who have looked forward to having mechanics for the rp war they fight for just as long. the mechanics don't make it possible to join fw without breaking up the alliance, and the mechanics make it *easy* to allow allied corps into fw."
9/23/2008,bringing 0.0 blob warfare to empire? no thanks...keep it in 0.0 please
9/23/2008,"even when you're making up numbers, you still fail at proving a point. so, the amarr use carriers 10% of the time. this with being filled of corps with no 0.0 space to call their own, and thus a seriously hampered income. allowing alliances with more isk will do what now? that's right, increase the number of capital ships used from the fictitious 10% (probably more like 1% if you cared to look), to the point where capital ships could conceivably be dropped more often against people who a) have fewer skills and can't even pilot a cap ship and b) have much less isk to afford a cap ship. bravo.your other point you say that it is damn near impossible to get people to set standings toward ten corps. oh my, ten?! in my altruism, i'll give you some advice. i take it your alliance has a website. on this website you can create a page, this page will be viewable ingame and will have on it links to all the corporations in the alliance. you can now send this out to you fellow corps who you are currently allied with, and a director can simply click the corp, click the standings tab, and voila! the alliances cannot do this, of course, but still it can be done in less than 2 minutes. if someone doesn't like you enough to push 18 more buttons, then do you really want them as an ally? i really can't believe that you're arguing that this is impossible when, what, six months ago corps couldn't set standings towards alliance and they had to set standings to the individual corps anyways. also, it's not like the gbc or the nc, or even the goons have a ginormous standings list that they have to maintain. no, it's impossible.but what i find especially comical is the last line: finally, we agree! let's quickly go over what an alliances is one more time: a collection of allied corps with a common goal, right? i'm done here, honestly. feel free to argue ad nauseum about this and how hard it is for 10 corps to leave one alliance and join another one and how it would totally destroy your history. i'm not buying it, and when you get down to it you guys don't even seem to be buying it yourselves.maybe one day i'll see you in fw, but much to your dismay i won't be holding my breath."
9/23/2008,"how about a compromise..outposts can be ""razed"" and left to ruin or rebuilt. kind of a extension of the incapacitation but requiring a different more difficult way to repair.if a outpost service was left incapacitated for more then (some set time period) then it would be considered razed. razed services would be unable to be repaired by conventional means and be a semi-permanent incapacitation of the outpost services. enough of the services razed the outpost would eventually be lade to waste unless they were derazed. until then the only thing one could do was dock in the station and access the market.services could be derazed after the outpost has been taken over or the hostiles have been beaten back. razed services would be unable to be repaired by anything less then a new platform designed to repair razed outpost services. the new platform would cost and work like a service upgrade. the cost of repairing multiple razed services and possible attempts to attack the egg holding the platform and or destroying it could prevent services from being derazed.derelict mode?maybe if all services were left razed for a period of time the outpost would turn derelict. when the outpost goes derelict then the assets remaining in the outpost's hangers and on the market could be looted. all jump clones moved or destroyed."
9/23/2008,"the only thing too hard about eliminating 0.0 alliances is the pos warfare associated with said action of removal. 0.0 stations pose no imminent obstacle, sorry jade."
9/23/2008,"let me ammend my original post (of two words).the need is for buffing logistics, making it easier to move minerals from place a to place b.there is no need to change belt compositions, just so that 0.0 corps can get trit easier on their own, in an unbalanced way towards high-sec. same way as high-sec needs the low-sec minerals, same way low-sec should need the massive amounts of high-sec minerals that are produced in high-sec.you have a demand, there is a supply. trade.the bottleneck is at hauling all those minerals back and forth, so address that issue directly."
9/23/2008,"the bottleneck is that killing rats in 0.0 you get isk immediately. from the drops you can recover some juicy faction stuff that can be moved easily to a market.mining ore you need to mine it, refine it and then sell the minerals before you see any isk. even if the rewards were at the same level most people would prefer the first option as it require less work."
9/23/2008,it's not just for mission piracy dude. it's an issue with all fleet aggressions. me and my corporation are all flashy -10s.if we're aggressed one at a time in low-sec by non-flashies (basically all people trying to kill pirates) we either have the choice of running or dying 1 by 1. there's absolutely no way we can help out our corpmates.it's a problem that's impossible to fix for various balance reasons.
9/23/2008,"i think its enough that your corp can help you out, there is alot of scope for abuse here, ie agreement that most people in mission hubs form fleet and kill the hell out of pirates. pirates are enjoying the game how they want to, just like everyone else. and the core of this game is pvp"
9/23/2008,"lol yea i think what you are referring to is called a war dec. then you have all the time in the world to get your ""blood""."
9/23/2008,what does war dec'ing have to do with this discussion?if i was talking about war dec's... i'd bring up war dec's.so either your on drugs... or your trolling.i'll just assume your on drugs.
9/23/2008,"neither actually. i was reffering to your post of wanting more time to get your ""blood"" however to the topic on hand...just becareful what you ask for, this by the way is the same way can flipping started. miners wanted their ""blood"". and they got it."
9/23/2008,so what the op wants is flaggings to transfer in gang?i.e people hiring mercs a-team style on the fly to help out before the flaggin ends?
9/23/2008,"if you can list me a set of reasons why it would be ""bad"" to ask for such a thing.... that is lengthening the amount of aggression time someone has to retaliate.... say enough time to gather up a posse to go after the pirate/can tipper while allowing said pirate/can tipper to continue to do such actions without completely messing up the balance???? be my guest!ps: its nothing personal... i just think you tend to be a bit of a bully at times : o )"
9/23/2008,"well drake if my opposition of your views is some kind of bullying. well then so be it. as for the op in the thread, he is asking for immediate reaction to an aggressive act in which it includes his gang mates. so its an immediate response not 24hrs to russell up some dudes to blob your target. he is directing his proposal to ""gang mates"" not how long the aggression timer is. he asking for kill rights to immediately transfer over to the rest of his mates. so his entire gang can attack the aggressor.now i do believe this can be bad and very abusive in terms of game play. and the pirate in this case will not be on the short end of the stick.what you are asking for is to get enough players together to hunt down the culprit way after the fact the act has happened which has little to do with what the op has proposed really."
9/23/2008,allright.... so instead of 24 hours... 1 hour at most would be at least enough time.as for the pirate getting the short end of the stick... the same coudl be said for the victim can it not?its a 2 way street here... and i always see people pushing one side harder than the other.if your going to be a pirate... then one would suppose there is a consequence for said actions.i also pointed out that you have to be a member of the fleet to even get in...if your not at the time... you won't get anywhere...adding others wouldn't help either....if its a corp mate situation... then they can get in within the 1 hour count down or something to that effect.
9/23/2008,i said the pirate will not be on the short of the stick. the op is asking for members in local to come assist him and by joining his gang and having the rights transferred to the incoming help that was not even apart of the act. and you are asking for the same thing. a mob vigilante so to speak. you want to get players together that was never involved in the first place. you are asking for the ability to essentially war dec a single player by involving a bunch of people that has absolutely nothing in common except the fact they happen to be in local. you want to transfer kill rights to someone that has no reason to participate short of you asking them to.
9/23/2008,"no. if you shield tank, you are usually a dps powerhouse because dmage mods are lows, if you armour tank you probably use more ewar stuff and less dps.just have a good mixed fleet, youll be ok!otherwise we will all just train caldari and have super gank solo ravens."
9/23/2008,bump.we need something like this.anything.incentives (other than killmails) make pewpew fun.
9/23/2008,"not supported. ninja salvaging is a proffesion.if thats what people like to do then its up to you to work a way around it. this game needs to be kept as open to all proffesions as possible.no, im not a ninja salvager."
9/23/2008,meh bored of hearing about all this non issue crap that can be avoided but instead of people avoiding it people whine about it.
9/23/2008,"at the csm-ccp meetings in iceland this idea was bounced around. ccp agreed to look into doing this. i think they should have found out by now. thus, we need some feedback.basically the idea was that if an item in a patch note was proposed by the csm, it should be tagged as such. this will make it more transparent how much influence the csm actually has."
9/23/2008,"yes, i think this is needed"
9/23/2008,an excellent idea. this will help us see if the csm is affecting real change and see if there changes that we like or dislike.
9/23/2008,aye i would really liketo know which stuff was influenced y the csm
9/23/2008,agreed.
9/23/2008,"if they agreed to look into it, why do we need to approve it for review? god i dont think anyone, including the csm reps understand what the csm is really for."
9/23/2008,positive
9/23/2008,update?
9/23/2008,supported. i cannot believe that ccp think this will increase server load because it will encourage people to reload more often. at the moment i reload at any moment after i have fired a charge and think that there will be at least 10 seconds before a re-engagement.
9/23/2008,devs and gm's have 'reload all' option in game
9/23/2008,oh please god yes implement this!
9/23/2008,"simply put the more traffic a system sees over a month the higher the transaction tax and broker's fee should scale.nowhere and no one, especially in a place such as eve where taking advantage of one another is the aim of the game, would pass up the opportunity to make money out of the masses. especially for instance the governor of jita, who seeing the amount of traffic and traders going through his system daily would quickly impose a local sales tax. brokers in jita would undoutadly increase their fee's due to 'increased workload'.in the real world do you really think those big named companies in the major malls pay as much for the floor space as does your local 7-11 in your 300 people village? the ability to have the biggest window display accessable to the largest number of passing traffic costs, and it costs big!in most systems nothing will change, but in systems were traffic (even if it dosn't stop at any of the stations in that system) is heavy the tax should double, and in systems where traffic is overwhelming taxes should quadruple.will this force players to leave jita for cheaper systems .... no that's is not the desired effect. jita is a testement to the success of a player run economy and to the success of the game design. after all there is no reason for people to actually go to jita, the jita trade hub is completely player driven. but it is totally unrealistic, even for a sandbox sci-fi game that there would be a level playing field through out the universe when one system above all others stands out. someone would take advantage, someone would want to be the next jita.will it help spread merchants out to the smaller trade hubs? ... hopefully, and specifically the smaller merchants who run on smaller profit margins and who would want to protect those margins.in conclusion, i would hope this would reduce traffic in the jita system as much as removeing agents from there. what's more i hope it would enable the attitude that jita has become the low sec of economic pvp and that you have to be one of the big boys to go to jita and make the big profits."
9/23/2008,this would **** alot of players off....pooooor babies i say.why?it encourages the market to even out...open's up opportune market shops in other systems...so yeah... i like the idea...its got its own built in balance system.would defiantly decrease the traffic for sure... unless someone can point out a very troublesome setback to this other than omgwthcarebearkbai....ill support it./signed
9/23/2008,agreed
9/23/2008,"very simple problem: it add at least 1 check and information logging to each market transaction. i think it will add lag instead of reducing it when you stat to work on a large scale.if you read the devs comment in the thread about jita ship cap the market is on a different note than the system and ithe node is shared with several other markets. so increasing the number of operations done on the market to decrease the number of people in system incur the risk of freeing (maybe) a bit the solar system while lagging even more the market. edit:i did forgot the other big objection: what tax rate and broker fee you will use for the regional orders? if i can put up a regional buy order at a low cost station and use the station fee it will bypass at least the increased broker fee, if the fee of the station where the selling is done is applied it will make impossible to calculate in advance the actual cost of the items brought."
9/23/2008,"no extra check needed where before the base tax rate was 1% for the month (or whatever the cycle is chosen for the update of traffic) is doubled or quadrupled ... if the traffic in the system alters next month the base rate goes down.if this was a solution to overcrowding in jita i would have named the thread .... jita overcrowding solved! ... like all the other threads that claim that.since no extra operations are done, except one a cycle and then probably that would be done at start-up after dt, your 'robbing peter to pay paul' argument dosn't apply.for regional orders the tax and broker rate use is the tax and broker rate at the system you set the order ... they are after all the tax people and the brokers getting your cash. if you really want to get into the nitty gritty of who's tax juristiction the order falls under then i humbly suggest you are taking the immersion factor a tad too far.edityes i can see now where the problem may lay .... i assumed that the tax and broker rate would be a variable for each station, you assume it is a blanket rate for every station.i guess the argument is futile unless a dev gives us a clue."
9/23/2008,"only one way to help clear jita out turn it into a .4 system ^^, or just allow smart bombs outside of station again. but really i think its an interesting proposal but like everything there are drawbacks. warping around everywhere to pick crap up is a pain. so if this tax thing went through 2 things could happen a.people leave jita and warp a round a bit more to pick up what they need or b. all that happens is stuff cost more isk everywhere as the eve economy is largely based of the ""jita"" average. so what we have is stuff selling for higher in other systems like it does now, there is more behind why that is ex. mission hubs ext.so in my opinion it wouldn't work and the only way for it to change is for someone to take it on themselves to form a new trade hub."
9/23/2008,"almost anything that promotes blobbing is bad, so no."
9/23/2008,"it's about time, do it. also declaring war vs 1 person only costs 1mil isk."
9/23/2008,"maybe your particular problem (you seem to have with someone) could be solved better by being able to wardec single (player) members of npc corps that are older than six or twelve months...this idea will not get any active support, why would you be willing to sacrifice any single newcomer to the eve universe that might ever want to join in?.nay."
9/23/2008,/signed - well not as a command :-)these are long needed ... the amount of mouseclicks in eve is starting to show on my wrists ...
9/23/2008,"maybe you have something more constructive ? instead of just saying ""i dont like so it shouldnt be in the game"""
9/23/2008,"i'm sure this is probably something that has come up and i also realize a full hanger set up for an alliance would require a ton of work with roles whatever if it was done per person.alright what i would like to see in the realm of alliance hangers is just like one hanger were an alliance member can put whatever they want in it to be available to other alliance members. so no roles needed (maybe a role tab for which corps are allowed access). obviously you don't want to dump spendy stuff in there but it would be great to put basic mods, ammo, cap boosters, ext. available for fellow alliance members in areas where there corp may not have a hanger whatever you. - ds"
9/23/2008,still being able to dump out hangar contents to a csv file would be very useful for peops who dont have the time to get involved in the whole api thing.should work the same way as dumping market orders imo.
9/23/2008,"i'm happy to support this to happen, api's are good but you still have to enter them into a program made by someone else.yes you could make one yourself to do it via the api but since the market iirc can do this, why not what you own."
9/23/2008,"well i think we need to rethink the roles of covert op ships in general because either your a scout or just more dps on the 0.0 front. sure you can ""surprise attack"" but that does you no good when planning to take down a pos. if they had a role that would allow them to take guns offline or something to that effect it would be cool. a module that would incapacitate pos guns to bring more battleships to the front lines. along with the ideas proposed to black op ships i think we could see a viable role for force recon/covert op pos attack options.enjia fullblood"
9/23/2008,"the current covert ops are fine. no need to tinker with them. they can already give you the perfect warp in on unsuspecting targets. that alone makes them very useful. they are cheap so if you lose one oh well. it's a ship tailored to scouting, cloaking, and scanning. give them more roles and you just take away from the other specialized t2 frigates."
9/23/2008,op: ccp had you in mind when they made the game. look you can modify your ship to please your own gameplay.hyperspatial velocity optimizer
9/23/2008,"personally i think warp speeds should be slowed down, and the acceleration adjusted so that warp speed actually means something.i mean if you want to see how much of an effect warp speed has in the game, just look at how many hyperspatial velocity rigs are sold. i would be surprised if it wasn't one of the 3 least used rigs in the game."
9/23/2008,"exactly, they are one of the least sold rigs in the game. why? unless we are talking large warps, i.e. 50+au or more, you only save a couple seconds going faster, and most people would rather have a faster cap recharge, or more shields, than a faster warp. this makes the rigs worthless. imho, the heavier the ship, the slower it should warp. the warp speed should be based on the mass of the ship. interceptors should warp their current speed, and it should get slower as you get to a bs, which should be have base warp speed that they currently are. if you use polycarbs or nano's, maybe you warp faster. it would give them a new use after the nanonerf. i mean we're talking physics right, since you know this game takes into consideration real world physics ."
9/23/2008,"after a short experience with courrier contracts, i ended up spending a lot more time making multiple sorts through the list to end up with the desired result.work on this, i expect, won't even take much time to develop."
9/23/2008,"wait, the contracts have a sort function to them right now?? supported"
9/23/2008,supported for me as well.
9/23/2008,is this a still ongoing issue? i must admit my mac client works fine for being in station.i'm interested in hearing what you guys think.
9/23/2008,i don't know ... the linux client won't even install properly for me :-)
9/23/2008,"premium graphics do not work in any of the mac/linux clients. thats one issue. another issue is that the official client is a hopscotch work that installs in ~/.cedega (wtf?), corrupts any cedega you might already have there (i used to have cedega before i went to wine) and also sports significantly and measurable lower performance and less flexibility than corresponding wine client, or of course, the native windows version. so in my eyes, yes, it's still an ongoing issue."
9/23/2008,"reply only forum with a limited number of csm posts would be more like it. as it is, csm's don't have a lot of tools for keeping a topic on the forefront and kind of have to hope that anything they want to focus on sticks on the first try. that leaves them competing with space whales and space hookah bars. something a bit like a ""state of the universe address."" also space whale discussion should be stickied on that forum."

9/23/2008,did i post my idea here yet?just get rid of the advanced learning skills.then replace +5 implants with +10 implants.bam instead of waiting 5 months people will want to log in and make isk to incease their skill progession.too crazy?
9/23/2008,"funny thing a dev himself said it 1st. during the last alliance tournament, he stated that learning skills where the worst mistake eve ever made."
9/23/2008,"and? dev's got caught cheating last year, like there opinion counts for squat these day's, they have the vision of a blind man in a dark room with his head submereged in water."
9/23/2008,"this.and:csm fails as a project. it came to light as a good concept, like so many other concepts that looks good at paper and crap when it comes to practical appliance.it didn't work. i don't buy the crap that it didn't work because it was x or y players there doing all the wrong stuff. csm will never work because it's proven to be totaly worthless for what it was created and brings the worst on people. the ammount of pressure and judgement that those players have to endure to copy and paste a few forum posts so devs can't bother to take a few minutes of their days to look at, it's just appaling. when the community have something to say, they say it. things didn't change and won't change because csm exists. when devs wants to act prompty regarding an issue, they will, independent of csm taking their times to be wasted in countless meetings and enduring players harrassement here. dissolve csm, brush it under the carpet as one of many failed concepts everywhere and that is all it takes to move on. players will get back to be players defending their own agendas, discussions, etc, and issues will continue to be spoken between player base and ccp as they always were."
9/23/2008,"i utterly despise this arguement, to assume people paid any attention to the forums or the in-game news is laughable. the actual majority just log on and play the damm game and i'd wager most won't even know what a csm is if you asked. let's face it, with the exception of maybe the factional warfare downtime, the in-games news is mostly junk and is worthy of being ignored (un-ended stories, biased news, same old same old).the csm represent nothing more than the forum *****s, and the forums are definately not what they used to be, if i didn't have nostalgic memories of the community in 2004 and joined in 2008 and took at the sheer amount of ****e here now, well, i would not of bothered voting either."

9/23/2008,please give my bhaalgorn some loving.. a nice 125 drone bay at least as its sister ship has a comperable sized bay.
9/23/2008,i can't support that. the bhaalgorn has already proven to be a pretty win ship if proven right.
9/23/2008,"whilst i too remember the glory days of the bhaalgorn back in the early alliance tournaments i think its fair to say that its a substandard ship today. reasons are twofold: the nos re balancing did hurt the bhaalgorn's capabilities (since it could no longer run the uber suck-powered tanks) and the introduction of minmatar recons have very much put its extended web-range bonus into the shade. so it remains now primary a faction version of a 'geddon without damage/rof bonused guns and 3/5ths of the drone bay.compare with the vindicator (megathron)vindicator maintains its 125 drone bay. compare with rattlesnake (raven)rattlesnake maintains its 75 drone bay.compare with macherial (tempest) mach maintains its 75 drone bay. now you could argue its not a straight comparison of that sort and say its a special kind of ship with combat utility bonus - but as i pointed out earlier - but the web and nos/neut bonus environment has changed considerably since the bhalgorn's heyday - and with curse/rapiers/hugins simply doing it better - it has a problem. on balance i'm going to agree that the bhaalgorn should have the same-sized drone bay as the armageddon because i honestly can't see why it doesn't already. the other pseudo/pirate versions of faction battleships do not lose drone capability - not sure why he bhaalgorn does. only thing i can can think of is that way back when the nos were at full power it was considered that a full rack of heavy drones + nos + tank was ""too powerful"" - but since these are unbonused drones and since nos alone can no longer flatline cap and since frankly a tech1 bs (dominix does it so much better anways) i can't see a decent argument for keeping the bhaalgorn drone bay gimped. as an aside, i know this kind of ship balancing ""issue"" is not popular with the csm as a whole - but you know, eve is a game about spaceships at the core of things and i'm not sure we should be so dismissive. there are many unloved ships in the game and re-addressing the stinkers from time to time does keep the game environment fresh. hell, the nightmare used to be be pretty horrible and now its amazing - i don't think we should be afraid of submitting a general list of tweaks and balances to specific ships if we're convinced by the arguments."
9/23/2008,this is actully dead on. i remember the days when i would fly an ashimmu with 3 medium armor reps running forever while webbing out of web range.those were indeed the days. so while i never flew the battleship sized blood raider ship i agree wholeheartly with a simple dronebay increase.
9/23/2008,"dunno if someone said this, but eve is kinda like real life.what do most people do for the first 15-17 years of their life? do i hear someone say school? if they want something easy, something that requires no skill and absolutely 0 planning? to this is say go play wow!(world of warcraft for those that dont know)with eve, as with everything you do in real life, requires some thought, some planning. why is this concept such a shock to everyone?"

9/24/2008,"tbh, this can be done with pre-existing assets already ingame. you can place a pos tower that acts as the orbiting hub for the colony on the planet, and set it up like any other pos tower, sans the moon mining.of course, it wont have the same stats as a pos tower in this case, but of a converted one to act as an orbiting hub, which needs said storage (i can see moon min storage being used here) for the outputs from the colony.very supported. its already a huge pain in the ass to maintain poses as-is, and very little incentive to set up constellation sov cept to get those cyno jammers up."

9/24/2008,i think current bumping mechaniks suks.
9/24/2008,"many a battle is fought at a gate or station, not talking about autopiloting through dangerous ares, thats just stupid.im not talking about collision damage, with the (complete lack of) ship control in eve, that wouldnt work, i'm talking about the completely ridiculous tactic of ramming ships in order to hold them at a position where they can not escape.there are many ways to do this legitimatly with mods/bubbles etc so there is no valid reason for this to be a required tactic, it is more like an exploit of game mechanics and as i said its so far from realistic that it does take away alot of the realistic feel the game should have.collision detection would not make a bs turn away from its destination due to a frigate ramming it from the side..., the colision detection system would stop the frigate from reaching the bs. simple and obvious.the only people who support this as a tactic are people who use it because they cant otherwise stop a ship escaping.i never complain about losing a ship in a fight, fair or not, but i'd be pretty ****ed if i lost a billion isk ship because a frigate kept knocking me out of alignment and a bunch of incompetent pirates managed to kill me even though they had no scram/bubble/web or firepower to do so without this silly game mechanic.not that i have any billion isk ships."
9/24/2008,supported
9/24/2008,"as an inty pilot myself my first nature would be to disagree with this topic but for the reasons listed bumping is not realistic.. if there was a collision detection the computer would therefore be unable to set a course into another ship thus changing the course to stay the heck away from larger objects.seriously both ships should be taking damage if they attempt to ram at speeds greater than 1k/s seems logical. or have a skill that's needed to override the computer to allow ""bumping"""

9/24/2008,"you said you were jammed for 2 minutes at a time, that being 6 ecm cycles. 0.494^6 = 0.0145 = 1.45%. (my original numbers were assuming a fully optimized falcon, including 7 racial jammers, but 10 second ecm cycles - i'm a gallente pilot, and apparently my memory of cycle times on modules i don't use is worse than i thought). in any case, even with correct numbers, getting jammed for 2 minutes at a time, reliably, happens a vanishingly small percentage of the time. now, you won't get a lock all that often - as you say, lock times do not help - but you're not jammed wholly out of the fight the way you imply. also, you're fighting a ship that costs as much as yours and requires as much skill as yours, it should probably be able to stand in combat with yours as well. even after the jamming, you're doing as much dps as he is, if not more, with a far bigger hp buffer - if you can keep the scram on, he will just die. of course, you can't do so solo very often(though him missing two consecutive jam cycles looks a lot like it at times), which is his whole defence, but if the odds go against him you can clean up pretty easily, and even if the odds are in his favour you should be able to drive him off most of the time. it depends on speeds and ranges and fittings, of course, but assuming close-in combat with close-in ships, the eccm-fit battleship will generally survive, sometimes even bagging the kill. against a ship of equal cost, skill, and power, with no ""terrain"" advantages, you win most fights if you fit the countermeasure to his setup. this is a problem?"

9/24/2008,"recently, i was buying a ship. (i had sorted the market by distance) one price seemed ok, but when i tried to buy it, it said i did not have enough money. ony then, did i realize that i had fallen for the old ""move the decimal point 3 orders of magnitude"" trick.but when i looked at the market window, the price seemed about right. it was only when i looked very carefully, i realized what seemed to be a period was actually a comma and that the price column had clipped off the last three numbers (ie. 00.0).by looking at the market window, there was no reasonable way that i could have spotted that the price was wildly off.i propose that any prices that can't be fully rendered in the column, be rendered as stars (i.e. ***,***.**, etc)that would tell the buyer that they need to expand the price column to see the full price. this will avoid the market window telling you lies.the ui as it is now, encourages market scamming."

9/24/2008,wouldn't be needed if ores were redone to have higher quality of the same roids in lower sec status which also fixes several other problems.
9/24/2008,high end ores should not be available at all in high sec no.
9/24/2008,"well, low sec is not the problem and i'm not scared of it. though mining in low sec is stupid. i went there once cause i scanned down a small gneiss/ochre site in a 0.2 system. jc without imps, covetor with t1 fit and insurance. i made it the 3 jumps trough low without a scout (fitted cloaking and nano), but mining was horrible. 6000m<U+FFFD> is hardly 3 cycles, and i had to warp out nearly every time rats showed up. additionally a bad repro plant in system ... in fact, it's nothing you want to do on your own.anyways, my concern is not about better ores in particular. it's about other ores! variety is the key. i'm fine finding veldspar fields with 60k+ on a roid and no ore thiefs spamming around ;)"
9/24/2008,it would be nice if you could include a drone that saw a salvage drone and drones that had the different scaners on them like a suruvey drone. i think this would be a good addition to the drone types.
9/24/2008,huh?
9/24/2008,"wrong, as it need to check what is the used tax. it will use a modifier to tax =x1 instead of =x1.1 (for example) but it will check what the modifier is and apply it. same problem that you have dismissed: the system need to log the number of operations done every time players do an operation at the market and apply the multiplier, even if it is x1. and it was not about jita, but the linked node shared by several markets. to reduce the load on the systems nodes you increase the load on the markets nodes. and the markets are already slow.if you put up a regional or ranged buy order currently the broker fee applied is that of the station where you put up the buy order. there is no tax on the buyer side. i am a tad unclear on what you mean there. for my point about the increase in the number of operations. the system would do something like this: 1 items is sold2 system check the appropriate tax charge for standing (a)3 system check the appropriate tax charge for traffic size (b) (and it need to check every time as it will not know the appropriate tax)4 system do (a)*(b) and determine the appropriate tax %. as the values a and b are variables the system need to check what will be applied each time.you can change 3 so that if it is = to 1 it directly use only (a) for the tax rate, but the check is needed the same. the number of transactions done is probably already logged, so it will not impact much on the system.note that it will broke the market for the orders with a duration longer than the period used to cycle to determine the tax and it will require that the tax was displayed at the time when you set up the sell order."
9/24/2008,"why not just add a congestion charge to over crowded systems there is not many, forcing players who want to buy few items to go else where and players that need many items such as a ship and all its fittings can still profit from entering congested system such as jita"
9/24/2008,"again your entire argument is based on your assumptions on how a piece of code you have never seen, didn't write and wasn't involved in it's design works. unless you can of course prove me wrong."
9/24/2008,"a. people will only leave jita if they have a reason to leave jita, in the same way they only go to jita for a reason. this change wouldn't alter the fact the entire range of anything makeable is available at jita.b. no i suspect that the opposite might in fact happen, as the cost of selling at jita rises prices at jita will probably rise.so hopefully what will happen with in eve will mirror a little better what happens in real life (tm). such as if you search around you'll find cheaper prices elsewhere in the smaller trade hubs/shopping malls but if you want convient shopping you goto the jita/larger shopping mall and get it all at once, paying a premium for doing so.this isn't a congestion charge and i regret even mentioning jita in my op, my fault, i got hung up on a side benefit of this system instead of spendng more time being clear on the benefits of this. lag and it's solution is in the hands of ccp, the economics and it's problems are in the hands of us and ccp.where's dr eyjog when ya need him, i'm sure he'd be better at explaining the serious problems that one massively dominant point of sale has on an economic landscape.those in eve who exclusivly sell through jita have an advantage over others who do not sell in jita by the sheer volume of customers available to sell to. but in real life (tm) those with the biggest shop window which looks out over the most potential customers pay considerably more for the privaledge than others.it's no about fairness it's about logic, those who sell in larger trade hubs would have to pay for the privledge of doing so."
9/24/2008,"and you misinterpret me, i am not speaking of the code, but of the market for the seller. your idea will change the tax bracket every month (or week, day or whatever time frame you want). my order was done day 1 of month 1 with a tax rate of 1%, so the sell price is based on that. after i month the tax rate go to 2% as the system see a lot of trade. that alone can eat 20-30% of the profit for some item. sample example: 1 have sold a golem. production cost is around 650 millions, sell price 700 millions. transaction tax was 5,56 millions, broker fee 2,57 millions. so my profit was a little more than 40 millions. it the tax rate increase to 2% before my sale, the profit is reduced by about 12%, and that is in a station where i have good standings and with some decent trade skill. so your idea will make difficult for traders to predict the profit as the tax will change from a period to the next. that is what i mean with breaking the market for orders with a longer duration that the tax change cycle."
9/24/2008,"wallmart docet? rl is exactly the opposite, you can usually find better quality items shopping around, but very rarely lower prices than the big discounts."
9/24/2008,this is a terrible idea. trade hubs are a good thing for the game.
9/24/2008,"yes i completely agree, but since this proposal dosn't get rid of trade hubs but in actual fact helps to encourage additional trade hubs, at a slight cost to one dominant trade hub i guess you misunderstood."
9/24/2008,"you keep saying that my proposal will increase the load on the market server and yet you claim this has nothing to do with the code .... i'm confused by this.wallmart's dominance has less to do with lower prices on the shelf and more to do with dodgy business practices which in eve would be acceptable but in real life ...., but that's a totally different discussion.and yes you can find better quality than walmart if you shop around, almost always.but yes you can find cheaper than walmart if you shop around, but it takes some looking around.but wallmart dosn't open stores on the high street, they open stores in locations with cheap rent knowing that their cheap priced goods will bring their customers to them.and my proposal would hopefully help corporations/individuals reduce their prices in comparision to the major trade hub and thus send them on their way to becoming the next walmart."
9/24/2008,"current plex spawning mechanic is such:plex spawn random at dt, as they are found and complete they respawn else where.problem: as interest in fw wane, not enough people plex so trying to contest or save a system is best done right after dt, after which time you'd have to run plex all over the region each one netting you 2-5% chance a plex will appear in the system you want.proposed change: make plex static and do not close. victory point awarded on a per minute basis."

9/24/2008,"definitely support this, as long as the introduced commands only relate to search and station services. nothing related to flight."
9/24/2008,"not supportedreason is that it is very easy to inject textual data into the chat windows of eve, especially when windowed.basically, if this gets implemented, hellooo macros."
9/24/2008,"""fit the modules that exist, because they do the job you want"" is constructive."
9/24/2008,"as per the interview noah ward (chief dev) gave regarding the csm iceland meeting (the same one where he said that they wanted to see sweeping ideas coming through, not niggling little things), the impression i got was that he saw it as one of his main functions was squashing the sparkly & original ideas that new devs bring to the team, and giving them into the same jaded, elitist ""i'm better than all of you so i could give a rat's bottom what you think"" sort of person that he came accross as himself.personally i don't really care about the big ideas. ea holds no interest to me whatsoever, and from what i've seen of ambulation so far i don't think i'm really going to care about that either... eve is a game where details matter, fix the bl00dy details before adding a swathe of big new ideas. it worries me that in the latest newsletter (which i received yesterday, sorry to spoil the surprise if anyone hasn't had it yet), they boast about fixing 1000 bugs for ea, with the implication there were still a lot more to fix. when i read that i was horrified that there were even 1000 outstanding that they hadn't bothered to sort out, never mind that the true total is even higher. but what do i know - i've only been designing games (not on the computer) for 28 years so clearly i know jack about what makes good game design sorry for off-topic rant"
9/24/2008,"11% of players voted - something over 20k of them. given the nature of in-corp communication, the fact that it was being spammed mercilessly upon login for two weeks, and the fact that most people don't care about elections of this nature(and a massive number don't care about elections of any nature), i'd say that we can safely assume at least a 70-80% penetration rate. your (often valid) complaints about in-game news aside, people do read it, because there aren't 20,000 forum *****s, even if you include alts(for that matter, wow probably doesn't have 20,000 forum *****s). but ultimately, my opinion is the same - the electoral body(ccp) ran an information campaign to the best of their reasonable abilities, and information was available to all those who looked for it. if you chose not to vote, then it's your fault, and if you live under a rock then we can't do anything for you. i might feel a bit of sympathy towards the latter group, but it does not render the process illegitimate."
9/24/2008,ccp needs to weed out those which are causing a lack of progression within the csm right now or it is doomed to fail.i suggest starting with darius johnson.did the csm members actually have to sign anything to concur with a set of rules for behaviour on the csm?
9/24/2008,"i agree. get rid of the biggest trouble-maker, and the worst mudslinger in the group: jade contantine."
9/24/2008,the csm document describes that the csm has to go by a high social standard. so everybody should have read it. but nothing was signed.
9/24/2008,"not really, or not in this instance.it seems to me that she's simply saying she doesn't loathe anyone in the csm."
9/24/2008,darius has done nothing but cooperate with the csm. don't take my word for is go ahead and ask the rest of the council.i'm sure he'd respond to this direct and personal attack but it seems he's held to a different standard by the moderation team than everyone else.
9/24/2008,"thank you for expressing ""the community""'s opinion.and here we have darius. a fine example of what not to elect to the csm if it's ever to be anything. true, if e-peen were worth anything he'd be the richest man in the world, but unfortunately it's currency that only accumulates in eve.when the next election comes (and it's due soon) vote anyone but a goon."
9/24/2008,"for what its worth i don't think the csm ""idea"" was bad. but the reality is we did get people elected who loathe one other and cannot remain civil let alone cooperate - and given eve's political climate its hardly surprising that happens since the game is built around grudges and vendettas and dark brutality. whatever happens in the future the reality is some of those people will keep getting re-elected due to alliance voting blocks, so yes, its a problem and i'm honestly not sure how you deal with it. you can certainly make sure you pick candidates you believe are capable of turning the other cheek - but you can't stop other players electing their own choice of knife-wielding drama-merchants if it pleases them.the problem is that the csm ended up composed disproportionately of 0.0 ""leaders"". the csm should have different rules of eligibility next time.divide up the csm ""seats"" into districts, so that there can be proportionate representation across the various places players play. ie: candidates will be running for a seat to represent empire players, a seat to represent 0.0, a seat to represent lowsec, and a certain number of ""at large"" that are open everywhere, etc. ccp screens candidates for eligibility, they can determine where their activities primarily are."
9/24/2008,"uhh dude i speak for a lot of europeans here, where do you get the idea that the majority of us speak ""the queen english"" american media is much bigger than british worldwide and most people learn the majority of the english that way so sit down and think about what you said, you are english right?"
9/25/2008,"what part of ""i'm not at liberty to say any kind of update one way or another."" didn't you understand?the nidhoggur's pretty good, and it's actually quicker to train a rev than training a naglfar even with the nidhoggur fully speced."
9/25/2008,"first of all your solutions are way to exploitable...look at all those mercenary corps in c&p - if the aggressor can define victory conditions, and war win / lose ratio is shown on corp page, we can now expect an outburst of ""uber"" pvp merc corps that have won x wars, just by setting a low victory condition and deccing an alt corp.you say you want fair system for the aggressor and aggressed, yet the aggressor has to meet the victory condition to win, and the aggressed can just stay in station to win.now this brings us to ""moral"" victories - you lose a war, as you haven't met the victory condition, yet you can say you won...let's see all those caod / c&p posts...also if you want to introduce victory conditions based on cost, the cost of the war should depend on the victory condition...but again it's too easy to exploit for e-peen showing (just win a lot of cheap wars over a hauler).any way i don't see anything wrong about wars atm (or at least not much) - eve is a game of competition - there are many ways to do it - competing by force is one of them."
9/25/2008,supported!
9/25/2008,against
9/25/2008,"i'd much prefer a single skill to train, with a second skill selectable as the rollover. if the rollover skill finishes training halts.or a que that allows for 24 hours of training (the skill must already be 'in place', it can't be a skillbook). this would be best for short duration skills (generally less than 6-8 hours)."
9/25/2008,"+1, along with most of what else has been said here.-jonas"
9/25/2008,isn't a simple solution that your primary skill can only be level 4 or less take care of the training 2 skills to 5 bit. you can't set amarr bs v and queue caldari bs v for instance.then set the secondary skill as currently training skill to next level or any skill to next level. you could set amarr bs 4 and queue amarr bs v or set caldari bs 3 and train caldari or gallente bs 4 on queue (provided you already had amarr and gallente bs 3 and caldari bs 2.)level 4 doesn't take too long especially compared to training something to level 5. just saying.
9/25/2008,"bumping should not cause damage (due to landing in stations, gates, other ships) when coming out of warp, unless there's a certain timer that allows you to move outside the object before you 'come back into phase' with the surrounding space (during which you're invulnerable to such things as smartbombs, bombs, ect. and can't be targeted. this will allow people to load their grid during short-lag situations).otherwise... the mass of a ship should determine which is affected by a bounce, the lighter ship suffering the larger deviation on collision (if the colliding ship is small enough it goes off in some random direction while the larger ship is unmoved).that will put 'bumping' into the hands of bs pilots, not interceptors."
9/25/2008,bumping damage isn't implemented until 1 second after warp completes a you phase back in. hence you rocket off but don't take damage.
9/25/2008,"wait, you mean being able to instantly teleport huge amounts of goods from across the eve universe incurs some risk? it's fine. freighters, esp. jump freighters, aren't really meant to be solomobiles. yes, you need your corp's help and no, that's not a bad thing."
9/25/2008,"carebear whine thread. there is hardly any risk in jumping a jf around. you can have cyno up at pos or right next to station to dock, what's the problem?"
9/25/2008,"there isn't any problem. like many people said current mechanics aren't seriously borked. but there is a chance of improvement and even create a new profession for it. besides there isn't any real reason for factions not allowing to cyno in non offensive commercial ships into their territories.'oh ccp, give us our daily pew pew' argument is a bit shortsighted here. its not like you will be able to catch these suckers on regular basis. they hug pos or stations and have more than enough hp to crawl back to their safe place."
9/25/2008,great answer fuze!
9/25/2008,i read this a while back and just backed off a bit because i my self do not see any value in fw. but after reading other posts from players that have absolutely no clue what the alliances in 0.0 are about or their true nature. i think this would be a great way for your normal npc/empire player to get to know some of these guys. i think this would be a great way alliances to find new pilots also.this would bring in a stronger game play with experienced fc's that do this on a regular basis and the knowledge passed on would be immeasurable. i would also see the new pilots learning how to pvp pick up a lot faster as a whole than just a few corps entering the fray.
9/25/2008,"agreed. another consideration is that allowing alliances into fw gives the militias themselves an oportunity to organize. one of the drawbacks to the militias is that because *anyone* can join, there are often troublemakers, either intentionally or not. allowing alliances into fw doesn't just mean that existing alliances would be able to enter; it also means that corps already in fw can create an alliance, collecting the best fw corps under a unified banner. currently, the only means by which to accomplish this is to try to convince militia members to join a single corp, which is like herding cats. while creating a cohesive alliance is no easy undertaking, it gives you more tools and more flexibility to work with."
9/25/2008,"just to clarify matters, we formed the pie alliance not to take part in the tournament, but to take part in the fw prototype (aka the defiants / saracens story arc).ccp, through their rped amarrian mouthpeice, told us that we would be expected to have more than the three active war decs permitted to lone corporations - effectively forcing us to form an alliance."
9/25/2008,"proposal cautiously supported, by the way"
9/25/2008,"i don't think no one else in the corporation should be allowed to cancel the job, ceos, 'officers', etc should retain the privilege to go ""no we aren't doing that."" however someone of the same 'rank'/position should not be able to cancel the work order of a peer."
9/25/2008,exactly that
9/25/2008,"i'd rather that it be limited to people with the roles to install jobs have the ability to cancel them.who delivered/installed/cancelled jobs should be logged, however.limiting it to only the installer can be very difficult to manage if that person is offline when the job is completed.orjobs can be delivered by anybody, but can only be cancelled by the installer or ceo."
9/25/2008,i like the extra logging who canceled a job as well.
9/25/2008,/signed....i know of 5 alt corps setup for research and manufacturing just because of this that would all be gone if this was put into place / fixed.-jonas
9/25/2008,"thats sort of what i'm getting at.the idea is more on the lines of getting some back up from friends, who might not necessarily be in your corp. it would also be sort of like being able to have an alliance for missioners etc, as they are definately vulnerable against someone who is in a pvp ship compared to the missioner who can be effectively helpless in a mission setup ship.the way it is now, a fleet member could be being attacked, and theres not much that anyone can do about it apart from sitting there watching him die i just think this would make it a bit more even for the carebear, instead of being a sitting duck."
9/25/2008,"as one of the 8%, i wholeheartedly support this idea. while i've made various little tweaks to not make it so hard to distinguish between red and green, it still doesn't solve all the problems."
9/25/2008,"count me in on the wanting to hear an update. but don't hold your breath.as for me, personally, i always love it when the execs at ccp open their mouths. it gives us players solid, quotable, evidence to call them on when they always fail to live up to their ""promises"".unfortunately, i hate to break it to you, but i have been with eve and ccp since it went live; and i have never, not once, seen them live up to the ""spirit"" of a promise. i have seen, on rare occasion, them live up to the ""letter"" of a promise; but even then they are never anything even remotely close to what should have gotten done and/or fixed.so, take my advise, and take what any ccp exec says with a grain of salt. they almost never have the fortitude or the dedication to ever deliver on what their big mouth promises.just my two isk from experience. peace."
9/25/2008,"no more lag on the internet, lol, you're delusional.hardware upgrade requires code upgrade to function properly, which is in progress, as indicated by several devposts all over the place. it'll be finished soon(tm) or at least eventually.doubt the csm will be able to get any eta on it as there probably is no eta. maybe some progress news will be provided at fanfest.but it can't hurt to ask anyways, so support."
9/25/2008,"i would personally love an update. sadly, i have a feeling ccp either1. will tell us to go away and play in our sandbox2. will announce something at fanfestbecause all lag will be gone by 2008, right?"
9/25/2008,"yes for tangible rewards and meaningful consequences to fw plexing.ccp already said somewhere that deny docking rights is technically difficult to implement but that deny service use is an option.but that does not solve the problem that fw currently only cost a lot of money for the participating players, with no actual reward besides the one-time standing boosts for promotion and any tags the players might snatch from the npcs. it would be nice if the militia would offer a sustainable playstyle.i'd like to see some more discussion on the possible rewards and consequences before i bring up this issue."
9/25/2008,how come conquerable stations have this implemented? a possible option could be that can use station services for free or have reduced costs when your faction owns the system.
9/25/2008,"without other potential gains for capturing systems, locking your enemies out of a system (by limiting docking/services) becomes less of a reward towards your faction, but instead only weakens your enemy (especially vs neutrals to fw), and in the long run might lead to your faction virtually locking down all your enemies (epecially an outnumbered ones) systems for good.besides having occupancy influence docking rights/station services, introducing faction specific lp store items and lp awards for capturing plexes/systems would seem like a nice touch."
9/25/2008,"i've said this before in other threads, but i'll repeat it. here's a simple, easy-to-implement method to make system capture more fun for rpers, and more profitable for everyone:1) remember those cosmos sites with trade agents that demand various ancient landfill products in exchange for rewards? recycle the code, and create fw 'bases' with similar agents. for the matari, these would be ""re-education camps"" for freed slaves (to be re-asimilated into npc society), and agents would accept slaves in exchange for lps. for the amarrians, these would be ""heathen religious camps"" for captured matari (to be enslaved), and agents would accept refugees in exchange for lps. (no cash, just lps.)2) re-use the cosmic anomaly code to create ""fw civilian sites"" that would drop slaves (in amarrian sites) or refugees (in matari sites). possibilities for these anomalies might include colonies, slave pens, cripples transports, etc. the creation of these sites would be triggered by the capture of complexes -- each complex might spawn one or two of these sites, while system capture might generate enough to require industrials to transport the slaves/refugees. for system capture, make some of the sites spawn immediately, plus more periodically over the course of several days.3) come to think of it, make it so that both factions reward the return of both slaves and refugees. this would create a new 'commodity' to fight over, as is the aftermath of a system capture both sides race to take/recover/free/protect slaves or freemen.note that this is not in place of elise's idea, but in addition to. i like the idea of each faction not having access to services in hostile stations./supported"
9/25/2008,sure.
9/25/2008,"and i don't think you can read.seems to me lv wants the answer that never came, and i support his desire to have an answer. when a company says ""we'll look into it,"" most people expect them to say something about it after a while and apparently ccp has not."
9/25/2008,you are right.my idea with this post was also that it would be a good thing to see what the community thinks about this. the support shown in this thread shows that the community would like to see this.
9/25/2008,"actually, the support in this thread shows that a dozen players in the community (assuming they are all uniques) support this, from 20,000 that voted...also, how do you know that ccp haven't already implemented the tagging? just cause you don't see any in patch notes, it doesn't naturally follow that they haven't done it...there is another possibility...take care,arithron"
9/25/2008,"i looked through the first couple pages and saw no mention of this so i'll try.what about a ""trust"" or feedback rating system for contracts where you can rate a player after a contract transaction. for example you buy some nice dg launchers from someone and afterword you just give a thumbs up or down which gets tracked for the user. then if someone else does the usual trying to sell a regular raven as a navy raven and you fall for it you log a negative on them. almost like a ebay feedback system. if a user has a 0 or below rating there will be a pop up flag or some warning right on the contract saying the seller has a negative rating and to make sure to read the contract. there are so many scammers taking advantage of people too trusting or naive. some will say we don't need this, if you fall for a scam whatever but in rl there are avenues to take to get your money back, better business beureu (in the us), local police, news agencies, etc. why not have the same in eve? i would think its a simple system and wont prevent anyone from properly selling and wont really fully prevent scammers but it would help.-jonas"
9/25/2008,that would be great for contract handling... particular couriers to get a break on high collateral or something.
9/25/2008,"i can't support this - a contract doesn't suffer from ebay's problem of non-delivery, since the terms of the contract are written out explicitly and inviolably, and failure to complete a contract is impossible(except in the case of courier contracts, but they have collateral for that). i don't care if the person i'm buying from has scammed a thousand people before - i read any public contracts i think of accepting, and don't accept bad ones. eve operates on caveat emptor, not the bbb and fraud legislation."
9/25/2008,eh when you put it that way..... i'd have to agree...but i thought the scc was the eve version of the bbb or the sec. : o )
9/25/2008,"good plan, i fuly support this. using standings is not an appropriate way for this for several reasons, so this rating should be a new dimension."
9/25/2008,"hello all, i just read a thread in the skills category, and it talks about how bad it sucks to train up to large t2 hybrid turrets, the skill requirments are horrendous, while the missile skill requirments are easyusing the skills, for example, to train up to t2 torpedoe launchers for me (gallente) would take only 26 days and to train up to tech 2 cruise missile launchers would take only 38 days, again, this coming from me, being gallenteto train for t2 blasters (large) would take me atm, about 70 days, which i find a bit excessive, and might sound a bit carebearish, but i find it a bit unfair that soemone could train for these tech 2 weapons so easily, while it remains so damn time consuming for large t2 hybridsnow to put this in a bit more focus, isnt it a bit stupid that i can train for two different battleship sized tech 2 weapons in less time than it would take me to train for one battleship sized tech 2 weapon(would only take me 64 days of training total to train for tech 2 cruises and tech 2 torps, while taking me 70 days for large tech 2 blasters, and an additional 23 days to train for large tech 2 railguns for a total of 90+ days of training for my own races large tech 2 weapons)now, im making a proposal, i honeslty believe that either ccp needs to increase the support skill requirments for t2 cruise / torp launchers, or decrease the support skill requirments for large t2 weaponssome ideas i had in mind:for t2 cruise missiles, you need warhead upgrades v for tech 2 cruise launchers (to increase their damage)and you need missile projection v for t2 torp launchers (to increase their range)oronly require motion prediction to lvl 3 for large t2 hybrids, and only require medium hybrid blaster spec to lvl 3 (as opposed to motion prediction lvl 5 (five) and medium blaster spec to 4 for them)and maybe do similar reductions for medium t2 hybridsand do the same w/ minmtar (projectile) and amarr(lasers) since thye are also affected by thiscontructive criticsm (that i probably wont read) and other replies appreciated"
9/25/2008,"definitely support this in principle. at the very least, there ought to be a mechanism by which a stock transaction can take place in a semi-secure means. i don't think it would actually be possible to prevent ipo scams, so clearly buyers will want to be careful who they buy from, but it would be nice to be able to put out private or public buy/sell orders, either on the market or through contract, to automate the actual trade of the shares.a couple of specific capabilities i'd like to see:1) the ability to offer stocks for sale either to the public as a whole, or to corp members only, or to specific individuals.2) the ability to place 'blanket' buy orders, under similar conditions.for example, my corp has a stock program. i would like to be able to, as a hypothetical example, place a corp-only sell order for stock at 500k isk, a public sell order for 550k, and a public buy order for 500k. this would allow the public to buy stocks with a 'transaction fee', while not charging the transaction fee for corp members. further, any owner could sell the stock back at will, so long as the buy order was re-issued as needed."
9/25/2008,"""geared toward versatility and prolonged deployment in hostile environments, marauders represent the cutting edge in todays warship technology.""having read a few non-constructive treads (example) on the issue of marauder i was thinking it was best to devote a new thread to this issue.marauders as i understand them - and i have marauder v and fly a golem daily - is to be the best ratting ship in the game (and by correlation missions as well). mine has been a joy to mission run in, but thinking about ratting, versatility and the prolonged deployment part, then the ships are missing the powergrid to fit for utility. here are the comparative powergrid numbers for the marauder and their t1 brethren:paladin/apocalypse 13500/20500golem/raven 6500/9500kronos/megathron 12000/15500vargur/tempest 7900/15500now some of the reasoning for the lower powergrid is that the marauders only fit 4 pg heavy turrents/launcers, but the problem is that they cannot then fit any of the utility items (heavy neuts, cap boosters, smartbombs, mwd & etc.) since they are horribly low on powergrid. this is most apparent with the vargur (nearly 50% pg nerf) and golem (with 6500pg the % boosting rigs and items don't do much).the result is that the marauders are fine missioning ships, but horrible at the versatile low/null-sec ratting, exploration and complexing in hostile environments - which the flavor text at the top implies is their role. nobody is going to take a 650 million isk ship that cannot fit neuts, cap boosters, smartbombs & etc. into low/null-sec. of course some will reply that they'll never take such an expensive ship into hostile territory, but some of us wouldn't mind so much, if it had a fighting chance. the only way to fit said items is to not fit some of the turrets/launchers, and then there is no point to bring a marauder over the t1 versions.my idea is therefore to increase the powergrid on these ships, so that the possibilities for versatile fits increases. if done correctly they'll still not be better damage dealers then the faction version of their t1 brethren (which i think is a design goal), but they'll live up to their role, and mayhaps they'll see low-sec usage. nota bene: if low-sec usage of marauders is successful, then there is the added bonus of making the low-sec pirates happy, in that they now have a 600m+ isk ship to hunt for..."
9/25/2008,"by limiting grid/cpu and sensor strength they shoehorned the marauder into (typically) only pve content. they are very, very limited when it comes to enough variety to their fittings strictly to keep them that way.while i would like to see them useful for pvp combat, they would probably unbalance it too heavily in the favor of the bigger alliances. this would further unbalance the already excessive advantages the bigger alliances enjoy currently.good idea, but not one that could be easily supported."
9/25/2008,"well my problem is that they haven't made it useful for typical pve content. it is only really useful for high-sec (or safe null-sec) pve content, and that defeats the whole purpose of the ship (per it's flavor text).and let me reiterate the point. marauders do not need more damage, do not need more tank, but they do need more powergrid to become versatile."
9/25/2008,"pve, versatile?i agree that the vargur needs more pg, leave the others alone."
9/25/2008,"i'm assuming you didn't understand, so i'll not respond as to a troll.yes versatility is needed for any ship to see actual pve usage in hostile environments (low-sec, non safe null-sec). if it can only be fitted with the 4 weapons and no heavy neutralizers, smartbombs, heavy cap boosters, mwds then it cannot be fitted against putting up any fight what so ever.you are correct in your assumption that it's not because of the pve environment, but because of the pvp environment that this is needed, but the role is still to make use of pve , just in those regions of space where pvp also exists."
9/25/2008,"here's the pg situation for each of the ships, with either 2 lar ii or 1 xlsb ii and four of the most pg-intense weapons of the appropriate class, and all skills at 5. paladin: -2575(long)/+2375(short)kronos: +950(long)/+1893(short)vargur: -3545(long)/+405(short)golem: +2848(long)/+959(short)a pulse paladin, blaster kronos, or cruise golem has enough pg to fit support mods without great difficulty - maybe 1-2 rcus for a full set. that's especially true for pvp on the paladin and kronos, where you strip 2300-4600 pg of lar in order to fit your mwd and cap booster. i'll agree that the vargur gets screwed, though - you can put together an autocannon pve setup, but not much else. i've played around some with a pvp kronos on singularity, and for that particular ship, i don't see any problems. you can fit 3 medium neuts without fitting mods, or you can strip damage mods to upgrade to large neuts. my paladin-flying buddy says the situation is similar for him, and eft agrees - you can even keep some damage mods if you want to. a golem is sketchier, but depending on how you choose to fit it it can be effective. so yeah, i'd have to agree with the poster above me who says it's just the vargur that's the problem - give it enough for a rudimentary pvp setup, because an artillery vargur isn't exactly a gamebreaker in missions, but leave the others alone. also, don't expect that any amount of pg will make people use marauders very often in pvp - they're just too expensive for what they do. it should be reasonable to try, but it's not something many people will ever actually do."
9/25/2008,"no. the problem is simply that lowsec ores suck, and the solution is to boost them (the normal lowsec ores, the ones you find in hisec explo sites)mine into a jetcan.if you mean npc pirates, then get a friend/alt to kill them for you. if you mean player pirates, then you don't need to warp out whenever they enter local. just use the directional scanner and see if they try to probe you down. if you see probes, then warp out."
9/25/2008,"there should be more of them, the rats should be a lot tougher for the local security (with minimal bounties), and they should not be so amazingly difficult to probe out."
9/25/2008,"npc pirates can ruin your mining if you are alone as mining barges aren't meant to fight the rats you can find in 0.4 or less and they will spawn in the exploration site. sadly you need to warp away if pc pirates are in system as the gravimetric systems are not deadspace, so you can be scanned with a spook probe from outside you on board scanner range with almost pinpoint accuracy. more than getting better ores my opinion is that a bit more gravimetric sites are needed and that the kind of ores and difficulty to pinpoint the site of high sec ores should be changed a bit to reflect the current ore values. currently if you find a difficult to spot site it is almost always omber, today one of the worst ores available.the rats are exactly the same that can spawn in the belts of that system. the gravimetric site is only one more spawn point in the system."
9/25/2008,"wouldn't it be nice to travel through a region where your standings with the particular interested party might otherwise preclude such safe passage? ever wanted to jump into a system to buy something urgently, but standings meant that such a journey will result in destruction from those pesky gate guns etc?well, here's an idea to allow just such things, for a little isk, of course! it's not my idea, it might even have been proposed elsewhere, but here it is in the assembly hall for comments and support:[idea]allow the option of paying officials a bribe, effectively, to grant safe passage from npc guns/ships etc, and to allow access to stations in regions and systems where otherwise you be considered hostile (due to low standings with said race/faction etc). make the charge for passage related to standings with said entity, and to the standing with that entity's enemies. the bribery needs to have a very definate and short time period effect (maybe allow longer periods for a higher cost, but a exponential cost).it might be possible to have stations 'eject' characters if their time runs out whilst docked...maybe some other players have additional ideas- just add them below!!!take care,arithron"
9/25/2008,"a system where small fleets can either knock out the security of a pos allowing a raiding party to steal a limited amount of loot from hangars silos ect in a ""power down mode"" but the destruction of the pos is impossible. or maybe sumthing like a shield jamming module that allows an enemy ship through the pos shield to do the raid. oviously the defences would still be on so the raid would be dangerous to the small raiding fleet this module would only be fitted to sumthing like a cruiser that has a limited cargo capacity and would take up most of the power or cpu of the ship meaning you couldnt tank or fit many wepons meaning it would be a daring raid but proffitable if pulled off. this would mean that the pos owner would have to activly patroll the pos to avoid such actions"
9/25/2008,"because you insist reading 2 different arguments as one:1) it will increase market load;2) it will create problem for sellers as they will not know what the tax will be next week/month and this will make impossible to predict the actual cost of the trade.if your read the posts instead of skipping it is will be clear. but jita is wallmart, not a store in central manhattan. it has the lowest sell prices, not the highest. you are trying to solve a problem that don't exist. jita live on mass trade, not high margins."
9/25/2008,"no it won't increase market load and i can say that with equal authority that you put forward your claim, because neither of us actually knows how it would effect market load, because neither of us knows how the market works.running a buisness is a gamble, which products you make, what price you sell them at and where you sell them are all a gamble, not knowing what the tax will be next month is just another very minor gamble at last! a valid criticizm and lets be honest one i can't answer. because your right perhaps i'm seeing a problem where one dosn't exist."
9/25/2008,"agreed.fw is dying more quickly than slowly, due to the lack of any tangible results."
9/25/2008,do you have any idea who the members are? there are 9 seats. only 3 are from 0.0.how does that have anything to do with the problems in the csm?
9/25/2008,removed. please post constructively. navigator
9/25/2008,his poor attitude is clear for all to see who can read these forums. its not suitable for a member of the csm. if you cannot see this then your blinded by your association to him.
9/25/2008,"i'm not convinced thats actually the problem so much that the ""0.0 leaders"" it ended up with all came from the same kinda philosophical block without much healthy debate or alternative viewpoints between them.+ we have had the problem that the ""0.0 knowledge"" expressed by the ""experts"" has too often been gone unchallenged by rigorous debate and left to stand. some of the non 0.0 csm's on the council have been a little too hesitant about going against the stated prevailing wisdom of the 0.0 csm's on nullsec issues and this is something i feel to be a mistake given eve's interconnected single server nature. + things have always gotten too personalized too quickly. i've certainly tried to be a counter to the big-alliance status quo vote but its very easy to stereotype my position as being some whining wannabe that simply wants to damage 0.0 empires because ""i'm apparently not good enough to run one."" (rather than seeing the input for what it is, being the promotion of genuine gameplay options for smaller organizations and roving playstyle). the tendency to personalize these things ruins decent debate and to be fair, its something i've tended to do as well by representing the other side of the issue as lazy status quo worshiping bloat-interests that just want to defend their own backyard. but i guess thats partisan politics baby. and the problem is you don't typically find out anything about the reality of 0.0 warfare without getting passionate about the whole thing so you come to table either without knowledge - or with knowledge tempered by bias against the other side of the argument.thats an interesting idea really: be a devil of a thing to sort out the details for though - you'd need some kind of objective (re ccp sponsored/independent oversight committee to decide the electoral boundaries - maybe mr ingthorsson could help again?)but yeah, if it came down to something like (off the top of my head) 1-3 0.0 seats (contested by 0.0 powers)1-3 empire seats (contested by mission runners, pve'ers, empire fighters)1-3 lowsec seats (contested by pirates, bounty hunters, mercs, explorers etc)1-3 random indeps (contest by whoever felt they could make a special interest message)you might well get a more interesting council all round. worth talking about certainly. though of course the flaw in system would likely be that a big 0.0 power could just split its vote again and get a candidate in for 0.0 and for one of the others to double up its csm power. the only real cure for that one is an end to voting apathy and ensure as many people as humanly possible are encouraged to vote. or make voting mandatory on the login panel - you have to pick a candidate (or click abstain) to get into the game. that also might work"
9/25/2008,"not really - you'd wind up with random csms, not good ones. the current crew, internecine warfare aside, has been fairly effective and representative of all the various types of players in the game. i don't trust that the 89% of the population who doesn't care would elect a group as good. also, it's never a good idea to make people do work that they don't want to do in order to be able to play a game that they're paying you for access to."
9/25/2008,"thats what the ""abstain"" button would be for."
9/25/2008,"dividing seats on the csm by district (or however else you want to) is really an unworkable idea!given that many players have multiple characters, how would you (and who would) deem x player eligible for running to represent x district? or maybe you were thinking of the characters coming from these areas (forgetting that players who run characters have multiple ones). making the csm form from characters from certain districts on a quota basis just silly when you think about it. afterall, its not the characters that discuss issues in real life with ccp, or get together in csm meetings- its real players. having districts etc doesn't avoid certain types of players, or make the resultant csm anymore diverse/representative in any reality.take care,arithron"
9/25/2008,"that helps with the former problem, but not with the latter. if real elections aren't blocking people's recreation in the vast majority of the world, why should we actively be seeking to extend fake elections to that level? angering your customer base by making them do unnecessary things they don't want to do is a terrible business practice."
9/25/2008,do you want those issues heard in your absence (and will you be submitting the templates by the deadline on friday?)
9/25/2008,"the templates are right there in the link.but i will wait till next week, that's probably better."
9/25/2008,would have to agree on the drone bay issue there it just something i'd keep in the hanger these days
9/25/2008,"quoting the goon wiki, ""give this thing the same 4 turret layout 100% damage bonus as the new nightmare, instead of a ****ty laser cap bonus. then, maybe people'd actually fly it.i know i would. ""this ship suffers pretty heavily from an overall lack of dps really. give it the ability to do damage and still have enough high slots to be effective and i think it would quickly change from the subpar ship is now to well worth the ~800mil isk these things are worth."
9/25/2008,"this is exactly my thinking! one of the best posts i read in months...for all people flame about wow and co. on these forums, there is one thing to be said for them: accessabilitynow, i'm not saying get rid of the skill-system alltogether, because eve is pretty much based on it. but like maximum i started an alt recently and thought back to being a noob, how much it sucked then and how much more it must suck now...as a noob you see all the cool stuff and can't wait to play, only to find out that to do anything at a semi-competitive-level will take them literally months to attain (and that's a highly specialized character, not a good character with some versatility), without them even being able to accellerate the process...i'm sure the devs realize at least to some extent that the hole grows ever larger... but i wonder whether they can look through their blinders enough to save eve from it's slooooow, agonizing slip into obscurity..."
9/25/2008,"i have always thought of eve as a second-stage mmo game - the kind of game you come to when you're worn out with the 'accessible' and easy games like wow which are out there. that kind of 'newbie' isn't looking for more spoonfeeding, they want a challenging game, and that's what eve is. yes it is a cool game, but i would be wary of recommending it to someone entirely new to the genre. let them get their feet wet in more accessible games first.i've been playing mmos for over 10 years now (meridian 59, everquest, asheron's call, daoc, horizons, and even wow, before coming to eve) and i had no trouble at all adjusting to the way the game works. i would rather need to train something for a long time to be good at it than to be automatically good at everything - otherwise the training is worthless and the game becomes boring with everyone good at everything. for me, wow's problem is exactly that - every class is capable of soloing, admittedly some better than others, which makes it pretty dull and blurs the line between the classes."
9/26/2008,i've loved this idea since it was posted.

9/26/2008,"this is a constitutional issue that has been stated in a passing note within the latest csm devblog, about the sudden 21 year age limit suddenly imposed by csm for candidates in the next election. as mentioned in the comments thread, this has effectively broadsided lavista's re-election campaign.given that voters were conscious of lv's age, and that he had been publicly tested and vindicated on the forums through running 2 public organisation successfully within market discussions, lv having wanted to run for csm was first effectively elected within md as the preferred candidate for championing science, industry and economic matters, and won a place on the csm.therefore, this sudden rule change has put a massive spanner in both csm candidates and voters who are interested in this particular area, and thus is something that requires a little more thought.this is especially pertinent as the next patch, midas, will be targetted to industry and general improvements across this part of the game, of which lv is the champion delegate of exactly that area.now while i generally agree with the age limit, in this particular case the candidate should be omitted from this rule.i therefore propose a small clause to be added that instead of just 'the 21 year age limit to be a valid candidate' that it becomes 'the 21 year age limit to be a valid candidate, unless the candidate has held a position on the csm previously'."
9/26/2008,adding the thumbs up.
9/26/2008,can understand in some countries this might make sense but to put it on all eve players is a bit much... 18 i would agree with but 21 is too much.
9/26/2008,"i guess its because of the hard spirits and ccp doesn't want to be compromised by pictures showing them with a drunk underaged ^^tbh, i don't care. average age of players is well above 21 i can imagine and so i have no problem with that rule. ccp will have their reasons for that"
9/26/2008,don't nerf lavista vista....
9/26/2008,lavista vista can't go
9/26/2008,limit should be higher and not allowing kids to do important things
9/26/2008,"you're right. players of 20 years old and younger are not important and completely irrelevant.while we're at it, women should be banned as well.communists too.what have you been smoking?!?!?!if there needs to be a limit, it should -in my opinion- be 18. but i also highly doubt there should be a lowest permitted age limit at all.edit 1: isn't this restriction a bit too photographic...?edit 2: since a) there is no ""relevant"" age restriction on playing the game (other than the 13 years of age), b) if the under-age player has parental consent to play the game, and c) the csm is the body that represents the players, i find it highly irrational to impose an age restriction. if the csm is a democratic representation of the player base, let it be a democracy for everyone."
9/26/2008,"the sudden change is odd, and lv should be allowed under this rule. if alcohol consumption is the key here, simply make a rule about underaged drinking and minimum-age in country of citizenship."
9/26/2008,"alcohol consumption was not an issue. the csm was asked to stay sober for the csm meetings and it could simply be enforced for people who are under the age of majority.the age of buying alcohol in my country, denmark, is 16. but people should of course respect icelandic law. i agree. the answer xhagen has given is that it's due to practical reason of the nda. but this is irrational due to the fact i had to have it signed by a legal guardian as well.i could understand a limit of 18. but not 21."
9/26/2008,lavista vista is doing a far better job as being a representative for the not-so-pewpew side of eve than many others who are on the csm.he stays until his 2 terms are up.
9/26/2008,i believe lvv should be grandfathered in. the rule was not in place originallyhe got specific permission from the gm's last roundhe's got parental permission (parent signed nda). i can see this rule being applied forward but not backward. i support putting lvv on the ballot.
9/26/2008,lv stays! or our wrath shall be furious!
9/26/2008,"lavista vista is doing a great, job. he replies to numberous topics and are helpful and brings forwards alot of ideas to ccp, which probably wouldn't get there if it wasn't for him. hell is he possibly one of the most loved members of the csm? he's had this position now and suddenly it will be denied?"
9/26/2008,i voted for vista! he stays!
9/26/2008,one of the guys i respect the most on the csm. let stand again ccp.

9/26/2008,"ccp puts this cause 'they look funny' to press, bad stuff ccp, i though you had mroe personality as a company."
9/26/2008,"i`m all for the 18+ rule instead of the 21+. ccp consideried the csm meeting to be a success, thus proving that people under 21 can handle the responsbility that has been entrusted them.furthermore, ccp wants us to move towards a gaming democracy (even if in this case could be considered metagaming). and the people, the players, have cast their votes."
9/26/2008,"gotta say i'm surpised by this move. i had a nice long post typed up but the forums ate it(probably because it was witty and clever). so in short, i hereby dismiss any age-related changes to the csm requirements effective immediatly. pull your head out ccp and do the right thing.as amarr citizen 155, spokesperson for the amarrian race and supreme ruler of vaajaita, i approve this message.edit: forgot my thumb"
9/26/2008,"support added,"
9/26/2008,"it's a simple as this, since lavista vista has already signed an nda and is legally bound by an nda he doesn't need to sign another. so legally ccp and lavista vista and the parent/legal guardian who signed the nda are covered.there is no legal reason why lavista vista should not be able to run again."
9/26/2008,the irony in this post is unbelievable.
9/26/2008,stopping a well-functioning and well-supported csm member from running for re-election is not gonna increase faith in the csm as an institution.
9/26/2008,this is hilarious. i'll support it as such.

9/26/2008,stupid discrimination is stupid.don't nerf lv or any other victims of this new rule.

9/26/2008,"i'd at least like to see ccp explain why they've changed the age limit. if there's some obscure insurance or legal issue then i guess they'd have to comply, but tell us so rather than just pull the rug from under an existing csm."
9/26/2008,"echoing the sentiment in this thread, he has done a good job, and is very visible on forums being generally useful, waive the restriction for him, drop the restriction back to 18+, or at least give us a very good reason why you have instated it."
9/26/2008,"/me signedthere should be a ""brain age"" limit...not an age limit.like the yahoo who remarked about kids.... he should be blocked.not the other way around.most kids these days are not very bright.. but there are a few who are actually smarter and more intelligent than the adults are...most adults are as dumb as bricks.lvv is great for the csm.... he has my support.don't kick him for his age. should be an qualification of maturity...not age."
9/26/2008,"lv, one of the main reasons that the csm was at all effective and not a complete joke."
9/26/2008,no. i can not support this so i do a thumbs down.you either let em all in or none of em in.
9/26/2008,i support the clause. let lvv be grandfathered in.
9/26/2008,"i don't actually agree with this per se as i'm against the plan in general - i think lavista's candidacy alone proves it redundant, and given people can own accounts and play under the ages of 21, then they should also be represented.nevertheless, i'll vote thumbs up, as a clause highlights there's a flaw in the proposed plan."
9/26/2008,"lavista vista is the best of the csm delegates and has performed his elected role better than any other two csms combined that you could care to name. should he wish to stand again, he should have the option to do so... as an earlier poster mentioned, lv is why the csm project has not deteriorated into a complete farce."

9/26/2008,fully support this. vista has been one of the most levelheaded guys in the csm so far.

9/26/2008,"me wants to join an alliance and fw.. so make it possible ccp.you won't see the average 0.0 pos warfare in empire simply as there are only few very good moons to harvest, and because you cannot claim sovereignty anyways.the idea with the alliance standing sounds good. just give it a try, one could still remove the ability again. it's only a game after all.."
9/26/2008,"there's no need. alliances, whether they roleplay or not, are too powerful and too wealthy to be a part of what ccp wants to be the pvp training grounds. the idea is for hi-sec people to experience pvp in a secluded area, with a variety of ship types. and to then get interested in 0.0 to eventually move out there, or move to low sec. it's simply not designed to allow alliances to partake.now you may say that you're a tiny rp alliance, but that doesn't mean large pvp alliances won't join up and turn fw into capital wars. even if you set a high standing to lessen the chances of larger alliances joining, you are still setting a precedent for them to do so, and kill fw.there's a lot that people can and can't do in this game, keeping alliances out of fw is just another one. i feel sorry for you... but the big picture of alliances with fw is very unhealthy. perhaps disbanding into one large corp is your best option... and well, very doable i might add.consider the wide variety of players who do their own specific racial missions... who is to say in an alliance what faction they will go for or against? you could literally sit in an alliance with 1000 people and watch your standings drop to a faction that you worked so hard for by doing nothing.alliances bring too many cans of worms... keep them out. period."
9/26/2008,"i know you are chair, but this tells me that you are abusing this seat to push an issue that only a select few care about. it's your personal opinion, and i don't think it's ever been a big enough issue to present to the csm or ccp. it's rather been your agenda. a well done campaign i must add but there are far more pertinent needs in fw than the whines of a few rp alliances. once those details are wrinkled out, i'll be glad to listen to your alliance debate, but until those are fixed adding your personal agenda should be pushed to the back burner. i hope you see the real flaw in fw and say as much as you can about what the players of fw really want... rewards. that should be the first priority in your fanfest meetings. so please, do that first. add up the people involved in fw, then add up your rp alliances... now tell me who deserves their needs first? fix fw, then worry about alliances.wrong. alliances won't fix fw, they will kill it. use the games current mechanics to be a part of fw... simple."

9/26/2008,"just last night i dropped 7 probes in a system to get full coverage and just after the last one i got disconnected. it was a bit frustrating plopping down another full set right next to the ones already there. the probes keep the corp tag on them. there isn't character association data displayed ever. not sure if that is something that is just not programmed to be displayed, left out intentionally, or if the data isn't there at all.point being, if there is data behind the scenes that tie probes to a character, i don't see why they still can't be used after a disco."

9/26/2008,"supported :)to throw in a chip or two, if you look up any organisations or government bodies that have anything to do with disabilities or the ahem, elderly, they might provide you with help on implementing this :)i know the teletext font in uk tv channels changed overnight, because of something like that ;)and i also know of quite a few ui specialists that would jump to the opportunity to help out :)ps: people, please don't be so harsh. it's really rarely that these issues are addressed, especially in computer games."
9/26/2008,a lot of features are based on strictly colors and i certainly support changing them(or giving the option to change them).
9/26/2008,one of the 8% here. i find it hard to tell what is turning off or active or overloaded. so signed
9/26/2008,"i find it hard from time to time to see if a mod is on or not if there's a bright background. i support this, even though im not colorblind."
9/26/2008,i believe this issue was already brought before ccp through csm. the answer given at the face to face conference was that the developers would keep this in mind going forward(as a valid point) but not rework what has been done in the passed.
9/26/2008,"csm members-what business is it of ccp's if we've used a given password in the past and have decided we want to do so again? why do they need to keep a list of all the passwords we've used for our accounts? why shouldn't we be able to rotate a set of three or four passwords that we commonly use? most importantly, is their current policy a good one?in short, i think this is a nearly useless ""feature"" which keeps track of personal information that is not ccp's concern in the first place. i'd like to ask the csm to address the elimination of the message and preventative measures keeping us from reusing an old password. keeping track of passwords formerly associated with a given account is a pretty big security risk anyway, as those passwords may be associated with other non-eve personal accounts (such as e-mail) maintained by the account holders.thanks for your support."
9/26/2008,i'm not sure i quite get it.could you please refer to where you read that ccp keeps a log you have used in the past?thanks.
9/26/2008,"this is easy for anybody to test.just try to change your password in account management to any password you've used previously, and you'll see the issue.not only does ccp tell you that you can't, which is troublesome in and of itself, but that means they're keeping track of all the passwords you've used before."
9/26/2008,google password hashing and password storage before you start complaining.security 101.... this is industry standard... don't like it? go somewhere else.they just choose a higher standard than usual... they sure as hell don't know your passwords.t.t;;/me thumbs down

9/26/2008,"i agree with this assessment, it's simply an issue with people not reading what the contract says."
9/26/2008,"it is. and it does a pretty good job of it too - if somebody doesn't complete their side of an exchange contract, you get to appeal directly to the creators of the universe. can the bbb offer you that level of warranty?"
9/26/2008,having played eve now on various accounts since 2005 i have had plenty of experience in both empire and null sec conflict and it occurs to me that there has been a very important and distinct difference betweeen the two. in null sec alliances can live up to there full potential and in high sec they cannot.to me this represents a huge imbalance in the game.in null sec due to the abscence of concorde and gate sentries different corps in alliances are free to use modules on eachother that in empire will either get you concorded or leave you as a target for sentries..this leaves alliances open to various griefing corps in high sec that mercilessly exploit this imbalance.i feel it is high time that this be addressed in some way. let alliances in high sec have the same opportunity as there null sec brothers to live up to there potential.remote repping for the win!! up with remote sensor booosters!! down with friendly aggro.
9/26/2008,"not supported. there are risks you take when you enter null sec, hence more rewarding. fine the way it is."
9/26/2008,"mara, so are you saying that like 0.0 the repper/booster or what ever helping out is as targetable. what i mean is if you come in and rep you buddy in high sec are you now targetable?"
9/26/2008,"no, what she is saying (i think) is that while pilots in a corp can use remote repping modules on each other reasonably safely, it's highly risky for members of an *alliance* to do so if they aren't in the same corp. the reason for this is lag combined with eve's targeting interface.basically it works out like this. i'm in a fleet battle, and i'm shooting my war targets. fair enough. now my buddy starts getting aggro, so i target him and put a repper on him. still no problem. my target dies, and i carefully select the new primary and start firing. no problem, so long as i'm careful not to click on my friend, right? well, what usually happens next is that a huge lag spike hits just after you activate your weapons. the client delays activating your modules, and the new target is destroyed. your interface automatically picks a new target and activates your weapons on the new target instead of the old one. unfortunately, the new target it picked was your buddy.who is in your alliance, but not in your corp. instant concording.there is, to my knowledge, no way to prevent this from occuring. it doesn't matter how careful you are, if you have a friendly locked for rr or other aid when you activate weapons, you might end up fireing at the friendy. if the friendly is in your corp, it's ok, because firing on a corp member doesn't provoke concord. it's ok in nullsec, since there is no concord (unless your friend is really touchy about such things). but in high sec, it's instant and unavoidable death. and as i've stressed, there's no way to prevent it other than never using a logistics module.it gets worse, by the way. imagine, if you will, that you are in an rr circle, or something similar, when the above occurs. you get concorded. then the guy who's repping you gets concorded for aiding a ""criminal"". then the guy aiding him, and so on.the solution is not necessarily to change the concord rules, by the way. what needs to happen, in my opinion, is for the weapon activation to be linked to a specific target at the client the instant the button is clicked. that way, if lag hits, you get annoyed by the ""you can't target that guy because he doesn't exist/is exploding"" rather than losing your ship because of a poorly designed interface./supported"
9/26/2008,"becq, i understand what you are saying. i guess what mara wrote threw me a bit and i was trying to grasp the point she was trying to make. but she mentioned watching them die, so i assumed there were no war conditions and her alliance mate was involved in a suicide gank or can flipping incident where her mate might be in the same alliance but mara is not involved in the aggression between the two parties. i would like to see if there could be a little more clearer proposal before i vote one way or another. even you said ""i think""."
9/26/2008,"there needs to be a way people can lock targets separately... such as a ""friendly"" lock, and a ""hostile"" lock. maybe have two icons to lock with, and alter some keyboard commands... ctrl+click = hostile lock... shift+ctrl+click = friendly lock.each lock will only accept certain mods activated on it."
9/26/2008,"why make it complicated? just make the mods like energy transfer, amour, shield and hull reps and all other passive type stuff act like the ship cargo scanners. simple.only thing however if you are in a fight it would truly suck to have some one not even involved to start repping your opponent with out the ability to shoot the space priest."
9/26/2008,short answer: no.long answer: noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo.
9/26/2008,"missile skills have many compensatory disadvantages.in short while it's quicker to skill for a specific large type of missile, it takes longer to train for a class of missiles, because you have to train the short and long range variants separately.it's as naive to say that ""missiles are easier to train"" as it is to say that ""missiles always hit"". you're taking an extreme case. but let's look at the other extreme: to train t2 small hybrids (rails and blasters) takes ~280,000 sp. to train t2 standard missiles and rockets takes ~770,000 sp. the gunner can master his frigate class weapons almost 3 times faster than the missile user. we have the classic eve tradeoff: quick payoff vs long term reward. specialisation vs generalisation etc etc.in short: missiles are a different weapon type from turrets just as drones are are a different weapon type. each type has it's own skill characteristics & quirks. eg: surgical strike: +3% damage / level vs drone interfacing : +20% damage / level vs warhead upgrades : +2% damage/level. on the face of it, it's brutally unfair that drone specialists get ten times the damage bonus that missile users do, no? why do gunners get 50% more damage bonus for 20% less sp?"
9/26/2008,so i dont need to train large blaster specialisation(including medium and small sepcs) and large railgun specialisation(including medium and small specs) to use t2 all hybrids?its truth that misiles train easier. forgot abpout torepdoes rank 4 when others are rank 5 :d
9/26/2008,for my industry altit takes 32 days to get t2 torps100 days to get large close range weaponso you train 3x faster for bs class weapon. is this alright?about damage skills misile have much higher dps at start than turets. on all 5 they are 2nd most damage weapons. with no tracking. only thing is you neeed to wait 2 sec to get damage done. no big deal at all. who trains standard misiles to t2? and rockets? no one? ow forgot that crows that are 100% hiting things at 7km/s+ when turets would be 99.9% miss.
9/26/2008,"did you even read what i wrote? they're different weapon types with different characteristics. you're comparing apples and oranges. are you in favour of eliminating the different short/long range weapon type skills for missiles as well? how about the missile support skills which are substantially weaker than the gunnery ones? (rof, dps). oh and make missiles hit instantly too pls - my manitcore will pwn when it doesn't have to wait 20 seconds for it's shots to hit. in fact just turn missiles into another kind of turret and eliminate the missile support skills altogether - unless you're going to introduce seperate support skills for each kind of turret (hybrid sharphooting, projectile sharpshooting, energy sharpshooting...?). what about the fact that gunners get tracking/range mods? i'd love tracking computer scripts for missile velocity/explosion velocity.launchers are as different from turrets as drones are. deal with it."
9/26/2008,"while you bring up an interesting topic i tend to favor a reduction in requirements for t2 turrets, trying to get people into the ships they want to fly in a somewhat timely manner is important(although an extra month isn't so bad).although i think these weapons are quite different and as such require different requirements, long range versions especially rails are much more effective in fleet battles and often blasters can easily match torps in close range and provide other benefits like actually being able to do meaningful damage to small ships.i'd have to say based on the current metagame, this type of change is unneeded."
9/26/2008,"not this myth again. here are the sums of the ranks of the skills in the skill trees of missiles and each turret type, split into weapons and support skills:missile weapon skills: 50turret weapon skills: 41missile support skills: 26 (24 if you exclude defenders)gunnery support skills: 18missiles sum: 76 (74 if you exclude defenders)gunnery sum: 59the missile skill tree is significantly longer than each gunnery one, and contains no transferable skills. in return, the missile user has the option to start the skill tree at different points. it's balanced."

9/26/2008,"i know ccp explorers arguements, but why not make it a client mechanic where you can choose a ""reload all with x ammo"" and your clients split the database calls into several smaller ones, like it is manually been done these days by the user. that should avoid increased database calls while at the same time make changing ammo alot more comfortable for us.would that change the behaviour of users to change ammo more often? i guess so. maybe numbers would go up by one fourth of total ammo change database calls.is database calls a bottleneck in eve? dunno..."
9/26/2008,"while i disagree with explorer's arguments, it isn't something that can be eliminated by the mechanism you propose. the concern isn't eight database operations at once, it's that people will switch ammo more often when the ui for doing so gets less obnoxious. it has nothing to do with the distribution of database calls, and everything to do with the quantity. as for the number of extra switches, i'd wager it's low. people are used to spending too long on it, and they still switch when necessary. and in response to your last question, yes, database calls are a bottleneck in eve, and a really bad one. browse the market in jita to see what i mean."
9/26/2008,"i disagree with the op. marauders were designed for short range weapon systems alltogether (even the vargur is fine on pg, as it's not an artillery boat).also they were designed as pve specialists. if you want to use them in low sec area without any guardiance, well, your risk really. imho it was ccp's intention to not make them able to fit their primary weapon systems plus heavy neuts or other offensive or defensive (like remote reps) stuff, as with one eccm you would have superior pvp ships. and they were simply not designed for that."
9/26/2008,yep. pretty much nailed it.
9/26/2008,the fact is they do not live up to the description that ccp teased us with forever...that is a ship built to last in hostile space for extended periods...read the description..this is a horrible attempt at bait and switch imho..promise us one thing and deliver something falling far below expectations..and on top of that making them in some cases more expensive than there faction counterparts...meh!!

9/26/2008,"i have 5/4(and 3 adv. @ 5)there is the beginning where a player is new(i'm speaking non-alt) he needs a bit of time to get his bearings. having learning skills gives time for him to get to know the game before he gets confused by the variaty of things to do(i know my head was spinning when i started in 2003, even when i had my brother guiding me). this is even before we start talking about issues with macro miners and trialist exploitations opening up(having to many ""cannot be trained on trial"" would surely annoy anyone valuating if he should play the game or not). so learning skills does serve a point(to some extend anyway).on the other side, people say ""it's your choice to train them"", well sure it's your choice but you decrease your performance in the long run right away if you don't train them asap(and if starting now you're already 5 years behind which is hard enough to catch up to). also i feel it makes the game even more confusing for a newbie to enter the world knowing little and being gimped by _a lot_ of training speed compared to someone who had a friend giving him heads up about learning skills. learning skills aren't the same as any other skill since what you sacrifice with other skills by not training is efficiency of certain field or usability of certain module. what you sacrifice with learning skills is efficency to any field or usability to any module, that is until you have trained it.and in the end, i don't feel it's much of a character progression to decide _when_ you train something, it is rather when you're deciding _if_ you train something.mechanic that stands due to ""we had to do it, suck it up"", well that is one failed mechanic. personally i'm all for removing the learning skills(and adding base attributes by +11 or so) and giving those trained the option to spend the amount of sp in skills of their choices*. don't see ccp caring enough though to do any changes, so meh.ps. someone talked about implants adding attributes, i feel that is still character progression and spices the game up for all involved.*mind this would have to be done in a bit more complex manner since you might suck at fx charisma and rule at memory/int so using the sp for charisma primary skills would give you advantage since all the basics are mem/int and 2/5 are dependant on them."
9/26/2008,"i agree that you're hurting the character in the long term by not training them, but you can certainly take a less focused approach than ""omg! got to train all these to level 5 instantly before i can do anything else!"". after all, in 6 months' time will it really matter that the character took 2 hours longer to train heavy missiles than it otherwise would have done?i don't believe that a new player would really have too many issues with how fast his skills train - certainly not so much he would quit because they were too slow. i didn't have an issue with it at all when i started. i gradually phased the higher levels of learning skills in with my other skills and it was not a drag to learn them at all. yes sure, here i am 2 years down the line, probably a couple of days worse off than if i had learned them all immediately, but i've lost more training time than that just through forgetting/not being able to log in to change skills when they expire.however, if you're that keen not to hurt the new player experience, boost a new player's skill point acquisition times by, say... 25%, reducing by 5% every week or two, and ensure that aura has a section on skill training where she makes it clear that in order to maintain the skill point rate, certain skills need to be trained."
9/26/2008,/signlearning skills are an obscene waste of a new players time and nothing else.
9/26/2008,because its much more acceptable to progress training than killing thousands of npcs over....and over.....and over againlearning skills is the best system ever and it shoudl not ever be taken out of the mechanics of the game.0/10 for not giving good enough reasons.
9/26/2008,"what, much like the empire people having the same general concerns because they all encounter the same types of problems in empire?geographic proximity leads to the same problems experienced,i.e., if it is cold, people put on warm clothing when they go out. i somewhat agree with you about the levels of healthy debate but that seems endemic to all csm discussions rather than a particular grouping of problems.""nice"" ""kevin"" ""williamson"" ""approach"" ""to"" ""writing"" ""there"". that's the sort of approach that gets you flak. handily, i've pointed it out to you now so you should rectify that and, no doubt, get less flak.again, probably a consequence of too little debate and discussion. perhaps those adopting an issue could start by outlining the problem and leave the proposed fix to a subsequent post. once the problem is clearly understood, things should go more smoothly. i have no idea what you are trying to say here. this paragraph makes no sense put against the rest of your post. please elucidate.ugh, no. that system creates elitism where there shouldn't be any. one man, one vote and all that. pretty good idea. i'd support that for the next elections. it might need a shade of reworking, i.e., people get a few chances to vote at login, giving them time to look at the candidates. or something, iunno."
9/26/2008,"in my opinion, one of the hardest working and indeed best behaved csm members is lavista vista.now ccp plan to introduce a 21 year age limit for the next csm. this would put lavista out of the running. lavista vista has the right to run two full terms in office. support our campaign to have lavista given special dispensation to complete his time as a delegate.in order for csm to succeed, ccp shouldn't be ruling out the admittance of one of its better members for a second term! all the technical jargen that ccp have come up with were dealt with in the last election.plese go here and add your support."
9/26/2008,"having the right to run again and completing a term, is two very different things. yes, all delegates have the right to two terms, but each one is seperate from the other, in the sense that they are not counted as one period. as such, rules may change and they have. lv has the right to run for csm when he is old enough, acording to the rules put forth by ccp. until then, he must wait..."
9/26/2008,"look, our various operating system disagreements aside, i like lavista vista. he's a nice guy, and i've enjoyed alternately sparring and agreeing with him here on the forums.unfortunately, some of the under 21 csm's have shown an inability to handle the responsibility. thus ccp is raising the age bar to ensure a more mature csm group that will take it's job seriously. regrettably, this puts lavista vista out of the running for the time being. however, if he is still around in 3 years, he will be eligible to run again, and i will look forward to voting for him at that time.in the mean time, i would hope some of our more seasoned player base will step up and respectfully fill the chair that lavista vista will be vacating. that is the best thing we can do for him. to select an honorable replacement that will make him proud."

9/26/2008,who honestly cares the csm is justa farce anyway and nothing to do with ccp's original idea of people having access to ccp's data to ensure fair dev play.
9/26/2008,maturity isn't a digital thing.if lavista vista is doing a good job they should grant him dispensation.generally i do agree with that policy mind you.
9/26/2008,"maybe we should do it based purely off of experience and intelligence. those things you just named an 18 year old can do, require little to no intelligence whatsoever to do.a 21 year old can be just as immature. especially in mmos.and an 18 year old can be experienced and at the same time mature. all depends on the person.instead of having an age limit, the voting process should be more rigorous and based off of the persons reputationcharacterexperienceoverall intelligence and knowlegde of eve....and especially the knowledge of eve. i saw a csm post an incorrect statement about smartbombs that offended me. how can someone representing the playerbase have no clue as to the mechanics of smartbombs?the standards should be changed, i agree, but age shouldnt even be a main reason for doing so.there should be some sort of exam. we have to hold these people to higher standards....oh and of course have more voter participation."
9/26/2008,right so! let's all vote for goons. that'll show them.uhm wait ... is this part of another goonspiracy to take over the csm?edit: amazing ... seems like avatars got rolled back by several months. what happened on the servers?
9/26/2008,"i don't think he should be given special dispensation, but i don't think the rule should be there either. if you have people under 21 playing the game and owning accounts, then you should have the chance for under 21 people to be on the csm. afterall, as ccp are so fond of telling us, it's a teen rated game with a teen rated forum i can understand the concern about maturity, but i'd disagree that's neccesarily dictated by physical age...that said maybe 13 year olds wouldn't be a good idea but i can't for a minute imagine a 13 year old either having an interest, getting voted for, or being prepared to do all of the work required. 21 seems extreme. if an age cap is neccesary, i'd put it at 16 or 18 personally."
9/26/2008,"i can see one obvious reason for a minimum age of 18, one ""funny"" reason for 20, but i have no clue why ccp set it at 21. not that i disagree, but still...18: you have to be of legal age for the non-disclosure agreement, which all csm members must sign. for those that do not know what a nda is, in short, it's a legal document where you agree to stfu about everything you learn about ccp and if you tell anyone, you can be sued. there's way more to it, but that's the rough outline.20: legal drinking age in iceland is 20. so to go out and get some bree after the meetings, you gotta be legal"
9/26/2008,"some of the over 21s have shown the same thing.lv's focus of industry is not where my interest in eve lies, but if it did, i would want him representing it on the csm. i think he has acquitted himself better than any other member of the delegates so far. his term 'in office' has proven better than any argument that age is not a determinant of maturity.i think this is a nonsense rule if it goes through - if the player is over the age limit to play the game, they should have the right to stand and represent the player base (if voted in, and i have little doubt that if lv were to stand again he would win a second term).i noted in another thread though that he seems to have lost his 'csm delegate' tag in the forums... i've not checked any of the other csms to see if it is affecting them too, but i sure hope it's not related to this..."

9/26/2008,"interesting subject.sadly i couldn't tell you, as i have no idea whatsoever. but i must assume that the iceland offices are running off energy based on thermal power generators."
9/26/2008,would be interesting to know if its possible to cover some of the energy used by the great server with solar energy or something like that. i know investments in these areas are high but i bet would be a nice marketing project to have a solar run game server. not mentioning the energy costs in the long term

9/26/2008,"so how do the carebears get from 1.0-0.5 to null sec, that would segregate a fair percentage of players considering that to get to high sec from null sec you cross low sec...quite simply put eve already has the tools for new players to learn the game via the tutorial, missioning and now factional warfare. you already have new player zones i.e where you do your tutorials. eve caters for a certain mind set and basically if your not going to be self sufficient you will get no where (excludes jita scammers)."
9/26/2008,instead of making another nightmare it should get a 100% boost to nuets. same idea as fitting 4 guns to be as effective as 8 but with nuets.maybe with the speed nerf give them a bonus to web strenght as well.with two things they would be pretty cool.
9/26/2008,i'd love to see covenant ships inspiring fear instead of glee at the imminent gank.
9/26/2008,"as a big faction ship fan, i'd definately love to see this, but more so the whole of the blood raider range needs a bit of loving now."
9/26/2008,bam! that gives a huge disadvantage to players who regularly risk podding. your idea provides an even greater incentive to huddle in hi-sec.
9/27/2008,i agree 100%
9/27/2008,"so, what's up csm, any new info yet?"
9/27/2008,look at the new animation on the front page. looks awfully similar a modulated pos if you ask me.
9/27/2008,"it is not new i have seen i before, but only as picture still."
9/27/2008,support
9/27/2008,quick question; was the custom alliance logo submission totally cancelled?
9/27/2008,"there is suppose to be a new process blah blah blah something like that is coming out ""soon"""
9/27/2008,qft
9/27/2008,make all implants manufacturable as intended.
9/27/2008,"if the kid has the right ideas and the people vote him in, who are you to judge?"
9/27/2008,"i can see age restrictions being relevant in some cases. however, 18 and an actionable nda seem quite sufficient in this case. 21 is overkill, unnecessary and blocks one of the more effective csm members currently serving from extending his competent work by re-running.odd move, ccp."
9/27/2008,"an age limit is okay, but its wrong to blind side lavista with it. he has served well and should be allowed to continue to serve if he is elected a second time."
9/27/2008,lvv is great for the community and has done far more than most. no reason at all not to allow him to stand for re-election.
9/27/2008,"unless there are some very compelling legal reasons under iceland or international law (possible, something laws have strange quirks), i see no reason to implement a 21 years age limit. competence is much more important.18 seem sufficient to avoid legal problems for my limited legal knowledge."
9/27/2008,"huh? under 21 is banned from being a delegate? so much for: ""the youth has the future"".age is overrated ... you you get older than 40, you know, trust me. thumbs up for this proposal, although i think age limits are stupid.rb"
9/27/2008,lvv shouldn't be the victim of ccp's ignorance of his age before the first elections.besides hes a darn good csm delegate. pherhaps too good?
9/27/2008,"at the very least, i think ccp should give an explaination."
9/27/2008,"which is why he should be nerfed . . .(just a joke people, kidding)i think it is rather stupid to impose this, if they simply aare doing it because of the fanfest alcohol or whatever, then, it shouldnt be a problem, they have to respect icelandic law, which means he couldnt drink anyway( if he's under the age, ofcourse), why the hell should they impose another rule about it if one's already there?"
9/27/2008,"i agree with most people that the rule, especially imposed so late in the process, and so shortly before the elections smells of elitism and corruption. some csm want prevent other csm from running, and thus maximize chances of success? i fully support repelling of the rule in its current form, and giving lvv a chance to run again. especially since he was the only one who kept us updated on a dead horse pos issue, while rest of the csm was asleep, or ignoring it."
9/27/2008,"or generally ****ing around, like always."
9/27/2008,supported
9/27/2008,i support an age of 18 at maximum unless ccp gives an acceptable and credible reason as to why it should be 21 instead.
9/27/2008,viva lavista!
9/27/2008,"if he can get elected, let it happen."
9/27/2008,"i do not see that age means anything in this subject; clearly understands the game, the economics and the math, so let him keep working on it"
9/27/2008,"they were not ignorant, he asked prior to the 1st election. they gave a nod at that time. i am disappointed they are giving the no now."
9/27/2008,"barring some legal reasoning (that you think they would have known about before the first election), i'd say 18 could be considered a reasonable limit, but 21 is stupid."
9/27/2008,"if this is collision prevention then the current method is broken. the sensors of the ship flying towards an object should simply calculate the size, course, and speed of the object in its path then perform a two stage ignition of the forward maneuvering thrusters. stage 1: drop speed and shift course to avoid object stage 2: return to original course and speedneither ship goes off in a random direction at insane speeds. the ship avoiding collision drops in speed maybe 10% - 20% to maintain stable flight.in this way a frigate will have to fly a ways around a battleship or capital while the battleship or capital simply changes course 2-3 degrees well in advance to avoid the small ship.if you want to keep a guy away from a gate or a station simply get a large enough fleet to form a wall and prevent the ship from approaching."
9/27/2008,"ok having 7 jammers pointed at you and only being jammed 50% of the time is pretty ****ing good tbh. if a specialized ecm ship can't jam people reliably why even have them around? canceling out ships with a 1:1 ratio doesn't work well. a specialized ecm ship should be able to reliably jam multiple people unless they specifically fit to counter. throwing on an eccm does exactly that, maybe you get jam but to keep up reliability the pilot has to focus more jammers at you(and subsequently not at your buddies)."
9/27/2008,"no u, ur the bad poster.the eft shot you posted doesn't do anything to support your argument because only the dumbest of dumbasses flies a 7-jammer falcon on tranquility. drop down to 4 or 5 jammers to represent what you're actually likely to see in game and run the numbers again."
9/27/2008,"i will support this but only if0.0 players are forced to spend the same percentage of time that npc corp tax is , in high sec space .if after 6 months in an npc corp the tax is 50% then members of 0.0 alliances should be forced to spend 50% of their time in high sec space .after all why should this repeated argument that npc members should be penalised for not being able to suffer from war decs , not be applied with similar logic to 0.0 residents ?"
9/27/2008,"that statement only works if jurisdiction was held over land. your over american-ism fails. in eve you can leave a corp but still maintain your assets in the same place. its all about services on offer, and the immunity to war is sure a nice one worth paying 10-20% tax for."
9/27/2008,"the immunity in war is worth exactly 1 million and corporation management 1. all that is needed to build a 1 man corporation. if a player has no interest in a corporation (and someone in a npc corp has no interest in a payer corp) he has no reason to stay in a wardecced corp. his reply will be ""you wardecced my corp? i close it and go to another"". so again, no service rendered by the npc corps. and before you give the standard reply ccp has stated that the players have the right to avoid wardecs."
9/27/2008,thank you to all who gave their support to this proposal and took the time to consider this with an open mind.please do continue to add your feedback so that the csm may hold an informed debate.
9/27/2008,"that actually surprised me, i hadn't realised that ccp literally and specifically encouraged you to form an alliance to participate in rp content.and ofc, fw is rp content. figures."
9/27/2008,so your entire argument is that the alliances wanting to join should disband the alliance and form a large corporation.how does this change the powerful & wealthy part?your 4th paragraph describes one of the reasons large 'neutral' 0.0 alliances won't get involved. bob/rzr/tri aren't going to jump in if it requires the entire alliance to have a high standing with anyone of the empires for the very reason you describe - it will drop the standings of the members with good standings to other empires. if the players you say will be affected care about that change they will leave the alliance; thus decreasing its power and wealth.
9/27/2008,"ok this is my fifth account and once again im staring into the abyss of learning skills tbh i think it's time we did away with them all together but i would like to propose the following solution1 ) all new chars get there stats maxed with whatever they would be if they were maxed out 2 ) all existing chars get there stats maxed the same way3 ) all skillpoints invested in learning skill previous to the change be reimbursed to the player . as credits toward training to be spent how and when the player see's fit , so for example i you have 2.5 million sp's in learning you get 2.5 million sps to ""spend"" however you see fit whether it's battle ships five or whatever skill you want or you can hold onto them and spend them at a later date .so think about it you get free training dpending on what youv'e already spent on learning , if you spent two months on learning , you get all those skillpoint back in somewhere more usefull .i feel this is a simple and fair solution yay/nay?"
9/27/2008,"i've kind of gone off flying caldari cruisers. can i get the sp for that reimbursed too?also, i believe that navigation and evasive maneuvering to v are effectively mandatory skills for any ship, so i think we should remove them and just make all ships 25% faster & more agile."
9/27/2008,"or you could troll threads for attention removing skills you trained for your own purposes no , removing skills that are a barrier to being able to play the game yes"
9/27/2008,no
9/27/2008,"ccp effectively already pre-compensate you for taking learning skills to 4+4. at that point, you're already learning at ~90% of the rate of a character with 5+5 learnings. if you want to specialise and get that last 10% then, as with everything else in eve, you have to pay. and as with everything else, you get to choose between a quick payoff and a long term reward. you don't have to train learning skills. i certainly agree that it's a very good idea to train them, but i think it's an equally good idea to train evasive v too. bluntly, that 10% margin is less than the variance between having good and mediocre stats, between having the patience and intelligence to work the good ways at isk making vs the dumb grindy ways and consequently having the isk to use +5s.to put it another way: getting learning skills to 5+4 (which is what most ""veteran"" players have costs about the same as taking a single large turret spec from iv to v to get that last 2%.in essence you want to give everyone millions of free sp for no other reason that they're in a skill which you really want but don't want to spend training time."
9/27/2008,"just remove the damn learning skills. it hinders new players, and no reimbursement for those that have already trained all learning skills.1. remove learning skills.2. add +11 attributes too all toons3. more noobs will learn to enjoy the game quicker??"
9/27/2008,total removal seem excessive. removing the tier 1 skills and adding 5 to all stats (with some form of compensation for players that have already trained the skills) will seem reasonable. it will probably reduce the number of players that will start the game and then abandon at the prospect of a month of almost mandatory training for the learning skills before leaning how addictive eve can be .
9/27/2008,is it just me or people don't like to wait for anything anymore.
9/27/2008,"4. alts become vastly more powerful, especially disposable trial alts"
9/27/2008,no macro miner you can not fly hulks on trail accounts!
9/27/2008,"supported, epeen waiving & smack talking is part of what gives eve its flavor. and this would add another level to it."
9/27/2008,i hate this feature. hacking the server could give the passwords to most of my internet accounts because of how often i have cycled through passwords.
9/27/2008,fyi they don't have to keep your actual password itself. they can just run the password through some fancy algorithm to turn it into gobbledy****. then when you put your password in it runs it through the same gobbledy**** generator and compares the garbled passwords without even looking at the original password. if that's the case then there's no privacy problems so long as the gobbledy**** can't be converted back into the original password.it seems goo-k is censored... i didn't even know it was offensive.
9/27/2008,logs? well we don't see any anomalies in the logs. sorry we are unable to reimburse yo...oh wait. wrong thread.
9/27/2008,"i know they don't keep the password around, only the hash, but i hate this security ""feature"" everywhere i find it."
9/27/2008,google john the ripper. ccp needs only one hash in order for login authentication. everything else amounts to storing a set of hashes for passwords users likely cycle across multiple accounts at multiple sites. one hash lets a cracker have a decent chance at getting access to any account i have. he still has to find the account and has to get lucky. holding a list of those hashes gives the cracker an entire database of passwords i like and more chances to get lucky on any accounts of mine he can find.there is no reason to store old hashes. it unnecessarily streamlines the process of gaining access to large numbers of accounts. a good practice in security is always to limit the availability of sensitive data by having no redundant copies. ccp storing hashes would amount to redundant copies of credentials to other accounts where the user has used one of their common passwords.i expect a ccp reply on this. it's obvious from the behavior described that ccp is keeping old hashes in the database. it's a non-standard process that isn't necessary and increases user exposure. it needs to stop.
9/27/2008,my guess is they keep track of them just in case of an account being stolen.
9/27/2008,"if this is true, there's still no reason to prevent users from reusing the old passwords."
9/27/2008,"seems fairly straightforward (not that i'd know ofc ), do eeet should also be an option to enslave for those so inclined"
9/27/2008,"jade; can i suggest you frame it in a sense of just asking how the ambulation ""tools"" are progressing / any news on those?they sound pretty much exactly like what this is about. so rather than proposing anything new which presumably has more issues with getting traction, we just get some words back from ccp about how this is progressing. for reference, the ""ambulation tools"" were talked about here.""while an actual in-game demo of walking in stations will not be available until fanfest this november, ward was able to provide a few highlights of what the players can expect.# the ability for players to have npc characters ""working"" in their shops and offices (ie: a bouncer, receptionist) complete with custom conversation trees that the player can create!...with the ability for players to create their own conversation trees with npc's, this expansion opens up the possibility for players to create their own missions for other players. again, ward reiterated that they really wanted things to be player driven and open up the features to as much customization as possible."""
9/27/2008,"yep good idea, i'll add this question/clarification to the issue docs for sunday."
9/27/2008,"lovely. just some of the more pertinent questions off the top of my head, but i'm sure there may be others too... - will this be included in the first iteration of ambulation? - is ccp aiming to build this up into a fully-fledged system or is it more just a little side project?they're the two things i'm wondering most about at this stage. presumably they'd be coy about any specifics, but i think those two might be answerable even in an early development stage and should give us some things to think about (f.ex if it's just a minor deal, those interested in seeing it more fully developed can lobby for that)."
9/27/2008,while your at it why don't you refuse to give them skill books....and tech 2 weaponry... and lock them out of anything else..hell why not the game at that point.... so long as they are in a npc corp.
9/27/2008,"lets say you get your wish? then you have a flood of individual players creating their own corps, just to compensate. you will effectively bump up the already massive corporation numbers by the thousands.good job. thumbs down."
9/27/2008,"how 'bout making sp's recycleable. an example, you have say 1 mill. sp in missiles but for some reason you changed for turrets and never use missiles anymore, why not make it possible to recycle say 75% or something worth of skillpoints from a skill (or the total amount currently trained) you already know and adding them to another skill.maybe having a basket where you can store skillpoints for future use or just swapping them directly from one skill to another skill.now i know that it's not a waste to train different stuff but this way it will be easier for especially new players to test things around faster to find their ''profession'' and for a bit older chars to be able to take skillpoints in certain areas and add them to skills they actually use.can't see any downside but i bet people (and ccp) have their say and opinions as well.cheers."
9/27/2008,"what's nice about eve, is the fact there is no cap to what you can train. there's no need for respec, if you want to train turrets, you simply take the time and train it. if you get bored or need missiles for another ship, voila, you can use them, no need to respec back and forth."
9/27/2008,"since arriving at a common definition for this key value, the aforementioned 'market average', i continue to stand by my proposal to bring this issue to ccp via the csm. i see this as a 'user interface' or 'game database' issue, which i would be happy to see lumped into that category in a broader proposal. if you have already included this request in a csm petition, please post here to notify us that this thread is redundant.to address one suggestion i've heard, i also reject the notion that ccp is attempting to disguise the meaning of a term that is displayed in the 'buy/sell now' window, which is obviously there to help in evaluating whether or not to make a market transaction. therefore, disclosure of the equation or calculation method for this value continues to be requested, for my part."
9/27/2008,ok let me clarify..in the order of your replies..first and foremost this is not an attempt to change 0.0 mechanics..far from..its rather an attempt to introduce certain aspects heretofor unavailable in high sec due to certain limitations..for one currently it is considered an act of aggression for one member corp of an alliance to use certain logistics modules on another member corp of the same alliance..i only propose making this possible in time of war with in the narrow confines of said alliance..so im not talking widespread unregulated use.this would allow high sec alliances to realize there full potential in combat during times of war..hopefully that clarifies my meaning.
9/27/2008,"it was that way, but some ""genius"" used it as griefing tools, boosting rats in missions and complex so that the people doing them could not kill the npc and would finally succumb to the rats.as it was a clear exploit, as people could cause the death of a ship without any way to retaliate for the one losing the it ccp changed it. to correct the problem will require some code change (in the alliance or gang features), probably not a simple change. the idea of the ""friendly"" lock could be a solution but it will depend on implementation, making remote rep, energy transfers ecc. non aggressive act will simply reintroduce the old exploit."
9/27/2008,well with all the code changes required for fw and all the other big deal stuff someone please tell me why such activities couldnt be applied to improving empire play..again by making the changes specifi..war time only..as it is in order to fix the game ccp effectively broke it..and btw ive seen more exploitation of the fact alliances cant effectively support themselves in empire by small griefing corps..than i did of the aforementioned exploit..disappointed
9/27/2008,"not supporteddon't you think like this those empire corps who sepcialzie in empire warfare need an advantage over the nullsec inhabitants? just like the nullsec inhabitants have station , jump bridge, pos, capital and what not advanatages over these corps?its' two different worlds. big alliances are supposed to be weaker in empire. it's not their turf."
9/27/2008,"tough crowdi swear, every time i come to assembly hall, im flamed to hell and backedit: at least my post can get one +1"
9/27/2008,might have something to do with your lack of good ideas.
9/27/2008,seems i'm the only person who's using these windows?!?else this is just a little reminder bumb :)
9/27/2008,can we get the citadel torp issue looked at too?its about to pass 100 support votes (some people just put /signed and didn't check the box)
9/27/2008,bugger i forgot that one. i meant to add it but ran out of time before the deadline earlier (damn long working days :) if nobody else puts it up i'll make sure i advocate it to the agenda for the next meeting. i agree that the citadel torps do need looking at - and it is quite ridiculous how easily they get neutralized by smart bombs at the moment.
9/27/2008,"actually, i hear that the heatsinks from the server farm are sufficient to provide hot water and thermally-generated power for a small town nearby."
9/27/2008,"taken from the hompage of national energy authority of icelandabout 90% of all housing in the country is heated with geothermal energy; the remainder being heated mainly with electricity.the majority of the country's electricity (80%) is generated using hydropower; the remainder being based on geothermal power.only 20 to 25 % of the technically and environmentally feasible hydropower, and only 20% of the conventional geothermal potential available for electricity production in iceland, have been harnessed. i dont know where ccp are placed in all this, but if one looks at the average of iceland i can not see a reason for them not to use renewable energy."
9/28/2008,"approved...also a question, if this issue is not implemented, would it be possible to prevent npc corp players from looting/salvaging pvp wrecks, because it is pretty ghey to not be able to wardec offenders"
9/28/2008,i fully support the op.
9/28/2008,this thread is more about which vultures get to pick the bones..imho the loot should belong to the player who got killed..flag anyone taking it..
9/28/2008,more whines from people who never leave overpopulated empire and then complain that their mission was scanned down and looted.
9/28/2008,"not much to say, great idea."
9/28/2008,"really, they should have been exportable from day 1. supported as it's harmless but very helpful."
9/28/2008,any updates on when or what areas the bo class will be buffed?
9/28/2008,"i like lvv as a csm, but even if i didn't i'd be quite confused by this. it is, of course, possible that this is just something forced upon ccp by law somehow, and i'm hardly in a position to dispute the interpretation of icelandic law they've gotten from their lawyers(though according to wikipedia, the age of majority is 18 in iceland, and only 21 in 13 small countries and mississippi). but assuming it wasn't a lawyerly mandate, i can't understand what they're trying to avoid here. they know first-hand that younger people can be effective, intelligent, and mature representatives, and i'm sure i'm sure that icelandic politics isn't so foreign that there's never been a childish buffoon well over the age of 21 elected. this doesn't make sense as a ""we want csmers to be people worth consulting with"" move, and unless they feel a need to follow the age of consent in chad or singapore, it also doesn't make sense as a legal move, especially given that they've shown a willingness to accept parents cosigning ndas. and even if they weren't willing to accept that, they should say ""must have achieved the age of majority in both your home country and iceland"", not a flat 21. it still wouldn't help lvv for this cycle, to my understanding of his age, but it'd be better for all involved going forward."
9/28/2008,"this, and supported."
9/28/2008,"the age limit should be the lowest of the age one is considered an adult in the candidates home country and iceland. as much as younger people can contribute, there are very good legal reasons to have this set.it really is a question for the lawyers."
9/28/2008,i've yet to hear a sensible justification for this move.
9/28/2008,"i understand there is a csm meeting today, how much you want to bet they take the easy way to eliminate one of competition in the upcoming election and do not even discuss this."
9/28/2008,"thumbs up, really needs a looking into"
9/28/2008,"my thoughts exactly. lavista vista has shown himself to be as mature as the rest of the csm (possibly even more so in some cases). changing the rules like this after the fact, when it was brought up and accepted prior to the first csm seems mighty unfair to me."
9/28/2008,"first off, such an obviously undemocratic move would get them hammered in the vote. secondly, a bunch of them won't be running again, and thus have no reason to block lvv even if they were inclined towards such behaviour. thirdly, they're not all complete *******s."
9/28/2008,fourthly the issue came up after the deadline for submission to discuss at the meeting - no doubt it will be on the agenda for the next meeting tho or possibly the meeting with the devs.
9/28/2008,my sentiments exactly...(also in favor of suggestions to reduce it to 18...)
9/28/2008,"changing the rules under the current circumstances is just odd. normally this wouldnt matter, but since we have a csm member under 21 its a bit of an exception. the rule itself is ok, but an exception should be made for lvv."
9/28/2008,yes for the exception no for removing the new rule.if you were elected as a csm in the previous election or an alternate in the previous election you should be allowed to run again dispite the age limit. new applicants should be required to be 21 years of age.
9/28/2008,and whats the odds we ever will hear a creditable reason ? supported not only to allow vista the chance to run but all players over 18 or so as we the voters should decide who gets in.
9/28/2008,you know if you wanted me to make a more palatable falcon fit you could have just asked instead of being an asshat about it.
9/28/2008,"right. because all falcons fit 4 of every type of racial jammer, right? and fit 2 strength rigs as well as 3 distort ampsrecalculate your chances with a more realistic falcon fit:high: covops cloak, cyno gen, salvager, hml iimids: 10mn mwd ii, sensor booster ii, multispec ii, grav ii, mag ii, radar ii, ladar iilows: 3x signal distort amp iirigs: ecm range, agility"
9/28/2008,"hint: what if that falcon pilot needs to jam a sniper apoc, the single most dangerous ship a falcon pilot can face? what are his chances to jam it?"
9/28/2008,this discussion is not about how to fit a falcon so quit derailing it. the fit on the falcon isn't entirley relevant he would have had a fair idea i was flying gallente ships and seeing as we were in empire could have purpose fitted so i should probably put 6 gallente jammers on there if you really want to theory craft it.
9/28/2008,"actually the way you fit a falcon does matter for your argument.you didn't choose a rook, scorpion, or blackbird for your argument because in a fleet battle the rook/scorpion/blackbird will likely be targeted by anything it hasn't jammed immediately.in a fleet battle even 1 falcon (or rook/scorpion) can only reliable perma-jam 1 battleship. so to perma-jam a fleet of battleships would take a fleet of ecm ships. on the cruiser level ecm ships can do a bit more disruption. the ecm ship will be doing relatively low damage that its hac counterparts have to make up for so the battle should last longer.likely what you should be requesting instead of a boost to eccm or a nerf to ecm is for another look at how the falcon balances. for example since the boost to the falcon, how many rooks have been sold in comparision to before? is the falcon still being used in its role as a force recon or has it also taken on the role of combat recon from the rook?"
9/28/2008,the point is fitting eccm in small gang combat as a countermeasure doesn't work as much as it should but this thread is necro too much craptalk.
9/28/2008,"the thing is, that the players in npc corps, could make their own corp to avoid the tax, and join that, where they are unlikely to be taxed, unlikely to interact with other people, less likely to continue playing or join a real player corp.as for other players avoiding war decs, for most forms of income in this game that aren't missions/ratting, they simply need a char in a player corp who never undocks to wash the isk, totally free from harm.the reality is that you can not grief people out of this game, there are ways around it, which prevent the game population from tumbling to about 10% of what it is today. personally i regard getting people to leave their alliance/corp as success enough, and anything further as pointless. if you want the dyspro moons and 0.0 mining/ratting etc you have to be in a corp and usually an alliance. what measly amount people make in highsec npc corps is laughable, and impossible to remove from them anyway.taxes are not very much anyway, most corps are only around 5%, and it doesn't apply to any trade, mining, loot, contracts etc. it only applies to npc bounties and mission rewards (not bonuses).i'm not sure i get the problem here, you want people to remain in their player corps and keep dying ? that isn't going to happen, if they can't go and make isk they're simply going to leave the game, macroers will put up with the losses because they work on the scale that if half of them die they still make tonnes of isk. new players will simply quit, never to grow up to be a new player in a capital before they should be who you can kill and loot.all this will result in, is people avoiding wars anyway, and more new players leaving the game, not a single extra target will be created for people that wish to grief. can anyone here see anyway that this will work out positive for any player ?"
9/28/2008,"it is about short term goals, fitz. they want more targets now, it that will exterminate the specie later it is not important. sustainable hunting is never important for this kind of people."
9/28/2008,exactly.the only thing this does is penalize newbies that do not realize they can create their own corp and avoid the tax.
9/28/2008,"wtf are you smoking? you realise that if you force people to join corps, everyone will make his/her own because they dont want to lose the tax. and dude, just because you don't like that someone stays in a npc corp and smacktalks you and you can't wardec him, does not give you the right to go and kick em all out. so you need to stfu and leave us carebears alone. wow >>>> this way."
9/28/2008,fail
9/28/2008,"not supported.not just because i'm in a noobcorp, as i couldn't care less about my income. i'm not rich and i'll never be rich and i run the occasional mission for standing rather than money.fact is, that there is a significant npc corp population that are casual players. fact is that many npc corp players want to be in an npc corp so they don't have the hassle and obligations of being in a player corp, rather than the ""i don't have to pay taxes"" argument. it is a valid playstyle, and i see no reason why this playstyle should be punished.if you want to tax players in npc corps, then i demand the following services in return:1) the ability to change npc corp at will (with standing requirement).2) the ability to put up a pos.keep in mind that in addition player corps also have the extra benefits of:1) having people around to escort you2) having help for missions3) organized mining ops4) having means to avenge yourself if someone hurt you in any way or just ****es you offso why exactly should npc corps extract tax if they do not offer any service besides immumity to wardecs (which ccp stated are pay-to-grief, and are legitimate to avoid by corphopping and other tactics after all)."
9/28/2008,"there are hundreds of single player games on the market. this is an mmo.i think that after a predetermined amount of time in an npc corp, the taxes should start to go up incrementally until they hit about 50% after, say, 12 months."
9/28/2008,"imo this topic is interesting, but requires further thought (in this thread) before progressing to ccp.the ""some penalty against/encouragement for ; moving to player corps"" is a good concept, but 10% tax as a penalty doesn't seem like the best solution to me.if we think about it in a broader context; all the pros and cons of being in a npc corp combined with the picture of eve (and mmo longevity) being about player interactions;pc only non-mmo screen-savers are fun for a while, but they don't create the kind of binding emotional attachment to a game that does social relationships in a community - love or hate.then we have an exciting concept to enhance new eden."
9/28/2008,my boosted ares says yes
9/28/2008,"tbh, i'd support this on the caveat that you get asteroid kms when you manage to finally run an asteroid dry. let miners see who is truly the most awesomemest rock-crusher"
9/28/2008,"i agree. there are limits to imposing security. the least ccp can do is allow us, the players, who pay their payrolls, to rotate passwords of our own choosing.thumbs up"
9/28/2008,ok honestly till this was brought up i was unaware of the fact and find it quite disconcerting. just mere fact of the possibility existing that my passwords may be logged whether via goobly yada or actual log is discomforting to say the least. all i really have to say about that.
9/28/2008,thanx for informing me of this as i truly have been blindsided by it.
9/28/2008,"even wrose is the fact that when you forget your password, they dont send you it, they give you a password reset process instead.....what point is there in keeping track of all these passwords? ive gone thru several, for the sake of security, some lead to one thing, others lead to others, but i need to come up with new ones just for eve? because they are keeping track and storing them?no, this is a security list, and its not something they should be doing, unless they were to turn around and say ""hey. heres your old password"" then its completly useless!take this feature away, its anoying and unnescary"
9/28/2008,"good security would actually make you change it every 30 days and not allow people to use simple passwords without non-alphanumeric characters etc. password hashing on the other hand means they are not storing your password, they are simply storing a non-reversible hash of your password, which you can get from your password, but you can not get your actual password from the hash. this is just an extra layer of security which shouldn't be needed anyway, but the more the better.it is good policy to never use the same password for two separate sites unless the security of none of those passwords is important to you. don't use your eve password for other sites, don't use important passwords like banking passwords for eve. the fact that they store your past password should be of little concern considering they are storing your current password (albeit hashed) which is all anyone needs, your past passwords are of little use unless you personally are employing much much worse security than ccp are attempting to."
9/28/2008,"this is because they don't store your password. thus are unable to send it to you !!! this is good security. what good is your old password to you if you can't remember it anyway !yes !!! you do ! that is good security! a hash is one way encryption, the process is the same and non-reversible, when you change your password they hash it, and store the hash. when you enter your password, they hash it an then compare the hash you entered to the hash that is stored. to be overly simplistic, say your password is 'ag' a hash may in the simplest form add those two chars together and store your has has 1+7 = 8.when you go to type your password in, it hashes it, and gets 8, which matches the hash stored, and lets you in.if someone gets hold of the hash, all they have is the number 8. if they know the hash algorithm in addition, they can 'guess' that your password is ag, bf, ce or dd, but they still don't have your password. with a more complex hash, and a good password this becomes incredibly difficult to even come up with a list of potential passwords. the longer and more difficult your password, the harder it would be to even guess a list for if someone was to get a hold of the database and the hash function it used."
9/28/2008,rule number 1 .never listen to someone who wants to take away a security feature..ever..massive troll thread...bad idea.
9/28/2008,"lies. if i had to change it every 30 days, i'd be writing it down at my computer desk, either in .txt or in hardcopy. i trust that less than i trust my long-term security provisions at present. also, i'm not supporting this thread because i'm worried about ccp storing old password hashes(because until quantum computing becomes functional, i'm not), i'm supporting it because banning you from using previous passwords is stupid - it only makes sense in the context of forced password changes."
9/28/2008,"believe what you will, this is a legitimate concern, not an attempt at trolling. negative response has been minimal, and nobody's slinging any personal insults (thankfully).this is not a security feature, anyway. it's a mere inconvenience. i've learned that changing passwords 6 or more times will likely free up the original password, as the server only retains a certain number of old hashes.so if circumventing this ""feature"" is so easy, why have it in place in the first place?"
9/28/2008,"the practice of keeping old password hashes is a pretty standardized practice across many industries.so please, explain why this is a security risk?"
9/28/2008,"yea free the slaves, even if we don't get an enslave button right away."
9/28/2008,"since this is something that is going to be looked into, it would be nice to have some sort of status page that can show how many slaves a certian corp/player/allaince has freed/enslaved. that way we can have another thing to epeen about and also give players looking to deal with slaves an easy way to find a respectable corp. an example would be a player who doesnt want to bother with the process of freeing a slave could look up the info for u'k or em to see how successful they are in freeing slaves. it would be a definite boon to normal players, especially rp alliances"
9/28/2008,"my minmatar tribe will not sell freed slaves, and we can't just leave them in our hangar. we have to dump our slaves in the trash hoping that they get out alive and get away to freedom."
9/28/2008,"my 0.02isk into the csm meeting|vote;nice idea for all the right rp reasons.there is a game mechanic to enable this already; agent missions.so suggest establishing agent missions to convert one to the other;- the reward or cost for the agent mission is proportional to the base-price difference.- the agents offering the mission are places in 0.4 or lower space, so no problem with contraband rules for the empires (ie. enslave or free slaves in the border zones).- balancing issue is frequency and quantity for the missions offered.- the mission locations will be wonderful combat zones for all the rpers opposed or supporting- the rp of settlement of placing the outpost (formerly) named iss fabrica in (formerly) minmatar space will actually work, as i can actually free 1500 slaves.added bonus is low-sec gets more love."
9/28/2008,"ok. now i know most of you are like stfu. carebear. etc, etc.but i come with a real problem. most missioning occurs in caldari space, most notably around jita. gallente is mostly lowsec, along with some of amarr space, and minmatar. now why would they crowd around caldari space? because you have access to a high end lvl 4 agents in high sec. so every mission runner from here to there gathers to run missions in safety. i suggest, and remember, i am trying to help here, that we make more high end lvl 4 agents in high sec around eve and therefore reducing lag overall (hopefully). i don't think it's about mods, but if everyone could run missions for whoever without the whole ""i have to mission in low sec so **** this"" thought, missions would be more fun, encourage a more even base of missioners in eve and potentially reduce lag in jita and eve in general.but just a small thought from me. later."
9/28/2008,"people mission primarily in caldspace for two reasons. 1) cn is the single best missioning corp in the game, because it's got the best agent progression across all four levels - high effective quality, 95% combat agents in contiguous highsec at each level, with a big pile of good l4 agents to finish it off. the other navies tend to be missing one or more of these things - either they don't have a worthwhile l2-l3 agent, or their l4s are in lowsec. 2) everybody rolls achura, starts in caldspace, with cald ships, working for cn, and because of the above, they never need to change. the thing is, there's a lot of good l4 agents out there that aren't cn, but the corps that host them are a pain to work up to. i work for a l4q18 combat agent, with my storyline agent in the same station(thus giving me corp standing in huge blocks as well), but in order to use this agent, you have to get to 6.9 standing without ever using an agent that has more than 50% combat. most people aren't willing to do this - which is why i have one of the better agents in the game and zero lag - but this sort of situation yields the problem you mention. it's not that they don't exist, it's that people are more willing to eat lag than they are to do extra work to avoid it."
9/28/2008,"is it not also possible to work up your caldari faction standing so that it is high enough to use 4s? my faction is in the high 8s at the moment and i am pretty sure i can use every caldari-aligned agent there is (except maybe r&d, but i don't care about them) - certainly i have access to 4s in caldari aligned corps i've never missioned for, but i do admit i've not checked every agent in every corp ..."
9/28/2008,"there are plenty on agents in all regions, either put a bit of effort in and find them or stay in the lag systems, sure some of the rewards will be slightly less but surely the less lag will make up for this and also less looters popping in to ""help"" salvage. also on the subject of cn lp store there are plenty of caldari corps with the same mods in stores and several not in caldari space at all so if this is part the reason then it just lack of research by the missioners who are happy to moan about how busy there mission system is without ever thinking they can solve their problem themselves and find a quiet agent off the beaten track a bit with perhaps slightly less q but certainly with less lag."
9/28/2008,"is there any realistic solution to these problems? because to be honest they are damaging all aspects of the game...1. while isk selling is not 'allowed' people are doing it because there is a market for it, otherwise theyd stop. this makes for a 'richest in rl means unbeatable in war' game.2. mineral prices are dictated by isk farmers and macro's, not real miners.3. manufdacturers are being priced out of the market because macro's and isk farmers are making t1 modules and selling them for less than mineral value just to get money back quick so they can then sell the isk.4. gtc sellers are now really taking the p*** by pricing people out of the game entirely since the 90 day card loss. i have no problem with people selling gtc's at fair prices.so, what can be done to cambat these things? and more importantly will ccp actually combat these issues at all?"
9/28/2008,"there are partial solutions, as a ""final"" solution will require to change human nature.ccp can't change the mind of people. so the only system is to punish isk sellers and buyer through bans and purchased isk removal. and that is limited by the number of people that can be devoted to it without increasing the cost of the game. i think ccp is doing about as much as possible.not really. there are plenty of factors dictating them, macro are one of them but not the only one. sadly player miners aren't the most important factor as mining with guns is very important. isk farmers shops work for the money, minerals are easy to sell, so unless there are contingency reasons like moving the minerals to a better market or a glut of some specific mineral, they aren't building stuff and selling at less than mineral cost. who do that are the mission runners without the skills or knowledge to reprocess the loot for the minerals. t1 loot (converted in minerals) is more than 20% of the reward in my mission in amarr space. all those player that haven't trained the refining skill will gladly sell modules for a price between 70 and 90% of the mineral value as it is more of what they will get reprocessing them. fair price is what the market will accept. little to do with isk sellers, much more to do with less sellers and more buyers as the $ in rl are harder to get. yes, ccp is fighting them, reporting the isk sellers and suspected macro will help (but don't hope for a immediate disappearance of the suspected macro, investigations require time and manpower). not buying isk and discouraging friend from buying isk will help too."
9/28/2008,"isk farmer problem exists for a few years and all we hear, that ccp ""doing something"". in reality, most of 0.0 space is infested with isk farmers. as low-secs too, where transport missions can be runned with a pach of macro alts. if ccp wanted to kill this problem, this could be done easy by combing 0.0 space and checking transactions of raven ratter. but it takes time and people resourses to do the job. easyer to put it off on brakes, only responcing to petitions.+these they are also ""paying"" for a game with gtcs. and they don't care about gtc price, average ratter can make up to 500m+ per day. so price of 600-700-800m is not a problem for them. and each our of not ratting is impact to rl money income."
9/28/2008,need quick button to report isk spammers and etc
9/28/2008,"#1 is unrealistic - how many people want to spend thousands on a game? - but probably the best of the ones you make, because the other three just demonstrate spectacular ignorance. re #2, it's easy to allege that macros provide the majority of the minerals for the game, but i'd want to see hard evidence of this before i believed you. it looks to me more like it's a mix of human miners, both in 0.0 and highsec, and npc-looters. re #3, there does not exist a market in manufacturing t1 items because t1 items drop in missions. the market is people with low refining skills selling them to people with high refining skills, and maybe a few inventors. your explanation is just nonsensical - minerals are far easier to liquefy than items. re #4, a fair price is what people are willing to pay. it's a free market of pure exchange between two types of currency. just because you don't like the price going up does not mean that the system is broken."
9/28/2008,"make me dev for a day, i could charge through lonetrek and ban at least 300 accounts of cnr isk farmers."
9/28/2008,"and at least 150 of them will be regular players that you think are isk farmers. for you it can be acceptable, but ccp live selling the game, and ""charge through"" banning suspects without checking is not the way to keep the game going."
9/28/2008,"the drop rates of these are beyond sad. they used to be found in cosmos, and now who knows where you can get them with exploration. but the fact is, the prices have gone through the roof, the means to try and find them, and the risk/time involved is way out of whack... not to mention those they do find them in bulk are simply farmers.i don't know how the actual change needs to be made, but something needs to be done to make these as common as they once were.this is a support for ccp to examine decryptors."
9/28/2008,"no please don not turn everything into useless garbage... please keep drop rates in line with demand, we don't need market floodingi like how decryptors rise in price"
9/28/2008,"summary of my input at csm meeting:- could be done using existing in-game objects (ceremonial circle, minmatar art et. al) with a market price, expire like cans and have no practical value- would require anchoring restriction to reduce risk of uber lag at gates, planets, moons.overall: wait for this until after walking in space (ambulation) is out, and the features offered there!"
9/28/2008,if we can't implement a rating system what about simply making contracts a required skill to make a contract (instead of being able to use one) and then make the contracting skill not available on trials? that would probably remove a lot of trail members from scamming.-jonas
9/28/2008,lmao...getting desperate for war decs are we....hahahaha
9/28/2008,"and, why not make it so that anyone in an npc corp pays 90% tax, learn at 50% speed and cant use any hardners or tank modules, that would teach them a lesson! maybe then theyd play this game the way a real man would! well, i say game but in reality this is a tough world and fun shouldnt come into it at all, just grind grind grind, like the real world.why should anyone be allowed to enjoy eve? goonswarm for the win, they play fair and dont interfere with anyone elses enjoyment at all! hey timmc, join the gooners, your exactly the kind of pilot theyre looking for."
9/28/2008,"yeah i change my mind, tax thread sounds better."
9/28/2008,just cause u cant live without a player corp doesnt mean you have the right to dictate the rules on what players have to do to get the 'cool' ships.i think the biggest problem is the fact that you get sick over a game. you really do need to get help.
9/28/2008,"as much as i would love to dump some of my useless skills and finish fighters v or [insert race here] carrier v in a matter of days i must say no. as it was said before eve does not limit your max skill points (unless you cant afford a new clone for some reason) and you can easily switch skills you are training. the only way i might ever possibly support this is if sp that have been moved cannot be moved again. i.e. under each skill level bar you get a second bar that shows how many if any skills have been boosted and the minimum level you can reduce it to based on how skill points have been add to that skill in the past.for example: i have level 4 rank 3 skills a and level 0 rank 3 skill b, i dump level 4 of skill a and gain level 1 and 2 of skill b. if i then choose to remove skill points from skill b it must remain higher than level 2 because those skill points have already been moved.remember you are messing with peoples brains here, neurons can only handle so many reconfigurations before they fail."
9/28/2008,"no.being able to retrain for the fotm overnight will just make things in eve very dull. everyone would be fly the same ""uber"" ship and setup at the same time."
9/28/2008,"i also think this is a bad idea, not only for the before mentioned ways to exploit, but also with a game like eve you never know what is going to be needed at a later time. i previously thought that having amarr ships skills was a waste of time until i saw the ship of my dreams...mmmm...curses are so sexy"

9/28/2008,just out of curiosity as i don't see it on the list of things to be discussed.is the pos flogging the dead horse proposal going to be addressed at all during this meeting?edit: added link
9/28/2008,"actually, yes, ccp is planning on moving to 100% solar power for their server farms in the interests of going green. in wholly unrelated news, downtime is being extended to an average of 12 hours per day. seriously though, they get their power off the national grid, just like everyone else. their offices in iceland are mostly powered by being on top of a volcano, and the servers in england are mostly powered by hydrocarbons of various types, with a large minority of nuclear power. they'll have backup generators(that i can almost guarantee you run on diesel fuel), but for day-to-day use, they get their power from the standard power generation system. it hasn't been financially practical to generate electricity for private use since the early 1900s."
9/28/2008,they use nuclear hamsters fed by the tears of hippies.
9/29/2008,"i find this quite a difficult one to comment on. on the one hand, yes it's damned irritating when someone loots the wreck you just killed. on the other hand, this is eve and for all of the restrictions we already have (and with good reason) it should be a sandbox, and a career of thieving from kills should be just as feasible as a career in can-flipping.in addition, nothing anywhere says that pvping should be profitable. indeed when the question about rewards for fw came up, ccp replied 'pvp is its own reward'. that doesn't mean you can't make money via pvp, real pirates prove that all the time, but to expect it if you're not engaged in piracy is the wrong attitude.it's a purely high-sec issue, because everywhere else, if someone steals from a kill you just made, you have the valid option of blowing them up as well. we fight over all sorts of things - the right to loot seems as good as any.i think i'd cautiously support dual-ownership of dropped cargo (the 'contents' of a wreck). i'd not do it the way the op suggests because it's overly complicated and would be a nightmare to code. a simple 'corp 1 is the ship's owner' and 'corp 2 is the corp of the member who most recently put a blow on the ship and is wardecced with corp 1' would be about as complicated as i'd be prepared to take it (which neatly avoids the loot from suicide ganks being flagged, as i don't think they should get any assistance against thieves). visually indicating anything more complex (ownership is visible remember) would get silly. one corp name in white as currently, and one below in red or some other easy-to-distinguish colour, would seem good.i have absolutely zero time for any notion that changes salvage rules, which is not what the op brought up. salvage belongs to no-one - first person with a salvager nearby wins - i see no reason to change this time-honoured practice endorsed by ccp time and time again."
9/29/2008,o.o !!! /signed
9/29/2008,"well maybe the original intended state was found undesirdable by ccp and now they are out of ideas ? i think the bo class was added for impressive rp but fails to deliver (same as stealth bombers, great concept on paper, sounds very fun, but horrible implementation ingame)."
9/29/2008,"supported partially.1 skill queue onlyskill still continues training if account disabled, but the queue does not.simple and quite effective, and makes char farming impossible, but gets you through 2-3 hour skills easier."
9/29/2008,"i'd leave it to ccp to decide how to balance the precise attributes and ranks and so on, but yes supported.edit: or instead of having the potential cons of instant travel and 0.0 alliance hyper-blobbing, keep jump clones exactly as they are and deal with one popular reason we have jcs: implants. separable implants and clones as described by raven timoshenko.not wishing to derail the thread, just pointing out there are alternatives that directly address at least one reason why people may have different jump clones."
9/29/2008,"jump clones as they stand today already reduce the significance of geography in eve. each increase in the ease/frequency/quantity of jump clones or alts per account, further worsens geography to the direction of insignificance.this is a bad thing for eve, as less difference in geography means;- less differentiation in trade markets- less importance and ability to apply territorial holding- less consequence in choice of battlefields/location- less consequence of hiding in a station (can't lock me down, i'll just jump clone)and generally moves eve towards a single monotonous landscape.weight it up .. reduce all of the above vs. having a shorter jump clone time?which do you think it better to have?"
9/29/2008,"very very good read - various others have already pointed out potential difficulties but overall well worth implementing in the game vs what we currently have. nicely done.edit: if ccp find the merc stuff too problematic, as clearly that is the area of biggest debate, the bounty system proposed alone is extremely good."
9/29/2008,"this has another consequence, which is all your transactions you'd need to select the wallet division that it came from; so effectively you'd need the ability to set a default wallet division.a simpler implementation of this, might simply be a place you could move cash to/from, but doesn't have any other accessibility for eg. trades etc.additionally, all the eve apis that support wallet export information would need to have additional support for the balance in any ""savings"" wallet.the key question is; is adding this functionality worth it given the increased complexity to player wallet management?what are the opinions of the people here?"
9/29/2008,"i would tend to think that this has to be an opt-in system. how it can be ""hidden"" from the average player without not giving them the knowledge this is possible, i'm not sure though."
9/29/2008,"i support lv's re-election.additionally, if a parent signs for the minor, wouldn't that take care of concerns regarding liability?"
9/29/2008,"that is correct. and this was also the case with my nda, thus making it valid. this invalidates xhagen's claim that it's due to legal reasons."
9/29/2008,"exactly, any nay-sayers are full of fail and po0pey.and like to take it in the p0oper.poop."
9/29/2008,"bizarre - especially considering i've held mature debates with 15 year olds and heard thoroughly immature rubbish from 30 year olds... blanket generalisations never go anywhere good.edit: besides, at the age of 18, in a lot of countries, you're old enough to drink, drive, vote, and have sex (preferably not at the same time) - i dare say those are vastly more important issues than whether or not you participate in a csm about an internet game, so 21 seems a very odd choice."
9/29/2008,its not fair on lv and he has been doing arguably the best job on the csm. either give him an exception to the rule or better yet lower the age to something more sensible like 18.
9/29/2008,"if there is a limit it should be 18. any 21 year old limits are ridiculous anyway, including underage drinking related laws."
9/29/2008,"not only does the iclandic eqvivalent to systembolaget only have two sorts of ale and trappist beer, this is even more backwards.drop it to 18."
9/29/2008,viva lavista!!
9/29/2008,"levista vista should get grandfathered in because he has already signed all the legal documents from last time, and has proven him self a valuable member of the csm. also 18 is more reasonable for democracy, and that is age of majority in most countries."
9/29/2008,agreed. another solution must be found.i am also very disappointed to see that such a thread is necessary...
9/29/2008,"yes, create more blobage, please.."
9/29/2008,*undock*explode
9/29/2008,i don't care about blobs as any plan to change bumping would only result in bring in more ships so you dont have to bump them to kill them.
9/29/2008,"i'm inclined to support this if no-one can come up with a really good reason how it will damage the markets.negative effect on individual traders i don't see as significant as the benefits and realism of corporations being able to manage their assets. this scenario could be balanced with a longer time-out for modification of corporation orders by corp members other than the original seller/buyer.it needs to be taken into consideration what is happening with the corporation wallets - corp member a, modifying the order of corp member b, would need to have the same corp wallet access to ensure the taxes et. al all went to the right place. otherwise there is rife opportunity for scam and unnecessary complexity."
9/29/2008,"good point, thumbs up"
9/29/2008,so you'd like to see that jf jumping out of high-sec wouldn't be possible?at least it would be more consistent that way.you can jump in/out to/from high-sec or you can't.makes more sense than this strange compromise.also when there were high-sec pos you could jump to you'd open a can of worms when people want to jump from high-sec to high-sec. now that would be funny.
9/29/2008,"geddon has 17 fyi (thats less then an avg bc). all caldari have 22 or more and average would be around 21. as to the dual eccm fitting eft shows optimal numbers and doesn't take range in account. even then it can reduce change from 88% to 38% (at optimal, no fleet bonuses or overheating). with a 4 times multi all level v falcon pilot. (98% to 48% with racials)so countering 4 mods with 2 opposite mods is rather significant. but the pilot can also choose to use two sensor backup arrays and reduce it even further 13%. and there is the point where it gets questionable if 4 mods vs 4 mods should equalize or not. jamming has the range falloff penalty but eccm/backup array don't.one could argue of bs would get a few extra sensor points. if you look across the board the way sensor strength is divided to class/size 20 should be minimum for a bs. (same goes for command ships which have the same sensor strenght as their t1 versions and are just above cruiser sized ships) eccm could get a small percentage increase or have the stacking penalty removed (since it reduces the chance of getting jammed by 50%). but you also can introduce a rig that amplifies the eccm effect to counter jammer that uses rigs to amplify the jamming. there is a sensor strength booster in the itemsdb database but that has a 100% increase of sensor strength. which is basically the same as a t2 racial eccm (of 96%). but its not in the game so its considered being overpowered which makes sense. so changing it in a eccm amplifier with penalty to cpu or speed could be usefull but you still end up with a gimped fit. having a ship with a sensor strength over 150 (more than a carrier) hardly makes sense.another option would be a skill that increases the eccm (and counters ecm related skills) which should require same prerequisites as the ecm skills. (eg fm skill)and after a few hours of looking at the numbers it seems that with the skill bonuses, rig bonuses, amplifier bonuses and ship type bonuses the falcons are very powerful ecm vessels.tl;drrevise standard sensor strength mechanism for ships alltogether.buff eccm"
9/29/2008,"i think eccm should be ecm counter-measures, not defense. if you fail a cycle, there should be some kind of penalty like being jammed back forr 20 secs, or losing cap regen, or being auto scramed for a duration and so on."
9/29/2008,"as was pointed out before, while a 50% chance on a target with a dual eccm seems like a very powerful amount, the falcon pilot can only achieve this by using all seven of his jammers on the eccm'ing target. and if that falcon is jamming only 1 target, his buddies are probably busy shooting the crap out of the falcon (especially because it didnt fit a sensor booster or range rigs and is probably less than 120km from his target). and when a falcon is being shot, it doesnt survive for long :(no support, falcons are fine."
9/29/2008,"i think we need to be careful here about what the problem is. the problem is not a falcon or other jamming ship being able to perma jam pretty much any single target. that's fine in my opinion, if you put the training in then they should be very effective at jamming any ship. the issue is that if you choose to try to counter the jamming by fitting one or more eccm it is very ineffective. even by sacrificing 3 mids for eccm on a bs you can still be easily perma jammed by a single jamming boat(have a look at recent cown movies for proof!)i think if you sacrifice so many slots to defend against a single form of ew then it should be much more effective than it currently is. my problem with jamming is that no matter what you try, there is no real effective counter. its becoming the norm to see multiple falcons in any gang for this exact reason and as a result its becoming over powered. a drastic increase in eccm effectiveness is needed to give us a way to fight back."
9/29/2008,"you think there is more interaction in a single player corp than in the npc corps? you are totally wrong. the members of the npc corps are some of the more supportive i have seen in eve, even if they are lacking most of the tools available in corporations and alliances to collaborate with other players. at the same time the npc corp channels are used to scam, recruit and a lot of other options that don't work so well in the local channels. so people in the npc corps are living in a mmorpg and interacting.if you and your friend are incapable of recruiting if is because you are incapable of offering something better. if you want more targets to wardec get lost."
9/29/2008,"you may want to do some research, a very large amount of most mmo's players time is taken up by solo play."
9/29/2008,"realy? where does it state that i cannot chat/gang/shoot other players while in npc corps? lot of ""pirates"" are in npc corps exactly because they cannot be wardeced. you think they don't interact with other players ?i love the people misusing the mmo label. it says only that there are many people in a world where they can interact. it does not say you are forced to interact in any way ..."
9/29/2008,i will support that when someone supports getting rid of all non-consensual pvp in high sec which is what the vast majority of people actually want there.the % of people who hang around in high sec looking for pvp may be loud on these forums but are tiny compared to the playerbase. why can't people just admit it high sec is for pve and socialising
9/29/2008,"it never ceases to amuse me that people equate npc corps with solo play. they're not. go learn a little about the game before you comment on it. plenty group in npc corps via private channels.to those arguing it provides an incentive to go to player corps: your player corps really must suck if you now are asking for a game change to promote your recruitment. have you considered that perhaps what you demand and offer isn't the right thing?as for solo play itself - what pray tell is wrong with solo play? what is wrong with solo pvp? what is wrong with solo trade? how does one propose true capitalism works in a non-solo capacity? if solo is so bad, why do we laud those who go out and get kills solo against superior odds?so go show them. i don't see why a tax helps that at all. if anything it's an irritation to encourage people to quit sooner.you argue that thousands sit in a system and grind for ages. assuming we're not including the farmers that ought to be petitioned, why aren't you making an alt in, say, sak chat and encouraging those people to go and see the world, if so many are truly like this? i'd have more time for yours and others' supposed passion if your actions reflected this ideal, but they don't. the vast majority of people posting and supporting this idea don't strike me as the type to welcome new players with open arms but with locked weapons.i'm all for encouraging a social game, encouraging a game where we work as cohesive groups - none of this however requires a player corp, it just makes it a touch easier, and you're never going to change the game to the extent where it does and keep subscribers.carrots, not sticks. if the player corp community has failed to attract people into player corps, the only group to blame is the player corp community. the immaturity visible in this thread just goes to illustrate why.mmo does not mean 'force people to socialise with me!'. learn what mmo means, then come back and comment."
9/29/2008,"i am less worried by these proposed changes than some of my militia counterparts, but still cautious about them. we already have an element of blob warfare at times, even some occasional pos warfare, and for the most part those that can't stand that form of warfare steer well clear and fight somewhere else, but it's still not a trend to be encouraged. unfortunately if the enemy tactics are entirely blob-based, you end up being forced into that mode of warfare, and i do know that quite a few in the amarr militia have expressed distaste for capital warfare, blobs, left 0.0 combat for that reason, and have no desire for its return.i object to this notion that fw is 'pvp with training wheels'. it isn't, but it does have newer players trying it, and that is a good thing. what it is however is a sec-hit-free, no sp limit, easy way to find quick fights in low-sec, close to a high-sec base of operations and learn about pvp. if i was going to attribute a reason for the reduced militia participation recently it's that the combat used to be a lot more small-gang and roaming, and people actually committing to fights they might not win; lately i have noted a trend of larger and larger fleets, and often said fleets run at the sight of an even-remotely similar force. fighting huge battles with 80-100+ ships is dull, laggy, often has capitals, and has no real way for the individual's skills, player or otherwise, to make any difference. fw encourages, nay requires, small t1 ships like frigates and destroyers. how can they operate when someone hot-drops a carrier fleet on them? let us not forget that fw is in low-sec and for many it was hoped to be the return of the roaming small gang, but on a larger scale.i can see a benefit from large alliances joining fw if they provided funding and support to the militia beyond direct military intervention, as the biggest criticism by those new to pvp is that funding pvp is expensive when the enemy keeps fielding carriers and battleships. somehow i don't see the alliance coffers or resources being made available though.i would strongly argue for the operating area of factional warfare being increased if larger alliances can participate, to reduce the chances of one large pair of fleets dominating the battlefield. at present there are only a few ways into the amarr theatre of operation - i have zero desire to end up with a circumstance where a large alliance decides to blockade those few entry points with hundreds of ships.i don't feel i've been won over by the arguments enough yet to see why we'd want large organised capital-backed alliance fleets versus somewhat slapdash militia fleets because the militia pilots have less sp, less isk, fewer numbers, and aren't as used to fighting alongside each other. any hope of the trend of more people trying pvp and actually considering more active roles in low-sec or 0.0 would very likely be dashed."
9/29/2008,"he said it good, no need to remove learning skillsalts do not worry me, but new players don't have the isk anyway, so the process of skilling up and making money is more gradual than if you had maximum attributes...it is fun to make your own toon and get into top level on your own, there is no need to remove this 'climbing ladder' experience"
9/29/2008,"incidentally, whenever you see ""i demand 'x' change to help new players"" you can be pretty sure that the proponent is an experienced player who is fully aware that change 'x' will benefit him far more than new players. it's eve's equivalent of ""won't somebody please think of the children!""the real beneficiaries of new characters starting out with 5.5m free sp in free learning skills will be experienced players who want quick cyno alts, quick scout alts, quick market alts, quick hauler alts, quick tackler alts, quick salvage alts, quick r&d alts and quick fw alts.resulting in a further huge encroachment on all the niches currently open to new players to actually play the game as a multiplayer experience."
9/29/2008,"i hate the learning skills, because they are conceptually wrong.what the learning skills do is favour players who don't play and players who use multiple accounts. this may sound strange first, but look at it closely. the learning skills are most useful, the sooner you train them. so the best effect is received by training them right from the beginning, instead of starting to play the game. new players don't want to train stuff that makes them train other stuff better, which will give them more bonus to train real stuff eventually.effectively, the best thing you can currently do, if you start playing eve, is to get an account, have it train up the learning skills and only then start to play the game. this is stupid and doesn't motivate new players.on the other hand, secondary account alt characters are overly boosted by the learning skills, because someone who already has a character can afford to have his secondary char train nothing but learning skills in exactly the right order of skills for maximum effect. that is both lame and unfair.so in my opinion, the current system does not favor new players. it favors experienced players. massively. any specialized secondary character gets where he is supposed to go almost two times as fast as any new player would get."
9/29/2008,"so faster skill training isn't your own purpose? just because people with something else to do can use them a bit faster doesn't make them horribly unfair. a proper interspersing of learning skills with real skills will result in you being down a few hundred thousand sp at most over the course of months, in exchange for being able to play the game. and the wonderful thing about it is, you can choose which you prefer. effectively giving alt accounts a free few days of play is hardly broken - compare it to power of two, which effectively gives them months of free play time."
9/29/2008,"i wasnt sure at first if i wanted to continue to play eve when i got my first trial account because it takes so long to get anywhere (especialy turrets grrr) so i gave up for abit.then i got a second account and trained the learning skills almost strait away and actualy started to get somewhere (exept turrets grrrr) if you could actualy train some decent skills strait away then more noobs will play the game.just make sure more of the specialised skills are blocked so you dont have people spamming trial accounts, like they've blocked industry ships."
9/29/2008,well if all of them so called newb`s want no learnings sure... but all learnings to v give you +10 atribute(+learning it self) that ads up to about 11 on each atribute.. hey ive got an idea... +11 to all toons and throw out the learnings the oldy moldys will be happy the new ones will be happy... im happy
9/29/2008,"in my early days i didn't have the advanced learning skills or the money to get them, my corporation didn't pay fro the advanced skills which altogether cost around 22 million, when a new player rolls a new character he should not be worrying about 'power leveling', but rather find the aspects which he can enjoy in eve, be it wealth making, socializing or the advance and complexity of the game.a real specialist toon only takes one attribute pair to the 5/5/5, beginners can do well with 4/0/0 and when they can they get 4/3/3, normally couple months from the start, when they realize that skill path they choice is what they like, they further develop the character to 5/4/4, it can happen on month 6 to 12."
9/29/2008,"this is in regards to the eve news story ""third party skill training macro contains a trojan"""
9/29/2008,"well, this would benefit about 10-20 % of people because i have a thought that most of the people would just put on the queue further and further not actualy waiting for the both of them running out... this would also benefit the capital ship pilots who`s skills may take several months... and you need to plan it just right so that you can go on suspend for lets say carrier v or something.. and thats how you can save your iskies :)anyway im all for the queue thing it be nice to have like 3 skills in queue just for gigglaz"
9/29/2008,"most capital players i have spoke with, and i am one as well, would not go away from the game for that long. since we have vested so much time into not only our primary characters but we also have secondary support characters for those accounts as well. so taking a suspension out of the game for that kind of time period is just not going to happen.i'll go even further on that. for most people that are operating carriers, dreads and such, even 20 days is way to long to be out of the game. the way eve politics changes on a weekly basis you can find, and often do, your assets way off in a region you can no longer gain access to. so in the long and the short, no, don't think what you suggested would happen.now back on topic for what i posted, how many times have you been somewhere else when a skill finished training, you had a program like evehq or evemon send you a email message letting you know that it finished but you could not log on for another 4 hours (or more) to change it? i think that number would be like 80 or 90% of the people playing eve.this idea of a duel skill training system has been around a long time. there is no reason not to implement it. ccp's long time players are still going to be loyal, still going to be here to play the game. doing things like that makes your player base that much more loyal to you. it keeps you connected to them. it shows them that you do listen to what they say.that is why there is this news article right now. these @$$holes know that people want this. that is why they created it. that is why it is working so damn well. a simple news article is not going to stop them (or anyone else for that matter) of trying to take advantage of something that they players, their customers, clearly want and need.all i am saying is that csm needs to step this up in their priority list. it benefits everyone equally and it not hard to implement at all. it just needs to be done.as nike would would say ""just do it""."
9/29/2008,wow something i can support without feeling like a (insert appropriate expletive here)!! (1) it doesnt upset game balance (2) its not breaking something to fix another (3) not a selfish attempt to bend game mechanics in your favor..i am so impressed..two thumbs up.
9/29/2008,"yes, we desperately need some variety of skill queue, but this has already been submitted by the csm. i can't imagine anything more happening with it in this term of office. take it up with the next council, assuming nobody runs on the platform of doing so themselves."
9/29/2008,this issue has already been raised and passed but i suppose a new thread to move it up a few notches on the developers plans would be worth trying.
9/29/2008,it's in caps so it must be important!!!
9/29/2008,"whilst i empathise with a fellow industrialist, i'd point out that in theory, transit of goods from empire to null-sec or vice-versa should be target number 1 for pirates, a popular reason for their existence, and the best reason for a logistics train beyond the obvious that your enemies should have logistics to attack.sadly, jump freighters render a lot of this moot, so i do struggle with the notion that says moving large quantities is too difficult - it's become a lot easier than it used to be.i think i'd be quite keen on ore compression in empire and mass export to null-sec of low-end minerals (i could dust off my mining skills, and it'd give more of the industry side reasons to mine and fewer reasons to cart freighters around) if the actual transit to null-sec entailed some risk. semi-supported, but with sympathy for the already endangered pirates. in fact, compressed ore would be smaller and easier to 'fence' and so supported, but with a desire for ccp to look at just what traffic low-sec pirates are supposed to be preying on."
9/29/2008,"the events in tribute this past week are a classic example of this issue. the emergence of massive fleet engagement have escalated out of control and everyone counters that it's our own fault for bringing these said massive fleets to to the fight. that's extremely weak logic at best and at worst it's a flimsy attempt to divert away from the real issue. to defend against absolute force you have to bring absolute force. there is no way to skirmish and win against a +250 pilot enemy fleet occupying a key system you need to recapture and defend. due to ccp's meticulous game designs and improvements you need to bring a force which matches that in numbers and composition and basically do so with a full frontal attack.i would like one ccp staff member or csm to acknowledge that the emergence of massive fleets numbering in the hundreds has caught ccp off guard and they have planned to eventually at some point in the future resolve this issue to their paying subscribers?this will never happen because they didn't only know this would happen, they planned for it to happen and without the needed improvements to the game's infrastructure to handle it. it's a classic example of enabling the feature without supporting the feature. which boils down to the root cause of poor planning."

9/29/2008,"kept short for the attention span challenged.proposal : add 4 new currencies to new eden, one per major faction.reasons : create an interesting economic dynamic. create opportunities for players who enjoy trading to get into a simulator with more complexity. create another way for player actions to have an meaningful impact on their characters' environment.missions and bounties paid in factional currency.bpos/skills/npc items sold in factional currency.player sale/buy orders can be specified in a specific currency.lab slots (manufacturing or research) must be paid in factional currency.base currency = isk (still used in 0.0 and low sec space for missions/bounties/npc sales)faction currencies would be effected by information already collected from server so would not cause drain on resources. some factors having effect on currencies: 1. gdp (base isk value of all items completing manufacturing in faction stations) 2. employment level (# of unique characters of a specific race loging on against # of unique characters in active accounts) 3. inflation levels (average price of goods sold over base within faction territory against previous day's measurement) 4. political stability (measured by results of factional warfare daily stats / # of concord interventions within faction territory / value of faction npc ships destroyed (i.e. police, convoy ships) 5. capacity utilization (percentage of lab slots in use) 6. trade balance (faction's gdp as a percentage of universal gross production against percentage of universal product purchased within faction's territory)i'm sure there are other factors that can be used.the actual currency worth would be indicated by a daily change of price in the npc goods market (bpo/skill books/etc.)players interested could jump in as foreign exchange merchants. if done properly this could also open the door for high level sovereignty holders to create their own currency in 0.0 security space."
9/29/2008,absolutely no way.this is a can of worms just begging to turn into pandoras box.sorry.. great idea.. good thinking... but your going to make a complicated game even more complicated then ever before by a factor of 10...if people dig it... ill jump in the boat... but honestly... there's more important matters to suggest.
9/29/2008,the added level of complexity is the whole point. devalued currency would do in new eden exactly what it does in the real world...create opportunities that can't exist in the 2d economy eve has now.
9/29/2008,"correcting some nasty misinformation going on. people with limited experience in security please qft.to anyone who has ever ripped thousands of passwords from a shadow file, the idea of having multiple hashes for every user is a f&!^%(ng gold mine of access credentials. hashes are not secure. hashes are not secure. hashes are not secure.this is not a security feature in any way and merely creates a database of sensitive information that is serving no purpose. a smart hacker who gets that database can go through and check for duplicate usernames or link a user to another account somewhere and try all of their passwords until one works. keeping multiple hashes makes a bad security break into a catastrophic one."
9/29/2008,"you'd need to know what hash they used to start with. or your cracking time explodes exponentialy to every hash you try to crack.going through shadow files is easy, because people are usualy stupid and use only the bog standard unix crypt call that fails any security test (8-bit hash iirc). good luck going through md5 hashes or even better encryption methods."
9/29/2008,"it is standard security practice to store x of your old passwords to stop you using the same one again, as presumably you changed it for a reason (e.g. someone else got it). the longer you use the same password for, and the more places you use it, the more likely it is to be cracked.it is also standard practice to store one-way hashes of the password(s) instead of the password itself, so that a hacker who gets into your database can't just read out everyone's passwords. the idea is that the hashes are useless for someone trying to hack in, as the server is expecting the unhashed password and they are (in theory) irreversible. as the hashes to certain common passwords are already known, it is standard practice to salt the password before hashing it so that the password hashes in your database are different to the password hashes for the same password in someone else's database. this means that it is not a security risk to store the hashes either. i would be shocked if eve doesn't do this.off on a tangent:note that hashing the password in the client and sending the hash over the wire is exactly as insecure as sending the raw password over the wire from a security against tapping pov. either way they have exactly what they'd need to send to log in as you. to verify that the client is really there and it isn't a snooper just replaying the packets from someone's earlier login, you need to use a double-hash mechanism:person signs up with password ""a"".server salts it (""salta"") and hashes that (""hasha""), and stores that.client wants to log in, server sends them a random salt: ""pepper"".client salts and hashes the password like the server did originally (""hasha""), then salts that with the time-unique salt from the server (""pepperhasha"") and hashes that again: ""hashhasha"".client sends that to the server.server salts it's stored hash of the password with the time-unique salt and hashes that the same as the client has to. it gets ""hashhasha"" as well, and allows the login because it matches what the client sent.note that this way means that the server doesn't store your password, that you don't send your password or the server's hash of your password over the internet, and most importantly the code sent by the client to login is different every time so that capturing the packets wouldn't let you log in just by replaying them. this still doesn't protect against a keylogger or other spyware on the client pc, or someone hacking the server to change your password or install a backdoor into the login process. it does make the security of the wires between the server and client irrelevant though, making it safe for internet use.i'd hope that eve also uses something like this, but it's not necessary as keyloggers are still by far the biggest weakpoint in any password system. some people just can't keep their pc secure, and others will log into the eve forums (uses the same user/pass as the game) from an insecure public pc.just assume that ccp know what they're doing, eve is pretty big now and they haven't had a major security problem, so they must be doing something right."
9/29/2008,"need to know the hash? i can tell most of them by inspection and can find 100% of them with a little bit of searching on random forums. the availability of decryption tools is endless. unless ccp uses a proprietary hash that's not a derivative of a major encryption scheme, they face the same exposure as every other system.this ""feature"" is fundamentally wrong. you need the current password to change back to the old password, so preventing a user from going back to an old password doesn't do anything except prevent a hacker from being able to randomly regain access as the user randomly decides to switch back to an old password that they already cracked...yeah right.the real reason it's fundamentally wrong is very simple. the procedure creates an aggregated database of access credentials. it's bigger than eve. having a list of likely passwords for a user is a huge asset if one wants to access other accounts of that user.please ccp, tell me you aren't using lanman. can't tell you how many systems have handed me over a list of lanman hashes generated for windows file-sharing with an at-least-slightly-difficult-and-somewhat-reasonable hashing system in a shadow right next to it.anyway, guessing the hash system isn't hard. salting can be defeated. a program can probably do it for you if you're lazy. insert massive word list. add mangling rules. add semantic acronym generator (still better than random) with more mangling rules. pipe through someone's stolen cluster. viola. you can now shaft 1857 people with weak to moderate passwords.how to avoid an attack like this? run your password through an md5 generator and copy some characters out of the result. you won't remember them, so write them down, thus undermining the utility of passwords.for however ""standard"" this practice is, i've never pulled any kind of shadow with duplicate user entries.in the end, it doesn't matter if ccp has the most l33test cryptographic system in the world. keeping more access credentials than necessary increases exposure of sensitive information while gaining no utility. that's a fundamentally bad security practice."
9/29/2008,well another way at looking at this is..if you were a hacker looking for passwords..which would you rather sort through..a huge database of which a very large portion is outdated or a smaller database with mostly current passwords..
9/29/2008,"yes, yes, there are many mechanisms in place to protect the information. it's not alarmist thought to ask for a system that doesn't carry more sensitive information than it's actually using."
9/29/2008,"cracking through hash generation is all about scale. the more passwords in the database, the more likely you are to get matches, which you can potentially link through those users to other accounts to hack their other accounts.most people re-use access credentials across multiple accounts and only vary which one they're using on a particular system. when it comes time to change passwords, they likely pick an old one that they already have memorized.keeping multiple hashes is completely unnecessary and only increases the severity of any potential security breach. not to mention a ccp employee could easily rip the information using an obscured program running on eve cluster nodes themselves for a going away present. sell info. quit ccp. does ccp think they're above this?"
9/29/2008,"yes, it's possible - you need one of agent standing, corp standing, or faction standing to be high enough to use the agent. this provides a pretty nice workaround, if you have a friend capable of using the agent you want to switch to - do gang missions for the agent, and the agent standing will shoot up very quickly, compared to how long it'd take to do corp missions. it's still a few dozen missions, but it's a lot faster, and it's standings you can just outright buy if you like, since you only have to be online and in gang to gang complete. incidentally, my corp sells exactly this service, if anyone is interested. in your case, if you have 8.6 standings(l5q12), then you can in fact use every caldari-aligned agent in the game. or, more realistically, 7.0 faction standing will get you all useful agents. i didn't mention this, because you have to be a massive missioner to get that kind of faction standing, and if you've done a couple thousand missions for the faction, you're unlikely to want to switch agents. however, it works just fine."
9/29/2008,"do more research, i run for amarr agents and get pretty much nothing but sansha/angel missions from a l4q13 and l4q18 in a 0.5 system, very very nice. the reason most people are in caldari has already been pointed out really... everyone is an achura and everyone is running for cn without more research into alternatives."
9/29/2008,"8.68 unadjusted i don't do much else in eve other than run missions, and i can't play daily or for very long so it's slow going. noticed yesterday that my main is now over 2.5 years old. i am trying to get standing into the 9s as i hear you get faction ships offered to you at various levels in the 9s (i think frigate at 9.1, cruiser at 9.5 and bs at 9.9). i'm not bothered about the lvl 5s though - i don't go into low sec unless i'm able to run a cov ops cloak."
9/29/2008,"isn't one of the things why people stick to navy corps that often the fact that before the loyalty points shop was implemented, agents would 'offer' random items, and people would get 'navy' ships from the 'navy' corps?"

9/29/2008,"as an achura (admittedly somewhat randomly) that left caldari space and never looked back after about a month, i'd say they're not looking that hard. i left for amarr space, and have since run with the amarr navy, and never had to go to low-sec to gain a high standing with them and access to level 4s.as for the big mission hubs that form in caldari space, that is an entirely separate problem of agent quality and lack of alternatives/imagination, no different to jita really. quite a few corps only have a very few high quality agents, so people who want the maximum return cluster around them. there have been quite a few suggestions over the months in features and ideas on how to improve this.navy corps offer extra lp items (blueprints for faction ships), so that can be an incentive to run for them."
9/29/2008,i find it hard to see the problem....my corp has been able to successfully run level 4's around the ren's area without too many problems... most of which are brutor tribe of course.maybe its due to jita that your seeing the high traffic.maybe your not looking hard enough?
9/29/2008,i agree. the agents in balginia are great. i just think people are to lazy to get out of their comfort zone to look else where. nice market hub nearby. good agents etc etc.
9/29/2008,supporting occupancy rewards/disadvantages by some form.
9/29/2008,"i think many agree that bumping as it is makes quite a ...lunatic concept. at least when some tiny peepots bumb huge ships, multiple times their size and mass.then there is another 'issue' with the collision system, that comes up again and again. ramming. or the lack of it as an option.i have read most threads on ramming concepts with great interest and what i noticed is that most people want ramming to cause damage. that this would be quite a bad idea is obvious for many reasons. however, damage is relative. or to be precise: what constitutes as damage is open for interpretation. damage to shields, armor or hull is damage, yes. however, preventing an enemy from escaping is damage, too. not direct damage, though.this lead me to this concept:1. smaller ships can no longer bump larger ships the usual way. only ships that are smaller than your own can be bumped.2. ships get a special option: ramming.however, unlike often suggested, this ramming does not do any damage to the target. instead, it bumps the target and causes damage to the bumping ship. that damage depends on the size difference, so that ships of equal size can bump/ram each other for little damage, while a frigate that rams a battleship would still bump the battleship, but it would also be destroyed in the process of doing so.the advantage would be that ridiculous effects are reduced a lot and that bumping an enemy to prevent him from escaping actually costs something. it would also add ramming in as a possibility, while at the same time preventing any abuse beyond what is already possible. the normal collision system would still work, because normal bumping is still possible, only that the larger ship will always win."
9/29/2008,we didn't want to kill station-hugging capitals anyway.
9/29/2008,doesn't make sense for a ship to take damage for bumping but not the ship that was bumped.
9/29/2008,"#1 is unrealistic - how many people want to spend thousands on a game? - but probably the best of the ones you make, because the other three just demonstrate spectacular ignorance. you know, it is possible to put across your point without resorting to insults. i believe i am making valid poits here so dont go insulting me.yes your points are valid, that doesnt make them right and you more intelligent.i believe many players would like to see many of these issues addressed.and you dont need to spend thousands on isk to get alot. ie i have seen 1billion for sale for <U+FFFD>22 roughly. so if you want to flatten a smaller corp all you need is a <U+FFFD>88 and you have yourself 4 billion isk worth of ships to send into battle fearlessly. there are many people out there who would happily do that.but please, dont resort to smack talk in a discussion like this. it just says what an ignorant egotistical jerk you are. or maybe an just an isk buying macro user"
9/29/2008,i believe the best solution i have seen so far is to either limit the amount of time you can be in an npc corp. this would effectively force everyone to either start their own corp or join an existing one at some point. then all those macrominers would be making the people who find them and wardec them rich
9/29/2008,"actually, my points being valid does make them right - that's what ""valid"" means. and i never claimed to be more intelligent, i just claimed to be less ignorant. as for your price, <U+FFFD>22 is about $40, or a bit more than a price of a gtc. that price is less than twice as efficient as doing the same thing legally in the gtc market, making me wonder why anybody would risk getting it taken away for that small of a markup. for your <U+FFFD>88($160), just buy 5 gtcs, make 3 billion, and actually get to keep it instead of trying to fly those ships with a negative wallet. also, most wars you'd want to be unbeatable in take a lot more than 3b or 4b isk to fight, never mind how much it would cost to be unstoppable."
9/29/2008,"decryptors are a joke at the moment. they not worth buying unless you plan on inventing high end ships. basically all mods are getting the shaft now when it comes to using decryptors as an economical means in their inventions.yes it's ""optional"", but it's become mandatory to not use one on mods.if what you say is true... as to keeping drop rates in line with demand, then supply needs to be drastically increased. have you noticed anything about their market?"
9/29/2008,"decryptors were never common and they are more common than in the past. the difference is that the number of inventors has risen faster than the number of people doing exploration, so the production is low and the demand high, hence high prices. making them easier to find will not increase availability by much as, as soon as the price drop, people will stop exploring for them; the return for the time and risk isn't noting to brag about, reduce it and a lot of people will stop exploring."
9/29/2008,exploration plexes are very limited. you may find one with decryptor per week. plexes are overfarmed anyway.
9/29/2008,"in hi sec i had 5 decryptors last day, they all come from radar sites, finding and hacking these sites is a professionthe rarity of an items makes it valuable, i'd prefer player driven economy, but not complete abundance of everythingthe market prices will bounce back when more covops pilots turn to exploration and radar sites, they need to realize that their effort is worth it.it may take as long as an hour of probing, but you only receive one or two decryptors, which makes for 15 mill/hour... not very profitable, thus the covops pilot don't want to spend time on this"
9/29/2008,so what you're saying is that scarce items are used for their more valuable purposes before they're used for their less valuable purposes? glad to see that the laws of economics still apply.
9/29/2008,"the reason for that is that with invention you get to pick what you're making, pick your success rate, and pick what you get. with exploration, you just get to pick where you look and 99% of the time find nothing, or nothing worth the cost of the probes.inevntion = goodexploration = suck.that's why."
9/29/2008,"they were abundant in cosmos before, and got hit with the nerf bat. the increase of inventors is one cause into the demand for these, but also the decreased supply, and increased effort to find these has made them skyrocket in price.i'm not saying we need them to be easily obtained, but we definitely need them to be re-examined before the board and looked at again."
9/29/2008,there is problem falcon outperform rook in every aspect cloack warp + high optimal+strenght bonus to ecm vs strenght + optimal + miserable misile bonus.falcon:caldari cruiser skill bonus: 10% reduction in ecm target jammer capacitor use and 20% bonus to ecm target jammer optimal range per levelrecon ships skill bonus: 20% bonus to ecm target jammer strength and -96% to -100% reduction in cloaking device cpu use per levelrook:caldari cruiser skill bonus: 10% reduction in ecm target jammer capacitor use and 20% bonus to ecm target jammer optimal range per levelrecon ships skill bonus: 20% bonus to ecm target jammer strength per level and 5% bonus to heavy and light missile kinetic damage.falcon should lose strenght or range to ecm and get misile bonus. no longer warp in cloacked at 200km eprma jamming ships. you want perma jam you chose rook and people see you coming. or want stealth and lose optimal or range. preferable optimal.
9/29/2008,"unsigned. force recons and combat recons have identical ewar, the only difference is in cloak vs. extra dps. the rook is in the exact same position as the lachesis, huginn, and post-nerf curse. unless you're also proposing a matching nerf to the arazu, rapier and pilgrim, enough whining about the falcon."
9/29/2008,"interesting, thanks for the update serenity."
9/29/2008,"i think the bounty system, as far as there is something deserving the name, could use a revamp. a massive revamp, to be precise.my suggestion is to make it based on transferable/tradeable killrights.the concept goes like this:player a gets killrights for player b.player a goes into his character sheet and selects the killrights. there he gets the option to contract his killrights. either to a specific entity, or to a bounty office.the bounty office pays an amount of money for the killrights, based on the bounty on the person who the killrights are on, starting with a negative.player c is a bounty hunter.he goes to the bounty office and sifts through the kill contracts, or buys them directly on the contract market via item exchange/auction.then he buys a killrights contract from the bounty office and gains the killrights.he can then hunt down his target and cash in the bounty.the bounty hunter gets the killmail. player a gets a copy of the killmail.killing a pc with a bounty on his head does not get you the bounty. only someone with a bountyhunter contract gets the money. if a bounty hunter with a contract on you shoots down your ship, you do not gain killrights on him. he just did his job.such a system would solve multiple issues, in my opinion.first of all, it would amplify the often proclaimed concept that everything has consequences.players who are normally too weak to strike back could easily give others who are not the chance to dish out. canbaiting and ganking even a rookie could have consequences, if a bounty hunter decides to come for you.getting your own bounty is not so easy anymore, because players can't just wait and let it raise, since sooner or later someone real will try to collect it. bounties would not grow so high, too. after all, you are never completely safe anymore, with a big bounty on your head.bounty hunting would work legitimately, even in empire.pvp inside empire would increase, while at the same time it would not hurt the carebears. issuing a bounty on someone would actually mean something.suicide ganking would have serious consequences, because it would quickly render the suicide ganking character unusable, if you overdo it.people could even make money from selling kill contracts.players could pvp and shoot players, while doing something productive and upholding the law. the profession of bounty hunting would become a real possibility."
9/29/2008,"a very similar thread has already been proposed, passed,a and submitted, and we're expecting ccp's response any day now."
9/29/2008,"not exactly any day now. but yeah, we already had a pretty big proposal, which ccp is responding to. just don't get your hopes up, sorry.but i like the idea."

9/29/2008,"i felt i needed to indicate something in the midst of this stupid mud slinging match that has utterly no purpose in general and is vastly damaging to csm's purpose which is anything but political.there is no such thing as a true democracy. only the corrupted kind...or partial.. or biased..or whatever.there never was is or will be.am i against such a thing? no....but you people need to understand that your definition of a democracy is very greatly biased..if not overlooking a few things.a democracy in its root meaning is a government or group controlled by the people.1 vote 1 person etc..etc..etc.at least that's where it originated.however... people only think that far and forget the rest.the part your missing is a very big problem.1: your assuming that everyone thinks like you do and will do the same thing.2: your assuming that everyone has the ability to choose right from wrong. (discernment)3: your assuming that everyone has the maturity to cast his or her vote without error.4: your assuming that everyone gives a rip what you think.5: your assuming that everyone has everyone in there best interests or for the ""big picture""6: your assuming that everyone has the same background needs and wants and hates that you do!at that point you get only one thing.total and utter anarchy... just nicely wrapped up in a little bow and ribbon... under the cover of ""voting"" and ""politics""sorry there's no ""perfect"" form of government... either one is benevolent or malevolent.you have to work with what you get... so don't pass judgment without making sure your free of error as well.everyone in eve is pretty much looking out for number 1.... or something to that effect.some are nicer than others.all i see here is a bunch of goon's banging there war drum (which they are rather good at with there numbers in the thousands) but doing nothing to resolve the problem.no offense to you goons of course.on the other hand i see jade who obviously ****ed off too many people and chewed off more than he can handle..... that's normal for most people.... but instead of moving on he's choosing to throw gas on the fire. when in fact he should be seeking to resolve instead of responding to this tripe.did he make mistakes? i'm not sure honestly... but this isn't getting anyone anywhere either.and a bunch of people who obviously see whats going on and aren't foolish to make it worse... but they get drowned out/ignored/trounced/war'deced and everything else in the mix for ""having an opinion""this won't stop the people who have no common sense of brains...let alone anything better to do then continue to throw a fit and complain and whine instead of taking action by resolving the issue in some form other than negative-isms.... something constructive.i've been running teams in online gaming for over 15 years... while i know my weakness (temper... quick to jump at times..etc..etc)i also know when there's a no win situation.. and this is one of them.that's why i'm going to vote.... the system may be busted.... corrupted if you will... but at least im doing something other than throwing mud around for some mistake(s) that where made or wheren't made or things needing doing.so keep this in mind people.... when you rant and rave.... you can be part of the group that yells... or you can be part of the group that does something constructive.... or worse yet... be a part of the gorup that doesn't give a damn about anyone or anything but themselves and what they want as opposed to the greater good.as to what that great good needs?good luck... because you won't find it in this topic... that takes communication and work.and that's why jade said what he said in reference to the smoke filled rooms.the only way csm gets anything done...is in peace and quiet.so you can attempt to resolve that...or make it worse.the choice is yours. good or bad... don't complain....instead do something constructive about it."
9/29/2008,this poster lacks in substance.
9/29/2008,isn't the age of consent 14 in iceland? i thought they passed down responsibility earlier rather than later over there. maybe they're just more liberal with sex than they are with internet spaceships...
9/29/2008,"that was raised, passed, and submitted to ccp months ago. it wasn't discussed in iceland, but it's in the list that ccp recently submitted a preliminary reply to. speaking of which, does anyone have a date for us as to when the players as a whole will see ccp's answers? i understand that there's still some things to be done, but i'd like to have an idea of when we can expect it."
9/29/2008,"honestly, no, we have no idea whatsoever.the problem is on ccp's end. this has to be done on the weekends, but the important people from ccp who has to attend are busy with conferences and crap, so it's going to take some time before we can meet."
9/29/2008,"the problem is we only have the short answer, and ccp still needs to go into detail during a meeting with us. and despite my attempts and the direct feedback from the csm, we have not yet been able to arrange this meeting.i really wish i had some feedback for you on these issues, but we really need to discuss them with ccp directly first."
9/29/2008,"/me grumblesisn't this why we invented email? it's not as quick as a chat, under normal circumstances, but given that it's already been about two weeks, and you're making it sound like it'll be a few more, then face-to-face really is a false economy. you can say more over email in a day(never mind a month) than over chat in an hour, so waiting a month to have that hour seems crazy to me. besides, you've got 47 issues on the agenda - you didn't have time to properly discuss that many with a full weekend full of meetings, you're not going to do better squeezing out a few hours in a chat channel."
9/29/2008,"i agree. if the csm sent an email, they could send a well composed and detailed request instead of rushing through a meeting and forgetting details and have to do it again. the csm would also receive a better and most likely a more well thought out response considering that the other side does not have to rush their answers to squeeze it in a small block of time. ccp might be able to answer some of the questions 15 minutes here or 15 minutes there as time allows, rather than having them find 2hours they might not be able to afford the csm. in which they could have probably answered your questions long before the time you spent waiting for a response to the possibility of a meeting. you would at least have the issues worked on and or addressed until they ever do have time. the csm could address some of the issues before you have a meeting, then you could have a meeting that is not as rushed and maybe a little more in depth due to the fact you have fewer issues to address..sitting on your hands waiting for some one to find time is not the answer."
9/29/2008,"we already mailed ccp a response, which they have yet to react on.trust me, we do everything we try to make this work. but ccp is not working with us at this point, so we are really not able to force them to do anything at this point."
9/29/2008,"apologies if it looked like i was blaming you - i don't know who is at fault here, so i'm not trying to blame anyone in particular. but if insistence upon a meeting is the stumbling block, as you and ank implied that it was, then i'd like to see that insistence dropped to allow things to function properly and efficiently. really, i don't care what is done, how it's done, or who does it. i just want this process to feel a bit less like it's being run out of brigadoon. i don't expect miracles from anybody, and i don't anticipate that the csm submission is going to be released as a patch next tuesday, but i want things to work as reasonably and efficiently as they can, and i don't think that they are right now."
9/29/2008,"essentially, you're trying to justify the intrinsic value of 0.0 ownership, while separating the extrinsic value. selling rights to isk farmers, and forum registration fees which are connected with corporate membership would seem to be fairly extrinsic. as are trips to iceland, and getting mentioned in forbes articles. :darius: the fact is, humorous quips aside, there's plenty of extrinsic value to be seized, i think it's just myopic to (wait for it) not think outside the sandbox."
9/29/2008,"not one of those things you mentioned has anything to do with 0.0 ownership, aside from renting to isk farmers, which as i'm sure many can attest, is a very risky proposition for your alliance. those extrinsic items shouldn't be looked at as a replacement for a fun and rewarding gameplay experience. nobody really sets out wanting to achieve those things. they are pleasant surprises.looking at the makeup of the council, being a 0.0 participant would appear to actually hurt your chances."
9/29/2008,"wasn't there a survey that ccp did where they found that well over half the eve subscribers never left empire? if that is the case (and i don't know if that's an actual fact or just an internet stat) then the spread is actually not too far from the actual in-game split of where people spend their time. indeed, given that i don't think any of the current council are exclusively high sec, it may even be weighted in low/nil/neg sec's favour!but as i said, that's based on a stat of which i know neither the accuracy nor the origin."
9/29/2008,"i'll say it right up front: i'm a relative newcomer to eve. i started playing in january of this year, on a whim. ""what harm could a fifteen-day free trial do?"" i asked myself on that rainy winter's day in seattle. ""i'll probably get bored and quit inside a week."" after all, no video game at that time had managed to hold my interest for very long.i've since subscribed two alt accounts. i have evemon skill plans going out two, three years in the future. i'm hooked. i love this game.so since i have come to care about this game so much, and since i've got so much invested in it, obviously i want to see it thrive and prosper. and i would love to have not just a chance to have a say in where it goes, but to be a voice for the people who play it. as a result, i'm running for csm in the hope that i'll be able to help make a better, brighter future in eve.here's a few random facts about my life in eve to give you an idea of where my eve experience has taken me:0.0 resident0.0 alliance executive board memberavid (but still rather noobish) pvpercaldari ewar speccedaspiring capital pilot have a carebear alt - industry and researchhave participated in fw with a (non-calamari!) altmac and linux userwith the preliminaries out of the way, there are a few platform issues i want to talk about to give you an idea of my areas of focus.cross-platform supportthis is my pet project. i started playing eve on a mac. i hate having to boot into windows to pvp worth a damn. i hate that the inset map is broken. i hate the disco box. i think we, the non-windows-using community, deserve better. to that end, i campaigned in the forums:link to postand successfully petitioned the current csm to raise an issue to the ccp developers about this issue:link to postas a result, ccp's response has improved slightly (they've been more active in the mac and linux forums) but we still are no closer to having regular, ongoing status updates about the status of a mac premium client, and we continue to have severe graphical bugs.as a csm, i will give this issue the attention it deserves, and i won't ccp get away with saying ""it's coming, there'll be a dev blog about it in a couple of weeks"" and then lapsing into radio silence again.tl;dr: we should be able to pvp on non-windows platforms at a reasonable framerate. pretty graphics would be nice. i'll bug ccp about it until they get sick of me and give us a proper client just to get me to shut up.the evolution of 0.0eve as a game really started for me when i got to 0.0. i like the danger, the excitement, the wars and the politics and constant shifting of influence that goes on in 0.0 space. as a csm i will encourage and support new ideas on how to improve the 0.0 experience, from making sovreignty more valuable to increasing the role that non-capital ships have in sov warfare. at the same time i realize capitals need love too - i can't wait to fly one, and i want them to still be as useful and exciting then as they are now.nano-nerfevery csm candidate needs to have a position on this one in my opinion. in my case, i'm cautiously for it, but i'm concerned about how it will affect blaster-boats. i do feel that *something* needs to be done - i'm tired of the predictability of nanoship gangs; it's all i ever see in small gang pvp, and it gets monotonous. levelling the playing field will force further tactical evolution, and i'd like to see something new.lagccp's hard at work on this one, and as csm i would continue to encourage them to do so. i'm in a 0.0 alliance, that means i have to deal with plenty of big blobs and the lagfests they generate. not on the scale of the big boys, of course, but even so, i feel your pain."
9/29/2008,"forumsthe forums need work. the censor software has an unacceptably high rate of false-positives, and the human moderators have trouble keeping up with the rate of posts. i like the forums - i enjoy reading them each day, and i think they are one of the most vital parts of the eve community. let's give them the attention they deserve.politeness and professionalismif elected, i want to work with, not against, my fellow csm members. i am committed to dealing professionally with both the other members of the csm and with the community at large. i won't let my personal feelings get in the way. i have no alliance-based axes to grind. i just want to make things work.in conclusionthere's a lot more that i would like to say about each of these issues, but i'm trying to resist the temptation to blast you all with a wall of text. i'll be setting up a campaign blog in the next day or two in which i'll talk about the issues i support at more length. until then, thank you for your time, and fly safe."
9/30/2008,"this, the stuff belongs to the player killed and not the killer, as soon as there a wreck it a free for all with the winners being flagged to the owner of said wreck. if you're tacklers are not fast enough to get the wreck as they should be close enough and fast enough then it you're problem and not anyone else's, train them properly and you'll get the rewards just don't whine about people not playing fair after you just killed someone !"
9/30/2008,bumping this
9/30/2008,"this is a nice idea and could use more consideration. in particular it would make a nice link to the issue raised to change freed slaves/tourists <> slaves. can you expand on the idea more, particularly in interaction with other aspects of eve? eg. can i planetary bomb your colony? do i need a dread-nought to do that, or something bigger?etc."
9/30/2008,"it is as you say with the exception of the widow, which is a worthy successor to the scorp. it can dps, tank, and jam, cloak, and jump drive. however, all the other ships are simply tier 1 battleships with a jump drive. seriously, agility bonus? not damps??? wtf?????"
9/30/2008,"i would like to see the 'covert hauler' for sure. fleet logistics make little sense in eve, and you should be able to support a fleet deep in hostile territory with some kind of support/supply ship. maybe one day soon we will see an end to blobbing.."
9/30/2008,"actually, i'd argue that the widow is the worst black ops, since it's completely outperformed by the falcons it can (in theory, with a fuel boost) jump. no matter how you fit the ship, you're either wasting the ecm bonus (with a missile gank fit), or wasting the missile bonuses (with an ecm fit, which can't even ecm properly). at least the other black ops bring some solid dps to the fight, i'd much rather bring a redeemer than a worthless widow."
9/30/2008,"i currently have an apoc tied up in a station that has been taken over by another alliance. this apoc has t2 lasers fitted with t2 ammo as well as used faction and t2 ammo in the hold. it is also outfitted with rigs. as the current system stands, i can do nothing with the ship. because the laser crystals are ""damaged"" i can not create a contract, if i repackage the ship, i lose the rigs. i have no way of removing the ammo, so the ship just sits and collects dust. tl;dr: you can not contract ships with used/damaged laser/mining crystals, and there is no way to remotely remove these damaged items without losing rigs. no other ammo type has this problem.my proposed solultion: give me the option to remove the ammo (or any damaged item) from a ships hold as well as the weapons when creating a contract. the ammo is already removed from the guns when creating a contract, why not dump it in the hangar instead of the cargo bay?"
9/30/2008,"i thought this one had been submitted previously, but apparently it hasn't been. yes, contracting of damaged goods is desperately needed."
9/30/2008,"please fix this. it would make life much easier and since only amarr (and miners) really have this problem, it doesnt seem fair."
9/30/2008,"this is a bad thing for eve, as less difference in geography means;i doubt it will even change the market whatsoever. i disagree. even if people could jump clone even more, while it might worsen the blobs, it won't make 0.0 unimportant at all. it just decreases the barrier to entry, doesn't remove it.with a 20 hour jump clone timer, that hardly changes(that's really true for all of the above too)no no no. even if the jump clone timer is lowered, it won't make people jump around like monkies. people can already jump away if they get station camped. or even worse, they can go and play on an alt! again, i will have to disagree. i'm not talking about giving all ships unlimited jump drives. there's talk about a jump clone timer in the area of 12 to 20ish hours time(i see 20 as quite reasonable)."
9/30/2008,"heartstone suggested a high skill requirement(science and infomorph. v). i think this is a good idea and i will write that into the document as an option, tonight."
9/30/2008,we really could use an update on this since it has been sooo long since the last one.
9/30/2008,"i like this idea with one single exception:i don't like how the pay out is based on the kill its self. this is for several reasons:1) bad price checks; what do we base things like faction loot, and the loss of faction ships. additionally, do they only receive compensation on things not dropped, and destroyed? there are many things to consider with this.2) rewards older players disproportionately; lets face it, the chances of a guy in a frigate killing a pirate in his fully fitted faction bs, or his t2 hac is nil to none. older players have a better chance. this makes players who've simply been here longer more sucessful bounty hunters. this shouldn't be the case.3) removal of the 'personal feel'; lets face it, i'm a pirate, and that bounty on my head is a direct relation to my e-peen. the bigger it gets, the better i feel about myself. its an indication of job success. good pirates aren't measured by the ship they fly, or the implants in their head, but their noteriety. a bounty hunter should get a good reward for killing famous pirates, not ones with expensive tastes in ships, and fine wines. also, part of what makes bounties so fun is having them cost players to get revenge. its not a system that 'just works' its a personal feeling, kind of like defeating them in a duel."
9/30/2008,"no different to normal pvp. not a real issue according to those who repeatedly say that isk and sp aren't an issue and new players can do pvp just like everyone else.being famous, reputation, bounty, these are all things that the pirate cares about - not the targets - indeed most targets don't know the pirate's reputation, whether they're (in)famous in the sector, or whether the bounty is due to success or put on by the pirate themselves to make themselves look more capable. there's nothing to stop you checking your own bounty hunter contracts. indeed ccp could add a sum of those and keep the existing bounty notification."
9/30/2008,yes please
9/30/2008,"yap, badly needed"

9/30/2008,supporting a grandfather clause.
9/30/2008,signing this for good measure.
9/30/2008,i iz giv moar support
9/30/2008,i agree with this. i don't think small frigates bumping larger ships to be of much benefit to the game. although this problem likely started occurring because of dock/undock tactics which need re-evaluation to.
9/30/2008,fix bumping. exploits becoming 'features' ftl.
9/30/2008,"titan portals and then getting bumped. you lose the portal?titan being of a mass (smallest one) 1,537,500,000 kg. so anything smaller then a cap sized ship should be able to disturb a titan let alone break the portal.kinetic energy = ek=1/2mv^2bumping at velocity should cause some form of damage. and when done by someone:1. not in your gang (stops warp bump damage).2. not in your alliance/corp (similar to repping without being in-gang).to the bump(er):1. high velocity bumping should cause damage to the ship to with a kenetic value in relationship to the mass of the target ship. ie., you try to bump a titan in a interceptor going 6km/s (just using an medium speed) with a mass of 1,075,000 (taranis). the interceptor should be damaged at least into armor if not structure/destroyed. seems like another part of the game that was omitted for ease of programming. titans should not be able to be bumped by friendly (ganged) pilots, especially while creating a jump portal. bumping a freighter on a gate for an hour is griefing but under the current mechanics its not an aggressive act, this needs to be corrected as well.ramming is a valid military tactic where the attacker and target both take damage. submarines were sunk while the attacker did take damage during rl use of this maneuver. the game needs to be fixed. not adding new material. fix what we have and make it solid."
9/30/2008,you just need the role to do it. i am not ceo and i can modify corp market order.ask your ceo to grant you the role
9/30/2008,"i'd support this on one of the following two conditions:a) doing so risks being caught in the cyno jammer's disruption, giving you an exceptionally risky (~85%) chance of your ship and cargo being destroyed on landing.b) the faction you jump to responds to your aggression and targets the jump freighter and cyno ship. maybe even retaliates and invades your little section of 0.0."
9/30/2008,"i can't see how letting jump freighter completely bypass the choke points that every other ship in the game must travel through in order to move between low and high sec is a good thing. frankly, it doesn't appear to me as though a jump freighter needs to risk much as it is (if necessary, cyno to a friendly pos, then warp to the gate and inst-jump). it also eliminates war declarations as a mechanic to stop hostile logistics, since jump freighters would be able to bypass any empire blockade./not supported"
9/30/2008,no
9/30/2008,"this is so necessary. even if they make the cyno-jumpfreighter system a sort of high sec pos module. using very similar system as the covert cyno stuff. you just make the jumpfreighter system work this way. which honestly is good because once you add the jump fuel costs, the pos fuel, etc etc. the corp standing idea is all setup to make sense with the storyline rp stuff.it's not overpowered because these systems will cost so much fuel costs... excessive addition trading costs will make your profit margins hurt compared to what your competitors who arent jumpdriving around.so really... nothing changes except it gives an advantage to the jump freighters which are respectable."
9/30/2008,"ummm being a jump freighter they already have an advantage of well being able to jump! before they had to fly everywhere taking forever to do so, unless you did things right and had some corpies with you to web the freighter on gates.jump fighters already don't have much risk as they can jump to a lowsec system next to highsec warp to gate and bam there in highsec. i have been on a couple jump freighter kills and the only reason we were able ot catch them was because they did stupid stuff like cyno on a planet or there cyno buddy put them to close to the station and bounced them off dock range."
9/30/2008,please visit your user settings to re-enable images.not a huge difference between a 6 or 7 jammer falcon so i don't know why people are getting their knickers in a knot over this. still being jammed 46.3% of the time with two eccm mods.
9/30/2008,"except that you upgraded to 2 racial jammers from the 1 you had before. although your last fit also had 1 correct racial jammer on the falcon and two pointed at the dominix, so it could use a bit of work there too. here's the whole list of numbers with 2x sda and 2x pda, just for completeness:5 jams(1 of each racial, 1 multi): 39%5 jams(1 correct racial, 4 incorrect): 35%5 jams(2 correct racial, 3 incorrect): 43%6 jams(1 of each racial, 2 multi): 46.1%6 jams(1 correct racial, 5 incorrect): 38.8%6 jams(2 correct racial, 4 incorrect): 46.3%7 jams(1 of each racial, 3 multi): 52.3%7 jams(1 correct racial, 6 incorrect): 42.3%7 jams(2 correct racial, 5 incorrect): 49.4%realistically, the top one is the most likely to be used, for a total of 39% jam. anything above 46.3% - and that implies luck - means you're facing a pretty bad falcon pilot. now how is this a bad thing? you're spending two slots on a countermeasure to a whole ship as expensive and skill-intensive as your own, and with full exertion it can deal with you almost half the time, instead of keeping two or three ships down most of the time like it normally can. that seems like a countermeasure just as effective as i want it to be."
9/30/2008,"up at the top left of this page, ccp keeps a lot of player resources handy. some are genuinely useful - the tracking guide, for example, is excellent. some are less useful, and probably the most egregious of these is the item database. keeping this updated would, in a sensible world, take exactly zero effort - you update your item database on the tranquility servers, and it dumps it straight to the website automatically. however, not only is it not updated automatically, it's not updated at all. look on the item database for marauders, jump freighters, or the other trinity ships - they're not there. look at the amarrian ships updated in the boost patch months ago - they're still listed as their old versions. it looks like the last time it was updated was revelations ii, which came out in july 2007. there is also a plethora of information there that is either useless or actively misleading to new players - thrust strength is an interesting window into design paths not taken, but it should not be on a site that is most likely to be checked by the newest players. finally, and most annoyingly, there is no sorting whatsoever done. it's not alphabetical, it's not in order of most used to least, it's not in order of ship sizes, it's just random. i would like to see the following changes made to the item database:- keep it up to date at all times. - remove all information with no game effect.- sort all pages alphabetically. having a database that's easily accessible and with urls is convenient, and it should be made as useful as it could be. a third-party skill monitor having a better-maintained item database than the official website is embarrassing, and this should be fixed."
9/30/2008,"most definitely supported. sitting at work doing nothing but browsing the item database since i can't play eve there, and realizing it's about1 year out of date at least."
9/30/2008,"with regards to the issue of people using the skill queue to shut down their accounts for longer periods, the answer seems simple: all skill training pauses when an account goes inactive. alternatively, training pauses after the account has been inactive for a week (therefore protecting people who accidentally let their account lapse).this prevents people from abusing the queue concept, while allowing it's functionality to benefit those who are actively playing. yes, this is a 'nerf' to those who engage in the pinnacle of afk gaming (cancelling their account while training a long skill), but frankly, i don't see this as a negative./supported"
9/30/2008,"sorry, but i'm gonna have to disagree here. the reason they don't have this feature is that there would be no value in having an account continue to be paid if you could queue up skills to be trained. that, and their people logged-in would change, which is one of their objectives (to push the envelope of mmo design).if people download macro programs, they get what they deserve. if they get a trojan or virus on their computer, they chose to download the program and only admit their guilt when they complain to ccp. i don't even know why ccp posted that warning, as it doesn't affect them or their servers.with the dual-skill (i think you mean dual, not duel) system, people will simply set <insert high-rank level 5 skill trainings> to run, then let their account expire for 3 months. this will not benefit ccp, as ccp is a business whose purpose is to make money by providing an enjoyable recreational product."
9/30/2008,"i support this.they could even make it so that you can change your skill within your ""my character"" tab on the eve online website. could creata a whole different situation for people at work. they can just log in and change the skill when the other one is finished. finally a chance to get rid of those pesky short lvl 1/2 skills."
9/30/2008,"damn. and how many low slots does it have? my iteron 5 is 38,000m3. just 3 low slots makes this better then a fully expanded iteron 5 with no rigs. how many rigs does this have? 2-3? damn this boy will be epic industrial ship. easily better then all other ships. with the exceptions of freighters.oh boy that smokes beauty. i can smoke out 2jetcans in my hulk in like half hour and then come in with this boy. tractor them and take them both immediately. my iteron 5 can pick up 1 jetcan + about 11,000m3 and has 2 tractors. beauty.damn son. you are basically making the 30 days for iteron 5 worthless training. go for this one right away."
9/30/2008,"someone could whack me over the head with a ""balance"" cluebat, if they have a reason to, but logically i don't see why you shouldn't be able to configure a normal fab (i.e. station industry) to do ore compression like a ship floating in space can. of course, i also don't see why you shouldn't be able to produce just about anything (small, anyway...) with a rorqual's industrial core, if it is ""reconfiguring"" itself into a factory..."
9/30/2008,"clearly you never actually bother reading the dev blogs or interviews, like the recent stackless io release. just because you view a particular feature added to the game as 'useless' doesn't make it so. perhaps you should get off your high horse and recognise that this is a very deep multiplayer game with enough complexity that no one person finds appeal in every part of it. if ccp have determined that a given feature adds appeal, they have every right to add it, and you have every right to not continue to pay them money; that's about it. plus you clearly know nothing about lag if you think that ambulation or even more amusingly, factional warfare, add to lag.i truly can't believe you are against the notion of more subscribers purely because more people might cause more lag - that's just plain stupid.yes i support the notion that larger fleets should be less laggy, and that either large fleet battles should either be fun, or not possible, not somewhere in-between (for reference, many talk of trying to get the return of the small roaming gang, so huge fleets aren't everyone's cup of tea, but they should be possible).i'm not quite sure why this issue is necessary given that it's very clear ccp have this goal already in mind (a quick glance at the infiniband project would show that)."
9/30/2008,"after last night this issue once again rears its ugly head.ccp, you can't make pos warfare mechanics the way they are and then punish fleets for trying to fight.last night's engagement was a travesty and you should be ashamed of yourselves. not only was the lag crippling to nc, but it wasnt for gbc... resulting in a slaughter and a bad taste in a lot of people's mouths.i do not expect this to be fixed but i have to post on it anyway. the game is broken and i'm not sure i want to play it like this anymore."
9/30/2008,in 2005 when i began playing this game i remember no major instances of lag .now i notice lag just in normal game play and thats been going on for some time..lag in missions..lag in loading solar systems...lag in warp..so on so on..i do believe stackless python will go a long way in helping..but the problem is while player numbers have grown quickly the effort to produce programming and infrastructure to handle the load has (forgive the pun)lagged behind..i dont believe trying to discourage new players from joining or changing mechanics in a way that only benefits the highly skilled etc.is the answer anymore..its way beyond that..time to get serious ccp if your gonna add new features and entice more players then better get to work on supporting it!1 or it will bite you in the rear end
9/30/2008,"holding space in 0.0 is not a small gang level of play. not to wave a flag for one side or the other on this. the fight should decide the victor, not node crash/who can re-log in the fastest.small scale fights are great, but they do not win major conflicts.ccp fix the game. goto a vmware format or something. allow for something other the game programming to load level the nodes. o/s level balancing could possibly help here. i do not know what your data center looks like nor do i know what your clusters hardware/infrastructure setup is. you've got a good game here and you need to pony up and fix it. make it the game. slow up on adding new material until you fix whats currently wrong.my 2 cents."
9/30/2008,/me signed
9/30/2008,what you need is a proposal to change the way sovereignty warfare works in 0.0. at the moment it encourages (necessitates) enormous blobs as the only way of harming the enemy. you need a complete and fundamental re-write of the sovereignty war mechanics that makes blobbing tactically and strategically stupid.there is no technical fix here. only option is to change the rules so the wisest fleet commanders and alliance planners distribute their forces and avoid blob fest scenarios as a bad idea.
9/30/2008,"as much as everyone likes to hate blob warfare, i've yet to see any reasonable mechanic that would replace it. i know how much we all hate real world comparisons, but there's no warfare tactics i know of to explain why the larger of two similarly equipped forces should lose on the types of battlefields you encounter in eve. pos warfare isn't fun, but even without it blobs are going to be around as long as there are large organizations of players that want to win fights.ccp needs to fix this on a technical level because they designed a game with large fleet battles in mind, and the current server technology can't support it."
9/30/2008,that would require a change to game mechanics whereby the smaller fleet inflicts more economic damage upon the larger fleet. and i can't think of any such change i could support.
9/30/2008,"right now, eve is plagued with limits on how much we can say. a forum post can't be more than 4000 characters. a bio is even shorter, and an evemail is shorter yet. even the notepad in game, which should specifically be for storing huge gobs of text you can't put anywhere else, is apparently having a fairly short character limit imposed upon it. this is stupid and counterproductive. instead of making one forum post when i have something long to say, i need to make five. instead of sending one corp mail with intel, i need to send three. this adds overhead to the system, and makes the player experience more annoying. take all character limits anywhere even close to the game, and either eliminate them entirely or make them so large as to have no meaning. if you want to make us have a 100000 character limit on a forum post, i won't object too strenuously - anyone writing a novella can handle a bit of chapterization. but the limits should not interfere with the play experience of average players - someone who wants to ramble for a couple pages in their bio, or discuss a mildly complex business deal via evemail, or post more than three dozen links in a forum post, should be allowed to do so without any restrictions.also, it should be noted that a thread similar to this, related to bio lengths specifically, has already been sent to ccp. however, since the problem affects more than that, i'm posting this in hopes that the solution will as well.edit: apparently there are concerns about unlimited text lengths being exploitable(see post #18). i don't quite get it, but i'll adjust my proposal accordingly - add a ""whenever practical"" to the above. i'd rather have short text lengths than a broken game, but i still prefer that they be raised as high as is safe."
9/30/2008,"i support the principle whole-heartedly. but.forums won't change until they bring in more development effort and re-do the whole thing. as you noted - we've already submitted an issue on the bio length and will be arguing about the outcome when we get our chat with the devs. re the other text limits - yes it needs to be sorted out for sure. but one thing you need to be sure of is that larger text limits in chat won't be exploited by cheating players in-game to gain an advantage over their enemies. eve is a game where people have invented can spamming, bookmark bombs, shuttle explosions, and all sorts of dodgy techniques to gain an advantage over their virtual foes - think ""whats the worst thing a bunch of exploiters can do with this change"" when suggesting an increase to game functionality that impacts bandwidth issues. sad to say that decent adult players do suffer by sharing the playground with people prepared to exploit the system to gain an advantage in virtual war. but saying that - by all means lets construct an issue that makes sense in general terms and see if we can't thrash out a compromise that lets us type more without delivering the mechanics into the hands of people who will use it to spam their enemies with 10,000 character rude images to lag out jump in fleets."
9/30/2008,"you raise a few good points. bios have already been asked about, and forums are also in the works to my understanding. the mail system should likewise be fixed wholesale, and not just having a character limit increased - we need a sentbox, an address book, options on how to read it, and elimination of character limits, not just one of those. it's only really the notepad that needs to be addressed singly. i stuck them together to make a point about how the game should work as much as i did because the topics have never been addressed before. regarding utility as a lag bomb, the obvious solution is pagination. every 10000 characters, have a little arrow at the bottom to go forward or back a page. something similar should be done with hardin's corp history - i tried loading that once, it took multiple minutes. i doubt many would use something like a bio, which gets read in a lot of contexts, few of them enemies in combat, as a lag bomb, but even if only for bandwidth reasons i can support automatically splitting it into pages. my goal here is to allow people to carry on business without artificial and unnecessary limits. the details of that, as you say, are up for debate."
9/30/2008,"1400 ii's and the tempest/maelstrom are god awful since ccp chose to impose scripting on everyone.the fact that a rokh and an apoc with t1 guns can vastly outrange a tempest with 1400 ii's is a god damn travesty. the fact that they can do that with superior tracking adds insult to injury. the fact that my 1400 ii's hold 10 rounds of tremor before a reload in laggy fleet fights is a slap in the face.without rigs three damage mods each:t1 fitted apoc with microvave l ( 2 te's 1 tc w/optimal ).... 170 + 24 .02063 tracking 226 dps t1 fitted apoc with radio l ( 2 te's 1 tc w/optimal).... 194 + 24 .02063 tracking 203 dpst2 fitted tempest with carbonized lead ( 2 te's 2 tc's w/optimal)..141 + 42 .001334 tracking 291 dpst2 fitted tempest with tremor l ( 2te's 2 tc's w/optimal )..159 + 42 .000333 tracking 292 dpswhy ccp? why does some 6 month old toon with amarr bs4 have more capability in a long range fleet battle than a 3 year old character who spent months training up large tech2 projectiles?with that tracking, a tempest cant track a cruiser hull at 150km and does not reliably hit a battleship when it's moving.this needs to be fixed"
9/30/2008,"when the best viable artillery platform is an abaddon, something's wrong with arties."
9/30/2008,"the current policy of refusing all large scale losses for reimbursement is harmful, illogical, and is in need of reconsideration. ostensibly, the logic behind this is that ccp does not wish to put the man hours behind having to investigate claims. in reality, this policy is spiteful, derisive and is a horrible business model towards its customers. a carrier is approximately 1.2-1.3 billion isk with fittings. if we take the 20-40 mil an hour bench mark, that's 120 manhours through missioning or ratting. this may be lessened through other income gathering methods (which is outside the purview of this debate) but the fact is that most fleetfights will see several thousand manhours expended and then wasted because of a desync or black-screen. this in itself is quite frustrating, and perhaps the single most unappealing aspect of the game. the fact that it is blatantly obvious moderators do not even examine the complaints shows a sign of callousness well beyond that. the policy should be changed to as follows:if evidence of a desync can be provided (no modules activated, no hardeners on, not warped out and evidence of similar circumstances occuring in the same system) the hull should be replaced, along with the destroyed modules, and any insurances payments should be reversed. from an immediate perspective, this does not change the immediate balance of power. these ships are still rendered ineffective while the pilot has to replace them. they suffer the cost of replacing modules, and the parties fortunate enough to find the wreck get the dropped modules. coversely, it reverses the long strategic advantage gained from server performance failure. pilots concerned do not lose their killmails, or the loot acquired, and they get the momentary benefit of those ships removed. afflicted pilots' disaffection for eve is lessened, reducing net outflow of players from the game, and improving this particular point of customer/client relations. player's patience with hardware limitations is not unlimited. ccp can at least indicate that their gms can spend three minutes on a customer for several hundred man hours put into a system, instead of callously showing appreciation for their patrons' time and money by simply sending pre-scripted responses."
9/30/2008,our logs show you should not fly what you can not replace.
9/30/2008,"it's not spite if it's truth. investigating these claims takes a lot of man-hours, and ccp likes spending money on customer service staff as much as any other company - i.e., not at all. and given the ubiquity of desyncs, it would really be a monumental expense for them to investigate them. i'd rather they used the time and money to fix the problem - which, if the last dev blog is to be trusted, they're well on their way to doing - than to fix the symptoms. besides, for better or for worse, desync is a known concern when you warp into a big fleet op, and being lagged and killed happens. and more importantly, it has always happened. a known risk, with a known lack of reimbursement, should not be a surprise. of course, ity's somethign that should be fixed, but as i said above, fixing the lag is the right solution, not putting a band-aid on."
9/30/2008,"i also take flights, but should one i take crash, my next of kin would have little issue successfully taking suit against the airline in question, nor would my knowledge of the risk mitigate this in any way. people weren't desynced warping in, we had a fight going, and then the entire node died. following this, everyone was shafted by ccp seeing as how best estimated put the active players at 60 total, with the remaining ~900 people being unable to do anything except die or stare at a black screen. i agree the solution is to fix the lag itself, but that doesn't mean that when servers deprive people of their labor with nothing in return, they shouldn't be remunerated."
9/30/2008,"if the logs do not show anything, then fix the logs. it's blindingly obvious that there are desynch/black-screen/etc problems in this game, and pretending they don't exist is not going to change anything."
9/30/2008,"being able to afford to replace a ship != losing it in a desync.even if you can afford it, its hugely frustrating when you are in warp while seeing your hull reduce, knowing there is absolutely nothing you can do. losing a carrier (or whatever) in an actual battle is less annoying, just slightly inconvenient."
9/30/2008,"if you are tired of de-syncs, lag, blackscreens, etc., then why do you blob? you know the servers can barely handle 300 people in a system. so why do you get upset when, big surprise, a system with 900+ people in it suffers from those problems? ccp should actually increase lag and desyncs, that way you blobbers never get the chance to fight in the first place."
9/30/2008,now that i can agree with. spiteful much?
9/30/2008,"i think you are either unfamiliar with the situation, or are just simply so poorly versed on the mechanics that you seem to equate a simple reality of forces necessary to counter an opposing group with some malicious decision to use numbers capable of destroying the system. there was a hostile force of ~450 in system. this force had close to 100 capitals, 300 support, including 4 motherships and two titans. the intitial allied forces that breached were roughly 600, not including the ships we held in reserve. of the roughly 1000 people who loaded, 920 were looking at black screens for 4 hours. 80 people at most were able to play. it would not have mattered who held the system prior to the battle, as the node crashed everyone had to load up because the node crashed and ejected every player from the system. there is no way around this situation in the mechanics of the game. when 90% of your customers are unable to access the game, this comes down to a design flaw. screaming 'fix the lag' doesn't change this systemic flaw. i empathize with the difficulty of making such a scenario playable, and i'd be willing to allow ccp the time to make it playable; but in lieu of a working scenario, asking the majority of participants in a fight to bare the brunt of a broken mechanic is simply unnacceptable."
9/30/2008,closer to 40% iirc. not to mention not all 0.0 players are regularly lagged out and unable to login the majority of the time.
9/30/2008,(sniped the comments about getting evemails about my loss 10 min before i saw my ship getting destroyed because it doesn't really matter anymore...still give my support to this issue)
9/30/2008,"in this particular battle, local was at 600 and change, 1021 prior to the crash. however, given the privileged position of being a lazy fc who wasn't actively in charge of either support or capitals, i was able to tally up the numbers on both sides through straw polls, killboard stats, and contacts with bob and nc/allied forces."
9/30/2008,"can someone explain to me in simply terms (other than epic fun) why it is necessary to have 1000 pilots flighting in a single system? what tactical/strategic advantage does that serve, and are there no alternatives?if i was losing ships to the lag monster, i'd adjust tactics to some other means of conquering the universe; are you saying this simply isn't possible?"
9/30/2008,"the advantage it serves is simple - if you have a fleet big enough to drop a capital in 20 seconds, and they have a fleet big enough to drop a capital in one minute, you're going to inflict three times the damage upon them that they are upon you - possibly more, since their relative fleet size will also drop faster. the bigger fleet usually wins against the smaller, and that's true in virtually every context, in both real war and fictional. just like the american navy could crush the canadian, the 500-man blob can crush the 50-man with massively disproportionate losses. about the only way to avoid this is aoe weaponry - it doesn't matter how big your fleet is if i nuke it in harbour. but eve only has three varieties of aoe - one overpowered(doomsdays), one very narrow(smartbombs), and one vastly overcosted(bombs). the only one of these that can be targeted usefully is the one that's most useless, because it's an easily interdicted weapon system on an easily destroyed ship. perhaps there are ways of avoiding this - give some t2 ammo a splash radius, perhaps? - but at present there is no conceivable way for a small, well-built fleet to beat a big, well-built fleet. as for countermeasures, you can try, but the problem is that if you try to avoid lag with a 100-man fleet, the enemy's 500-man fleet that doesn't care about lag will show up and pulverize you. besides, you may be losing ships to the lag monster, but so is the enemy - it's not like you can eliminate lag for your fleet while keeping it for the enemy's."
9/30/2008,"if there are 100 people willing to fight each other, then coming to a compromise is useless because neither side trusts each other. there's no such thing as tactics when it comes down to this because numbers usually make the most difference."
9/30/2008,"you should know that such a concept rests solely around the prisoner's dilemma, insofar as both parties seek to to get the other to co-operate whilst allowing themselves to defect. no group is going to accept a numeric disadvantage, even if scaled down as you propose, nor does it mathematically make sense to. (i'll leave it to you to learn lanchester's laws, unless you'd wish to trade your polaris frigate for tutoring lessons) simply put, it's against both the mechanics and scope of the game-play to seperate battles. essentially, the only way your proposal is viable is if the party who must take the system volunteers to jump in one at a time, thus providing a lag-free experience for all parties involved, and often with the same results. so, tl;dr version, no the mechanics of the game do not permit splitting a battle.edited: correcting point previously noted."
9/30/2008,serenity is not an employee of ccp.
9/30/2008,"let's not confuse that arguement with such trivial things as facts :d moreso, this is not the thread for discussions on tactics resulting to such lag, the lag itself, or anything of that nature. this thread is predominantly concerned with ccp's policy on reimbursements, and its interaction with game mechanics."
9/30/2008,"i'm not sure whats funnier... the fact he assumed he was ccp or the fact that its totally random and off the wall.i for one can't make the connection.as for the discussion... even if ccp manages to fix the so called problem... its going to exponentially get out of hand.feasibly the only way you could have a lag free massive battle... is to make sure both parties have an equal number of pilots of sufficent ""epic size"" to insure the battle actually takes place.in other words.... 300 ships on either end or something.because i don't know about you guys.... but crashing nodes to win is not what i call... fun.if all the massive wars for 0.0 where like that... hell id quit... wheres the fun in that.id rather get my @$$ kicked in live time... not blacked out."
9/30/2008,"unless the bulk of advertising, devblogs, and information regarding conflict in eve online is false, warfare is never about a fair fight. if a gm were to state to both sides, ""alright, the servers are not intended to fight at this level, so my calculations are that x bs, x dreads, x caps, etc, from this side and y bs, y dreads, y caps from that side are a reflective distribution of numbers arrayed, and i will be willing to move all those outside this number to a staging ground/away from the combat zone"" and allow the reflective portion to duke it out, i'd be happy with the outcome, whatever it may be. this isn't something that the onus should be put on the players. this is a fault in the mechanics of the game, and i simply feel that ccp should own up to their responsibility and take the necessary steps to rectify their shortcomings, rather than let their playerbase arbitrarily suffer. suggesting that battles should be divided into even numbered engagements simply evidences an abject ignorance of warfare and conflict to the point that i'd like to ask drake that if he and i are fighting, and he has more isk than me, perhaps he could send me some because it's unfair of his financial advantage."
9/30/2008,"just saying, if one side had 600 frontline ships available to confront a 450 ship-fleet, with further reserves available - they could have gone and sieged 3-4 other locations and left enough forces to camp the enemy where they stood. in the best event, the smaller enemy would be able to counterattack one of those 3-4 locations, but would have to charge through a camp and jump in through cynos, loading grid second.accepting the loss of a system while striking numerous others surely is something that would work better in the future."
9/30/2008,"wow.... you really do think things through don't you.epic fail.1: ccp owns up to it and fixes lag by getting more servers more hardware.2: fleet battles numbering twice if not thrice there size before shows up.3: server node crashes4: rinse, dry, repeatcare to try again?"
9/30/2008,"you should not lose ships in this game while staring at a loading screen, period, whether its a frigate, or a titan. that's just about the epitome of crappy, ill-coded game play.if their logs can't show them that the player wasn't actually in the game when their ship died, they damn well need to enhance their logger. having a ship replaced that died before you loaded shouldn't even require a petition. it's a defect in how the game is coded, and if they can't fix it, they should at very least fix it so that players aren't disadvantaged by it."
9/30/2008,"once again, this isn't a question of choice of tactics. moreso, you're saying that once you have 400 in fleet, the jump button should change to the ""i win"" button on the overview?"
9/30/2008,"care to troll again? this isn't a decision-making discussion on behalf of the players. ccp being unable to produce the product as advertised and paid for should result in some form of compensation. it should not be left to the players to 'speculate' what the server's capable of and then find some way to 'negotiate' with the enemy to make a game playable. we're not playing alternative-dispute-resolution-online. this is simply a question of ccp taking responsibility for its errors, even if it means an increased workload."
9/30/2008,agree very much
9/30/2008,"really shouldn't even be a matter of increased petitions and workloads, though. losing your ship before you are actually in the game = broken / defective / not working right.can anyone really say with a straight face that your ship arriving in the game before you do, and dying before you ever get there is ""working as intended""? look, it's not rocket science. there is a protocol (set of messages that go back and forth between the client and the server) when you log in. like so:1. server recieves login request from client.2. server authenticates the user, and starts sending game data.3. server places the player's ship on the grid4. data transmission to the client is complete, client starts rendering the game (you stop seeing the ""entering game"" screen).5. client finishes rendering the game, and gives the player control (you can start clickin stuff and activating modules).what's wrong with the above? it's pretty obvious. step 3 shouldn't happen before step 5. they coded it wrong. in low-load situations, it's not obvious that it's coded wrong, becasue the time lapse between 3 and 5 doesn't matter much. in high load situations, it is obvious, and it breaks the game.since it's coded wrong, if they can't easily fix it, they should just put an extra bit in there where the server goes ""damn, his ship got blown up before step 5, stick another one in his hanger"".the end. it's broken. fix it."
9/30/2008,/signed
9/30/2008,"the lagfests we are seeing almost every day only help to make it clear that this game cannot handle the fights people want to get into.even though they try very hard to boost systems by throttling connections, restrictions on player capacity it just doesnt handle it.if you loose a ship through their server not being able to handle the amount of people in the system you should get reimbursed fully. this is a game i know, but we also pay money every month to play this game!"
9/30/2008,to answer the op...i agree ccp shouldn't be shining you on and replying with canned answers in these instances. this policy is wrong and it should be addressed.
9/30/2008,/bump
9/30/2008,isn't setting a ceiling to the price of a gtc an indirect way of fixing it's price?
9/30/2008,"it's a fairly direct way, actually. it's not like these people are asking it to be capped at 10 billion, after all."
9/30/2008,"won't happen and shoult not happend, also comparing gtc to other necessary good is not even wrong. governments ""rarelly"" fix prices for luxury goods."
9/30/2008,"the problem here is that gtc cards now cost more per month in real cash than when the 90 day cards were around. so yes, ccp is making more money if the playerbase would be stable or larger than b4 the 90 day cards got removed. so yes, they can take action to bring down the price of gtc's, it would mean lowering prices on them. :) i for one am all for that as i still think we got screwed over with the 60 day cards. setting fixed prices for gtc cards in isk is a bad idea though :)"
9/30/2008,"working as intended, i agree with adding 30 & 90 days gtc again but they won't reduce they prices, so these would be added with new prices proportional to current 60 days gtc. if anyone thinks they would change this he's a fool and should learn a bit of economics too."
9/30/2008,no. bad idea.yes the gtcs are ridiculously priced... all you have to do is not buy them. eventually those who want to get isk for gtc... will lower prices.if people are still willing to buy at such a ridiculous price... then why would these gtc traders lower prices?the claim that people are faking sales... is absurd.
9/30/2008,"meh, put up wtb orders and spam it in the ""other"" channel in the trade tab if your buying a couple at a time you can still get them for 350-400mill"
9/30/2008,"i'm all for using mmos as a lab to test real-world economic theory - for that matter, i'd like to go to grad school for it at some point - but there are limits even for me. forex is not fun for anyone but the geekiest of finance majors, and the eve player base is decidedly not composed of wall street types(these days, they can't afford the subscription). it would make gameplay an utter nightmare - you'd have to keep track of five separate wallets, and keep five submarkets active - and you wouldn't even have the convenience of your visa statement automatically converting it all into your home currency, because your wallet doesn't run through a corporation that plays on the forex markets. you'd be throwing a huge roadblock up to anyone who doesn't have enough money to carry a comfortable sum around in each of five currencies, and you'd be doing it for the sake of making internet spaceships more closely approximate real-world financial markets. i like my financial theory as much as the next guy, but this is taking it too far. it's still a game, and gameplay still has to come first."
9/30/2008,"i'm hardly suggesting it be made as difficult to understand as the real world market.no reason anyone who doesn't want to see all the different currencies should have to. press the esc button and click on ""show all monetary values in isk"" the player's purchases would automatically be made first through the currency that is required and then the player's other currencies would be exchanged at what the computer determines to be the best value available. only players that want to get into it would ever have to see what was going on behind the scenes....the same way most markets work.as you say, it's a game. there's no reason a group of creative minds can't think of ways to make something complicated seem easy."
9/30/2008,"the real world currency market is not difficult to understand - it's actually fairly simple, as long as you just look at the what and the how rather than the why. it's just generally a headache. you know, that might actually work. as long as there was an active currency market, and there would be, there's no reason you couldn't automate it like you suggest. i still don't think that it's necessary or wise, but i'm less opposed to it now that you mention that possibility."
9/30/2008,no.
9/30/2008,your forgetting the programming effort involved in implementation of such a system would be quite daunting.but oh well.
9/30/2008,proposal is simplelet salvagers salvage podded pilots to retrieve special implant salvage materials.add bpcs via lp store/missions/exploration sites etc so that pilots can use the special implant salvage materials to build new implants.
9/30/2008,"kinda spooky if you think about, nerco'in someone floater for hardware.nice idea, but in a dark kind of way."
9/30/2008,nice!
9/30/2008,better yet..... sell the bodies for organic materials to medical service stations.that's how they get clones for there clone bays. : o )
9/30/2008,"grisly, but interesting. i'd like to see ccp's take on this."
9/30/2008,the mida (industrial) expansion will allow players to build implants. no idea on how it will work.
9/30/2008,"hashes are secure. hashes are secure. hashes are secure.see what i did there?how about actually justifying this instead of making a dozen posts all saying the same thing?proclaiming that you 'ripped' password hashes from /etc/shadow hardly makes you look any smarter. an 8 year old can 'rip' passwords from there, although most people prefer to call it copy and pasting.if hashes weren't reasonably secure, i'd be worried about other (more important) things then my eve account."
9/30/2008,the difficulty is 90% getting the hashes and only about 10% turning the hashes into useful access credentials. [yoda]the dark side clouds our vision and moves in secrecy. experience security breaches you will. limit their damage you must.[/yoda]i like the 8-year old comparison. let it be known i'm throwing experience out there just to look smarter instead of asking that ccp not hold a database of mine or anyone's access credentials. it's bad practice as i've already pointed out half a dozen times.
9/30/2008,"in the real world... if you dont earn over say 20,000 a year... you dont get taxed.if you earn a million every month... you get taxed 30%setup a graduated tax for the npc corps so that anyone earning say a billion a month of isk in the npc corps get taxed a certain amount.if they dont like this... they can make themselves a corp or join a corp."
9/30/2008,or we can decide not to make people play their game the way you want them to.
9/30/2008,csm turned this down flat last time... i doubt they will pass it in the future.

9/30/2008,"i think that docking/services limitations depending on who is in control of the system is a good concept and makes sense from a storyline point of view.if you are in fw then losing docking rights is a penalty for failure. and i think more immersive.i don't agree with someone else's suggestion of an 'end game' big payout, that encourages people to blob up on one side and farm it. but that wasn't the op's suggestion anyway."

9/30/2008,"the bottom line is that if you don't want muppets on the csm, then you shouldn't vote for doctor bunsen.it really is that simple.of course, it does require a little bit of research amongst the voters to work out who the less suitable candidates are, but then it's part of the fundamental nature of democaracy that the system won't work without an informed electorate."
9/30/2008,"look mate, in a game where you try to blow eachother's ships up and harm other players, you can't honestly expect the game to take something that seriously. don't like the bigots? pod them.additionally, ccp stands for crowd control productions. it doesn't mean thought control productions...besides, who would enforce this wonderful utopia world of eve, you? there aren't enough gms to handle this. they're too busy moving people in and out of jita by hand."
9/30/2008,"just to clear this up a bit:csm sent in it's documentation, ccp responded with 1-2 line (or in some cases 3 word) answers on those topics. this was, as most would agree, unacceptable for most of the issues raised. a compiled set of questions from the csm delegates were again sent to ccp asking for clarification of it's responses, and this point that is what the csm is waiting on - a response to that requested clarification from ccp."
9/30/2008,"how about the csm sending an open letter to ccp's ceo (whose name i recognise but could never spell from memory), copying in a number of prominent gaming sites which have already given column inches to the csm, complaining that despite ccp's assurances of how the csm would work, ccp are constantly holding up progress and appear to not really care any more now that they have milked the press coverage for all they can..."
9/30/2008,"no. given that the csm's only power comes from their ability to influence ccp, burning your bridges with ccp by slamming them in the media is a very bad idea. that is a last resort, and even then i'm not sure what provocation ccp could come up with that would justify the csm actively trying to destroy the game."
9/30/2008,"why a bad idea? if they don't keep their promises they should be blamed. if they are nto stupid they wouldn't break their media campaing by suddenlly closing down csm or cutting all comunications.seriouslly, of a staff of over-300 guys/gals on ccp they can't devote soem hours to comunicate with csm and respond to feedback by the comunity? smells bad."
9/30/2008,"my point there was really that ccp have jumped on a media bandwagon with the csm, and they have made some public commitments... and now the spotlight has faded and it is time to deliver on them, don't seem to be doing so.as a minor example, i distinctly remember ccp saying that they were going to host chat logs... i have just tried to see how far they had got with this, only to find that when i clicked on the csm link on the left hand column (oddly positioned in the middle of 'my account' and 'my character') only to find that the link is broken. way to support the csm.maybe herschel is right and an open letter is a last resort - but if ccp are not responding, it needs to be escalated. if someone at work isn't doing what they should be and is ignoring your emails, you can escalate to their manager, to get them kick the person's arse and get them to do their job. i think it's definitely time to consider doing that."
9/30/2008,"my guess is that right now, ccp is probably of the opinion that they've sent off their answers, and the csm is just being annoying and hard to please to try to get unnecessary information, and that it's making them look bad in the process. it's entirely possible that they don't think that they've done anything wrong, and as such see no need to fix it. remember, the csm is a side thing for most of ccp, and their day job is still hacking together code for the next few expansions and supporting the game generally. you can't expect them to write a book every two months. i don't know if your viewpoint or my hypothetical ""ccp viewpoint"" is more accurate, or if either of them even comes close to the mark. there's very little information for us to judge it based on. but don't bring out the sledgehammer just because you're a little bit annoyed.now that is a much more reasonable solution. get email addresses going up the chain of command, and send off nasty letters internally if you can't get satisfaction through normal means. but don't go airing dirty laundry outside the family unless it is truly necessary, and right now it's not."
9/30/2008,"i would focus on getting your contacts to escalate your requests. keep it professional. keep it civil. they did not have to give us a forum to voice our ideas or concerns for change. they could have as easily told us to pound sand. of course that is not very healthy to your goodwill and growing customer base. i have seen the attitude from them before. now from a business stand point. we are not privy to their current work load, issues, projects, man hour shortage/overage or what crisis is currently flying through the office atm. we assume since they have 300 people, that some of them have nothing to do. if i had 300 people and some of them had nothing to do, i would not have 300 people the next day. and i would not be hiring either."
