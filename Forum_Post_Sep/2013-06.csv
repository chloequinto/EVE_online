6/1/2013,"yes. because your original premise is flawed.there is no ""exploit"" or ""abuse"" of the because...- you can't reliably designate people good or bad on a mechanical level. people find ways to be bad without breaking any rules (so there is really no point to putting arbitrary restrictions on bounties).- bounties do [still] mean something both literally and figuratively... it means someone dislikes someone else enough to put a reward up for their destruction and you can get an extra bit of cash for destroying that person (all that is wrong here are your perceptions on what the ""wanted"" sign should mean).- ""good"" and ""bad"" are relative... as is everything else (again... there really is no point to putting arbitrary restrictions on bounties because what you consider a ""stupid"" reason for placing a bounty another person might consider perfectly legitimate).- the merc market is still thriving. check out crime and punishment subforum sometime."
6/1/2013,"so what you're saying is that if i decided anyone who visits jita sucks, and sit there all day handing out bounties, that's not stupid?if i decide that anyone who dares ask for or give help in a help channel sucks and hand out boutnies all day, that's not stupid?if i decide that all forum users are lame and start handing out bounties 'cause i saw their name on the forum, that's not stupid?if i decide that anyone who does not have bounty should get one and start posting bounties on anyone who does not have one, that's not stupid?why is that not stupid?i could go on, but i think you get the idea. a single troll could have an impact on a multitude of players."
6/1/2013,hence this thread and my attempt to have an actual debate about the .(... thanks for the major on your post after i responded to it)
6/1/2013,"to me it'd be stupid... what you believe is none of my business. but i'll still kill the people you placed a bounty on if it's high enough.see above.again... your prerogative (and i have personally done this from time to time).if you have the cash and think your reason is good enough... go for it.everything is relative/subjective.and if a single troll can stir up **** and cause chaos, mayhem, and/or a war by placing bounties everywhere... excellent! more players are interacting and in conflict with one another!"
6/1/2013,your counter argument is reasonable and much appreciated. i will give it some thought.
6/1/2013,"here.your reply implied exactly that and stated i was was incorrect because of that implication. i meant contacting corps directly, as that's how we do things right now.yes and your whole premiss is based on you deciding what is and isn't a 'good' bounty. from this premiss spawned the new contract system, that you are now pushing. it's doesn't have much in the way of details, so i'm asking about it.i was, you avoided answering that question. it was directed at your 'new' contract idea. why would i know about how concord would interact in this system, it's your idea. isn't it down to you to flesh it out?what does it matter? it's not your place to decide that. it's not your place to dictate who can and can't do what with their own isk and the .just because someone picks your ideas apart and asks questions you don't find easy to answer, doesn't make them a troll. that argument, as well as avoiding answering question, is a very weak stance to take. you either have faith in what you are discussing, or you don't.destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
6/1/2013,"again... incorrect, i was referring to you not comprehending my multiple previous post talking about the mercs and the morph of the discussion of the thread....you only want 'extreme details' so you can pick them apart for flaws without trying to be objective (i am trying to be objective, you're not.). i'm not going to (nor could anyone) come to a 100% viable solution without asking for input. if you see a hole, why not offer a suggestion? failing that, we know you hate my idea. that's fine (most people do). good for you.if you actually read the thread (and this just proves that you didn't (no more responses for you, sorry.)) you could clearly see that this was not my idea, and i made it point to say so, i merely liked the idea. any refinement of details should be done as a combination of ideas from multiple players. no one is going to get anywhere if people can't help others out with refining their ideas. like i said, it is impossible for a single person to come to something 100% viable without asking for (and getting) input.you are. just cause you are on the side of defending the existing system... doesn't mean you aren't deciding. it is the responsibility of the player base, hence this forum.i'm just getting sick of answer things over and over and having to rephrase thing specifically so you can comprehend them. how about before you click post, you click preview and scroll through the thread. just a thought... or do i need to tell you how to use more than one tab in your browser, and what browser to use, and what a tab is?thank you for your time (believe it or not, it is appreciated), though you get no more of mine.why? you proved to me you did not read the entire thread.please refer to post #27. and the following statement""it's your idea. isn't it down to you to flesh it out?"""
6/1/2013,"yes i am aware you had the suggestion from another player, semantics. you've added it to your idea pool. the specific question related to concords involvement in that idea. i would imagined a person with such a high intellect as yours, would have some opinion on whether they would be excluded or not. i guess you are right and comprehension of that intellect was somewhat lacking.it still boils down the the same bad premiss. which is what you have decided is and isn't a good reason for a bounty. i personally don't give a sh*t why people do it, it adds to the game.let me ask you this, although i'm sure you'll avoid it also:would you object to the placement of a bounty, just out of random feelings of spite?destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
6/1/2013,"spite?people gave me a bounty for many reasons, none because i am bad or was bad to them. some thought my bounty to low so they helped it out. others as a show of support.i doubt any isk in my bounty is spiteful nor did i commit any crimes to achieve it.mmike azariah ----<U+FEFF> <U+FFFD>|(<U+30C4>)/<U+FFFD>"
6/1/2013,"that may be true, but i do have reason to ask him that question. it goes back to when we all had this discussion and i'm interested in his reply.destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
6/1/2013,"just out of common curtosy, i will reply to you one last time, unless you rather discuss?what do you think about concord intevention if the contract system was allowed to hirer killers?do you even support allowing the contract system to be used to place a bounty on someone? (which i have always wanted to see, i think the contract system could use a few additions. (which i will post in the features & ideas section in the future.))not at all, i just destroyed someone cyno frig just because i can (they had plenty of time to run).i have left my home constellation and now i'm exploring the more dangerous ares of eve in an attempt to better relate to the pirate players.imo the 'because i can' bounties, should not be part of the same system as the ones that get the top pirate players' faces posted on billboards around the universe.also, if a person wants to become the top pirate in the universe. i think they should have to earn it. and wtf! why can i put a bounty on myself? if i had to complain about just one thing, that would be it. it doesn't allow the top pirate pilot to be on the most wanted list. it allows the richest pirate to have his face plastered on the wanted boards if he so chooses."
6/1/2013,well if they would allow for skill respecialization it would atleast need serious consequences.for example if you would like to unlearn skill like mining barge you would be refunded only 50% (or even less) of the skill points you spent learning on it.this would be only way i would maybe allow it.
6/1/2013,"i'm by no means asking for local in null to be changed/removed to match wormhole space, merely pointing out that the current mechanics are the root cause behind both ""afk cloaking"" and hot dropping.so let me get this straight, the ""conditions are so different"" because wormhole players... actively keep their eyes open (via probes and dscan), rather than being lazy and relying on a mechanic that can be devalued / spoofed via afking have fits that are more appropriate for the situations (i.e. not minmaxed pve fits) are ""sufficiently organized"" sounds to me like wormhole players have the right idea then. they know they're not in a little happy safe farm zone."
6/1/2013,whats the risk in looking at the local list to determine who is in system and how many friends they have
6/1/2013,"to be honest this is a very silly idea, boarder lining stupid.what fights are you expecting in a highsec belt? all this does it make it that much easier for gankers to find targets making it easier for them to get an easy kill.once again another idea that only helps one part of the game but hurts the others. mining is tough enough for the people that do it. it pays little, has a ton of risk and the miners dont need something like this to make it worst. this will cause more miners to go switch to something else or worst unsub since they cant pay their plex fees. if less miners are mining that means less ore to buy to build ships. (how i earn my isk) which means less ships on the markets for pvpers. stop trying to make mining worst and maybe submit some ideas that help make it a worthy profession again."
6/1/2013,"i have run several low sec missions and i do agree they mosty suck the pay out isnt worth the risk. but making trade routes go through low sec would never work. the empires patrol those areas and they arent going to give them up anytime soon because that would be a loss of territory. what low sec needs is a reason to be there. fw has plexs that only show up in fw low sec, it gives people a reason to be there. giving some missions for pirate factions would be somthing that could bring people into low sec to run missions to get enough lp for that pirate hull. but low sec as it is its not worth the risk when you can just run missions in high sec then buy the hull.low sec ore is a joke. jaspet is pretty much worthless. its huge, comes in limited amounts and you can make more in the same time mining veld. now if jaspet was the only ore that gave zydrine.... there would be a huge reason to go into low. but you would have to take ore from null and everyone knows you cant touch anything in null sec because its ""end game"" blah blah blah. etcunless ccp is willing to make changes low sec will always be pirate havens and ghost towns.maybe let alliances stick up sov beacons in low. i know its a crazy idea but if you can claim the space your more likely to defend it. fw low sec has tons of fights because people are fighting to hold on to it. it means something to them."
6/1/2013,"highsec is entirely self-sufficient. it's not a closed community because there are things it lacks, and there are things it provides that other places lack.wormhole space will never be a closed gate community because it will always provide tech 3 components to the rest of new eden. don't get me wrong, i don't think that w-space should have anything close to everything available. i think there should be tons of juicy things that you can't get in w-space at all. but that doesn't mean it should not be possible to subsist alone in w-space. it is possible to subsist alone absolutely everywhere else, why not w-space too?"
6/1/2013,"that's why there are static wormholes. you can't cut yourself off. that is what makes eve unique. also, not having to play with other people is sort of an eve online and star wars: the old republic thing. not very many other mmos allow that."
6/1/2013,please link dev blog where it says that empire space is getting refining nerf. spread your fud elsewhere.
6/1/2013,"no dev blog, but there is much talk about equalizing empire because it has too many players and making too munch money.even ccp soundwave mentions in this interview, he thinks are too good."
6/1/2013,"the amount of money made in empire is not what this is about.this is about the fact that every part of new eden has some sort of ice except wormholes. every part of new eden can close its self off and ignore the outside world except wormholes. giving wormholes ice will not break the game, it will not cause the massive power blocks to shift, nor will it cause the all mighty jita to tremble. giving wormholes ice allows players that live in a wormhole to exist there just a slight bit easier. it is a small thing that would make the game alot more fun and go towards cooling tempers. it lets wormhole dwellers provide their own fuel, it gives non combat pilots in alliances something to do while they are inside the wormhole, it gives more targets to shoot at for combat pilots in a wormhole. you dont have to worry about the ice getting brought into empire to hurt the market since compression is terrible and we can only get 75% max yield from our refineries. this idea doesnt hurt anyone but helps alot of people."

6/2/2013,"i endorse the idea of adding our smart filters to the overview and allowing more contextual sorting. if we get to work on the overview in the near future, this would be the kind of thing i would want to do to improve it.i also hope our new ship group icons will eventually make it into the overview, allowing players to read instantly what type of ships are around them. but first we need to make sure they are good enough in a feature that isn't as critical as the overivew. so once we have released them in some way or form and evaluated their usefulness, then i would want to see them used in the tactical overlay and the overiew.ccp arrow | director of user experience | eve online | @ccp_arrow"
6/2/2013,"the ship info panels could be helpful but not if they interrupt quick selection in the overview window.i think the icons for the shiptype we are seeing on the overview should be reworked. the destroyer icon is too large, and they are in general too vague to draw much from.building on a previous picture, it would be nice if the icons depended on the hull size (as they pretty much do currently) but with the added bonus of looking fairly distinctive for each hull size. my mockup isn't that great, but it should be reasonable to illustrate how distinctive each icon on the overview for player ships should be."
6/2/2013,"ccp arrow, please look at this thing : supreme commander strategic iconsthis is a list of strategic icons in the rts supreme commander.this is how it looks like ingame : zoomed out viewas you can see, this is very easy to read. any semi-competent player will notice where the blue defensive line is, what the attacking forces' units are.just imagine, goonswarm's tengus (trapezoids) supported by huginns (diamonds), scimitars (squares) and some interceptors (acute isoceles triangles, because they're fast).now that's easy to read. you can see what their interceptors are going, how the logistics are placed and all that stuff.you can even use supreme commanders' system for tech 1/2 differentiation. add small white tabs under the strategic icons. 0 for tech i, 2 for tech ii, 3 for tech iii.done."
6/2/2013,"why should concord care?as long as ""the rules"" are followed, what reasons capsuleers have for hating one another is none of their concern.then it would be just like the old . get alt to accept a contract and have the alt kill you (and remember that contracts are ""one-off"" things... they have no ""reoccurring"" function). collect bounty and laugh at the person who placed a bounty on you.pro-tip: don't think too hard about it (we certainly don't). most of us put more effort into ""how"" we do things rather than ""why"" (as i've said in previous posts... it's a mentality thing... you either have the urge for destruction or you don't... why you destroy is a drunken rationalization or afterthought at best... ""we don't know him, but i'm pretty sure if we dig through his history we'll find some reason why he had to be blown up!!""). why not? like i said in my last post... what reasons you or i perceive as stupid may not be for another person. you simply don't know (because you are not that person and your values are different from him/her). this very disagreement that we are having is literally proof of that.your opinion that ""because i can bounties"" are not valid is merely that... your opinion. i am perfectly fine if people want bounty everyone for no reason. some people just want to see the world burn.as for ""earning"" infamy... again... there is no way you control that because it's relative/subjective to the person. why people hate a certain person may or may not be different from why other people hate another person.movies have been based on this. hilarious stuff happens. maybe you are bored and just want people to attack you? maybe you hate yourself? who knows?"
6/2/2013,"common courtesy? i think the current system, even if it requires a few tweaks, is fine. the tweaks are around the payout percentage and a few other small changes. i can see the attraction somewhat of contract killing, but the question related to concords interaction with an active contract. yea i do know what i think on this, what are your thoughts?so fine with them, but not to be in the same system as ones you deem appropriate? yea we understand that and we completely disagree with this bad premiss.please refer to posts #17, #26, #37, #39, #46, #48.it's by design and remains how it was before the change. if someone wants to waste that much isk on themselves, so be it. it all adds to the game and promotes more player interaction. why is that not a good thing?destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
6/2/2013,"how about (read it to the end first) removing local and replacing it by constellation chat? you still have your intel and that somebody is in your constellation, but you won't see how many and who is in your current system.so your intel channel become more valuable too, because you can keep an eye at gates and report the guy/fleet.this!"
6/2/2013,"i have seen this suggested many times. it is a somewhat elegant and easy solution to introduce.my only concerns are that i do feel we have a balance atm. even if this balance is made through two imperfect mechanics off setting each other, but balanced it is. would the change from local to constellation, tip the balance in favour of those cloaked? if this is so, then would we see an introduction of a cloak hunting system? then placing the balance firmly in the other direction?i know i may be over analysing it, but i do see a snowball effect in the offing.still, it is a nice simply change that could be made.destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
6/2/2013,another aspect: blackops and covert cynos would become much more fun and become a lot more attractive. you wouldn't know in which system they jumped into (unless you tracked the covert ship through all gates and pinned it down to a specific system) and whom they will attack. but it might be too op as well. i don't know. certainly much more interesting. and it would put the null back into the nullsec.
6/2/2013,"i think the difference is that local is a two way street. you see me, i see you. if we are both paying attention then any risk is equal.cloaky: what chance/module/skill does the target (say a miner) have to defend himself aside from scooting to a pos or station? what risk does the afk cloaker take in a safe spot as he leaves for work for the day?mmike azariah ----<U+FEFF> <U+FFFD>|(<U+30C4>)/<U+FFFD>"
6/2/2013,"ok so i consider eve online and what ccp is doing is a wonderful and great thing. the idea of freedom and freemarket in the game is amazing. there is one thing that bothers me though. as we all know the world economy is not in the greatest of shape and the worlds monies are a bit shakey. euro is bound to crash following the dollar. so my question is if the currency on which ccp uses for subscriptions happens to fail what, what is ccp's ?"

6/3/2013,"ok, then we don't care to waste time making the same explainations all over again because you think you're a special snowflake.if you want us to put any time into considering your ideas, then you should at minimum put similar effort into making sure that they haven't already been looked at, and into addressing objections raised at that time. if you can't be bothered to do that, why should we be bothered to spend any time on self-serving skillpoint reset proposal #218?(answer: we won't)"
6/3/2013,"the target has the built in mechanics of cloaked players not physically being able to do anything to them while cloaked on their side. they also have the fact that cloaky ships generally have weak tanks and or meager dps.there may not be much (or any) risk for someone sitting afk cloaked - but there's no risk for someone sitting in a pos or outpost either. and like someone afking in a pos/outpost, there's no reward."
6/3/2013,"afk is fine, cloaking is fine, but don't make them invulnerable. give me some way to find and kill them at some point. lets make eve a bit more real. you could hide in my home. i may notice you broke in or hear you moving about. chances are very high that eventually i will find you. you will have time to do dirty deeds until then, but when found, i could turn the tables.special probles, or ship fittings, or even a time activated system wide scanner (anchorable). i'll let someone smarter than me figure that out.at its current state, we need more risk for the system cloaker."
6/3/2013,"this isn't aimed at the op as that focused on actual inactivity from the player bringing up a prompt of if you are afk (which i guess is a reasonable thing). i'm asking this more toward the general dislike of and demand for ways to counter cloaking (i didn't want to start another afk cloak thread either, people would hate me).how do you know they are a cloaked afk player? is it that they don't reply in local or remain in system for hours and you can't scan them down?because i fit into that catergory as an explorer. i fly a cloakable ship, turn local blink off as i'm exploring solo, and spent most of my time using the scanning system. but i can't fit a cyno and my usual explorer fit has little to no offensive and defencive capabilities. i don't like the idea that while i'm focus on scanning down a site and sitting in a safe spot cloaked that someone can still find me and kill me went i've taken the steps to not being found.also, though i'm not sure it will still work after odyssey, can't a covert-ops frigate still avoid you uncloaked at a safe-spot using the eccm method to counter probes?"
6/3/2013,"let's make the comparison a bit more real: instead of somebody in your home, you just have surveillance equipment in your home, watching your every move. i sincerely doubt you will ever notice that it is there. and you won't find everything. in nullsec at least you know somebody is there and watching you. ;)"
6/3/2013,"you make a good point. in order to watch every move you would need a lot of camaras, and a respectable amount of time to install them. as a person very familiar with this type of activity, its not easily done in great numbers undetected. therefore, setting up many cameras in someone elses home for evil intentions is rare, and not everyone can do it. in eve no skill is required to cloak up and hide. even camaras can be found in time, in eve a cloaky cant. there needs to be a chance to counter it, even if its slight. let people cloak and camp, its all good, but don't make it risk free."
6/3/2013,why
6/3/2013,"i'm going to try and be polite, because i simply cant control how hard i lol'd at your post. you clearly didn't do any research on me.. i mine a lot. way more then you for sure. i mine in all areas of space.unlike you i am not afraid of gankers and the like. they are a part of eve, if you don't like it get out of my belts.in no way does this help one side or the other. this is strictly about emerging game play and a more realistic universe. you make yourself sound like a winy child.mining is 100% still a worthy profession, you just cant be a wimp."
6/3/2013,the dong.
6/3/2013,"missioning is probably one of the most done activities in eve (afk mining doesn't count as an activity) that a very large number of people do. while i realize that most people on the csm have a primary focus on pvp, null space issues, and things like interface, since a ton of people do missions, and in an ideal world, some missions could be a bridge to pvp in learning of fitting and tactics and such, i would like the csm to ask the devs to start a levelacide plan.what is levelacide?basically going through missions one agent level at a time (maybe agents and how they offer missions can be improved as well), figure out what is good, what needs worked on, and if there are some new missions that can be added or some older missions that just need to be deleted. maybe some small gang and fleet centered missions (with lower requirements than incursions or pvp) could be added. if you don't have a fleet, one could be given to you (think solo queue, but with eve players).now, why an eve solo queue? mark rosewater correctly points out that in gaming, people generally do what they are rewarded for doing, even if they don't like it. pve eve generally rewards players for solo activities. the last mission in the soe arc is probably the only pve battle a player might ask for help with... if he doesn't have a good ship. if he does by then, he can solo it. now one can point to incursions, but that's a ranked solo queue and there is a bit of a bar you have to be able to jump over. think of incursions as bronze or silver teamqueue.so we need a step before that.basically, we need to turn missions into unranked normals and solo queue.for lifetime soloers, step one is just getting people working with others from time to time. null alliances and even rvb need fresh blood. well there's a lot of fresh blood that's busy missioning for isk/hour. i'd like to think that some of them could be turned into pvpers and nullies. but the first thing that has to be done is get them to thinking that playing the game with others is both fun and rewarding.levelacide would be a great opportunity to add a venture frigate into group activities."
6/3/2013,"by isd, i assume you mean csm? if so, i konw that ripard teg and malcanis are both chomping at the bit to overhaul mission pve, particularly in ways that make it into a sort of training ground for pvp fitting and flying. they would be good people to contact.i believe it was ripard who suggested far fewer npcs, in exchange for their being tougher and having bigger bounties. one obvious change would be to have npcs warp off if their in trouble, so that pve ships have to fit scrams (and long range pve ships have to bring a tackler). are these the sort of changes you're thinking of?do you have examples of missions you'd consider good, and missions you think need a serious going-over?"
6/3/2013,"no, asking for a reexamination of missions mechanics is not asking too much.just don't expect the world to change over night.m"
6/3/2013,"well damn, and i had such high hopes for tomorrow morning."
6/3/2013,"around our milky way, and most galaxies, there are these groups of stars called ""globular clusters"". very dense groups of stars that orbit a galaxy at the center. i say, make some orbit new eden.now an actual globular cluster might not do much for the game, as they don't contain many planets and are made up of hydrogen and helium almost exclusively, but that can be worked around. since we don't know where new eden is in the universe, we can bend the rules and make it so that globulars would contain planets and heavy elements, as how they would work in new edens time (as what happens in new eden isn't happening at the same time in the milky way), and maybe the age/structure/compositions of orbiting clusters is different in this part and time of the universe. why change our understanding of space to fit the game better?here's why:-drive events in the back story; a cluster was found above say amarr and minmatar space that is very profitable... they could then go at it, pushing developments and conflicts among the empires-massive land (or space) grabs: a cluster or two are above 0.0 space, full of planets and resources, all ripe for the taking... and fighting over. the battles of these clusters would push the 0.0 player corps to wars on a massive scale. dust mercs would be called in to take over the new districts on the planets and defend them. for dust, new maps of districts under construction could be made, adding more gameplay styles.-new stuff: maybe a new materiel, new substances, not found in the galaxy is abundant in the globular cluster, making a reason to go there and be profitable. maybe ice is abundant, and would lead to huge ice mining ops. all this would be high risk and high reward.-new faction: perhaps there were people colonizing the globular when the eve gate collapsed, and they have been stuck, cut off even more than everyone else was, and could be using different kinds of weapons than the rest (their railguns would look very different)-new structure: you'd have to get to the cluster by some form of giant star gate, which would have to be built, and they would be one way in, one way out.exploration: if odyssey is all about exploration, why not create brand new space to explore, like with wormholes? freshen the game up a bit, maybe bring some old vets back to wage war in new space, create new industry, new skills and items, and even ships to investigate the new star systems.i think have new territory to conquer and push the back story would do the game a lot of good. i tried to explain it the best i could, thanks for reading"
6/3/2013,"lets not make this a long post,electronic attack frigates are in need of a little love. if they were able to use the covert ops cloak they would be a handy edition to the black-ops gangs which presently have to factor in large sums of fuel for recons. it should be bombers and eaf, maybe even hand them the new logistics bonuses from t1 frigs so they can be a multi-suporting role within the covert-ops/black-ops gangs.good idea or no?chun tzu"
6/3/2013,no.-sun tzu
6/3/2013,"i don't think we need another cloaking ship.but i'd support a change to the resists to bring them to the combat recon level of resists. a better tank would merit the drop in speed you get when you go from the disruption frigate to the eaf and follow a pattern similar to combat frigates with their t2 counterparts.also, this thread should probably be in the features and ideas discussion forum where other paritally-formed ideas go instead of polluting the assembly hall."

6/4/2013,"op... don't take mag personally. he's a logic-fu master second only to tippa. what you ""feel"" about a subject or game mechanic is more or less irrelevant to him if you can't back it up with good reasoning. and if you argue with him in the realm of design intent in eve he will dig up various dev blogs and posts supporting his stance."
6/4/2013,"i dunno, why is there any risk in 0.0? nullsec is all about risk vs reward. why should it be risky to mine there? why should it be risky to gate camp there? why should it be risky to rat there? why own 0.0 space? why doesn't everyone go there? why make it so you can get huge rewards with no risk? risk has a role in most parts of the game, which for many makes it exciting. if you or your alliance earned the station in the system for safety that's one thing, someone at some point risked something to get it, but getting free intel for no real risk or effort by cloak/camping should be changed.a mining bot has a risk of being ganked in high-sec while hes afk. shouldn't a system camper in null?"
6/4/2013,"edit: woops wrong thread, correct reply to follow...there is risk in cloaking. you must travel into enemy space. cloaky ships are fragile and lack firepower. you are not capable of doing much by yourself other than gathering intel.additionally, there is zero effort or risk in using local as an intel tool, there is zero risk sitting in a pos or outpost.why do you demand such one sided increases in risk, which are disproportionate to the 'reward'"
6/4/2013,"i don't see how most players in nullsec are good with a ship that cant be found or killed yet can do so much damage. almost everyone travels into enemy space at some point, so that's not unusual risk for 0.0 . it doesn't make it better if you can be one shotted by a miners drones if you cant be locked or found. all im saying in adding risk is make them findable at least over time."
6/4/2013,"but aren't the cloaky ships bringing (at least part of) the risk to nullsec too? if you make it smaller, that would make the risks smaller too.so by your logic, reducing the cloaky abilities/capabilities/possibilities should reduce (all!) the rewards in nullsec too in order to keep the balance :) i like that!at least that would be the next logical step."
6/4/2013,"two weeks of no activity and it only reached the second page, this section either has a low turn out or the first page threads are hot topics"
6/4/2013,"dearest ccp!maybe it's time to overhaul you skillpoint system.1 it would be better if you make a sp generation mechanism ,after this skill points are spended via attributes that character have in his brain via coefficents.you can get rid off skill que(it was a great solution ,but today we should have some evolution changes)2 nd it would be awesome if you can buy book remotly. it""s future why we can't buy via inter... golo... dunno net a books or courses.it makes no sense pros no way of forgetting to switch skill learning your char becomes smth like wine .more age more tasty. you shouldn't get to high sec to buy books cons safer for users so no suicide ganks after books (bad for piracy ) no more missed learning hours (bad for ccp)"
6/4/2013,lol
6/4/2013,"destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
6/4/2013,"1.) if you can ""store"" sp, it allows you to put off ""what to train"" decisions until you develop a need for that skill. this has a very negative impact by allowing people to store sp until the new fotm comes out, and insta-training into it. also, if the sp gained is static, but is only ""modified"" when being applied to a skill based on the current attributes you have, you essentially eliminate the need for having attribute implants during 99% of your play time... example: i decide it's time to train command ships 5, so i clone hop to my +5 implanted clone and then apply the sp, and then clone hop away to do pvp the rest of the month. 2.) access to skillbooks is an important consideration for living ""away"" from empire (nullsec, wh space), and having to make a trip to highsec to access these skillbooks adds risk to players that need them transported. furthermore, there is a portion of the market that thrives by making skillbooks accessible at market hubs, and your change would undermine this viable market community."
6/4/2013,isn't this just dust's skill mechanic pasted into eve?
6/4/2013,"absolutely right dersen, didn't know where my mind was. i wouldn't mind fewer but better enemies at least some of the time, at least for solo stuff. and maybe for a few missions it might be cool if they give you a system, but force you scan down the target in addition to some other pvp like activities. those are some of the changes i have in mind.also the fewer enemies don't just have to have bigger bounties, if there's only two or three per mission, maybe they could have more drops per ship like in pvp where a good chunk of the mods give or take survive.that said, i think there needs to be a wider varity of missions. a few horde mode security missions like we have now aren't that bad as long as we have other options... attack the pirate mining fleet. maybe an easy defend mission of some sorts. guard the asteroid belt for 10 minutes or something. join a friendly npc fleet going after a small dreadnaught. maybe some regions could have pirate hot spots (like incursions but not to that level) where you'll get missions related to those pirates.also a few missions with alternative win or bonus money conditions wouldn't be bad.as for which ones need to be kept or which ones need a going over, that's a good question.thanks for the reply mike, i won't get my hopes too high as i know these things can take time."
6/4/2013,"linna, your ideas sent me off looking for more information"
6/4/2013,i spend a lot of my time mining and i have seen thinks change over the years but one thing has remained the same. the t2 survey scanner has a max range of 22.50 km and there is no way to change that with a full orca bonuse with max skills and implant the strip miners can be pushed out to 25.9 respectavley but there is no bonuse to the scanner. and if a noob joins the fleet his t1 stipes get pumped out to 25.9 just like all the rest but he only has a 15km range on his t1 scanner. why not have the range boost also apply to the scanner?or give us faction scanners with a 30k range but don't screw us on a low drop rate like you have with all the other mining equipment
6/4/2013,"in response to my post in another thread, this is more what i would have liked archaeology to be like...you discover something and scan itwhich leads to...using science and industry skills to study it and narrow down other linked sitesso you...fly there and discover more clueswhich then goes to...more exploration of new eden's history, landmarks and scenic vistasand so on and so on, until...the resulting data and notes from your search are turned over to interested agents, corps or factions, thus leading to rewards, unique items, lp, standing, knowledge or a feeling of accomplishment (whatever seems fitting)added future features...incarna lab to study discoveriesand...cartography room to view results and plan your next move.(thanks to ccp, bioware, square-enix and relic for some of the art)(not suggesting you change the existing idea or implement this, just saying, in an ideal world, this is what i would have liked eve achaeology to be like. though others have expressed a liking for the idea)archaeology - planetary interactionconcept imageokay, an idea for pi to link into my archaeology feature. unlike the current pi, which i think of as industrial, this is for more science based structures. so you start with an 'expedition command centre' (or ecc) this serves the same purpose as the current command centre, providing power, cpu, limited storage and a basic launch capability, but players will be unable to place both types of commands on the same planet. the ecc also counts toward your 'interplanetary consolidation' skill limit. this forces the player to choose between the (somewhat) certain income of industrial pi or the riskier but more rewarding exploration and science approach.from the ecc you can deploy a 'survey drone' over an adjustable area of the planet. it's purpose is to fly over the area and search for anomalies and potential excavation sites. the actual working is similar to the current pi mining survey, you plan/set the length of time the drone will be gone, the longer the survey the wider the area covered, you then place a pin at the central point of the area you wish to search. any discoveries will be highlighted in the planet view and notifications will be sent to the discovery codex (whether this happens during or only at the end of a survey is up for debate). varying skills, time of year, sovereignty, recent system activities, current lore, planets and their location within new eden affect the probability of a discovery.once you have discovered something you send out the 'excavation crawler', a land vehicle with a small team to pinpoint, uncover and if possible return any relics, data or clues to the ecc. crawlers work similar to drones but with a smaller area of activity and a fixed time to complete their job, which is decided by the type of anomaly or discovery.with both the drone and crawler, overlapping areas of activity diminish productivity (again similar to current pi mining)additional buildingsradio telescope <U+FFFD> able to detect potential sites of interest in space and provide a rough location to the capsuleer. increased numbers, upgrades and skills narrow the results from whole regions to a few solar systems, the player then needs to fly there and probe down what the telescope detected.cartography facility <U+FFFD> refines the possible location results from analysing relics and data. only works for certain types of discoveries, does little on it's own but building one provides a boost to the players analysis report accuracy.r&d facility <U+FFFD> reduces the time needed to study relics and physical discoveries. upgrading the facility increases the bonus.data processing facility <U+FFFD> similar to the r&d facility but works to reduce the time needed to study data and sensor readings.data bandwidth <U+FFFD> unlike current pi that uses transport links to move goods, the exploration pi uses data links that carry a limited bandwidth, players are able to upgrade this to match the increased data being send to and from facilities.finally, it should go without saying that the lower the 'sec' of a system the higher the chance of discovery, but it can also affect the type of discovery. empire system are move likely to provide relics and projects relating to those empires, null and low sec have higher chances of pirate and discoveries based on eve's wider lore and story. wormholes and new systems reachable by player built stargates would have higher chances of truly unknown and mysterious encounter (though wormholes do have a higher sleeper/talocan discovery chance).cartography 2nd concept as first is unclear"
6/4/2013,"it would be great if this could be done, to at least make the killmails accurate. it should be done even when they are moved on grid anyway. this wouldn't cause a performance issue would it? make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve"
6/4/2013,"jovian's cant do anything because they are all extinct. they ahd finally found a cure when lab-assistant tuxford pressed the big red button by mistake, dooming them all to oblivion."
6/4/2013,this thread again
6/4/2013,"some of those features, while probably being fun, would be horrible and game-breaking, especially for newer players. i've always thought the idea of a jovian encounter would be cool. but ""invasion"" would hardly be the term, especially if you're looking to work the lore into it. seeing as how the jove are a dying and broken race, the only way you could spin an encounter would be to either have the jove break into our space in search of a cure. or you could have the jove, realizing that their days are numbered, open up their space to us to allow their technology to be claimed before they're completely wiped out.to the people claiming that the jove ships are vastly superior to ours, yeah i suppose thats true in lore....but then again look at the gnosis, hardly a death machine i'd say haha.all in all, it would be cool to have some sort of encounter with the jove, but i doubt we'll see it any time soon, and if we do, i'm almost positive its never going to be an invasion of sansha proportions."
6/4/2013,i approve this idea with all my heart and will try my best to push it to ccp. burn the land and boil the sea you can't take the sky from me
6/4/2013,"""if you could fly the ship before, you can after""... yeah right.what the hell is adding advanced spaceship command v to freighters and jump freighters about? the flying boxes that go really slow and get routinely ganked by ships taking a fraction of the resources to make must be made more unbalanced by a pointless skill?change it back. or make it iv, at least. or here's a thought. have the skill *do* something so people *want* to train it. what are the bonuses on my providence for advanced spaceship command? oh that's right ... nothing. the fact no-one trains a skill is not a reason to change per-requisites to v, up from i, betraying a design philosophy in the process. that's rubbish. either make the skill worth having, or get rid of it entirely.what would i do? providence requirement 1, ""advanced spaceship command bonus: 5% bonus to align time and 2.5% increase in shields, armour, and hull resists and hit points per level.""ark as above, but 2.5% reduction in jump fuel costs. you just made ice cost more, throw us a bone here.and what is up with the command ship skill prerequisites? to fly a vulture (a shield command ship) you need armored warfare v, information warfare v, skirmish warfare v as well as the one that actually matters? huh?come on guys ... don't put freighters ""right up there with carriers"". when people fly carriers, they make more isk in nullsec for far less risk than they do in high hauling rubbish in a freighters. live up to your design promises, or stop making them."
6/4/2013,is this directed to ccp or csm?burn the land and boil the sea you can't take the sky from me
6/4/2013,well said
6/4/2013,"so.. i was looking at this wh that led into 4dh-st and tried to figure out what evil i could use it for, a pretty cool idea struck me.the ability to make wormholes stable, imagine the possibilities, alliances that have never before been able to interact with eacother due to the distance can suddenly become mortal enemies (or important allies).so this is how i believe it could work:you find a wormhole in a 0.0 system that leads to another 0.0 system, then you place a structure at both sides of the wormhole - ""wormhole stabilizer"" and the wormhole becomes permanent (while the structures are up, mass limits for the wh etc should still apply). this could be a great strategic advantage for any alliance, and can also be used to initiate an invasion in a region if the wormhole appears in a system no one really visits. finding and destroying enemy wormhole routes could be very important, and also protecting them i believe would be a very high priority as they can shorten extremely long distances. to balance the wh stabilizers i think the reinforcement timers should only be a couple of hours, so you really need to stay on top of things to protect your critical routes.note: it should only be possible to place these stabilizer at wormholes leading from one 0.0 system to another."
6/4/2013,only if it can stabilize k-space connections. wspace crowd does not want wh stabilizers. burn the land and boil the sea you can't take the sky from me
6/4/2013,"yes, i wrote that as a note in the end :)"
6/4/2013,"so basicly you want better jump bridges out of alliance? should it realy create a passage though a wormhole system or just a wh that connects 0.0 directly with 0.0?the wormhole stabilisers should only be placeable by local sovereignity holders, so both involved alliances have to agree on placing them. otherwise you do not even have to get a cyno for a titan bridge, but have a permanent bridge to your enemy. eve is too fast already, cause you can cross the universe very fast. for me, titan, and other, bridges should only be possible from one titan to an other, so you have to put a little effort and risk in moving your troops fast."
6/4/2013,"you should not be able to place stabilizers through a wormhole system, that would be too gamechanging for the people that enjoy their life in the whs, so only directly from 0.0 to 0.0 . (not 0.0 to low-sec/high-sec either)and the whole point of this is to make it a bit more interesting with alliances that are very far from each other, this could create a completely new playing field and interesting developments. no the sov holders should not agree, the whole point of this is to make it a bit more volatile and spicy :) but having the wh stabilizers relatively weak is a form of balancing so you will have to make sure to defend them.also, super-caps cannot enter wormholes, this should not change.. a titan should never be able to enter a wormhole even if its stable or not."

6/4/2013,
6/5/2013,though i'd still like to have that bra-free look back:
6/5/2013,"so...let me get this straight:not only do we have to go to the hassle of setting up dual character training one month at a time, but it costs more to train an alt than it does a main?on a month-by-month basis, it's the same price, granted. but normally you can buy chunks of time in advance which greatly reduces the cost. but with dct, you have to pay $20/month.why is running an alt -- a secondary character, someone i'll spend less time playing -- more expensive than running a primary?"
6/5/2013,a plex is a plex. it costs the same no matter which character you use it on.
6/5/2013,i think it should enable you to login with 2 characters from the same account as well.. or theres not really much point :s
6/5/2013,"you don't have to use it. you can just use a second account if you want an alt you want to keep on training.if you want an alt that you dont need to keep on training then it's cheaper to have it on one of the 3 character slots that every account has already.this change is about adding value to those existing character slots, not replacing the utility of multiple accounts."
6/5/2013,"this. does it have a limited and niche appeal? yes. are you forced to use it? no. could it be cheaper to get a second account? yes, at around 3 months per char. should it be cheaper than standard pricing to use? hell no. the choice is simple, either use it or don't.destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
6/5/2013,"it is what it is, invulnerability to gain rewards. afking for rewards and effect is frowned upon in every other aspect of the game. twist it, mold it, and paint it however you want, it seems simple to me. let them be found if they stay too long. add another item to the game to do it, helps the eve economy and adds a cool new aspect of pvp to the game."
6/5/2013,"ok i have several issues with this, firstly: there is no reward. they gain absolutely nothing. they cannot prevent other players doing something, they don't gain any isk or assets, the reward is zero. if you decide to interfere with yourself then that is on you. if you consider that a ""reward"" to the cloaker/afker then... don't give them that reward. simple.secondly, i don't even see the point of the use of the term ""afk"" in these topics. to highlight what i mean, let me present two situations.the classic ""afk cloaker"": sits in a safespot, cloaked, ship is completely stationaryplayer goes to walk the dog, have dinner, work, whateverthe active cloaker:sits in a safespot, cloaked, ship is completely stationaryplayer sits at the computer the entire time, chatting in corp, etc chat channels.to everyone in the system, these two players are exactly the same. they're not scanning or hunting, they're not even moving, they can't be found, etc. the fact people keep harping on about ""afk"" would suggest that they do no wish to impede or punish the second - very much active - type of player. except every single suggestion ever proposed would punish the second type of player, despite the fact that he's active (just not visibly so to the carebears).this suggests to me that people are not in fact attempting to deal with an issue regarding ""afk"" players, because they always suggest things that would hurt the second type of player tooso can we stop with the dishonesty? this isn't about afk players, this is about active players that you want defending from"
6/5/2013,"most of the suggestions favorable to this idea of increasing cloaker risk simply push likely combat areas away from gates and stations (if you assume that unknown situation = pilot avoidance) by making these choke points a weaker choice for campers, cloaked or not.even with the ""constellation-only local"" you're going to have the same issues as you do now - you don't know whats behind that gate or outside the station. the only way to save yourself is with logic, experience and a decent fitting. if this is what you hope to avoid then the issue for you is gameplay itself.this all just boils down to someone being upset that they aren't good enough to avoid easy camping tactics which just equals poor ability. why should eve reward people for being horrible at it?"
6/5/2013,what resources do you propose for the rings?will they be like ice belts and mined out in a given period?mmike azariah ----<U+FEFF> <U+FFFD>|(<U+30C4>)/<U+FFFD>
6/5/2013,"as sentinel zx pointed out to me (here), ccp fozzie said yesterday that ring mining isn't something being worked on anytime soon (if ever).that said. i'd imagine completely new resources for the rings that tie into a new industry (ideally stargate construction), i'm sure existing minerals and ore are there but the ring harvester is looking for only certain types of resources, something that exists in planetary rings only, plus asteroids provide richer yields of those already available ores.scientifically speaking they should contain moon minerals spread across the ring as a fine dust or micro asteroids. but i wouldn't want ring mining to tread on any ones toes so a new resource works better.ideally it would be something like the actinides and other radioactive elements and you'd harvest the decay products (eg. thorium is collected to create radon gas which is then used in some way to aid the long-range jumping effects of stargates, perhaps as a radioactive tracer between the two gates that maintains the connection).there wouldn't be a limitless supply of the resources in rings, but i would see them more like belts, a fixed amount that is respawned after downtime (do belts still work that way?). it certainly wouldn't be like the old ice mining, more like the newer version, yes, but it would take a well run mining operation to deplete a ring within a day.i also imagine that mining the rings in high sec would require something like the 'starbase charters' so that you need permission from the empires to do it, low and null sec (and wormholes) would be free to mine and have greater quantities of resources."
6/5/2013,"if you had attended fanfest and went to the ccp panel on their company growth and outlook for the future, you would already know the answer. but since you didn't some nice soul put it up on youtube right here."
6/5/2013,i would rather use the crappy system the japanese players are forced to use.
6/5/2013,"laughing at this peer pressure pyramid scam, seen a few people fall into it and doesn't look too good .)"
6/5/2013,"not being able to dock would be the best way to balanced.hell, let it even build capitals (not super caps). transporting the mats for it to build those massive of ships would actually be a rather fun logistical challenge, if they are not all from mined material. if you parked it right outside a station, so freighters could undock and dump mats in it would leave it quite vulnerable to attack. much tears, best tears.if you want to further enhance mining game play, give it a doomsday for a comet. basically, you can have comets be like ore sites, where you have to warp in a super industrial to hit it with a drill-ray to brake it into pieces, then others can mine the pieces.of course, like a titan, it should have to sit there for 5-10 mins while using the mega drill-ray. maybe you can even use the hacking mini game to ""cut it into pieces"". mehit wouldn't overhaul the boring mining problem, but it would go a long way to help it."
6/5/2013,"wowi love the idea of a trail of clues but this would be almost an epic arc that demands skills be trained as opposed to an ongoing repeatable process, wouldn't it?m"
6/5/2013,"yeah, i envisioned it as something that requires a little of everything to complete, some projects can be completed within a day and some of the more epic tales and mysteries could be months and years but with the rewards scaling to match (i also like the idea of small groups or solo players needing to drum up support and funding to pursue leads like a desperate scientist pleading that the next stage of his research will yield massive rewards for investors). a solo player could do it but there are lots of skills (new and old) so it doesn't fit a tightly focused character build or specialised alts but is easier for corps and groups to complete with diverse skill sets.i have been meaning to do a mock-up of the discovery codex, which would keep track of projects and also work as an ingame lore encyclopedia, there is a section that shows the branches of a project that would look like the dust skill tree or the ship progress ui shown at this years fanfest.you can follow clues down one path and if you hit a dead-end or something requiring skills that you don't have you can double back down the project tree and follow other clues and different leads. in a corp or group these branching leads can be explored simultaneously and discoveries pooled to refine results and data.really it shouldn't be called archaeology but more investigations but i wanted it to focus on discovering the history of new eden and bring the lore into the game."
6/5/2013,removing the command processor module would reduce the effectiveness of ogb alts
6/5/2013,"well this one is super simple. in the corp information tab there is a piece of information which relates to the corp member size. i think that this piece of information should be expanded in order to include the total amount of members, the amount of eve players, and the amount of dust mercs. this would allow the populations of both games to see if the player corporation is mainly an eve based corporation, a dust based corporation, or if they have a mix of both. -venix"

6/6/2013,"considering some of us have been playing for a long, long time with the ability to only train one character, adding an option that requires a plex to use at least placates my bittervet rage at ccp making the game ""easier"" by allowing people to ""have more dudes quickly.""be thankful they even put the feature in."
6/6/2013,"well said gunslinger. these threads always seem to be thinly veiled attempts at nerfing all cloakers, using the 'afk people are bad m'kay' excuse.for all the talk of generating 'risk', it all boils down to making nulsec even safer so the zerobears can rat/mine/whatever under the complete safety of local's all seeing eye.jint hikaru - miner / salvager / explorer / spacebum in the beginning the universe was created. this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move."
6/6/2013,would the scoot loot be grabbable by anyone? in otherwords would live players gather around bots hoping for the windfalls?m
6/6/2013,if the us dollar and euro collapse more or less at the same time then we have bigger problems than how to pay for a game.
6/6/2013,"canned food and shotguns, where the smart money is."
6/6/2013,"don't forget ammo, ammo is the new currency."
6/6/2013,"so, yesterday i was doing my thing on the forums, and spotted this post.tldr, some mercs from dust were trying to get in contact with eve players who might be interested in their services. however, they apparently had to create an account on eve (trial, from the looks of it), and then post on the newbie section in the hopes that someone would notice the post.is it just me, or does this seem pretty stupid? specifically, the fact that this is supposed to be the eve universe, containing both dust and eve, with integrated chat channels in-game... yet we can't directly post on each others forums?the solution i'm advocating is simple. create a section on the dust forums where we can post, and vice versa. a liason section, if you will. enhanced communication between the two games means more cooperation, which means the links that bind us get used more often. especially going forward, when the cooperation (or lack of it) between the two games might build or destroy empires.this is low-hanging fruit that should be relatively simple to do, i would think, and could have a decent payoff."
6/6/2013,"they're already in our communication channels in-game, this seems like a pretty obvious change to make."
6/6/2013,this seems like a low-cost no-brainer idea to increase involvement between the 2 games.
6/6/2013,good idea. +1
6/6/2013,i've passed this suggestion on to the cpm.
6/6/2013,"also supporting this, greater co-operation between dust & eve players at some basic level is a must i think as dust players get more organised - as they have proven they can do anyway - and look to impact eve."
6/6/2013,as long as it's a section and not a full forum merge +1.
6/6/2013,"confirmed.just as a starship pilot probably doesn't have much interest in giving feedback on ""domination mode"" in dust, i doubt the groundpounders would have much interest in ""missions & complexes"" in eve. unless they played both games, of course, but then the issue's moot."
6/6/2013,endorsed.
6/6/2013,ok warp effect nice but i realy mis the simple loading system done. or undocking station done. thouse whear best part of long trips. now is am i undocking? do i have to wait for anmation to jump sigh. so hear it is petion to all feal the same way please sine to bring back loading bar or a less glamer quick loading thank for support.
6/6/2013,"i rather like the new system. with two exceptions:it would be nice if the undocking animation was a little more obvious. there are red lights flashing, but they're hardly noticable unless you're looking for them, and i don't want to put that much effort into determine whether i'm undocking or not. i wish the game wouldn't take control of my camera when i arrive in a new system. there's not really a reason for it to point anywhere. i understand why it does when you begin the jump, but the ending doesn't make sense."
6/6/2013,"i have been playing eve for a few years now, and i had come to enjoy eve, but lately i have come to have some issues with the updates.1. the amount of updates and patches that are done. i knew eve as one of the few games that did these things twice a year, but now it seems every 2-3 months there is something new i am having to wait to get patched. i understand emergencies, those you can't help at all, or if there is a major glitch, but there is so much more going on lately.2. i don't play for the graphics, but almost every update for about 2 years now has had more graphic changes than substance changes. for example: the new graphics when you jump through a system gate. it lags down my computer greatly and that is on low graphics. it's painful to deal with. or the scan sites, i don't scan i don't care to see more things popping up on the screen and from the people i have spoken to who do scan, they like to do scanning to find, they don't want half the work done for them.3. this is a game that you can't really multitask in, you have to pick a path to go down with everything. i personally was working on the drake to have heavy missiles and all of that, but then less than a year ago everything changed on the drake and heavy missiles, leaving me with 2.5 years of training that i couldn't use and i was back to using frigates, and i still haven't recovered. then as i look through what ships i can use i come to only two options, heavy assaults or cruise missiles on any of the ships. 4. there is so much that needs to be fixed in the substance field, like everything to do with corporations and alliances is a mess under the corporation tab, and the issues with poses is a nightmare, things have gotten better with dust, but it's still not great. but instead of seeing improvements on the substance we see more shiny objects and flashing lights that do nothing but hurt my computer and it's ability to run the game.what happened to the versatility of this game? what happened to the understanding? what happened to the substance?i used to love this game, but now at this point i feel like i am being cheated out of my money for the service i am paying for."
6/6/2013,so you are complaining that the game changes and grows? that its graphics improve with age and animations are added.what are you askin for? that ccp stop changing the game or that they roll back to the good old days?m
6/6/2013,"please re-read. i think you missed what i was pointing out, i clearly posted somethings i would like to see change, and the things i am unhappy with."
6/6/2013,"i don't personally see a list of complaints that the game is growing, but, i do see complaints regarding a constant barrage of unnecessary changes in light of many very needed ones.an example: player owned stations (pos) - these really need a lot of granulation worked into them.and, yes - it would be nice if we could focus on the multitude of issues, and ignore the graphics ""advances"" for a little while. while some of them are neat-looking -- i would much prefer the ability to turn each and every one of them off."

6/7/2013,"thank you, chitsa jason for your help."
6/7/2013,"if you're paying through plex, yes. if you're paying through account management, a year's worth of dct is considerably more expensive than a primary character.no, i don't have to use it. but i'd like to. and whether or not i use it has no bearing on whether or not i can critique the implementation of it. i'm glad they've added utility to the three character slots, but that doesn't change the fact that it's not what it could be -- for players and for ccp.i've never understood the argument of ""it's something, so don't complain"". if you get paid below minimum wage, are you happy with the situation?see above. being forced or not doesn't enter the equation.i'm not arguing for it to be cheaper than standard pricing. i'm saying it's less than a primary character for well over the cost of a primary character. why is buying a second account both better and cheaper than dct?see above. this is never a valid response. i'm not arguing the feature shouldn't exist, i'm not saying i'm unhappy it does. i'm saying the implementation leaves quite a bit to be desired, and there's no reason it shouldn't be much better than it is."
6/7/2013,"dct isn't intended for people to train their character for a year. if you want to do that, you're far better off doing it on a seperate account for a variety of reasons in addition to cost.it's literally meant as a minor flexibility option for people who want a limited alt with a couple of million sp. i know that you're desperately trying to avoid understanding this because you want 1 account to offer the same utility we get from 3 accounts now, but that's the truth of it.stop thinking of dct as in any way competing with alt accounts. it doesn't. it's intended for use profiles that aren't suited at all to multiple accounts. if you want an alt and you're thinking ""man, just having a second account would be way better for what i want this alt for"" then dct isn't intended for that kind of alt, because there's already an option that does what you want.the rest of your argument boils down to ""i want ccp to give me more for less"".dct is as it is, deal with it."
6/7/2013,"the parts you snipped answered the rest.does it have a limited and niche appeal? yes.could it be cheaper to get a second account? yes, at around 3 months per char.destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
6/7/2013,i also wonder why therers no limitation to the cloaking modules as you can run it forever but i do support this. seems to make sense to me.
6/7/2013,"gunslinger actually failed to mention the third type of 'passive' cloaker: cloaky eyes/ears in w-space. sometimes one has to sit cloaked off a wormhole or starbase for hours to set up a trap, act as a picket for incoming hostiles, or because the inhabitants of your static are trying to bore you to death with their posspinning."
6/7/2013,"i hope i'm posting this in the right forum and the csm council will take this seriously given the potential gravity of the situation. the problem is as stated in the topic and ccp appears to be completely ignoring the issue. major antivirus software vendors have started flagging the in game browser as an identity theft risk because it's based on a highly vulnerable version of google chrome from 2009there's been a thread on reddit about it, a months old and similar years old threads on the eve issues and bug reporting forum as well as posts i've contributed to."
6/7/2013,"considering that malicious advertisements (malads?) inside legit pages/sites are a thing, this should be a higher priority. furthermore, considering that ddos attacks seem to be a part of the shady side of the eve metagame already (to go with rmt + botting), it is not a far leap to more insidious attack methods."
6/7/2013,"current skill system mechanics are fine. it allows you to try out modules and ships with enough time so that the next time you train your next ""better"" skills you'll be up to the challenge with your next bigger ship. contrary to other silly stupid wow/cod/bf3 games as you can use the best frigging gun in the world and be rambo...here it doesnt work that way. it needs time...and lots of it to become better with your ship and equipement... use that time efficiently.not supported"

6/7/2013,"hay guys thank you so much for your posts, i would just be so glad if ccp thinking on it a lot more if they done this sort the warp animations and station undocking. to sort out station loading may be put in a cut sean showing you undocking. and as for the jump effect keep it but removed the bit wear the cramer spins around after you enter system."

6/8/2013,"i do not at all want to be given more for less. what i am, is unsure as to why ccp expects me to be happy giving more to receive less.my question is why? there is no reason dct can't be everything multiple accounts is, minus the ability to actually fly both characters at once.and ""deal with it"" isn't an appropriate response to anything. should people have ""dealt with it"" rather than turn ccp around with the jita riots and the mass exodus of subscribers? eve is decidedly better for that, for people wanting the situation to improve. dct can be more than it is, and there doesn't seem to be a good reason why it isn't already.if i'm mistaken, i apologize, but your position seems to be: this is the current state, and any change is bad, no matter what the quality of the current state is, or what the change would be toward.you say dct isn't meant to be the equal of multiple accounts, but why? what, at all, would it take away from if they were more equal?"
6/8/2013,"it's all very simple. this system works well for a very few and limited situations. it in no way is meant to replace second accounts and at no point do ccp suggest it does. it's purely to train alts without having to start a second account and then transfer that char. it's financial viability only last for 3 months per char, then at that point a second account would be cheaper.why on earth should they be concerned with whether you are happy or not, when the system is as described and you are not being forced to use it? i could understand this argument, if they had removed the option to have a second account. but they haven't.so the choice remains firmly in your hands. use it, or don't use it.the list once more, for clarification.does it have a limited and niche appeal? yes.are you forced to use it? no.could it be cheaper to get a second account? yes, at around 3 months per char.should it be cheaper than standard pricing to use? hell no.destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."

6/8/2013,"it has been interesting playing since odyssey, and watching for the impacts of the heralded re-balancing of ice, ore, and moon goo.what is my verdict?utter, total, and complete failure. why?these changes were obviously designed to encourage players to explore more, and to play in nullsec. these changes could make you very rich as a miner in nullsec! ... on paper.actually, all of these changes fail to address one single, basic point, of the reality of nullsec.the map.the current map in eve has a number of critical choke points in it. both into lowsec, into nullsec, and jump routes needed to access entire regions in nullsec. and guess what - those choke points are all closed to explorers. indeed some are closed to everyone who isn't a plex billionaire who paid for admission to the inner circle of the two or three mega corps that control the critical access points, like pandemic leigon, goons etc.so until the map is changed, nullsec will remain dead and empty. to far to go, to hard to live there. impossible to export things to hgihsec to sell. so all the changes in one word add up to .... fail.fix the map, or stop pretending that things like make ice scarcer do more than making botters make more isk faster.how should the map be changed? highsec empire incursions. each player faction should be able to place sbus, and attack nullsec systems - if claimed and retained for 7 days, the nulls system should change to empire space, with a dev assigned security rating. if null sec mega corps keep null empty, and they have been and clearly indend to continue that, then enough already. add highsec patches in nullsec, with jump gates to the core systems."
6/8/2013,"i'm not really going to even address most of the rest of your post. it smacks of insular empire dweller, the sort who thinks that every gate into nullsec is bubblecamped 24/7 and so on. and besides, i'm one of those evil goons, the major factions controlling everything and apparently sells access to our space (that's news to me, i wonder where my cut is...), and thus you wouldn't believe me anyway.so we'll cut straight to your idea.sure. but it goes both ways. if highsec factions can invade nullsec, then it goes both ways - nullsec can invade highsec. e: i should also point out that all of the perks of nullsec that you clearly desire but are not bold enough to join a group and claim are tied to security status, and would thus vanish if your idea came to fruition. so, uh, what would be the point of this again? you wouldn't be playing in nullsec, mining dark glitter and arkonor to your heart's content while your personal tower sucks down dysprosium. you'd be playing in highsec, competing with a million other miners for ice belts that vanish in twenty minutes and cursing yourself for thinking this would get you what you want."
6/8/2013,"i agree, this needs to be given a much higher priority by ccp. by ccp knowing of this vulnerability, they are morally and professionally obligated to fix it.in my opinion, keeping the igb secure and patched is much more important then content even.csm, please bring this to light to ccp and support our safety.-signed-"
6/8/2013,"to the council of stellar management,if you read the eve online: odyssey feedback thread you will see that there is many anger and frustration with some specific contents of the new expansion odyssey. i expect you, the members of the council of stellar management for which i have voted, that you bring these points to attention before ccp and urge them to state solutions. especially the comments of some players, including myself, to get motion sickness or simulation sickness through the new effects and camera movements especially on long travels.best regards,aya shinomiya"

6/8/2013,"hi,i think some little changes might help. i am not sure. should be tested. i think it is more the combination of camera movement and effects. also the succession of warp travel and jump. i do not think it is wise to fob the players with things they can do at home to avoid the problem instead of ingame improvements. my suggestions in this matter: removing of the camera shaking while entering and leaving warp travel. until ccp found the possibilitiy to actual let the ship shaking and not the camera (-drones). this would be indeed a difference. the perspective would be fix while the ship on it is shaking. now it is conversely. i think this is one point that causes the sickness. removing of the camera swing before the jump effect. it is very aggressive camera movement. jumping from gate to gate needs only a few seconds. if you travel through many systems you see this swing in combaination with the jumping effect in quick succession. and if we are serious. our ships do not fly direct through the event horizon of the gate. they disappear and appear around the gate. we can see it. so this camera swing to create the illusion that the ship is moving through the gate is in my eyes expendable for the purpose of let player feel better while playing. making the jump animation or future animations like this less aggressive and flashing and more smooth. many player are annoyed but the jump effect after a few jumps. they cannot watch it any longer. including myself. i think it is because the whole animation is very aggressive. first this camera swing, than this flashing speed animation and at the end this distortion effect. and this many times when you travel through many systems. the problem with the effects in my eyes is that ccp puts to much effort in this show effect. everything must be cool-looking and bombastical but very often they forget the user friendliness.many games have possibilities to break up sequences and cut scenes through pushing esc. i do not know whether this is possible for eve online. but in this way player who are annoyed by the effect after a while can simply break it up. maybe than seeing a loading bar. i do not know. i am not familiar with the technical issues.many player, including myself, blame ccp of not implanting options so player can decide how they want to use the game mechanics. e.g. the new scanner. i do not understand why it is so hard to give the option of automatic scan and manual scan? now, it scans after every jump, after leaving a station or the warp. same whith the effects. ccp forcing us sometimes to things instead of letting the player decide how to use and customize them. this is one of the main source of the anger and frustration i think. they want back the old position of the undock buttom. damned, let they player decide where they want to put this damn thing. sorry.best regards.edit:i realized that you can at least turn off camera shaking in the settings."
6/8/2013,"i have a quick quip to say about the idea is that there should be certain restrictions to which forms a duster can and cannot post on, segregation is needed in just about almost all areas as the two game's subjects are entirely different and i am quite sure you guys will be rather tired of people posting about nerf lasers buff havs and nerf duvolle all day long. also we have free accounts so alt bad posting is quite possible to get entirely out of hand. i mean features and ideas a section as a cpm have to comb though quite often would easily get drowned out when something eve side gets screwy or something starts complaining why there is no day cycles in dust and someone mistakes it for eve and bad replies there is no such thing as day cycles in space. i would like to see the forums merged i would not like to see the issues that may arise from it.dust 514's cpm 1 iron wolf saber eve mail me about dust 514 issues."
6/8/2013,agreed. there are some sections of each games forum where a player from the other game will have nothing useful to say. so keep those sections separate.
6/8/2013,"in a recent interview ccp fozzie said that ring mining isn't something currently being worked on and may never be. while fozzie could have been misinformed or not part of that particular area of development, it does concern me as it is an area and a feature i was looking forward to and am intrigued by. i'm not demanding it or asking for it to be the next thing in eve but it is something i would one day love to see come to the systems of new eden.so if people still want it please show your support here and hopefully the csm can let ccp know it's still something the players of eve want.source - ccp fozzie interview the particular statement i'm refering to is at 43:45 minutes into the interview.thank you."
6/8/2013,"i would like to see the current asteroid belts simply be placed in a ring formation around the sun with about a dozen fields available. maybe put some ""empty roids"" in the background to complete the picture of a ring of asteroids. this would be in line with their latest concept of changing the ""spacescape"".an expansion later, they could possibly change some other things, such as making only veldspar and scordite commonly available, and making the more valuable asteroids available in a similar manner as ice fields. like, if you mine out the plagioclase ore anomaly, which is in a random spot somewhere along the ring of asteroids, then it would respawn some time later in another spot of the asteroid ring or even another system's asteroid ring (imo they should also somewhat randomize the systems where ice spawns).these seem like fairly minimal effort changes that could open the field for something larger that i can't think of right now. mostly i just think it would be nice/more immersive/less silly than the current asteroid fields.edit: i should add that only the first paragraph is really the bit that i expect/want when thinking of 'ring mining' right now. the other stuff is just me rambling. there's of course also the thing for the rings around some planets, which is what people might mean when talking about ring mining."
6/8/2013,not bad.+1 i'll askm

6/8/2013,
6/9/2013,"it takes about 3 months to train a decent mining alt, that is 3 plex for dct, to set up a new account i will cost 1 plex to start the account, 3 plex for training time, and 2 plex to transfer the character over to the main account.lets total that updct 3 plexsecond account 6 plex"
6/9/2013,"ccp haven't explained their commercial reasons, but i'd guess they go something like this:1 plex gives you 30 days account time = 30 days skilling(1) ccp offer additional incentives to the price of starting a new account, because once you have a character on a new account you have a very strong incentive to keep maintaining that account. if you don't you lose access to the character. no such consideration applies to secondary characters on your main account, so there's no good reason to offer extra pricing incentives from ccp's point of view.(2) simplicity: dct maintains the ""list"" price of plex, and the cost is simple to understand and simple for ccp to implement. given that they explicity don't want dct to directly compete with multiple accounts, the effort of adding in the spectrum of pricing incentives is high and the reward is negative from their point of view. think of it as the difference in the per-month price you pay for watching 1 pay per view event compared to subscribing to the sports channel for a whole year. the 1-y sub is far cheaper per unit time because your total spend is higher, and you're very likely to renew. in terms of cost of delivery and administration, it doesn't cost the cable company any more than the ppv, but it's way better in terms of revenue to lock you in for a year. but if you just want to watch a single game, then it's better for you to pay $20 for 1 evening than $600 for 365 days, even though you're paying more than 10x the per-day price of a sub.anyway that's all i'm going to say on the matter; you can either accept that reasoning, or rant about it some more, but it won't change anything."
6/9/2013,"so you want the ability to create more highsec space? why not spread out more in to the multitude of highsec systems that are almost always empty? if anything, we need less highsec."
6/9/2013,"how do two gigantic belts encircling a star make it easier for gankers to find you over the current beaconed belt positions? cruell nightmare and ccp soundwave aren't saying there should only be two mining spots in a system, in fact they are saying the oppisite, that belts should be spread across systems in terms of au rather than km.also, i'm not sure what kind of high sec mning you are doing that pays little and involves a ton of risk. though if you're not paying a sub and only play with plex that might explain it."
6/9/2013,"""warfare in high-sec, whether concord sanctioned or not, involves the destruction of enemy assets, and the destruction of the enemy's will to fight. ""most of us in high are in high because we don't want to fight anyway.. so there's no will to fight to break. you null seccers and your ""lets all kill high seccers!!!"" mentality.."
6/9/2013,"sounds pretty reasonable, one question though. what would happen to the existing mining barges? would they be rendered obsolete?"
6/9/2013,"no, definitely not. the two types of mining would be completely separate from each other except for some shared skills, ships from one simply can't perform the tasks of the other, for instance the ring harvester would have no turret points and cannot fit strip miners, it is dependent on it's unique mining drones for harvesting. the idea is to add a new type of mining, not to replace an existing one."
6/9/2013,could be interesting way to do things for those of us fancying a little interaction while mining that isn't just changing target...
6/9/2013,"this is a proposal to allow the game to systematically remove/anull corporations that are inactive, especially those which have been inactive for very long periods of time, in order to free up corp names and associated tickers.imo ccp should always express favourability toward active players rather than treating them as equals to the hundreds of thousands of 30 day alt accounts and 1 man dead corps."
6/9/2013,allow noctis into all sites that have an acceleration gate to salvage. i have seen several new players that tried to get into accel gate sites but it wouldnt allow the noctis thru. it would however allow t3 cruisers to use the gate. there is no reason why a noctis shouldnt be able to use any accel gate in the game. it's sole purpose in the game is to salvage and ccp is not allowing it to be used fully as it should be.

6/9/2013,"proposal:energy discharge elutriation i should be changed from 20% to 25% cap reduction for laser turrets and the t2 variant from 25% to 30%.as a few might have seen there was a very big discussion about the changes to the amarr hulls, losing her cap bonus with the current odyssey expansion. while i like the changes, there actually is a reasonable concern of performance lose with some platforms, especially for newer players. as you think back of your early days we mostly did ccc and recharger stacking, improving cap recharge to a point where the hole setup runs forever or long enough for your needs. however many amarr hulls actually perform noticeably better with the cap if you use discharge rigs instead of cccs, since the massive reduction in weapon capacitor use, especially with high damage ammo is better than what you can stack up with cap recharge mods(if you just use 1-2 rig slots and 1-2 low/med slots). the problem with t1 guns is actually, big surprise, that they don't need so much cap and therefore new players can't really take advantage of discharge rigging(actually they even got nerfed with the general cap reduction of lasers). with a improvement of the discharge rigs even newer players with t1 guns get a noticeable improvement if they want to reduce slots for cap spend to a minimum to get a better overall performance out of hulls like the new apoc or navy omen in pve.[apocalypse, new setup 1]heat sink iiheat sink iiheat sink iienergized adaptive nano membrane iienergized adaptive nano membrane iiarmor em hardener iilarge armor repairer iitracking computer ii, optimal range scripttracking computer ii, optimal range scriptcap recharger iiexperimental 100mn afterburner imega modulated pulse energy beam i, imperial navy multifrequency lmega modulated pulse energy beam i, imperial navy multifrequency lmega modulated pulse energy beam i, imperial navy multifrequency lmega modulated pulse energy beam i, imperial navy multifrequency lmega modulated pulse energy beam i, imperial navy multifrequency lmega modulated pulse energy beam i, imperial navy multifrequency lmega modulated pulse energy beam i, imperial navy multifrequency lmega modulated pulse energy beam i, imperial navy multifrequency llarge capacitor control circuit ilarge capacitor control circuit ilarge capacitor control circuit ihammerhead ii x5hobgoblin ii x5with all 5, the setup runs(ab off, repper on):4m 35s with multi7m 32s with xray25m 33s with standardwith all 3 cccs removed and replaced with 2 of the current t1 discharger rigs it looks like this:3m 56s with multi4m 50s with xray5m 56s with standardif you replace them 2 t2 discharge rigs(while t1 would be as effective after the change) you get:4m 20s with multi5m 16s with xray6m 26s with standardif you now look at the numbers with the new 30% value(i took triple t1 discharge rigs) with 2 of the new t2 discharge rigs it looks like this:4m 37s with multi5m 37s with xray6m 59s with standardas you can see with the extra 5% discharge rigs would be a lot better option for younger players than they are now, giving you nearly the same performance with multi frequency crystals as if you use ccc stacking. keep in mind that a fitting like this also frees a rig slot(that can be spend on cap, range, tank etc.) and with lower levels in controlled burst and cap skills, the discharge rigs are even better. once you look at t2 guns and t2 ammo dischargers are actually become the preferable option compared to cccs, since your guns use a lot more cap and you will utilize scorch and conflag a lot more than standard crystals, so you spend nearly 100% of your time with crystals that favour discharge rigging.to summarize:- new players can start to utilize discharge rigs earlier, by getting more comparable results compared to ccc stacking at least for multi frequency crystals even with t1 guns- it softens the blow for newer people starting with a bs for l4, since both laser options don't got a cap bonus(and the abaddon takes noticeable more damage now, requiring noticeable more cap to rep it up, as i tested it out after the patch, it did feel a bit less stable overall, if you can call a 3m 10s setup stable)- old cap booster setups on the apoc need less changes for older players- overall runtime of the hulls gets slightly improved, not really enough to drop a cap mod but new players will notice itfor pvp the change would obviously make some fleet setups run a bit longer with the same amount of cap charges, but the biggest improvement would be better runtime for nano kitting setups, making the rigs a more useful option compared to other popular energy rigging choices(optimal, tracking, damage, rof). while the power grid penalty is a hard one on active tanking setups, the higher bonus might actually convince some people to use them."
6/9/2013,"personally don't think +5% is enough to make a dent, most of the pure laser boats that remain have had their cap bonus removed with few corresponding increases in cap .. but i'll big it up nonetheless since every little bit counts.watched the odd gameplay-slash-interview with fozzie(?), and he has the right idea but is at a loss as to how to achieve it . he knows that blanket cap increases will lead to neuting and other madness (ex. old apoc) but acknowledges that lasers are 'off' as it were and suggested that one thing he'd like to explore was to make them heinously unstable but with stellar performance comparatively .. alternative is to continue down the path of watering them down with cap/fitting decreases and placing them squarely in between autos and blasters (*yawn*)."
6/9/2013,"well it is not intended to be the all end fix to amarr and laser problems, however i think it is a step in the right direction. i made this after a lot of discussion here, on the german forums and ingame about the matter. it isn't even the case that i got big issues with the changes atm, i even feel they are great if i look at the navy apoc now, but i do realize other people play a bit differently and might not agree with me for that matter.i played around with a few ideas and adjusting discharge rigs a bit seamed to be the most sensible solution. it gives newer players the useful option to use discharge fittings early on and reduces the issues many people got with her bs after the change to more manageable levels. if i look at my navy apoc(1xt1 and 1xt2 discharge rig), it improves cap life from 3.5 to 4 minutes with conflag and 4.5 to 5 with multi frequency, so it is quite a noticeable improvement and it does scale very good for lower skill levels.i am also a bit concerned what will happen with lasers and amarr in a more complex makeover, time will tell i guess."
6/9/2013,"switch out the cap recharger for a cap booster, don't permarun the repper. problem solved."
6/9/2013,sounds like a great idea. just please dont merge. i dont want to be reading troll posts from dustie alts as well.
6/9/2013,"i was just thinking, when and if the devs were ever to look at missioning maybe we could get some missions that use the hacking system that was just added.example: we need you to go hack a serpentis comm satellite we found. if you succeed at hacking without getting noticed, you get some bonus reward of some sort, if you fail the hacking game, the mission can still be completed but you have to fight through a few level appropriate npcs and you'd loose the bonus reward.another thing that could be pvp like is to attack a pirate mining fleet. you'd have to go in, pop some mining vessels and get out before escorts arrive to get the bonus.i also think it would be nice when if you kill a mission complete npc or too many npcs for those that have more than one or two foes, half of the enemies give or take would flee. so if my domi pops 3 battleships and 5 bcs, some of the other ones think twice about hanging around."
6/9/2013,"saying that ""ring mining is not currently in the cards"" is not the same as saying that significant revamps to moon mining aren't in the cards. after technetium alchemy was introduced, fozzie promised ""more changes in the future"" and here we are in odyssey. and with the odyssey devblog, fozzie said that, let's see...sourcepersonally, my opinion has always been that the concept of ring mining was a rough idea wrapping up several necessary design criteria for any moon mining revamp but that the specifics were open for interpretation."
6/9/2013,"first, thank you for replying, i know the csm sometimes can't or won't comment on certain issues but it is nice when they do.secondly, i'm not entirely sure why you have assumed that ring mining must be in someway linked to moon mining and tech ii production, if i'm missing a post, announcement or dev blog then please let me know.my purpose was simply to show player support for the activity of ring mining as another branch of mining and not for it's larger implications on production, poss or anything else. i saw it as an alternative activity to mining belts and clouds and something for miners to do, not all miners can or want to maintain and manage a pos or it's production chain. also, with the trend of moving certain items out of npc hands and making them player created comes a potential need for new minerals, ores or resources that ring mining could provide without stepping into the area of tech ii production.finally (not aimed at mynnna but general readers), when i say ring mining it's important to understand i mean planetary rings and not rings of asteroids, that would be belt mining and is an entirely different debate.thank you."
6/9/2013,"i actually like the idea of the all roids being in a true ring around the sun... something that would make life more interesting for miners is to have them look almost the same and be generically named until you run a scanner on them or try to refine them, this would make the scanner a useful tool instead of hanger clutter (i don't know of any miners who use one these days due them only telling you how much is left in that particular roid). the nameless convention could be carried almost all the way to refining stage and have a few useless materials thrown in too to mix it up. you don't want the useless stuff? fit a scanner so that you can avoid mining it in the first place. what do you think?"
6/9/2013,"soundwave's initial comments at last fanfest talked about putting moon minerals in the rings.and in response to the op, mining in general badly needs a revamp and expansion, whether that specifically involves ring mining or some other new type(s) of mining is of lesser importance."

6/10/2013,"ccp also wants to do something about cloaking. and local. and that entire bloody intel spectrum.i did not expect this thread to garner support, mainly because it a) makes cloaking better, which scares the people who hate afk cloaking, and b) it makes it possible to detect cloakers, which scares the people who love afk cloaking. it's a balanced solution that pisses off both camps. my proposal is basically ""remove local"" combined with ""allow cloakers to be probed"". it's far more balanced than either solution on its own, but that doesn't matter, because people are self absorbed and don't like compromise.do you remember what it was that actually got learning skills fixed? it was a person in authority basically getting sick of seeing all the topics and then going up to somebody and saying ""hey, you, fix it now because i'm paying you"". the problem is not resources. the problem is not designs. the problem is not convincing ccp that it's an issue that needs dealing with. the problem is priority. this entire clusterfuck could be fixed in the next patch if somebody in authority mandated it. but nobody in authority is mandating it. so it isn't getting dealt with.i made this thread for two reasons. 1) query public response to compromise (which went about as well as i expected), and 2), to contribute to the growing pool of complaints so that maybe somebody in authority will stumble across the thread and get pissed enough to actually finally say the word to get this stupid thing dealt with.honestly, i don't care what ccp does to cloaking, because i know whatever it is, it'll be better thought out and more balanced than anything most people on this forum could propose.i just want to see it get done."
6/10/2013,"you'll have to provide me with the wide spectrum of information that relates to ccp wanting to do something about cloaking. something that's on a par with the learning skill debate. i doubt you can, but we shall see.they do want the intel separated from local and i agree this has been long talked about. i would also agree this is on a par with the learning skill debate.but now we get to the crux of the matter. this thread is really all about afk cloakers. you have an axe to grind, we get it, oh my do we get it. but these ideas have been talked to death. the complaints regarding cloaking have been going on for years. mostly from those too ignorant of the actual mechanics at play or that believe they should have almost perfect safety in null.this thread will not garner any more or less support, than others have on the same subject. but i see that's not your point here. the point is simply to keep flooding the forum with such threads and hope that by mere weight and repetitiveness, you'll force ccp into action.destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
6/10/2013,"the extent of it is a couple of mutters at fanfast panels, mostly. it's not as explicit as ""afk cloaking is bad"", so much as a non-commital ""cloaking is something we want to take a look at"".thing is, intel and stealth are implicitly intertwined. you can't cleanly separate them.your presumptions are understandable, but highly inaccurate. i'm concerned with cloaking as a whole. stealth in eve poorly implemented, and i take issue with it. the reason you think this is about afk cloaking is because it would be physically impossible to make a thread about cloaking and have it not touch on afk cloaking in some way, shape, manner or form. i do believe my implementation would ""fix"" afk cloaking, but that's not why i pieced it together.i probably would've made an intel-related proposal, but a) i'm not qualified to do it, because my knowledge on intel gathering is disparate at best, and b) such a proposal would necessitate widespread changes, and people are generally bad at thinking holistically. if you write a list of a dozen interconnected changes, people will take one or two of those changes, isolate them, and then tell you why your idea sucks whilst ignoring how those two changes interact with the other ten.accurate, if inelegant. i do believe my ideas have merit on their own; i'm not just here to spam. but that's part of the bigger picture."

6/10/2013,"while recommending an old home remedy is all well and good for a temporary fix to alleviate discomfort, it does nothing to address the root issue at hand. the fact is that for some players who had no issues plaing this game previously, it has now begun to affect their physical health, and that is a very bad thing.what's the suggestion for those of us who have reported migraines triggered from this effect? i'm afraid ginger isn't going to cut it in this case. i've been trying to look away or cover the screen with another window, but if i'm jumping into a potentially hostile environment, the delay in awareness of my surroundings could potentially be the difference between (virtual) life and death. it puts myself and similarly affected players at a disadvantage.the response in the feedback thread has been loud and clear, on this and many other problems with the new expansion. i would echo the request that you members of the csm, as our representatives, pressure ccp to address these issues. at the very least, we need some communication from ccp that they recognize that there are problems and are willing to listen, as so far they have been silent on the subject."

6/10/2013,"actually no, somebody i know for years(he is not to bad at pushing l4 times) got a lot of issues with this strategy on his new navy apoc, because it only runs as long as my setup, with the difference that he needs to permarun his cap booster, while i relay on cap recharge and cap use reduction with 2 rig slots and a low slot mod more, spend on cap stuff.as a second note, i never run cap booster setups(i tried, they are terrible) and think they are bad for pve, especially on amarr hulls."
6/10/2013,"i ran a cap booster setup for ages & had no problems with it. there is no reason that you have to run a repper permanently for l4's & that's where most of your cap is going. if your friend claims that he has to permarun the cap booster he is either a) also permarunning his repper because he's too lazy to pay attention to it, b) has really, really bad cap related skills for the fit & needs to sort that out or c) is lying. even with average cap related skills, the cap booster setup lets you drop the cap rigs to pickup more damage or better rep capability."
6/10/2013,"i'm pretty sure he didn't permarun the repper and his problem is actually exactly that he didn't fit a single cap related module except the cap booster on the apoc like he did before the patch. with the cap bonus change the apoc is down to 14 volleys with multi frequency or 12 with conflagration, per 800er cap charge. if you add some repping and constant capacitor drains like hardeners and tcs, this means about 2 cap charges per minute.after ammo and a container for spare crystals, you look at around 23-24 charges what translates into a runtime of 11,5 and 12 minutes what isn't enough for some l4. while his problem will not change without him changing rigs, coming a bit out of his comfort zone for tank and dropping his t2 rof rig, i think he might be ok if he uses a single 30% discharge rig. it isn't a bad idea if we keep it nice and simple for people with her old cap booster setups. a setup that doesn't need one needs 1 med, 1 low, 2 rigs and a setup that gains a bit more efficiency if you use one needs 1 rig, 1 med slot, i think that should be a viable ratio to anybody."
6/10/2013,"i think you're right in terms of rigs in general need improving which fozzie has said he will look at doing..but i think on a general setup you shouldn't need cap rigs on a ship to get decent cap it should only really be for cap stable fits.or for mwd kiting ship.'tech3 ships need to be put down, like a rabid dog drooling everywhere in the house, they are out of line' ccp ytterbium nerf missile range into place where is the td missile change? ..projectiles should use capacitor. abc's should be t2 habc and nerf web strength its still too high"
6/10/2013,"amarr hulls with cap bonuses have a very similar runtime as hybrid hulls. since apparently nobody liked cap bonuses ccp changed them for some weapon related bonuses. as explained in the amarr bs balancing thread, dropping the cap bonus is just switching around some modules/rigs on high sp fittings. this is also the reason why i don't have issues with it.discharge rigs provide weapon cap use bonuses similar to the old ones on the hulls and are a better option than ccc stacking on high sp levels where you can burn a lot of cap with lasers and hulls without a cap bonus. like explained before the scaling makes them more effective with less slots invested(better run time with high damage ammo, less with low cap ammo). because of the same scaling principals, newer players with t1 weapons can't utilize this fitting feature properly and will lose performance without the cap bonus on the hulls in many cases. to address this, i made this proposal. as a positive side effect, i hope people can be similar happy as i am with the new apoc and navy apoc in pve."
6/10/2013,"you are more forgiving than most problem is that once upon a time the cap bonuses were warranted as lasers were :awesome: and the ships were more than competitive with only one bonus .. now, after umpteen boosts to the three other systems, laser are barely on par even with twin weapon bonuses and those now have the cap issue on top of the comparatively weak weapons.it is my hope that ccp eventually decides on restoring the :awesome: to lasers, cap be damned. amarr has been a gang/fleet race from the get-go (lol midslots ) so making the top performers dependent on outside assistance when operating at their peak is perfectly in tune with my idea of amarr ... as long as there are some solo options available, i am good with most hulls needing serious sacrifices outside of the group."
6/10/2013,"i am well aware that cap bonuses where intended as damage bonuses(and actually where pretty solid), that where build into lasers already and served as restriction for other hulls to not fit lasers, because lasers where simply better. a lot got changed over the years with other weapon systems and hulls, gallente hulls are no longer fitting starved(still utterly terrible at point blank compared to pre qr ability's), minmtar hulls with acs actually do some dps at range and caldari are the new medium range kings with the cm update. in my opinion by dropping the cap bonuses, adding speed, range and tracking to the hulls, rise tries to bring lasers back to a point where they can not just compete but dominate other options in fleet pvp(the new navy apoc is a awesome example for that), if you can handle fitting and capacitor restrictions. even for solo and small gang the hulls look a lot more competitive now(navy omen can kite like a zealot, geddon is a very useful addition and the new apoc can be played like a nano pest with super high range).if you look at the old designs with only the cap bonus, most used off racial weapons. not because lasers where bad, but because the extra fitting and cap saving could be used to build massive tanks and provide overall better performance in pure ehp/dps fights. with the new approach of giving out weapon bonuses instead of cap bonuses, rise tries to amplify the advantage of laser fittings on the hulls, making them hit harder, further and better than other ships in her class.while the change to discharger rigs doesn't look like much, it will suddenly help a lot of new players and pure pve players to get back to the point they where before odyssey and make the process of changing old habits for amarr players less harsh, since i am sure rise wants to drop even more cap bonuses on other hulls. this isn't bad in my opinion, as long as you have the ability to chose between a cap hungry min/max setup or something that can be made fairly cap stable with a few adjustments in the rigging/med/low slot department, not just for high sp players, but every amarr player."

6/11/2013,"i don't appreciate having my side of a discussion being called a rant. much like i don't like being told to ""deal with it"", or be told ""your argument boils down to strawman x"".i had hoped for a more grown-up attitude. it disappoints me that you are one of the faces representing our community.that said, my responses to your points:1 -- as a consumer of the product, i don't agree that we as a community should so ardently defend ccp's methods of obtaining our cash, but obviously i'm not opposed to seeing a company make money.that ccp has a monetary reason for the current setup doesn't change the fact that it's unfriendly to users. this is basically my point. dct costs more than a second account, while offering the user less. that it makes sense from ccp's point of view doesn't change that it doesn't make much sense from a subscriber's point of view.2 -- your second point seems very similar to the first. ccp makes more money this way. the ppv analogy works so far as an account is concerned, but i don't see the comparison when applied to dct. i want to run a second character constantly, year after year, on the same account as my primary. where are the points of comparison with ppv there?i want to be locked in for a year. continuing your analogy, i'm being charged a year's worth of evenings at the per-evening charge, as opposed to the per-year, which i'd prefer."
6/11/2013,then you should be running a second account.
6/11/2013,"you seemed to suggest cloaked vessels would be undetectable when cloaked, except by other cloaked vessels.therefore, to defend against cloaked hostiles it would be needed to have cloaked vessels standing guard.the balance point to this must deal with the absence of local, at least regarding cloaked vessels.i would suggest something different.for local:"
6/11/2013,"okay, having read the response and thought about it, i think the suggestions in the op are too much. it gives too much to the cloaked ship. i think there should be a small chance to see the cloaked ship wihtout a new mechanice (scan probes, etc.) and that could be something like keeping cloaks and the jump cloak as they are now.basically,-you wont show in local until you deactivate your jump cloak.-you will be removed from local once you activate your own cloaking device (if you have one).-given the two above you at least be visible for a very short amount of time jumping in and out of a system.thus, if the pilot ratting in a system is not paying attention his risk factor just went up. if he went afk even while at a pos, his risk factor just went up. and so forth.at the same time i also like the idea that the cloaked ship cannot view local as well. now he has to use dscan and warp around--i.e. work for his intel.and in addition a way of finding cloaked ships in system should be introduced. be it with scan probes, a module whatever. thus, if a guy is ratting and warps to a pos to go take a leak and is nervous somebody may have come in system and is waiting to ""do bad things to him""<U+FFFD> then he'll have to re-scan the system. just as the cloaker no longer gets quicky intel without some risk, neither does the ratter.nikk's suggestions cover most of this, iirc. the op is moving somewhat in that direction, but is not comprehensive enough and imo, gives too much to cloaks.note that with the above the idea of afk cloaking is pointless, even without some way of finding the cloaked vessel. since you don't show up in local, you can't have any impact. adding in a way to detect cloaked ships will introduce risk to afk cloaking as well further discouraging it, at least for long periods of time."
6/11/2013,"highsec cap restriction will be an issue.planting either low or npc null pocket with station into every sov null area as staging ground would be a good idea. of course, not if you're null farmer terrified of neuts. but good for eve as a whole."
6/11/2013,"before you even comment on my corp/alliance, i lived in wormholes for years and before that was a lowsec/highsec miner.fact is, outside of obviously stupid pipes like hed, most entracnes to/from null/low/high are completely empty, because no one wants to guard the entrance to a pipe thats not in the optimal route to a trade hub, because people rarely take that route.not only that, but 90% of the time, if your in a cloak or fast-warp capable ship, nullsec dwellers will ignore you because you pose very little threat, and the time/effort required to try and bring you out to be killed would be better spent maintaining the daily order/routine.fact is, null/low is and always will be accessible to people of any skill, so long as they learn what ships are capable of what (covops ship gets more or less free-roam of nullsec if you know how to fit it and fly it properly).honestly, the only real issue nullsec has, is power projection, which promotes mega-empires, since a single fleet can go anywhere very fast, and it actually becomes quicker the more ships/pilots you have (which is the opposite of what should happen)."
6/11/2013,"this would have to work both ways, and it wouldn't end up like you're expecting. you would have a horde of newbies and carebears against organized alliances that make their living killing people. highsec would cease to exist. whether or not this is a good thing is a subject of some debate. in the meantime, if you really want to get into null, go to providence. one of the few nrds pockets of null, and only one jump out of highsec. as long as you don't shoot anyone or steal wrecks, you'll do fine."
6/11/2013,"i'll tell you what. form up two hundred guys, grab some sbus and head to vfk. i see you're in a player corp, so you won't have any trouble anchoring them. that way, you don't remove absolutely everything that makes null worth being in and don't just ad extra highsec for people to ignore.let us know what happens! you seem to think it'll be easy to do, so go on and do it!"
6/11/2013,"i enjoy, perhaps i should say enjoyed, the hacking/archeology changes post june 4th, up until odyssey 1.0.4.this most recent change to scatter containers seems to go against the idea that the solo hacker should be able to get about 1/2 the containers. the spread speed in addition to the opposing vectors means i barely have time to get 1/3 of them, if i'm lucky, let alone if i take the moment to try to read the labels. in addition, i now have to get closer than 2000m to the data/archeology container before i kill the core if i plan on getting any significant portion of the loot. being in hostile space, the only defense i have on my cov-ops frig is to cloak. this range difference puts me at an even more significant disadvantage. even when i'm under the cloak perimeter i still cannot get 1/2 the cans. of course i haven't tried randomly clicking on the closest cans...in it's current iteration i can not believe that this scattering dynamic keeps the solo hacker/archeologist anywhere close to the pre-expansion income level. let alone anywhere close to june 5th-9th.my thoughts, as to steer this away from a flame post:perhaps the containers could scatter from a single random point in the quadrant the player is hacking from, seeing it in print, it seems like that was the way it was before.perhaps fewer containers could appear, without labels, with mixed/randomized contents.perhaps increasing the range of the looting beam to help mitigate some of the difficulty due to the new/wider spread. perhaps the cans could last a little longer, and keep the new spread spawning.perhaps the cans could spawn in clusters of type so we could concentrate on a specific type, 'chasing' then down so to speak, to limit the overall types of loot a single player could receive from a single spawn container.idk, i'm frustrated after spending a few hours searching under populated nullsec for data/relic sites and the first one i come across being unable to loot any significant portion of the cans. i did learn something today, there don't seem to be any data/relic sites in drone space. i personally would love to see the kind of drone relics i might be able to come across, and a massive drone communications network might produce some strange/interesting loot.lil"
6/11/2013,not sure it has been brought up before but.would it be possible to ask ccp to change the universe and solar system map screens to windows that can be resized and moved instead of taking over the entire screen. everything else in eve appears to be a window that can be opened and closed or minimized except the map.

6/11/2013,doe any of the csm's read this? i would like to get their input on this.
6/11/2013,"you're talking about l1/2 missions with ship restrictions here?if so, sounds like a simple update to the list of permitted ships is called for. add it to soundwave's ""little things"" thread."

6/12/2013,"i am 100% ok with that. if you can push jita to 0.0 by taking and holding the surrounding areas (perimeter to 0.4 etc, after all all null has low around it), then good for you.of course, to do so you'd need to take all the planets as well, using dustbunnies. but hey, that's what they are for, right? that said, if you 'nullify' jita, don't be surprised if the caldari empire decides to take it back. as the husband of one of our corpies very accurately commented in teamspeak (he does not even play eve):space is infinite. why are there choke points at all?"
6/12/2013,"obviously stupid pipes << precisely my point. there are too many of these at the moment. try living in drone regions when you are not blue to anyone in the inner reigons for cyno routes. it is simply too far to be worth the bother - the rats are rubbish, the lack of loot means no free meta 4 parts for pvp expendable ships, the additional jump distance adds a horrid overhead to all your exports. in short, the map makes that entire reigon dead. and yes, i have lived there and until recently so did my main's alliance. we left because the map makes it economically better to be in highsec than that reigon ... even with the mining changes. we didn't want to leave, but our members were losing isk badly - due to the map. that's crap.initially all ccp needs to do is to look at where people play in nullsec, and very importantly, where they do not play. nearly all of nullsec is empty, much is not even claimed. whole reigons are dead, you can go a dozen jumps before you find someone, and they simply flee to their mining pos. yay ccp!based on pure player numbers, this game is absolutely highsec based. so if we want highsec players to go to nullsec, we need to stop making it so damn hard to live out there. a few npc stations in highsec islands to act as trade hubs (and the surrounding 4 or 5 lowsec systems to act as cyno points) would spice things up, and be consistent with the lore of the game. ""tired of the endless war with gallente, the caldari empire in a bold move attacked system xxxxxx this morning ..,. if not stopped they will add the system to their empire in 7 days"" and sure, there should be a couple billion isk sbu that is freely attackable by anyone without concord response that you can drop back into highsec - which if successfully deployed and defended for a week drops the security of the system by -0.1. nullify jita in a month or two? go for it ... if you can."
6/12/2013,"been there, done that what happens in null to independent alliances is this:1. set up goes great, everyone has heap of fun.2. lots of activity in system, 10 to 25 players in local all day.3. random neuts come in, people start losing ships but enjoy the pvp.4. fleets of t2 ships come in, typically cynnabals, falcons and talos. losses increase, as t1 ships / new players get slaughtered.5. player numbers in system fall.6. afk cloaky campers move in, typically cloaky tengu etc.7. miner ship losses increase.8. all mining ceases due to cloakies. industry index falls badly.9. miners return to highsec because they can't mine any more and are losing isk badly.10. ratters return to highsec because their miner friends have all left.11. insufficient player numbers active in system to justify the sov bills.12. exit from nullsec.that is typically what happens. the twist is someone like pandemic legion flips from blue protector providing top cover from sov invasion, to standover extortionist. that simply accelerates 12, because 3 to 11 is still happening anyway.we can see ccp's attempts to change the above by other actions, namely the rumours of changes to cloaking, and the massive nerf to t3 cruisers currently in the works. to me, the t3 changes are really unnecessary. the issue in nullsec derives from the map and access issues, not from how powerful or not a single cloaked ship happens to be. without highsec islands out there in the raggedy edge, independent alliances will inevitably be forced back to highsec. seen it over and over and over ... and because holding sov does not require anyone to actually play in a system, nothing will change (imagine if you lost sov if you did not maintain military 3 or industry 1 every 7 days). especially with the cloaky camper mechanics.so yes, nullsec is dead and empty, but for pos on moons extracting goo for mega corps. has been that way for years now, i don't want to see that continue for the next decade. time to change the map and really spice things up."
6/12/2013,"npc 0.0 exists, you know."
6/12/2013,"keeping this bumped. +1 from me , btw. love the idea. belt rats could now spawn at different parts of the belt, at planets, w/e. i really don't see a downside, except for having to reseed it. but it would be worth it."
6/12/2013,i agree with this. when i use the star map i typically minimize the map control window which contains the only button that can get you out of the map. (to lazy to look for keyboard shortcut for map) then i have to hunt for where on the neocom the control window put itself to exit the map. the star map should be a window.
6/12/2013,"if i leave the game for a month or two, why should i lose my corp?if one of the many military players goes on deployment and lets their account lapse, why should they lose their corp?if i go inactive and all my stuff is removed, where is the incentive to come back?"
6/12/2013,if you leave for a month or two wouldn't others in your corp be there do defend your station?if you are a solo corp then what right do you have to occupy and hold a moon from active players?i understand the sacrifice that the armed forces and others undertake and sympathize with the difficulties of a persistent game universe vis a vis real life commitments. if you know you are going to be away then you have time to park assets where they will be safe or let others know about leaving.mmike azariah ----<U+FEFF> <U+FFFD>|(<U+30C4>)/<U+FFFD>

6/13/2013,"@ mag'si'm not saying that's not the case -- obviously it is. i'm saying it's ridiculous, and it should be changed."
6/13/2013,"your argument boils down to cost, as you expect it to be cheaper. sorry but no, that's not the point of this mechanic. as has been explained time and again.this mechanic works out cheaper for short runs.a second account works out cheaper for the long run.use it for either, or don't use it at all. the choice is yours.destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."

6/13/2013,"so...why would it take a week to annex vfk for an empire, but two months to annex jita for a nullsec group? should be the same both ways. of course, highsec doesn't actually have the organisation to conquer anything.as for your 'npc highsec islands with safe cyno places', that's what npc nullsec is for. adding in areas of highsec smack in the middle of what's supposed to be dangerous space with the sole intent of making it safer kind of defeats the entire purpose of nullsec.and just because you got shafted by some droneland slumlord doesn't mean the whole of nullsec should be redesigned to suit you personally."
6/13/2013,"then why is there no rational distribution of npc nullsec to ensure access to remote systems? even by your logic, which i don't agree with, the map is really badly made leading to dead and empty regions.the problem with nullsec is not that it is far away or hard to live in. it is that massive regions of nulllsec it is so utterly dead that there is nothing to do for pvpers. it is unhealthy for any corp to have miners in null and pvpers in lowsec because there is simply not enough pvp to be found in nullsec.nearly all the small gang pvp in the game is currently in lowsec. whole major alliances have withdrawn from nullsec to low, because other than moons (yea that's watching paint dry laugh a minute spreadsheet fun) unless you have a good protecated war with someone, null is just boring. and it's boring because there are too few people who actually *play* there.so don't call me a highsec carebear, or try to guess reasons for my post. my reason for posting is i am concerned about the health of the game, and of the success of the odyssey patch being undermined by the legacy map issues. space should not be full of choke points, and capital fleets should take a lot longer to move than they currently do so that there is actual strategy in this game again.eve used to be a better pvp game. it got dumbed down by instant-always-kill typhoon builds for ganking iterons, and pay to win dreadnaught fleets. things need to change, because currently if one of the majors lose, rather than a rejuvenation of nullsec we are much more likely to see only the odd moon extraction pos out there, with not a single pvp target for entire reigons.there were once wars that had been going on for years. but let's be honest about the state of nullsec - many of the old pvp alliances have simply quit the game. now there are members of the r64 cartel, and while they occasionally fight over who gets to have which moons, once that fighting is done they will be back to logging in their highsec ganker alts and lowsec pvp alts because there is simply nothing to do in null any more until the next war, which may take a year or two to happen."
6/13/2013,"i'd be fine with it taking longer for highsec empires to take null. i ould also be fine with nullsec alliances that have sov 4 being able to declare for one of the empires, and have thier system convert to a caldari empire 0.5 which they could then upgrade the sov on to 1.0 . such a system should keep thier ihub and rat spawns, but the station would be npc owned unless the sov got knocked back down to 0.0 again.bottom line, bad maps in ffa pvp mmos harm the game, by falsely skewing the population to play in certain areas. places further away need better resources to justify the cost of getting there and back, where (as in eve) distance traveled has a jump fuel cost. instead, we have areas in eve that are a long way away, but which are badly inferior to other closer areas of the game. it is no wonder such areas are dead and empty - presenting nothing more than wasted game server resources and lost opportunities. fix the map = more fun pvp. don't like my proposed solution? make a better proposal. but make no mistake, this games growth continues to be sluggish, and in my view a key culprit is nullsec is the map, particularly in combination with other archaic and poorly designed mechanics. no-one fights a war to take a station any more ... they just drop caps and you're done, no need to ever *play* there. not good enough for going into the second decade."
6/13/2013,highsec should only be 0.8-1.0 systems and concord response time should increase to at least 30 seconds. also move incursions and l4 missions out of highsec.
6/13/2013,"danika is not talking about holding a moon. he is talking about not loosing his corp. as was stated above, if there is an inactive pos at a moon and you want that moon... then just dec & shoot.

6/13/2013,"well, that sounds like an occasion for a new mechanic.sure, implement a timer for inactive corps. send warning eve mails, and eventually emails, that a corp has been active long enough that the name is about to be released back into the pool, and any items in the corp hangar will be deposited in the ceo's hangar in the corresponding station.are you going on deployment for two years? reserve your corp name for, say, 2 1/2 to 3 years. make it something that can be done on the eve gate, so you can update it from a laptop in afghanistan if necessary. once the reservation is up, the timer starts again. (soldiers frequently re-up for tours because they can't bear the thought that they're abandoning their teammates, so this has to be able to be done multiple times.)that should take care of 99% of cases. in the unlikely event that the departure is abrupt, say an eve player is kidnapped and resurfaces two years later to find their corp and assets gone, the petition--i should say, ""support ticket""--mechanic is probably sufficient to the task.so, require an active response and a set amount of time to reserve the name and ticker, and it should be possible to release corp names and tickers back into the available pool."

6/14/2013,"adding some kind of notification, before you jump in the system owned by faction to which you have negative standing (like when you step through the gate from a high security to a system with low security) to notify players, that the next system is a system in which you will be attacked by police, because of your negative standings with faction, owner of this space.arguments:very long ago passed the time when the empire was safe and peaceful place to live and travel between 30 jumps was considered as a far away. in today's dynamic times, such option is a necessity. once such a notice exist when you jump from high security to low security, it should be append for this case also. the danger for the pilot is the same and leads to a risk of loss your ship."
6/14/2013,do you not think that a criminal should himself take the responsibility to know where he is not welcome??? rather than asking the game to hold your hand.jint hikaru - miner / salvager / explorer / spacebum in the beginning the universe was created. this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.
6/14/2013,"standings, not sec status. as in, you've run too many caldari missions and now the gallente faction police will shoot at you.i don't see why not. i'd like an option to set the autopilot to avoid the faction entirely if possible too."
6/14/2013,"this is how i would do it, start slow. make sure the change won't upset anyone, even if its not as effective as a purge. start with player names then move on to corp names.remove the names of characters who meet the following conditions.1/ trial account only2/ account not active for more than 4 years.so the only names cleared would be trial accounts that haven't been played for 4 years. while its going to produce fewer names than a deeper purge, i bet it would free up thousands. how many trial accounts were set up and not played in eves first 6 years? once we get to removing unused corp names i would say 5 years, any corp that hasn't had a char log in for 5 years gets recycled. when someone from that corp logs in they need to pick a new name, but everything else remains."
6/14/2013,"disagreewhen ccp announced odyssey i made alt and corp with that namethey are both innactive but still my favoritelets kill inactive corps, then characters, remove inactive agents, then inactive stargates.i see many systems are not used for weeks - remove them also"
6/14/2013,"i'll see the troll above and raise him one. unused starbriidges will last forever, it is the wear and tear on the busy ones yoo need to worry about. after a certain number of cycles they will go down for maintenance.the idea of trial names being first on the block makes sense. you love your name, put a ring on it.mmike azariah ----<U+FEFF> <U+FFFD>|(<U+30C4>)/<U+FFFD>"
6/14/2013,"exactly what it says on the tin. you should be able to push a button to simply orbit a target based on your current distance from it. if you're 5369 meters away from the target, you start orbiting it at a distance of 5369 meters. also, you should be able to set ""current distance"" as the default orbit distance.in addition, a ""fall into orbit"" option would also be nice; basically, keep flying in your current direction until you're flying perpendicular to the target, at which point you begin orbiting at that distance. if you're flying away from the target, this option simply causes you to orbit at your current distance. you should be able to set this as a default orbit distance, too."
6/14/2013,"there may be an issue with high ranges, due mostly to the grid system eve runs. but i do see your point.iirc in the past i was able to set 400 as an orbit range, but had to be within 150 to do it. it's been a while so my memory may be playing tricks.i like the fall into orbit idea, but wonder if it would also be affected by the grid system.destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
6/14/2013,i think orbit distance has a hard limit anyway. 50km? if you're further than that you just orbit at maximum distance. or have the option disabled entirely.
6/14/2013,"you can currently ""orbit at current range"" via the right-click menu if you are closer than 100 km to the object. it's just not easily accessible if you're in a tense situation (combat, for example).it would be nice to have better control over options like this."
6/14/2013,"+1that would be awesome! just sit back in a ""fast"" hauler and scoop loot from a bot army mining away!!"
6/14/2013,"our proposal is to add information about the sovereignty of the solar system on main information window.example:solar system: informationeystursolar systemregion > heimatarconstelation > sveiparsecurity level > 0,9sovereignty > minmatar republic arguments:in the empire, many pilots got killed because they are not noticed, that on their way have systems from another region, where they are unwanted, because of negative faction standings.would also help in guidance and travel in systems and regions with zero security.we think that information of such importance, should be added to the primary information window, to be available with one click, not as a minor in the subsequent window."

6/15/2013,"something i noticed about the current overviews (crucible/retribution) is that there are conflicting filters that are somewhat confusing, and also lots of filters not listed in the options. for instance, i made an overview filter setting and selected all hostile npcs to show in it, selecting all categories listed of those npcs. but not a single npc ship showed at first, i had to right click every kind as i encountered them and select 'add to overview'. this is because the categories in the filter settings only included general types, like asteroid pirates, or mission pirates. but the actual pirates were set up by ship size and faction, ie. asteroid sansha battleship.so i spent two whole expansions adding ships to my overview, and am probably not done yet. i don't want to have to go through that again, so please make all options available in the settings menus, and if there are overlapping settings, setting one on or off should toggle the others it applies to, ie. setting asteroid pirates on should turn asteroid sansha battleship on."
6/15/2013,"do you have any idea of a time scale for any of this?even to state that it is intended to be done within the next year would at least give us all something to look forward to.once again, i would like to thank all those who have come up with such excellent proposals to improve the overviews."
6/15/2013,"please at least fix the refining efficiency, but it would be nice to have larger cargo bay in the medium intensive. hauling 2 million m3 of unrefined ore out of a wormhole is silly."
6/15/2013,i hope it picks up more steam.
6/15/2013,"it should, it's a good idea."
6/15/2013,"it's in the topic. cargo scanner should not show profession can loot.showing the loot makes explorers skip the majority of containers, just cherry picking the ones with pos module blueprints. this is not ""exploration"" or ""an interesting treasure hunt"". this is just spam scanning and zipping between systems. the optimal way to explore is to skip 90% of cans based on cargo scan and only do the minigame when you spot a shiny.please push the subject and make ccp nerf cargo scanner. it is simply hateful to soon assume all sites scanned by previous visitors, it's taking the element of surprise out of hacking and archaeology and it's just dull. if cargo scanner did not show the contents, exploration as profession would be much more balanced. right now a try-hard player will trump ten roleplaying haxplorers by just spam scanning instead of hacking the sites in a slow manner."
6/15/2013,"if you want another bad analogy to bring to the ccp table, ""cargo scanning profession cans is the equivalent of cargo scanning ded complex gate to see the overseer loot."""
6/15/2013,"one of the things everyone always focuses on when they talk about eve is how players shape the universe, from building empires to massive, player-driven economies.with this in mind, why don't we have stock market(s) in-game? a feature that would allow a corporation to create and sell shares in an open and transparent way, much like any item you can find on the market. it would allow individuals and groups looking to earn cash a way to invest in corporations that have ambition, but lack the funds they require.""how would you prevent scams?"", one might ask. the short answer is, ""you can't"" - there will always be front companies out there, looking to milk investors for their own profits. but i think overall, this would be a good addition to the game, bringing more forum-based deals out into the public eye for everyone to interact with.this really has been on a lot of people's bucket list for the last decade."
6/15/2013,"why is that in the launcher i can confirm my login info by hitting enter but to actually launch the game i have to grab my mouse and click a button? why can't i just enter my password and hit enter twice to launch the game. or... better yet, remove the entire useless 'launch game' button all together. surely when i enter my password and hit enter in the game launcher it means i want to play the game? why does it need double confirmation?""are you absolutely 100% certain you want to start this game?""come on ccp..."
6/15/2013,"how about no? both of those maps have various functions that require the probe/dscan/filter window to properly use which necessitates a large window to actually see/interact with the tools, there is no reason to make it a ""resizable"" window, since at any size except for ""max-screen"" it would be illegible (unless your playing on a freakin tv).the fact that you are too lazy to press a single button, that is always in the same spot, whichever spot you choose to put it (cause neocom is customizable ya know) or for heavens sake a single hotkey, doesnt mean ccp needs to make huge ui changes.its a single button, get over it."
6/15/2013,"huh. i didn't actually realize this. but yeah, explicitly i'd like to see it as a single button, or at least an option for default orbital distance. the menu just makes it kind of awkward. i don't think it updates after you've opened the menu, either, so if you're moving fast it can actually get thrown off by a bit. it's one of those things that needs actual push-button-get-thing control. at least, that's how i feel. thank you for pointing it out, though."
6/15/2013,i'll donate lp to your cause when you can make your cause not full of douchebags that make me want to gouge out my eyes.good luck.

6/16/2013,"let's not have this idea die a quiet death. we need to get the tug class into eve.keep posting your ideas and feedback so the csm has something solid to take to ccp for consideration.since i've been looking at incursions recently, i've found the logistics of moving a battleship and a logistics hull impossible to do without resorting to contracts or by using a support alt to move the required gear. there should be an easier way of moving rigged ships without resorting to the contract system. it would also greatly assist with the movement of gear if you join a new corp."
6/16/2013,some feedback from ccp would be nice.i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about.
6/16/2013,"well, i think we need new refin system on poswe want what?see pos never refine, or that it is just harder and slower?maybe reduce the cpu / powergrid to see refinery stacker would be a good idea.this does not make the rafinage ""easier"" but simply affordable because now with the ratio we have, think refine by pos is just stupid.but if we could refinent full stacker that, it would make real pos ""industrial"" of refine.idk, can we have the dev device?"
6/16/2013,i agree. ban isboxer. it is an artificial effect on gameplay which brings no benefit to the playerbase at large and discourages cooperation and interaction between players.
6/16/2013,devs have said for a long time that afk cloaking is not good gameplay. maybe someday they'll do something about it.
6/16/2013,option b agreed... bump
6/16/2013,"this idea has been suggested before. numerous times.in spite of this, it has never been implemented.this is dumb.so i'll throw in my support."
6/16/2013,"well, at least before you used to be able to just restart your client and reselect a character. this behaviour is gone and now i have to shut down the client, and open the launcher again, etc...an option that would close the client and just put a new client back up on character selection would be awesome."
6/16/2013,so i was going through the tutorial on combat and i pulled up the angular velocity i think.i noted that if you are going to fast your gun can't track the target.so then i adjusted so that my guns could track and found myself staring at the numbers for almost the whole fight.which got me thinking about a color change if your guns can't track.i think it would be cool if you could set up your overview to change colors of your target if your guns can't track them.it could be something as simple as a client side option.type in the number you don't want to exceed and if it does change the color of the target.***** modified *****as others have pointed out perhaps a better option would be a colored ring around each turret.or just a dot or light.for guns it could depict angular velocity and for missiles it could depict range.that way can see at a glance if what you are shooting at is in range or missing.green for in range or your guns can track the target and red for out of range.you could even add in a yellow for marginal.if you want more info you can use the overview.
6/16/2013,"dislike. don't dumb the game down, people should learn how to read the numbers."
6/16/2013,today i lost alot of isk because i canceled a order that i made by mistake. if you modify an order then you get the brokers fee back but you dont when you cancel it. i can understand the brokers fee if you sell the item you have on the marked but not if you cancel it. then you should get the fee back.i think you should have a look at the brokers fee since in this way its just another isk sink that dont make any sence.best regards dragunov skywolf
6/16/2013,"totally agree, was just thinking this today."
6/16/2013,"exactly... and as for expensive assets. i have very little and would usually just jump onto my alts anyway. although occasionally i do like to head out into lowsec and nullsec for a ""break"" but it's rare."
6/16/2013,"great idea.i would add some type of shielding native to the ship, say radiation.similar to the missions that give environmental damage.fly a rifter into one of these rings and it could go pop pretty quick.instead of the charters, i think that a faction or concord standing would be required.not sure of the 10 drones. i can see the 5, of course.alternately, you could create an asteroid tractor beam.have a drone tag the rock and tractor it in.that would be competitive just like salvaging."
6/16/2013,interesting idea but i think it should be handled a different way. the current mining mechanic is being messed with in ice mining now which means that the ore side of it will be also tweaked soon enough. ccp can never leave things alone. always have to nerf things for the sake of new ideas seems to always be the ccp idea of the day.perhaps using your idea with a pos mechanic would be a better reason to do it. not to have it as an individual level item but something that should be at the corp level and does not have to be done at the alliance level. something that requires teamwork.
6/16/2013,"why so hostile ?a large tv doesn't add resolution by the way, in most cases you lose resolution using a tv.what makes you think that changing over the maps screen to a window is a huge ui change ?perhaps it is something fairly simple that they just haven't got around to changing yet.all i am asking is for the csm to bring up the question, apparently ccp have been updating the rest of the ui and i wanted them to add this to the list if possible.button placement shouldn't really change on a conversion to a window.what will change for those that choose to use one account and multiple screens is the ability to move that map off to one side.everything else about eve that i have seen so far is that you can have multiple windows open and can do lots of things at the same time.right up to the point of trying to probe or look at the map. then you are stuck with just that screen, it doesn't make any sense."
6/16/2013,"i would make that 1 year for trial accounts personally. if someone hasn't logged in to their trial account for more than a year then too damn bad. this isn't about being nice it's about meting out some fairness. a trial is a free thing to activate and is designed for people to get a feel for the game. if they haven't logged in their trial toon for a year then chances are it was either an alt or the game failed to captivate that player.i didn't activate my trial character for 2 years after his creation date and to be honest that if my toon had been blasted i might have been better off - i had totally forgotten how to play the game, redoing the tutorials would have saved me a lot of time and heartache. whether or not i would have been able to get this name back is kind of irrelevant, who actually remembers some trial account from 2 years ago?"

6/17/2013,"in the beginning, for those that have been around long enough, the only way to live out in null was out of a pos. i have lived in deep null before (i.e. 50 jumps from anywhere) and refined using poss. it wasn't fun then and certainly isn't fun now.then along came outpost building and poss were completely forgotten about for the most part.yes, we want the whole refining array(s) updated. are there many ways to do it? yes.why don't we refine from a pos?1. there is always an outpost nearby (in null)2. refining loses 25% off the top.3. we have the rorqual to compress raw ore to transport.4. poss have never been near the top of the dev love listthere are many things that need to be updated on pos refining. my op lists a few updates to what 'might' be possible.if you want to make it really better, then completely remove the time & refining loss caps (e.g. make it instant & skill/standing based) - just like it is everywhere else. leave a pg/cpu req since it is a pos mod that has to be onlined, just like the manufacturing modules are now.hrolt ceo live free; die proud"

6/17/2013,"because of this thread, i went and got isboxer to play with it ... or rented it, for a better, word cause its subscription based.seriously. if you can set up the sucker to manage 10 accounts, the level of work involved is still a lot.i have seen on youtube players running 6+ battleships to do missions, but it still means they are paying 6x as much plex, and yes, i can understand making isk faster, but six times faster? if you can do that amount of work, pretty sure you deserve the results.right now, one dedicated exploration toon running null sites should make more isk/hour then someone isboxing anoms, at least when you have to plex all the accounts to keep em running."

6/17/2013,"because your ship is composed of mechanical and electronic components that are designed to work and thinking for you. the autopilot is part of the ai of your ship, set to replace the pilot when needed.once the autopilot can distinguish systems with high security and low security and inform you for them, why can not to make it for the sovereignty of the system and to whom it belongs, provided that in both cases it is a one and same game mechanics.frankly i doubt that, when you setup your autopilot to travel from jita to amarr, you use social networks or ""through the myriad of other tools (in-game and out)"".and again thick underline:we are talking about improving the performance of a ai component of your star ship, not for the player skills and intelligent. <U+FFFD>welcome i am aura, your electronic assistant<U+FFFD><U+FFFD>"
6/17/2013,so you're basically asking for ccp to implement a bot to do your playing for you while you're afk. no.
6/17/2013,it is not dumbing down the game if the player has to input the threshold.it is simply a visual que nothing more.at the very least it will make people aware.
6/17/2013,learn to add transversal to your overview like everybody else.
6/17/2013,"huh... that is why i posted to begin with......i found the the way the game depicts transverse rather inefficient, and thought that having a color change change of the very same numbers would help rather then staring at a decimal point for the entire fight.i am beginning to understand why people call this game spreadsheets online.it is not that the game has lots of number crunching but that the players actually enjoy looking at them instead of the ships."
6/17/2013,"you're not entirely correct. this idea of displaying combat relevant information outside the overview in an easily accessable and visual way isn't a new one. it has been requested before and most players would propably welcome such changes, since it would involve looking at the main view screen, instead of staring at numbers in the overview the entire fight. there is just a section of the playerbase, that defends the old way of doing things no matter how bad or stupid that way actually is, so don't get discouraged by it. just make your case the best you can, address any constructive criticisms and hope your idea gets added to ccp's things-to-do list."
6/17/2013,"the changes to industry and exploration that came with odyssey were good in many ways. null sec now has much more industrial capacity. although we have yet to see a significant increase in the activities that capacity can support. industrialists have been given more means to function in null sec, but have yet to be given a motive to move. these players will no be forced out of high sec, they need to see something that makes them want to go, despite the added risk. many will never leave high sec, but the bigger that incentive is the more will go. even weeks after odyssey i still have not seen any justification for the move from gav sites to anomalies. why? it just does not make sense. let us consider some points. - there will now be more targets for ganker, as everyone knows ganker prefer targeting players that can not shoot back like miners. now all those miners hiding in the grav sites will be sitting duck targets for gankers. no there will not. the miners that were sitting in those hidden belts before were only there because they could mitigate the risk. they were only vulnerable to ships with probe launchers, or cunning gankers that would set up traps. as both of those are rather rare, the risk level was acceptable. now that the tools to mitigate that risk have been taken away, those miners that were hard to find before will not even be there now. they will not be sitting ducks, just waiting for a ganker to stumble upon them like a rat in a belt. they will move to somewhere that they do not have to rely on luck for survival. - players who never bothered with exploration before now have a mechanic drawing attention to it. exploration will become much more common. yes this is true. odyssey will encourage many who have never tried exploration before to give it a try. but what does this have to do with grav sites? changing grav sites to anomalies does nothing to improve this. moving ice fields to anomalies was a nice change, they were static belts before, not grav sites, this would have made them slightly harder to find for those that do not know how to activate their ship scanner. however considering that is automated now, ice fields are basically exactly the same effort to find as they were before. you just click on the list of scanned sited rather than the overview. not a big deal at all, but a step towards eliminating the over view entirely, which i understand is a goal eventually. however why include grav sites in this? it would have made sense to move all static belts to anomalies to get them off the overview, but grav sites and static belts are very different things. while this was a good change for ice belts, it was very bad for grav sites. why eliminate grav sites? make all the static belts aonamlies like the ice fields, but leave the grav sites as they were. grav sites offered improved isk/hr to the miners over the static belts available in the same system, but at the cost of being harder to find. you needed the skills and equipment to finbd them to get that improved isk/hr. now they are as easy to find as static belts. - imbalance #1. grav sites offered increased income for those willing to put in the extra effort. now they are available to anyone via the new active scanner. why? is that not what static belts are for? if this is the way the game is heading then just remove all static belts and add more ore anomalies and all mining can be done in anomalies. it makes no sense to offer the higher value belts at zero effort required to find them. - imbalance #2 grav sites outside of high sec offered a extra layer of security, considering that mining ships are sitting ducks with no way of defending themselves they need all the protection they can get when operating in dangerous space. with the protection of the grav sites mining ships were only really threatened by other ships with the means to scan them down. through the use of d-scan you would see the probes and have plenty of notice to warp to safety before the potential gankers arived. provided you were paying attention, not semi afk. to some this seemed to be excessively safe, yet mining in these sites in low sec and npc null sec was still very uncommon. why? while the threat to miners is not just while they are mining, they are slow travellers, and they still nedd to get the ore to a station once it is mined. low sec and npc null sec where still to dangerous to be worth the risk even with that added safety of the grav sites. yet this layer of safety was removed, making mining even more dangerous in these area's than before. now any ship can see the ore anomaly within seconds of jumping into the system, and the miner will not get any warning on d-scan via scanning probes that there is an incoming threat. where a miner could once mine with the only real threat being hostile probers, now every ship that jumps into the system is an immediate threat. this is not a slight increase in risk, but an astronomical increase in risk, to an activity that was already such a high risk almost nobody did it. - imbalance #3 mining deep inside alliance territory has always been fairly safe. with good intel channels you know about gankers while they are several jumps out. you rarely see a neutral let alone a hostile in the system you are mining in. and there are always roaming defense fleets in the area that will jump on any incoming ganker fleet before they get to the miners. the added level of safety provided by the grav site was not really needed here, but was still nice to have. yet even in these systems where mining seems to be even safer than in high sec, many of the miners have been on the forums complaining about cloaked campers disrupting operations. a single cloaked frigate could render all that safety void. so the risks here is still high. removing a layer of safety here makes the situation worse. - imbalance #4"
6/17/2013,"with all the great changes to odyssey this change of grav sites to anomalies has done nothing but remove content for many players. i consider myself a freelance miner/industrialist in eve. i am not affiliated will any null sec alliance or power block. i did spend over 2 years in sov null. however i did not appreciate having someone else dictate to me how to spend by limited play time in eve. it seemed every time in logged in there was some sort of cta or defense fleet that was mandatory anyone online join. when there was a mining op all ore was expected to be given to the alliance coffers. i know not all null sec alliances are like this, but try doing your own thing during a cta and see happens. cta's are a necessary evil in sov null. the space you enjoy playing in needs to be defended. if you do not help with the defense then you can gtfo. i have no issue with that. it is as it should be. my problem is why should i be forced into a large alliance in order to enjoy soloable content. up until odyssey null sec mining was possible for me to do. it was a high risk activity, but i made more isk/hr than in high sec, and i enjoyed the extra risk and challenge. but i was very dependent on the safety of hidden grav sites to make that possible. there was almost always neuts in the systems i mined in, i was not in secured sov space. but i could do it, and it was fun for me. for me and other like me odyssey dispite its great other features was not an expansion for me, it was removal of content. i get the vision of moving to anomalies, i think the move of ice belts to anomalies was great. the reduction of ice supply is a different matter entirely. but the move to anomalies was nice. i would have been happy if all static belts were moved to anomalies. even the static grav sites spawned by upgraded sov could have been moved to anomalies. many null sec players insist this change does not really affect them due to other tools they have for protection. but why remove grav sites completely? why remove existing content? at least leave the randomly spawned grav sites as they were, or add new ones. my proposal is not to change what has been done. but only to restore the random grav sites. even just to low sec and npc null. these areas need some feature to attract miners that no other system has. give them good concentrations of high end null sec ores. mining is just not done in these systems, while it will go on relatively unchanged in sov null and high sec. give us mining content for these more dangerous area's. give us back some new grav sites, with ore compositions that will make them worth the effort to scan down, and worth the risk to go into low sec and npc null to mine them. these are the most dangerous area's of eve for industrial players. make it worth the effort to operate there."

6/18/2013,"i support the op on this issue because it is sorely being abused. after 10 years of playing this game off and on not once did i receive a bounty until last week.are those who have bounties bad players? no, i never assumed that. i have always had a ""live and let live"" policy towards other playstyles. it is only natural though that others should respect other playstyles as well, otherwise the game ceases to be a sandbox. i say that because a sandbox allows for all styles, not only one. themeparks do that bs.i have a positive security status and am not even a combat pilot, yet i receieved bounties for defending other players in chat who were being trolled by a group of players that were clearly getting their kicks at the expense of others and instigating arguments. of course it's against the rules to name names so i will leave it at that. the main point is, unless a person has a negative security status and has been flagged by a corp as a criminal (feature that should be added if a former corp member commits a crime) then it should not be so easy to harass non-combat pilots without cause or mere words in chat with bounties."
6/18/2013,"so a sandbox is only a sandbox, when it follows your rules? sorry, but no. it means even though you are able to use whatever mechanics the game gives you to succeed, then others can use the same or other mechanics of the game, to try and thwart you. the game only ceases to be a sandbox, when you place the restriction on it that you ask for. then it would become a theme park.how exactly does placing a bounty on you, abuse the ? what relevance does your sec status have, to the placement of that bounty?also how does you having a bounty, constitute harassment? does it now mean you cannot undock? does it suddenly stop you using the market, or mine or whatever you do within eve?eve is pvp centric. if you understood this, then you would see why all players should be open to a bounty placement. i can certainly see why you got one.destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."

6/19/2013,"and what if a ship is using a split weapon system? or enemy traversal is still at a point where hitting is possible, but very unlikely?if i am using both guns and missiles, which one is used to determine my ability to hit? what if they are a a very low transversal, but at a range where the guns are unable to hit properly? would such a system apply to a droneboat, and if so would transversal be calculated by the position of the ship or the released drones, if the latter how do we display that?the problems in implementing this are significant. while a simple ""green if enemy angular velocity > tracking of single weapon system"" might be possible, it would be a rather halfassed way to go about it when so many other factors go into calculating ability to hit.tldr: barring some very low priority unified ui system to better show and compare all stats of an enemy moving vessel to your currently fitted weapon systems suddenly appearing from nowhere, i think you are out of luck.that and ability to eyeball the movement of an enemy is an important skill to learn manually, especially for pvp, when you may not have time for a lot of paying attention to the overview."
6/19/2013,"as you say and i said the overview is not the best way to see things, hense my post.i did modify my original post to account for different guns or missiles.i have no idea what you are talking about for drones, so far all i have had to do with those is tell them who to shoot or just take a shot at something and they go there merry way.as far as gun range that is the first thing i had to look at.i didn't start worrying about tracking until i started the whole orbit of death thing.if someone can stay out of range it doesn't really matter about tracking and range is depicited all over the place so i am not sure what you are talking about there."

6/19/2013,"as a long term null sec miner i agree with all of this. the fact that a ganker enters a system and can warp to the site in less time than it takes an orca to get up to speed and warp out, makes mining in grav sites more dangerous than belt mining. i agree with all the other changes that have taken place, the fact that we can now get enough trit to actually build cap ships without importing massive amounts is a wonder."

6/20/2013,i think the complain here is not that we not get enough money out of exploration (which is the case since odyssey but ok i will get over it...somhow..) the problem is that we cant get all containers and that it feels realy realy bad to loose those containers that u just wone from the mini game. to make it feel better they could just reduce the number of containers so that u could grap them all of cause that would destroy the 2 person exploring idea but in the end exploration was always a solo activity and ccp should not make the solo expirience feel bad just because they want to make it a coop activity they should find a way to make it fun for both options.
6/20/2013,how much would the price of carbon have to increase for it to be worth grabbing?
6/20/2013,"yes and no, if all the loot was worth something, then yes but currently the loot is ~80% low value salvage. if i only get half the containers and a 8 mil decryptor goes 'poof', what happens to the seeding algorithm? does it add it to the next container to keep the average value the same or re-seed it in a another place? with option 'a' where it is gone, the value of that item may well increase. many would stockpile, then crack the core but not loot, driving up the prices.with option 'b' whee it is re-seeded elsewhere, you will have a whole constellation / region of people beating the hacking game and not scooping any loot to force it all into one system because it must drop to keep it's value the same.i really hope the drop rates are not in anyway determined by the 'market value' in-game. that would be too easy to price fix.there are better ways to make exploration a co-op activity. - 2 normal cans and a dual can that needs to be hacked by two people- time out on the hack module so you need to wait 3-5 mutes to start again ( so you take turns )- system cores that cannot be cracked with one player alonethen again, who wouldn't fly the 'power of two' anyways?"

6/20/2013,"i am proposing that ccp changes the way corp mails are setup now and request that they return to the way it was done a few years back. in so much as, when a new player joins the corp, they will receive the corp posts previously sent after a short waiting period.i will detail a short scenario below: after having some success in recruiting a couple of ""noob"" members, i sent out a few corp mails with details and handy hints on how things work in eve, which is helpful for a char who is a few hours/days/weeks in to the game.i was then lucky enough to recruit another few new members a few days later but found that they were not receiving the mails i previously sent out and therefore had to re-send each new player all the information individually or i resend the previous mails to everyone whenever a new member joins the corp.previously with the eve corp mail system a new member within a corporation would automatically receive all corp mails after a short waiting period. for me this would seem an ideal situation for getting information to each corp member efficiently.many people would argue that all this will do is create a massive backlog of mails which are unnecessary and in the most part i would agree, who wants to see a dozen ""wat"" or ""lolz"" clogging up the mailing system if the corp ceo/director's are too lazy to delete the spam.to mitigate this a also recommend a system were the ceo/directors can ""lock"" the mails they wish to keep and after a defined period of time (say 7 days) all the non-locked mails will be deleted. as a ceo of a corporation, i would find this solution to be a much more efficient way to disseminate information to my members without having to worry to much about deleting all the spam."

6/21/2013,"there are a few issues with shares that need to be addressed. obviously the existing system is 'broken' in a number of ways but some groups are using it to lock down bpos. either a new set of shares needs to be created, or the old system needs to go away. my choice would be remove the old system and change bpo lock down as part of a general overhaul of corp roles and associated permissions.what features should these stocks have?we should be able to pay and collect dividends.there needs to be a way to do forced buy backs, or perhaps shares have a specific duration from the initial offering at which time they are all forced buy back (this makes shares some what bond like) or simply expire.it would be nice if the market interface for stocks was not region specific.they should show some historical data, price history (our familiar market chart), dividend history, top 10 share holders, how widely held (how many different players own shares in this corp), number of shares outstanding, total number of shares.are all these features needed? no, but they would be nice. and if they are not considered at the initial design, they may never get implemented.my best guess is, we won't see a stock market until we see corp roles redone."

6/21/2013,"just my two cents here.i would strongly oppose any meddling with wh mass limitations. that is one characteristic that makes wh-space unique.given the latest changes since summer 2012, players can see that eve is changing from a very complex and skill intense game to a game where one can do a lot more things at the beginning without the need to specialize in a certain trade.the fun of gaming is suffering from that. eve does not need more of the occasional wow/wot.. players. it needs people who continously play that game. there the game mechanics need to stay balanced.unfortunately, ccp has no clue at all how balancing game mechanics works. the changes they implement are way to big. metaphorically, balancing by ccp is done with a slegdhammer instead of a clockworker's screwdriver0.0 space is fine as long as a resident will be able to go ratting, pi ing and so on. people in 0.0 can ""easily"" make billions within days!!!! (no, not rat botting, just a few anos and pronto).so, 0.0 residents were always rich enough to afford jfs to get their stuff to jita and come back with other needful things, especially tritanium.now, with ore content changes, even that might change. why? 0.0. had already had the best income abilities?because some csms have strong interests in making 0.0 even more attractive.whs are sometimes used by 0.0 corps/alliances to ship stuff into hisec what a perversion if wh entries could be intentionally manipulated and perpetualized by players.if that changed, wh space would become a 0.0 appendix no thanks!and yes +1 for this petition!pos need a revamp, surely access management and individual storage possibilities.but, as we all have our experiences with ccp, any change that will get eve closer to wow is going to happen sooner or later.unfortunately, ccp do not realize that wow is dying and therefore cannot not seriously be a role model to be copied"

6/22/2013,"i find totally shameful a real eve player defending this ""augmented"" type of gameplay.its really sad"
6/22/2013,"what's more shameful, is people posting with obviously no idea on the subject they talk about. then proceed to berate players based on this poor knowledge. that is sad.let's be clear here. a plex cannot exist without being created with rl monies. this means ccp get money for every plex used. isboxer does not automate, it duplicates. you do not gain items at a more accelerated rate with isboxer, than you would do under normal game play. if you go afk at any time whilst doing anything with isboxer, you stop doing it in the game at the same time you would without it installed. destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
6/22/2013,"yes let's be clear."" a plex cannot exist without being created with rl monies. this means ccp get money for every plex used.""from the person that actually paid for it !"" isboxer does not automate, it duplicates. ""duplication or replication is still an ""augmented"" type of gameplay and totally shameful for a real eve player to defend it !"" you do not gain items at a more accelerated rate with isboxer, than you would do under normal game play. ""yes, you do !"" if you go afk at any time whilst doing anything with isboxer, you stop doing it in the game at the same time you would without it installed. ""it doesn't matter if you go afk or not, its still gives you an unfair advantage against the players that don't use it !but you are right, what's more shameful, is people posting with obviously no idea on the subject they talk about."
6/22/2013,"what relevance does it have, regarding who paid for the plex? the whole point of the plex system, is so it's trade-able with in-game currency. the whole point is ccp gets paid. they may have traded isk for it, but that still didn't come for free.i'm have a feeling you think the minerals you mine yourself, are also free. here's a clue, they are not.it's duplication, which is already a part of the eve ui. why shouldn't i defend it? please show me proof, that you gain items at a more accelerated rate than normal game play. i'm sure ccp would also like to see this.of course it's relevant regarding going afk. you claim this is automation. if indeed it was, then it would continue to work after. it's not automation, hence why it stops. they have to be at the pc, in order for it to work. that's the only way they gain items and that's why it's fair in my book and ccp's. i am right, it is shameful some not having a clue. they like to include emotions and feelings, as well as talk of rmt and bots. it's all rather sad.destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
6/22/2013,"ellen:1) make a different thread if you have a problem with plex.2) it is not augmented and you are ""shameful"" for harassing anyone with an opinion not your own.3) prove it. for fcuks sake. please prove to me and everyone here that isoboxer lets you gain at an augmented rate. i would love to see you prove this with facts... you know maybe you even trying to use isoboxer and realizing it is nothing you make it out to be.4) prove it, because anyone who has actually used isoboxer knows you are full of it.5) the winner, ""but you are right, what's more shameful, is people posting with obviously no idea on the subject they talk about."" nice, i'll take 5 as you admitting defeat since you are the one here posting without logic, facts, or any legitimate information. you argue only on misinformed opinions and are too stubborn to actually commit yourself to a second of research on an issue.take a look here, maybe this will help you. for now, you are just terrible."
6/22/2013,"""what relevance does it have, regarding who paid for the plex?"" -it's very relevant, if no player spent rl money on plex, ccp would not receive money from this system nor players would be able to buy the plex with ingame isk.""they may have traded isk for it, but that still didn't come for free.i'm have a feeling you think the minerals you mine yourself, are also free. here's a clue, they are not.""-actually, they are. like shooting npcs, mining creates a value out from the environment to that player. in both cases the player spent time in those activities, but it was his time, ccp didn't receive any real money from that player if he paid the plex with ingame isk. ""it's duplication, which is already a part of the eve ui.""-its absolutely not part of the eve ui to duplicate commands to other game clients !""why shouldn't i defend it?""-i have no idea whatsoever why anyone should defend such ""augmented"" type of gameplay. ""please show me proof, that you gain items at a more accelerated rate than normal game play. i'm sure ccp would also like to see this.""-by automatically synchronizing the fire trough multiple clients a isboxer is more efficient than any human fleet, and that's exactly the point for using this program, otherwise no one would use it. ""they have to be at the pc, in order for it to work."" -it doesn't matter if you go afk or not, its still gives you an unfair advantage against the players that don't use it."
6/22/2013,"i'm not even sure you know what you are arguing about now, regarding the plex. they use a plex, ccp gets money. the more plexes that are used, the more money ccp gets. it's that simple. it's completely irrelevant who first buys the plex, it still gets used and ccp still get paid.no they are not free. isk and mineral have a cost. everything in eve has a cost. i'm not simply referring to rl monies, but it's a cost all the same.as far as if he paid with a plex is concerned, ccp got paid for that plex. a plex cannot exist without ccp getting rl money for it. end of.oh and minerals are not an isk faucet.i didn't say other clients, i said duplication is a part of the eve ui.that's because you simply have no idea.but efficiency isn't acceleration, it's simply efficiency. a single account pvp group that is efficient at pvp, still uses normal game play to gain things. not accelerated, simply more efficiently gained.you do know what accelerated means in this context, don't you?oh and it's duplication, not automation.it does matter regarding going afk, because you claim automation. the fact everything stops, pours scorn on your claim.destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."

6/23/2013,"they view it a lot more than you see them respond. if you ask for a blue response to a valid question, there is a good chance you'll get one."
6/23/2013,"ok this seems like a totally superficial or inconsequential request, but i really think it has some merit. i also think it is very easy to implement, thus not taking a lot of development time out of more important things. right now, all ships that are previewed via the info picture are shown in a bland caldari star background, regardless of race, origin or lore. moreover, the way lighting is currently applied in conjunction with the dark top and bottom background leaves parts of the ships too dark for previewing at many angles. my suggestion is to improve upon the previewing feature by adding different backgrounds when spinning a ship according to their race/origin (like the static pictures they have). moreover, if the lighting source stays fixed on the camera center and the background is devoid of completely black regions, all parts of any ship would be readily visible from all angles. one might think that such a change would serve no purpose at all other than a graphical no-content tidbit, but i really believe that it can help young players to get more excited in the game, and it would also provide a mild but measurable incentive for players to train and strive for more ship hulls. i think that the fact a past removal of hangar ship spinning resulted in a lot of rage strengthens my argument. thank you for your time. c:"

6/23/2013,the ossogur gate in amamake is a constellation gate from hed to ortner. after the odyssey expansion on june 4th the jump range on this gate has increased by over 50%. it's not even a regional gate. the jump range is literally 35km from the center of the gate. no confirmation yet on if this is a bug or intentional feature but it would be please reduce it back to the original jump range. don't buff the carebears. they need a reason to be afraid of lowsec.

6/24/2013,definitely think this is a great idea! i just started playing again and have to characters on the same account. having to completely quit out of the game and then relaunch it is quite vexxing.
6/24/2013,"i have been thinking a lot about this and want to see some more input. i am glad to see at least one member of the csm is on board. i had an idea in line with what ccp did with the ice belts but modified. systems with a large amount of current belts would contain the largest ore ring placed appropriately for the solar system, between a larger planet orbit and the sun or beyond the most distant orbital body such as our own solar system belt here.systems with little to no belts would scale accordingly.for example i remember when i was a young rookie and starting to figure out how to mine and warp to different belts was interesting but lost its allure once i discovered that belts could be , or where depleted even before i got there. for rookie systems i feel this would benefit new players, in both terms of mechanics and social. i have often spent time in new pilots systems to find that there are a half dozen or so pilots spread out in every belt that hasn't been depleted. i feel that this detracts from their initial experience. especially if they choose to go down the industrial path. and having them all in one could also push them into the realm of pvp.thoughts?"
6/24/2013,supported.
6/24/2013,"not supported.there are many more pressing, worthwhile and frankly more interesting calls on time and resources than this."
6/24/2013,"i fully agree, yet a change like this does not require any meaningful amount of time or/and resources. the starscapes are already there, you just have to assign a background id to each ship when the preview screen loads. or even better, assign a background according to the maincolor db attribute so that you dont have to make db entries for any ship."
6/24/2013,"these do not effect your raw standings which is the stat i believe fw membership is based on. as i recall (although i maybe wrong) they were put in place mainly to allow quicker access to higher level agents and to make it possible to access hostile faction space and do business even with a very low standing level.afraid you'll just have to do what everyone else does in your situation and grind missions to repair your standings, or just go pirate. i found the change very liberating as you don't need to care about standings, sec status or lack of targets."
6/24/2013,"dearest ccp maybe it would be great idea to add a ship it's history of use .to know who was his manufacturer ,where it was built .and it series number .maybe it would be great if we can see who used it before. i think eve need more logs ."
6/24/2013,why?if different manufacturers produced different quality hulls or if you had to service and maintain your hulls as an owner i could see a point in this. as neither of these cases apply i see no point in wasting resources and effort on this.

6/25/2013,"why?odyssey made 'pvp' in highsec easier not harder. so much so that i have known whole alliances to play more world of warcraft since odyssey than eve - because ccp essentially destroyed their nullsec gameplay then dumbed down highsec pvp at the same time to utterly favor players in greifer corps.that is a spectacular own goal.as for the 'tears must flow' ... no. what we see is a massive design effort from ccp to try to increase the playerbase, but dumb decisions like making ore sites instant appear to everyone rather than having to be scanned down, combined with a total inability to use nullsec pvp defences like bounce bubbles and ecm burst in highsec, making 'pvp' dead easy in highsec. 1. war deck everyone you see mining ice or good ores.2. use a neutral scout to warp to ice belts, ore belts to check for targets.3. jump in instant warp to target.4. kill target (you can warp an interceptor to them faster than they can go to warp, unless they use a bot - i.e. the anti bot changes have now favored botters and cheats) 5. repeat, no scanning *ever* required now.that's not pvp, that's slaughtering highsec players. and guess what, they get upset then they leave the game. been seeing it this past couple of weeks all over the place.can i have your stuff? sure, it won't help you anyway - unless you have capitals you are now irrelevant in eve in nullsec, and if you play in highsec it is only a matter of time until you are greifed out of the game. that is why eve is continuing to underperform in player retention - the changes made to 'make exploration easier' have really only aided the veteran greifers who didn't need any more help anyway.go look at the rise and fall of darkfall 1.0. the wolf will always devour all the sheep in a game like this one - that ccp spends millions getting more sheep does not mean eve will live forever. only that ccp is on borrowed time, because the game that gives the sheep the equivalent gameplay but with the security they long for will steal most of their paying customers. without carebears, there is no-one buying plex to sell to you. nullsec empires don't pay their subs with real cash, after all - that is what moon goo is for - but ccp can't pay their staff with moon goo. so guess what - either ccp needs to make more radical changes dumbing down the game yet again, or they need to watch their game slowly but surely lose market share.so don't attack me for proposing that the real issue ccp faces for nullsec is the crap map and bad resource distribution. drone reigons are a pathetic joke, and space is infinite so should not have jump route choke points the way it does currently. fix the map, improve protection for independent alliances holding sov in nullsec, or watch the game slowly but surely lose to the imitators who seek to topple eve from dominance in the space empire game niche."

6/25/2013,i have emboldened and underlined the relevant keywords (note that neither of the words refer to anything more than your relationship with a single person).now get the **** out.
6/25/2013,"three points: 1.) when a corp wishes to join fw, they need to have corp standings above some threshold in order to join. the corps standings are based on the average standings of all members (that actually have standings) to the npc corp. diplomacy and connections do not matter in these cases. i would assume, when joining the fw npc corp, it too, also uses your base standings, and not your skill-modified standings. 2.) access to agents use modified standings. this is the primary purpose of the diplomacy and connections skill, as it allows you to access level 2-4 agents more quickly, which are more lucrative for many reasons. this is why malcanis is somewhat right... higher standings == higher agents == greater mission and lp rewards. 3.) the social skill, which gives a ""5% bonus per level to npc agent, corporation and faction standing increase"" is what you need to train, and then you need to go run some missions for the empire you wish to join. realize, you only get faction standing increases from storyline missions, and you have to run 16 regular missions to get 1 storyline mission. also, newbie career agents give out a single-offer series of missions that act as a storyline mission and boost faction standings, too."
6/25/2013,"nb: if you don't want to run the epic arc missions--which are buggy, and often very hard, but which yield massive faction standing increases, but you can only run them once per character--then run distribution missions for an agent of the faction you want to build standings for. the payouts are crap, but the missions are really fast and you can accept several at once with a moderately sized hauler, which means that you get storyline missions at a really fast clip if you plan it well--and a fast clip even if you don't. also, you get to know a small part of space like the back of your hand."

6/26/2013,"first of all, thanks for liking the idea to add the quick filter box.now, i have to say that i completely - totally - absolutely disagree with your point of view when you say that ""eve is not about easiness"". well, in fact, you are right, it's unfortunately how it currently is. and i think that's a problem. eve shouldn't be only aimed at hardcore 4x pro gamers. the number of eve players could even increase if the game was more accessible to the majority of people. it makes no sense to keep a feature in the game that frustrates players (and i think the overview is one of them).of course you can customize the overview, using the 5 available tabs, etc.. but frankly setting it up is a nightmare.the more user-friendlyness ccp devs will add to the game (i am not saying ccp should add wizards or automation systems to play instead of players), the more players will enjoy their daily dip in the eve universe.frustration = no fun = players unhappyuser-friendly uis = actions quickly executed = faster reactions during battles = players happy"
6/26/2013,"i think eve must remain an island (pun was not intended ) in mmo gaming which would be oriented mostly to dedicated players and by all means avoid casualization. it's much more interesting to play with/against mature (25-60 y.o.) space sci-fi fans, instead of youngsters.i can't approve lowering of 'entry barrier'. eve can be improved by making it more comfortable but avoiding casualization has highest possible priority.i think it should be done this way: if you simplify something or make more comfortable - be certain to add some complexity to the same area and deepen it.quick growth of popularity means even more quick increase of average stupidity.as it was said by some wise man, to improve yourself you need to play against stronger opponents.you - on the contrary - want to invite weaker players, that will make you degrade as well.if overview settings and filters frustrate you it means you haven't mastered it decently. i have nothing against current overview, only against its lags.not at all. you really do it once. and while you do it you improve your understanding of game mechanics in general. after that 1st manual setup you just improve and polish it from time to time, until it reaches some optimal state which covers all your needs.quantity kills quality. especially when you try to increase quantity too quickly. eve still has the potential to gain more players without loss of quality and depth, but it's a relatively slow process which needs a lot more content and diversity (like multi-genre development)."
6/26/2013,your analogy involving the hammer is incorrect. the reason is because anything and everything these days has warning labels on them stating specifically as to how you are to use or not use the item to avoid lawsuit. i was also told by gm morticia that the current uses of the is not overly liked. so i would not automatically assume ccp agrees with the common abuse of the just because they added flexibility to it.
6/26/2013,"so...some guy kills me in 0.0, why should i not be able to bounty him? there's no crime there, no killrights, no sec loss, nothing.some guys pop out of a wh and camp my miner alt into a station. why should she not be able to bounty them?an afk cloaker lurks around my alliance's space, why should i not be able to bounty him?a bunch of guys in bombers camp a jump bridge. why should i not be able to bounty them?someone from a blue corp posts awful smack in local, why should i not be able to bounty him?someone makes terrible, terrible suggestions on the forum, why should i not be able to bounty him?"
6/26/2013,"but that's to stop you from suing the hammer maker, not to make you use the hammer in approved ways at the risk of being sued.do you think corp thieves should be eligible to have bounties placed on them? what mechanism do you suggest that qwould allow a thief to be bountied that wouldn't expose every corp ceo and director to being bountied for their normal operations?"

6/27/2013,"a lot of people seem to fall into the trap of thinking that providing ease of access is a slippery slope to making gameplay easier. it's not. fact of the matter is that no matter how much ease of access you add, the only way to make scrubs play better in comparison to vets is to remove gameplay options and force everyone into a smaller range of gameplay styles. anything that increases the options players have will invariably work to the net gameplay advantage of expert and veteran players. and anything that does not affect the options but makes them more accessible will generally draw more players with less skill, making the skill of the veterans and experts more apparent in comparison.world of warcraft is a testament to this trend, and has demonstrated exactly what will happen when you remove gamplay options as well as what will happen when you make everything more accessible. when at first they made gameplay more accessible, it brought in a wealth of scrubs, but the vets and experts remained solidly on top--the gap between the bottom and the top increased. but when blizzard took away gameplay options, the gap between the top and the bottom grew steadily smaller.i bring this up because i believe it is relevant to this discussion. more overview options that do not add info, but help to sort the info you already have and make it easier to process, are a good thing. do not confuse this with things that add info to the overview that's not supposed to be there. no matter how clear it is what everyone's ship type is at a glance, you will never be able to tell what someone's fit is (beyond an educated guess) without using a ship scanner."
6/27/2013,"i don't care about staying on top or in the middle or wherever.i do care about average skill and intellect of players. you've read my previous post inattentively. stronger opponents - more interesting opponents. noobs can become strong if you don't lower entrance barrier and don't dumb down the game, but if you do lower it newly-coming average players will be weaker and more stupid than current average players.if you still don't understand what i mean, imagine current minimum of eve players' intellect and skill (from all playerbase) - lowering entrance barrier will decrease that minimum.players must learn shiptypes - it's just realistic that you need to learn if you want to reach something. a noob doesn't need to know all shiptypes, but after some time when he improves his skill and knowledge of the mechanics he will get to know every shiptype (gradually). that's just normal.eve is a wonderful game and a wonderful sandbox mostly because it doesn't take your hand to lead you through everything - it introduces some basic things to you but you have to learn deeper details by yourself, with your own brains through your own experience. you casualizators want to break that part.eve's interface should become a bit more comfortable but the game itself should not become more accessible - it's accessible enough, eve only needs more content and more genres plus more and more depth, diversity to it."
6/27/2013,i can live with that. i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about.
6/27/2013,"reporting that both my goggles, and the are working as intended."
6/27/2013,"faction warfare complexes are a broken mechanic. 'plexers' fly empty ships, warp core stabilized ships, cloaking ships and have almost zero risk in exchange for the loyalty points they are earning. they can do this with day-old characters. there is no way for another player (whether it is a pirate or an opposing faction) to stop the plexer as they can just warp from complex to complex in a single system running each one down a little until they end up back where they started. my assertion is that players who are actively taking part in capturing a complex and fly in ships capable of defending the complex should be rewarded more than players who risk almost nothing.empty ships are relatively easy to catch, though there is ample warning and time to escape. warp core stabilized ships can be killed with a large alpha or multiple points, but often they will warp off. cloaking ships can be found with enough effort. i am not arguing that there is no counter, but the effort in comparison to the risk is herculean.i've spoken with people taking advantage of the brokenness. they admit it is broken and there is no risk. i often see new characters (sometimes created that day) who are in faction warfare plexing -- these are never brand new players; they are veterans taking advantage of a broken system.faction warfare complex timers should roll back when not actively being run down by a faction warfare pilot. i don't want this to be bogged down by specifics, so i won't indicate at what rate the timers should roll back (but i expect it should be at least at the same rate they are captured and possibly vary depending on the occupant of the complex).full disclosure: i am a pirate who often preys on plexers; most of the time i am solo, and often times i am not the victor. this is not a proposal to assure i gather more killmails."
6/27/2013,"[proposal] change killmail generations to show ships, involved in fights, playing important role, but not acting directly on the enemy.hello everyone \0for the first, reason to write this post:in current, pilots flying ships like logistic, bonus, ceptor, ewar often are not present in killmails, because in most battles they have more important priorities than shoot primary.but most of pilots want to have kills, as result we often can find unneeded civilian guns on scimitar or combat drones on oneiros.suggestion part:as a player, i think it will be good to change killmail generation mechanics,and add to current condition if interacted to the killed ship in any hostile manner and was in the same system another additional rule and if was in the same fleet with pilot landed the final blow and was in the same system expected results:huge number of players will get more fun. pilots of ships, not focused on destruction of enemy ships will not worry about way to get in killmail and can focus on more useful activities. also, cloaky falcons and spot bonus will appear in killmails.thanks"
6/27/2013,i probably don't care much about this as i enjoy myself even without killmails.but i would definitely support a proposal that added gang links to the killmail. and maybe i could care enough to add logistics repairing any ship that was on the killmail.edit: an edit just to note that there are modifications for some popular killboard software that allow players to add themselves (or the fc to add them) which work quite well.

6/27/2013,"i definitely support this idea! at least for logi/dictors. or may be for the whole fleet which will be in overview/system at the ""boom"" moment. =) and it'll be really awesome to see ingame related kills with convenient timeline and achievements such as ""top damage"", ""most final blows"" etc. and may be smth like ""most damage repaired"" for logi, ""most targets tackled"" for dics, ""most targets jammed"" , ""most dancers in cargo"", ""top looter"" and so on."

6/27/2013,"i agree that the rorqual could use a compression buff. to your points:2. no. refining at a pos, yes, compression, no -- not unless it's removed as a rorqual feature.1. updating rorqual compression:a) ore hold increase by 50%.b) ""local"" compression slots should be limited by a players manufacturing abilities - 11 slots total @ max skills.c) compression time should be decreased, but not more than 25%.a, b & c work hand-in hand. most producers that i know only utilize 10 slots, but 10 slots in conjunction with a modest ore hold increase and a modest reduction in compression time would be a huge buff to the rorqual.in regards to ice (and ore for that matter), the overall compression sizes should be similiar and you should be able to support the same number of ice miners as ore miners. i haven't compressed ""on-the-fly"" in some time for any ops larger than 10 people, but the rorqual pilot should be able to compress for a good-sized op - i would say for 20 people (2 squads / rorqual).other rorqual changes that are needing to be made:- add another high-slot or two - for tractors or gang links. there are only 3 real gang links used - mining laser cycle time, range and shield resists - two capital tractors and your industrial siege.- removing the drone bonus as has been said, i'm indifferent to since a caught rorqual is a dead rorqual.- jump range - a slight increase would be nice. more than a dread, less than a carrier. no additional modules needed.- scanner bonuses - remove this from the orca too and add it as a mining barge or exhumer bonus per levelthere are other changes / tweaks that could help this, but these are higher on the list that others, imo.hrolt ceo live free; die proud"

6/28/2013,"reading through the many pages of this thread, i recall supporting this idea before, though it may have been over in f&i, rather than here. some of the ideas tossed about in the later discussion have me wondering if we're still talking about a tug, or more on the lines of a ferry.one poster mentioned it has a high-sec civilian carrier, which i would see more as a ferry, rather than a tug which would be a single small ship consisting of a large engine, tractor and command deck, for moving anywhere from 1 to 3 large ships.either way, though, i'm in support."

6/28/2013,"well there is a ""easy"" fix. set the yield of breaking down ""compressed ores"" to 100%.can keep the normal ore processing at 75%, but if you want 100, you'll have to build/fly/operate a rorqual.so basically it causes your first major build to be a rorqual, then subsequent builds become somewhat easier as you can compress your ore, then reprocess it in the refinery to get the 100%.that should be the easiest fix.-- include if ""compressed"", reprocess 100%."
6/28/2013,"+1i support this, also not because i want more killmails, but because this broken mechanic leads to dissatisfying gameplay. my rough estimate is a full 1/2 to 2/3 of plexers warp off/cloak/otherwise avoid conflict. now sometimes this is justified, but man"
6/28/2013,"max butched is almost exclusively a logistics pilot for pl, in january he managed to get on almost 800 kills from his logi's.heres the thing, you used to not aggro in your logi because you could simply dock up or jump a gate after repping and get away, thats no longer the case.your logistics ships can get on mails if they want to, they're choosing not to by simply not packing combat drones.the process is simple, fit combat drones, launch drones and assign them to a dps ship, every target he aggro's will then get attacked by your drones, placing you on the mail.your repping power is barely diminished at all and you achieve what you want without having ccp do any coding at all (aka wasting time on something thats easy for you as a player to achieve)"
6/28/2013,its works only in part of different situations.look at this:enemy fleet = = = = = = 50-80km = = = = = = our nagas = = = 50-60km = = = our logiin this case drone control range is just not enough.
6/28/2013,"bringing this up again because we could really use some csm pressure on this issue. i would ask that you reference the thread here, and in that thread, ccp sisyphus' post here.basically, ccp has admitted that there is an issue, and their chosen course of action is to slowly work on optimizing the jump animation and then testing it to see if it improves the situation. i'm afraid that this slow and incremental effort is unacceptable. the game is causing physical pain and discomfort for a portion of its paying customers. this has been live for over three weeks. before that, it was reported repeatedly on the test server. there has been plenty of time to address this. this is not some minor bug causing a little inconvenience; it is a health issue and should be taken seriously as such. this needs an immediate fix, even if only a temporary one while they continue their optimization efforts. in the meantime though, something needs to be done, and ""no eta yet"" is not an acceptable option.so how about it csm? whether you like th animation or not, can you support the players you are supposed to represent, and apply some pressure to ccp to try to get us a quick solution on this? it doesn't have to be pretty, it doesn't have to be complete, it doesn't have to be permanent, but we need some relief from this problem, and we need it asap!"

6/29/2013,"well, this idea was original posted in f&i, and with the responses and support it received there, i felt it best to bring it here to attempt to bring it into the eyes of the csm or ccp. so far, we've had a reply from one member of the csm in support of it, and as long as it continues to garner support, i plan on keeping the idea alive. i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about."

6/29/2013,"i've used isboxer to mine ice in the past (which i no longer do after update)... it was effective and stable... i can vouch for it's use. it's only $50. a year.i used the isk to buy cooler ships, characters, etc.... i tried to use it on missions (which i actually play and enjoy) and i just uninstalled it as it was just too much work and too much clicking. i tested how quickly i got the mission done with 4 ships and it was maybe a minute faster then with just my two box norm.i think eve in general is a multi-account game and everyone has accepted it, or at least understands it. isboxer made it easy to control those accounts.i completely get the idea that it may seem unfair, and it is imo if you're looking for a good pvp matchup.... which everyone in here shot down....... meanies!!!

6/29/2013,i think a fine solution would be to give an option to disable the auto rotation of the cam or allow us to control the cam during the jump sequence and also showing our ship during the jump and applying the gate cloak just before landing in system. the reason i say show the ship during the jump sequence is due to a technique that figure skaters use while performing spins is to focus on a point this would allow us to focus on our ships. i personally do not have an issue with the jump in its current form and would be sad to see any changes to it but i sympathize with my fellow spaceship pilots and will not be telling them to htfu this time even though i really really want too.++<U+FFFD><U+FFFD> ++<U+FFFD><U+FFFD>- - --++ ++ -++++++ <U+FFFD><U+FFFD><U+FFFD><U+FFFD> ++<U+FFFD><U+FFFD><U+FFFD> <U+FFFD> <U+FFFD><U+FFFD>++ <U+FFFD><U+FFFD> <U+FFFD><U+FFFD><U+FFFD><U+FFFD><U+FFFD><U+FFFD>+ ++<U+FFFD><U+FFFD> ++<U+FFFD><U+FFFD>- <U+FFFD> -<U+FFFD>++ <U+FFFD><U+FFFD> <U+FFFD><U+FFFD>+<U+FFFD><U+FFFD><U+FFFD>

6/29/2013,"my response to ccp's position: not good enough.they had feedback on the test server.they've had almost four weeks live.they even had their own devs reporting the problem.and their respons is ""we'll get to it eventually""?!?!this has gone on too long already; ccp's neglect and indifference to the early reports is no excuse for this delay. ccp needs to understand the term ""stopgap measure,"" and implement something until they can put in the fix that they want.everything ccp has said indicates that they are simply unwilling to fix this sooner because they don't want to remove their new art asset, and want to take their time to try to ""optimize"" it in some unsubstantiated hope that they can do so in a way that will remove all ill effects whle still preserving the animation. by insisting on this unneeded delay, they are putting the importance of their pretty animation above the physical well being of their customers, and frankly, that is more sickening than the jump sequence will ever be."
6/29/2013,it's usually better not to have your ancillary armor rep automatically reload.unfortunately it keeps defaulting to that. it would be nice if it remembered my preference regarding auto reload like it does for my orbit default and keep at range default.or just have it default to not auto-reload.make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
6/29/2013,anything to lessen this game being a mad clickfest
6/29/2013,"first off, i apologize if my english is not that good, i have a lot to say, and it will be difficult for me to find the right words, so that everyone can understand what i am talking about.i believe that many manufacturers and business guys would love to have their ui to be less clicky and easier to keep track on everything.i am not asking for a complete overhaul just yet, but i would propose to make at least some little adjustments to the ui that might help in the meantime:at first : sell/buy orders:manufacturers always have a lot of marked orders running, and according to their production line they often have to set up the same amounts over and over again.here it would be nice to have the marked quickbar improved, so that one can save previous buy orders (amounts of minerals to buy, range of the stations/systems e.c.t. ... ).this way one would be able to just go to the marked quickbar -> click on the previous buy order -> adjust the price, and click the ""ok"" button.it would of course be awesome to be able to set up and save entire shopping lists, and use those as buy orders, f.ex.;a dominix needs:x amount of trit.x amount of mexallon ........e.c.t.save the order and be able to re - use it whenever needed.that said, i wanna point out that i currently use the awesome isk per hour 3rd party program by zifrian (thanks zifrian for making this awesome tool):"

6/30/2013,"posting to support the op. this terrible change has been too long unaddressed by ccp. i love this game. but if it will make me sick to my stomach too often i will stop playing. and no one will get my stuffs. ccp, there are off buttons for ship explosions, missile effects, turret effects, etc. ""immersion"" does not seem to be harmed by those. so, [u]please[/u] give us a persisting off button for the jump gate and autoscan visuals."

6/30/2013,"sure, i guess, but data sheets, carbon, hydrogen batteries, and electronic parts...just a waste of time. i like the puzzle change to the mini professions, but the scattering thing just kills it for me. lets face it, ""bring a friend"" is a fail scheme. the mini professions were never much of a social thing...seemingly more suited for the lone explorer type. the scattering cans ruined that, and the paltry reward makes for a total waste of time for one, let alone two or three.i would like to see the scattering cans done away with...the rest of the changes i can live with (and slightly enjoy)."
