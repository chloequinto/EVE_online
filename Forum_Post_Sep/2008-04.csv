4/1/2008,"@zensti have a wet dream that roughly looks something like thisplease visit your user settings to re-enable images.it should be self evident what it shows - and i'm not going to spend alot of thought on it here, unless by demand.as i honestly dont see ccp"
4/1/2008,"i disagree.first of all, most csm candidates point out how much they know about the game, etc. if you (csm people) only needed to _listen_, why would you need that knowledge? just jot down whatever we're saying and pass it on to ccp, simple no? anyone could be csm.i think you need to participate. in any discussion on the forums here, we're trying to convince each other of various points and nuances related to whatever topic. and it's better for us to convince you that what we're saying makes sense than it is for you to just copy it down to give it to ccp without caring about or understanding the details. i'd rather argue with you than write ""tornsoul, give this to ccp: blah blah blah. and bring back an answer.""besides, sometimes a ""this won't work because of x reason"" is just as valid coming from you as it is coming from ccp, since you have all that experience with the game and can tell what works and what doesn't. we don't need to wait for ccp to tell us that they won't add arkonor roids to lowsec, for example, you can explain just as well as they can why that's not balanced and won't be added, should a discussion about it spring up."
4/1/2008,i agree experience and knowledge is important attributes for csm memberswhich is excactly why i also saidi didnt intend to imply that the csm should simply take anything thrown at them and present to ccp without giving it some thought and giving some feedback themself as well.in fact i believe that feedback will be the main factor by wich the csm members ultimatly will be judged.
4/1/2008,"i implied in my earlier posts in this thread that i have done that and considered listing them here as well. but it seemed this thread was about you so i did not deem it appropriate to expand it to include your opponents in here. actually it was another candidate that got me checking up because from my view it seemed they sort of appeared out of nowhere. i appreciate the addition of more calm and well reasoned voices on the forums. i just wish they had been around more and found the reason they now appeared was for the csm. why not before if they are so interested in eve?well, it is not necessarily repeating when responding to a lengthy thread. your voice can be used to further debunk an idea or to support it (with new arguments or just a vote as it were for the idea) or you can modify the idea and bend it a different direction based on what others have written. well, you are correct csm should listen but presumably the csm members are elder statesmen of eve who can sort through the muck and recognize the gems to present to ccp. it is fine and indeed good if they present ideas of their own for consideration. this shows the rest of us the thrust of their thinking and how they handle themselves in the face of flames and their willingness to modify their ideas as more information and new ideas are offered. for instance if someone was just *sure* that concord should be in every system a and will not bend from that view i think it is safe to say we would not want to see that person on the csm (i am not implying you do, just using an extreme to illustrate the idea). not trying to be a pain here but with no posting history to speak of along those lines how are we really to judge?"
4/1/2008,"i was thinking along the lines of perhaps putting it in winterblinks thread, with a post for each candiate, that could then be linked to along with the other links - and perhaps serenity steele will pick it up as well"
4/1/2008,good idea...i had not considered that. i was waiting for the other candidates to stick their necks out here for me have at.
4/2/2008,"the ""forum stats"" were added to all candidates on monday night now if i could just get xml of those stats and show it in a graph ..."
4/2/2008,"yeah i saw that steele.however, what imperator jora'h did was more of a qualitative analysis of the numbers, rather than just listing them.the quantitative listings you've provided (via eve-search) are handy as well - not taking away from that at all.but i'd like to see the qualitative analysis for the others as well ;)) i find it interesting ;)"
4/2/2008,this is going to be hard to pick. i agree with the agenda you are putting for the torn. luck to you.
4/3/2008,"good luck, torn.me and ts go way back, we've built big together as a team. me behind the scenes with all the crazy ideas and him in the foreground being steady and cautious.i know torn personally as a reliable and level-headed person. he's not going to storm into ccp with ideas for sweeping and ultimately unrealistic changes. he'll be able to get the job done, i think, better than anyone.i think that his campaign website is a prime example of his ability to be realistic about what he can accomplish and how he plans to accomplish it.i'm of course about as biased as one could be, but wouldn't you be biased if your best friend ran for election?big and tornsoul both care very much about this game, we've built up a family around it whose ties run deep. we regularly meet in iceland for fanfest, having a large percentage of our members attend both '06 and '07.as for the old website's record of tornsoul being a member since 2002, i believe that tornsoul founded big as soon as he found out what eve was, long before beta even started. so big has existed as a group since long before the game was released, through beta, from the very beginning until the present.he's watched the game develop from the start and i think has a good grounding in what eve was meant to be, and where it can feasibly go.and as far as anything soul of fountain has done, we've just joined so i'm sorry if you've had misgivings about them - but we've only been in the group for a few days.tornsoul isn't that active on these forums for two good reasons. first of all because big's forums are quite active in themselves and tough to keep up with. second because the trolling in these forums can be so intense as to drown out any real discussion about basically anything. me and torn have both felt that one of the best places to discuss anything about eve in a civilized manner is to be at fanfest drinking beer :ppeople with long forum resumes or a history of combat experience does not automatically make them a good candidate. you've gotta look at the whole picture, you're not sending a character to iceland, you're sending a person. and you don't want that person to be nothing more than just an angry nerd or obsessed combat pilot with lots of time to kill. just because that character has been loud on the forums and gotten many kills in-game does not make them the best person to guide ccp in developing eve.i don't think it really matters much that he's not been engaged with the ships & modules forum. is mere ship balance or module fitting issues the only thing that you're concerned with in this game? there is a lot more to eve than ships and shooting! i like my share of pew-pew, but this is a have with far more levels. people only have so much time an attention to spend on a game in the first place, and you can't be everywhere at once - on all of the forums, all the fan sites, running a corp, being in-game, having a social life and a job irl.ps: we were never in cfs. we were in fa, who conquered cfs space (and were subsequently booted out)."
4/6/2008,"it would seem volt silenced everyone there must be more people though, who would like to know my stance/interest on this or that subject though?or something completly different... ?"

4/7/2008,"## last but not least : the stuff that really really needs to be fixed, because it's outright broken.can you name 3 or more outright broken things with the game currently?"
4/7/2008,"ja - jeg er dansk and i'll be at the gankaton this comming saterday -3 broken things, at the top of my head : territorial warfare (pos warfare beeing just one aspect of this - but probably the most ""visible""/moaned about thing)jumpgate/lane distribution (leading to such things as jita)a myriad of gui stuff/menus/interfaces that really should be fixed... (admittedly, few are ""game breaking"" but still...)"
4/7/2008,ermm... okay call me stupid but i don't think its self evident. will you elaborate? or is it to say empires should be spatially divided by lowsec/nullsec? oh if so then that is hot...
4/7/2008,"self evident after all then i could write page after page after page after page, about all the good stuff(tm) such a distribution would do, and fascilitate in eve.but again... way to radical...i don't see the majority of the player bases wanting it.i don't see ccp wanting it (or rather, deal with the outraged player base if forcing the change)too radical - is why it's just my wet dream"
4/7/2008,if ts does not have time for eve forums why should anyone suppose he has time for csm? he certainly had time to promote big stuff on the forums.if ts cannot stand the trolling why should anyone suppose he is now able to stomach it? what about the inevitable trolls that will pound on the csm? having a forum history does not make a good candidate but it does give people here and ability to see who the candidate is. what they are about. what ideas they support and how they respond to varying ideas and people. we just have to go with you and a few other peoples' opinion that ts is a really good guy. he probably is but i would really like to have seen someone who exhibited a concern and put in an effort to make eve better before the csm came on the scene. if not for the csm i think it is safe to assume we'd never see any of ts's ideas.
4/7/2008,really not going to vote for someone running a lottery.
4/7/2008,"erherm...""tornsoul isn't that active on these forums"" doesnt equal ""if ts does not have time for eve forums""i've already said that i read a humongous amount of posts on the eve forumsi'd say i spend an average of 1h a day, give and take, keeping up-to-date on various topics of interest - and watching for new interesting posts/trends.i'm (no longer) the most prolific poster around (aka ""active on these forums""), granted. i (mostly) prefer to listen (read), and internalize what's going on - for that big picture feel...most issues have most sides debated to death by thousand of other people.while i understand where you're comming from (with regards to knowing ""who i am""), i simply don't (or rarely) have the urge to repeat what has already been said, just to say ""see me, i *also* think x"", on issues 1 through 5000. i'm sorry but that just doesnt ring my bell.if it makes no difference if i make a comment to a post or not, i (usually) prefer not to make it.i prefer to make my opinion known where i feel it either makes a difference or add's something new.the frequency of this seems to not be to your personal liking - so be it.will it mean i won't get enough votes - maybe. so be it.============you saidi've always appreciated the work and honesty with which big has done its thing for eve at large and respect the job it has done for the eve community.and now you say""i would really like to have seen someone who exhibited a concern and put in an effort to make eve better before the csm came on the scene. if not for the csm i think it is safe to assume we'd never see any of ts's ideas.""those don't equate...one paragraph is about big, the other about me specifically (and honestly... saying i haven't done anything for eve before the csm... )those two go very much hand in hand though... so what you say about one, goes for the other as well, to an extreme degree.so both can't be correct."
4/7/2008,(i'll take the bait...)why on earth not?i'd be very intersted in you elaborating on that - seriously.
4/7/2008,"i do not think those two statements are at odds.first though realize my last post was debunking the notions i quoted in that post.as to what you said big has expanded eve in interesting directions. but as i noted before it did so entirely for its own benefit. that is 100% fine and cool. eve as a whole benefitted from what big does but it is not altruism that drives big.tornsoul as a csm candidate is a different matter. while pointing to what you did with big is worth noting it is not the whole answer. tornsoul is not a big representative in csm. tornsoul is supposed to be a representative of all the players of eve on the csm.what happens if an idea comes before the csm to propose to ccp that is contrary to big's interests? if you had posted in the past i and others would have a sense if you will argue for changes that you feel are overall better for eve or if you will protect your corner of it. you can see this clearly in many threads from other people (some few will argue for a better eve, most will kick and scream if you mess with whatever it is no matter how unbalanced).i find the notion that you do not reply because all you have to say has already been said puzzling. surely you have some spipn to offer to an idea. or lend support for a really good idea so maybe ccp will pay attention. or have a new idea all your own you would like vetted on the forums. you certainly seem a bright guy and it sounds like you have lots of ideas. i for one would have liked to hear them and discuss them.i am merely noting i have no good way to assess the above. i also noted before there are some others running who are equally lacking in this department so i'll have to wait and see (and i do mean to point this out in the csm candidate thread when i get some time). i know it looks like i am here to bust your balls but that really is not my intent."
4/7/2008,would you still want the job if there was no free trip to iceland?honestly?
4/7/2008,"and i'm trying to tell you they are if you have a different opinion then i'll simply accept that.as a hypothesis... say big was making most/all of it's isk from t2 prints.say a game change was suggested, that would render t2 prints nearly worthless (comparatively), but would benefit eve overall.i'd back it in a hearth beat.to even have a chance of you believing that, apart from believing that i generally don't go around telling lies , i'd have to tell you a bit about bigbig as a corp is extremely adaptive, we don't put all our egg's in one basket (goes abit against the hypothesis about making most isk of t2 prints - but follow me here...), so any game change, regardless what ccp might throw at us, would not hurt us much.and we're the kind of corp that thrives on a challenge, there's simply *so* many ways in eve to ""have your fun""/""make your isk"", that i honestly don't fear ever hitting that ""big over eve, or eve over big"" dillemma.because should it come, i know what i'd choose already.yes, i also have a (big) obligation towards the well beeing of my corp and it's members as well, but trying to influence eve simply for the sake of a personal (or proxy via my corp) advantage simply won't happen.i'm simply not wired that way...you can believe that or not - it won't change a thing.it's simply how i've always run my (and bigs) affairs.the only example i can give of this, that's remotely relevant, is all the times the big lottery have paid out prizes to ingame enemies.not excactly helping big supplying our enemies with isk is it?it's not the best example, so no reason to knit-pick at it, but it's the best i can think of atm.like i said earlier, i'm honestly looking forward to seeing your analysis of the other canditates. so don't worry."
4/7/2008,"already answered once in this thread...but i'll quote...what i forgot to mention in the above quote, but which is noted on my campaign website, is that i'm also going to ff'08 this year (i assume there'll be a ff'08 ofc )the free trip to iceland for csm members really isn't a lure for me - due to the timing of it (having to take days of work)and come ff'08, i can easily afford to pay my own way to iceland (i got a well paid job...) - so *shrug*."
4/7/2008,"guys seriously those are damn cheap shots. not even i would go to those lows. i personally can't imagine for a minute anyone who would go to those lengths to get a free trip to iceland. the application process, setting up a website, making stuff up to get people to vote you and finally releasing your real name to the whole of eve just for a holiday that you spend with some internet geeks discussing the future of a game of internet spaceships? alrighty... get a grip!"

4/22/2008,"now as you can probably guess im in the camp that feels that local gives us too much intelligence and actually reduces the opportunity for combat since in the current state of play everyone knows too much about what the likely opposition has on the table and can simply opt not too engage if they dont like the odds. sure you can duck this a little if you are the owner of a jump bridge, or titan, or (to a degree) black ops covert portal, or (if you are really cheesy) you can do those horrible log-in trap things  but all of this is only powerful because otherwise your enemy knows precisely what you have in local (and the next local) and can react accordingly. what if that knowledge wasnt free? wasnt near omnipotent, what if tactical uncertainty existed and fcs and residents in 0.0 space could only be sure about what existed within range of their ships sensors? what if scouting performed a far great role, what if you could simply hide a reinforcement fleet out beyond the orbit of a distant planet? what if you had to actually use big probes and exhaustive long-range scanning to ensure that the enemy had nobody one system over to jump in once the battle had started?it would make combat more hazardous; itd lead to some terrible surprises of course. it would be scary for territorial powers because theyd need to do some actual active patrolling to know what was passing through their claimed territory rather than just putting alts in stations. it would be scary for npc hunters to a degree, since theyd need to have the long range scan open and check proximity rather than just watching local. but  it would also mean that hostiles hunting those ratters would have to scan and search systems properly to find their prey rather than just burning through every system in a wide area until they see people in local. of course some changes would have to come with this: 1. the map intel would need to change and stop being a free-lunch. no point being a ninja ratter watching your scanner diligently and counting on the security of a big system to protect you from bad guys when the game map is happily announcing to the entire server that youve killed 1001 guristas in the last 8 hours. anyone hoping to come and kill you should at least have to make the effort of scanning for wrecks as they pass through the system and make the connection.2. the long range scanner should become more customizable and user friendly  it should be able to give a proximity warning if you set it up that way. for example, if you were ratting youd want any new ship contact within your maximum range scan to pop up on your screen with flashing letters and an audible alarm. thats just reasonable payoff for the fact you are no longer able to see enemies come into local.3. cloaked ships are another problem. realistically you are going to have to be able to scan for cloaked signatures and be warned of their approach. you shouldnt ever be able to narrow them down or get specific ship information (or warp to them) but if there is a cloaked ship in x range from your ship you should get a warning. thats again the payoff for the removal of local. think about it  without this and no local then all npc hunters would automatically die from cloaked recons warping to their belt and scrambling them for a gang to come in and kill. fair is fair.4. but there can be some excellent things too, in my story i make reference to the fact that signatures are unknown, by class, by specific in that order, when first detected all traces should be unknowns, and depending on the ships involved, the skills, even the modules of scanning ships the process of refining the contacts into detailed knowledge takes time and maybe a bit of luck. this stuff makes for drama and excitement, adds some gray area and uncertainty to the engagement envelope and adds another layer of possibility to warfare."
4/22/2008,"but the big thing is that removal of local and some in game map statistics tools in order to make 0.0 space big and scary and spacious again  a place where anything can happen and its possible to stage ambushes, to evade patrols, to find surprise-battles and where intelligence-gathering and successful recon plays a vital role. makes non-concord unrestricted space an open environment of danger and possibility  and will make for some excellent space conflict and drama.as for the chat aspect  other players have already addressed this. make 0.0 (and potentially lowsec) constellation based chat where your name only appears in the chat window if you say something. people who want to chat can do so; people who dont want to be seen (for combat purposes, for ratting, for transit whatever) dont immediately get ratted out to everyone else in the system.*** so this is a post to kick a discussion amongst csm candidates and the general eve populace  what do you think about removal local chat from 0.0 and how do you envisage the game developing from this if it happens? are you for or against the idea? and why is that?lets have a discussion."
4/22/2008,thank god a real post for a change! good your back jade.i agree that local needs to go!
4/22/2008,"/kudosagree with all that. the story helped to make me want these changes even more, i hope ccp gets the same feeling.it would perfect if you added this to your plan:-->scans done in 5/15/30 degree range also show the ship's pilot information.and--> non-pilot ships are taken out of the ""ship"" category on the scanner (move them to a different category)edit: last addition:add a character count that works this way, it shows one of the following messages (won't show any number, just one message):-populated system---> this means there's more people active than you and your gang. people do only count after staying 5 mins in the system-lone system---> this means you and your gang are the only pilots.why? a tiny bit of information is necessary, just not to spend hours with the fleet ops just to discover you're alone in the system, so you wasted your time. this marker would at least give you a hint, and since people only start to count after 5 mins in the system, it would not ruin the stealth operations, and it wouldn't confuse you marking as active people who are just jumping through gates"
4/22/2008,"yep, the highest level of intel on contacts should be pilot information. agree also you should be able to remove not piloted ships from the focus search. also something just occurred to me. in the spirit of making intel gathering vital and removing all the ""free lunch"" intel from general game systems. pilots should be able to toggle off the ""appearing with online status"" in other people's address books if they choose. no reason why an enemy should necessarily know with perfect accuracy whether x pilot is online or not. this address-booking of hostiles is another local-ish cheese technique of metagaming too much knowledge of the tactical situation in my opinion. as always though, i'm very interested to hear from other people on the issue."
4/22/2008,"multipel acounts running same time still have bonus in-game (intel and all), no?"
4/22/2008,"good idea, or maybe a ""do not show my status to the enemies of my corporation"" thing ^^btw, what do you think about my last idea? (edited on my previous post)"
4/22/2008,"i'm not keen, because it would allow an alternative to actual scanning when people were hunting for loners in 0.0 systems (for example). its not a show-stopper, and i could definitely compromise on the issue, but i do feel that focusing the 0.0 combat intelligence on the ""what you can scan from your ship"" angle is the way forward. any kind of meta-reporting tool or functionality is giving away information that is not really earned by any positive effort.if one group manages to sneak 20 ships into system (or adjoining system) where(or next too where) another group is gate camping with 10 (ie the 10 don't have a scout in scan range of incoming gate) i don't want the 10 group to suddenly be alerted that this is now a populated system and smell a rat. i think they must be attentive to scans and intel gathering or face the chance of being jumped by and losing initiative."
4/22/2008,"potentially of course, if somebody is putting a cloaked scout at a gate with and checking long range scan (while also running a bs client elsewhere) then he or she will get a benefit from that - but thats eve really, ccp coded the system to let people run alts and multiple accounts and some things will never change."
4/22/2008,hmm ... where to start ...enjoyed reading the fiction. the game change suggestions are nice.but you lack 2 things:1. log in traps become more effective2. oog (out of game) tools will become more effective (even eve voice).however it's the best local replacement proposal i have read so far (including one or two of my own) :-))eve is seriously lacking in information and sensoric warfare (except ewar) and this could give covops pilots new potential. however i fear without automatic response tools (i.e. your mentioned proximity alert) this will kill the individual player (other than pirate) in lowsec.i have to word my next iteration on local removal in features&ideas forum.
4/22/2008,"the changes you're proposing are too sweeping, too big, for ccp's baby steps.that said,1. i'd be in favor of deployables that give the local sovereigns some sort of advantage, as far as map intel. the problem with map intel is that it's too black-and-white; either you see everything everywhere, or the delays (half hour, 1 hr, 24 hrs) are too poor a substitute for a suitable fog of war. i'd prefer deployables that give the sovereign an intel advantage, with the provision that an enemy scouting force can sneak in and take out these intel deployables before they transmit their warnings. wanna be stealthy, work at it.2. i'm all for that. also for a hud mini-map of local, and ship-to-ship communications so that if you're a fleet of 50 ships and each warps to a belt to check it out, the information of what's present at each belt is then available to each ship in the fleet, in the local map / overview / scanner window / all integrated information screens.3. i think that a cloak that can be detected somehow is ... well, not a cloak. if local is removed and we have to rely on scanning and proximity for information, then stealth is good enough, so i'd say remove cloaks and replace them with stealth (ship is visible, but hard to probe down, lock on, etc etc etc).4. we already have an ""unknowns"" indicator, and we will rely on it heavily once local is removed. it's the lag. an empty system feels different than one where a 100-ship fleet is waiting for you.and, anyway, ideas are nice, but everything that we suggest still is too big, too radical, for ccp's baby steps. so, good luck."
4/22/2008,"jade, interesting idea, but please either change the thread title to remove the csm part or move it to your campaign website. the csm has note been voted on and you are not a member of it (yet)"
4/22/2008,"jade's post was a fun read, just what i wish eve to be. recalling someone on the forum somewhere mentioning passive scanning, this made me come up with an idea after reading this thread.active & passive scanning:passive scan:passive scan would be a window with a button that says ""passive scan"", this window will paint contacts with weak ship-signature-strength. this way you can get a list of contacts (mostly of ships), but without indication of ship types or any location in space. now, cloaked ships will show up as weak contacts, but they will likely be much nearer your position. and if the passive scan is used when a recon is 30km off your ship, the enlarged signal strength (by nature of close proximity) will indicate that a cloaked ship is nearby. you would need luck or be tiringly paranoid to spot say a recon trying to catch you offguard.this passive scan may be used to gain knowledge that a ""cloaked"" ship is nearby, especially if you accidentally happen to fly 30km near it. clever manouvering may enable you to actually triangulate the position of a cloaked ship (like a cloaked hauler).with recon ship, they might be more stealthier, and harder to spot but they will show up as weak signals, but indistinquashable from regular passive contacts far off your position.active scan:active scan will be a way to both search for and pinpoint the distance and vector to another ship. a list of contacts will be displayed with info on; shiptype, distance and vector. the important thing is that when a pilot presses the ""active scan"" button in the scan window, his ship will radiate a much higher signal strength for the next 60 sec, revealing his position to anyone simply looking at their scanning window.i like the notion of this making for a cat and mouse game, where you can relax abit more if you are a miner or simply staying put at a safespot.the activity with active and passive scan, will serve as a limited intel tool in a star system that no longer provide guaranteed intel on local pilots, as well as giving people a ""fair"" chance in spotting launched probes doing an active search.probing tools would perhaps ""need"" to be changed to balance the power to probe, so that the prober isn't wasting his time doing so, by having potential targets just warp away too easily.any ships that is not cloaked and is within visual range, would show up differently, on a passive scan, indicating that these contacts are ""visuals""."
4/22/2008,"well we need a roadmap for change really, many these things don't all come at once - but we should know where we want to be heading and its important to communicate that knowledge to the devs at ccp. yep, don't mind this in theory at all. agreed, thats all good stuff. well its a visual cloak i guess, with some ew stealthing. think star trek i guess, they always seem to know there is a cloaked ship out there somewhere. maybe reduced detection range and such - but you do need to give people in local-less setting the ability to be warned on cloaked ship proximity or cloaks become overpowered and npc hunters are dead meat. sigh, lag eh, i'd rather not rely on that for detection mechanics :)well its still about vision at this point and i'm pretty interested to hear how the csm candidates and general eve populace feel about the local removal options for 0.0. all the best though and thanks for replying!"
4/22/2008,"i see your point, i've changed csm discussion to csm campaign - in the prefix letting people know its to do with the campaign not some formal csm discussion subject. that seem okay for you?"
4/22/2008,"yuor idea is good but i beleive by makig client to run one per mechine woudl make your porposal viable. oterwise, it is goign to benefit multipel acount holders.it is liek take 10 steps foward and 5 steps bakward."
4/22/2008,"to be honest jenny, eve benefits multiple account holders full stop. and taking 10 steps forward to go 5 steps backwards still means you've gone five steps forward but then i've always been a glass half full kinda chap really.thank you for your feedback though, its appreciated."
4/22/2008,"is it even technically possible to only let one client run per machine? i know that windows will let you start multiple copies of single-instance applications if you run them as different users.also, i have access to about 4 computers in my house that can run eve so that issue is moot anyway."
4/22/2008,"by the way, i'd like map statistics to have new options in the 10 minute range. that means ships killed in the last 10 minutes... you know, all the info."
4/22/2008,"an excellent post jade. my personal view is that the visibility of local channel is a problem because it operates at a consistent uniformity across an entire system. what do i mean by this? well, regardless of where you are in a system local 'sees' you - perhaps the omniscience you refer to in your post. what systems lack is any sense of 'terrain': theres nothing to hide in or behind, no way to manouver and attempt to conceal yourself, wether that's for offensive purposes or defensive.i have suggested an alternative (link under sig) whereby systems have a form of 'weather' - micro climates around planets and across space. these micro-climates / environments act to divide local into a series of sub channels.for example all category a planets would create a 'yulain feild' around them: if you're close to a cat a planet you sit within that local 'channel'. stars might be surrounded by a different radiation, enabling some scan frequencies whilst disabling others.these fields would shift, move, expand and contract creating a dynamic shift of system weather and creating localised pockets of scannable space. its the 18thc equivalent of hiding in a fog bank. we could expand upon this idea by considering that certain micro-climates are more or less common in certain regions of space.now players have the opportunity to plot their course around, through or into specific micro-climates to wait in ambush or conceal their location from roving pirates. an additional layer of tactical decision making evolves, perhaps even a 'career path' of pilots who specialise in tracking 'weather patterns'.the solution need not sit wholey in the domain of the scanner: we must consider also the topography of eve - the interstella equivalent of mist, darkness, woods and valleys.c."
4/22/2008,remove local but add a radar type screen its totally idiotic to hit scan every few seconds if you want to know if something gets close
4/22/2008,"nice little story and a good description of the direction eve 'could' go. local could remain as a chat interface, just remove the ability to view people in the system ie they are completely anonymous/invisible in that window until they choose to speak.im not actively engaged in 0.0 warfare yet, but making changes in this direction is going to make things a whole lot more interesting ill wager.regarding map intel aswell, as already mentioned far too much intel can be viewed from it, in turn this would encourage more timid people into low sec, if their presence there wasnt a bright burning beacon on the map.id suggest a new line of pos, sensor arrays, networking relays. etc etc, which grant the command of an alliance these vital bits of information on the map. this would tie in fantastically with a command room feature in the ambulation expansion. if you want your numbers hidden from an enemy alliance then forward task groups would be required to remove/disable these sensor outposts.0.0 space is meant to be the wild west of eve, just who is providing the data everyone can view on the map? in the fiction there is no explanation for it.i really feel that changes in this direction are overdue and would open up so many exciting possibilities.do it ccp, make your space the cold dark void it really is!"
4/22/2008,"yes, soem steps forward is good. in tis case, i perfer bacon and lokal chat to even up teh game as a cuonter.if all is unkwnon then everyone and famili flies gank squad 23/7.taht is my unbaised view."
4/22/2008,you seem like a good candidate but i need to know a few things about you. are you open for suggestions?what do you mostly do in eve?merits?do you care about industrial side/do you know much about it?
4/22/2008,teh idea is to maek it harder not unposibel.
4/22/2008,i supprot this. invirometal effect and mabe line of sight but mabe that lag to much?
4/22/2008,"im not suggesting line of sight mechanics - moreover dividing a system into seperate, fluctuating environments. i dont believe it will cause significant lag because essentially youre just breaking local down into seperate channels based upon where a ship is. local is still 'there' - its just much more localised.c."
4/22/2008,i knoe. the line of sight comes form me.
4/22/2008,"i know you wanted this discussion to include the csm candidates, to hear their opinions on the idea... with luck they will show up and make their views known.if local is a concord (empire/faction?) maintained set of systems that, based on the security of the system, tended to ""break down""...in .5 or higher space, these systems are well maintained, thus local remains as it is...in low sec, these systems do not work as well, they are not maintained... and so the local channel may fail to keep track of anyone in that system... when someone uses a gate, docks in a station, or speaks in local, the system tracks them... if they are in proximity (100 km) of a gate or station, they can be tracked... after a while (about a minute) there is a chance (20% per security level) that the system will maintain that tracking... so in .1 space, there is a 20% chance that the pilot remains listed in local, 80% in .4... every 30 seconds after the first minute, another check is made until that check fails (or the pilot triggers the tracking again)after tracking is lost, an interaction with the system (as listed above) would be required for the system to start tracking the pilot again.in 0.0 space, there is no tracking, talking in local, using a gate or station will cause you to show up only for as long as you are talking or within range of the gates or stations.player controlled areas (sov level 1) can install tracking systems, the data can be encoded to allow only alliance members to gain the information, but hacking (skill) with a decryption device would allow enemies to also get the data, and that data can be disseminated to the fleet (more role for the intel folks)cloaked ships (when cloaked) should never be able to be scanned, perhaps at most an unknown signature at a minimal range, similar to all ships at extreme scanning range that are uncloaked... non-covert ops cloaks should use cap as long as they are on, and the amount of cap should be based on the size of the ship and no non-covert ops ship should be able to remain cloaked indefinitely (10 to 30 minutes at most, at which point the cap is gone as well). covert ops cloaks will also use cap, but a minimal amount (easily maintained by the ships that can use them). i would also add forced recon and stealth bombers to those ships that can use the covert ops cloak"
4/22/2008,eve doesn't have an email field for this sage!!!!!!!
4/22/2008,"am i wrong in thinking the idea of csm was to provide a certain degree of transparency to ccp, act as an oversight commitee and work to prevent scandals and endless tinfoil-hattery and not make players into pseudo-devs?a lot of the candidates seem bent on using their potential position in the csm as a platform to lobby for their own pet peeves, game design changes etc etc.have i got the wrong end of the stick?"
4/22/2008,"pretty much.the csms role is to relay to the devs cuurent topics of concern or debate amongst the eve community - if thats tin foli hattery fine, but it could equally be ballance issues, new features and so on and so forth.clearly its beneficial that we, the voters, are able to view the candidates in as transparent a light as possible: after all once voted in theyll be 'in the room' with ccp we wont. csm members will likely have personal baises towards various aspects of the game that they view as more, or less important and equally views on how those issues should be adressed. jade constantine is simply being transparent is this instance and calling on other csm candidates to offer their views should they wish to do so.c."
4/22/2008,on the flipside does being a csm mean you should halt your personal take on eve and not share ideas about where eve is heading development wise?the local chat is a hot topic lately (and not so lately) having the problem and ideas for solution made so eloquently and creatively rather than just rants is good.thumbs up from me
4/22/2008,"i'll delete my longer post, and say my views quite simply.you won't get local chat functions removed without some dumb clause for replacement mechanics. ccp's idea of change is trivial, and only a knee-jerk reaction to years of player *****ing. they'll remove *local chat* in the same way they removed *instajump bookmarks*. the mechanics may be changed, but they'll be used to achieve the same results.the best you'll do with csm is:a) convince them to reveal the details of their replacement mechanicb) get them to reveal their timeline for replacementand if you're really loud:c) push them to bump the scheduling and priorityd) solicit another idea for replacementyou will not succeed in making the game any harder than it currently is."
4/22/2008,"thats really not what we are asking for here, options and depth is.each ship they insert into the game adds both those things.its not too much to ask for that to be applied to the local chat issue."
4/22/2008,"that makes no sense, because the inclusion of so many ships has watered down eve. i'm asking for the complete removal of local chat functionality, without any need for replacement. if the scanner gets looked at, then it should be for the improvement of existing functionality and user-friendliness. its important that you realize the whole problem of local chat is the artificial restriction of player interaction.allowing more player interaction in 0.0 is the same as increasing the difficulty of eve. which, by the way, is the same thing as adding 'options and depth'. ccp could remove local chat list tomorrow, the game would be better and the problem resolved."
4/22/2008,"i very much enjoyed the story there, excellent stuff...on your points:1. the map intel would need to change and stop being a free-lunch.i would somewhat agree with this. i would like to see the map intel available on the map be based on what your corp/alliance has come into contact with in these areas rather than losing all information on the map.2. the long range scanner should become more customizable and user friendly  it should be able to give a proximity warning if you set it up that way.another stellar plan... i like the thought of this and helps keep things interesting too.3. cloaked ships are another problem. realistically you are going to have to be able to scan for cloaked signatures and be warned of their approach.this i have a problem with... if this is done what would be the point in flying a covert ops, force recon or black ops ship with a cloak at all. there wouldn't be any, which interestingly enough highlights a problem with the whole remove local idea and re-balancing existing mechanics to fit.despite not liking the idea of making cloaked ships 'detectable' as it breaks the entire spirit of the thing, i am forced to see the sense of it in terms of game balancing as much as i don't like it. but i still feel there should still be a way, however difficult, for the cloaked ship to remain completely undetected by potential victims, or you are killing off dedicated cloaking ships as a viable choice and this (to me at least) is totally unacceptable. great stuff calais, you got my vote :p part of the problem here is that 'space' in eve remains pretty much two dimensional in some respects, despite the three axis. take planets and moons for instance, regardless of where you or others warp from, everyone ends up at exactly the same place when warping to 'zero'. being able to hide your ship on the dark side of the moon would be a sci-fi wet dream come true!and aside from from warping from 'room' to 'room' spamming the bookmark button there is no way to take advantage of the space in-between. you should at least be able to warp to an approximate point in space at will. from a combat perspective, this would cause a problem for scan probing but that itself could be solved by the very same mechanic.the solution here would be to allow different types of probes to be deployed within the sphere of influence of other types, which would, in effect, make it possible to create a sensor network within what-ever system you are in.secondly, the probe network and the results thereof you create, should be accessible by all members of the gang and as a corollary the workload too, as probe deployment itself could be shared between members... the analysis itself would have to remain the domain of those ships specialized in it, to make sure that we are not making the obvious ships redundant in this matter.this would make, alongside removing local a very interesting environment indeed... dark and scary where good work, tactical environments (ccp had a sticky about this a while back) and inventive shenanigans are rewarded. wow.. well, thanks to the op for an excellent thought provoking and inspiring post and to the surprising lack of rabid trolls, many well thought out ideas in here. i hope know ccp can pull some good stuff out of this thread."
4/22/2008,"perhaps the issue is more than local chat showing. the game has drastically changed with the introduction of cloaking and capital ship types. some areas have advanced while others have not advanced to remain balanced. for example: sentry guns in empire, i remember a time when you could not ""tip cans"" without concord intervening, or when you couldn't tank the gate even in 0.4. with ship changes and equipment upgrades this is now possible, so this is now an imbalance. local is used by fc's to gage when to engage, how many there are to engage, i feel removing local would create more of a blob mentality and remove the tactical that makes real battles fun.perhaps there needs to be a percentage of detection on ships that use devices not meant for them, cloaking devices were meant for covert ops originally. lets say a raven has a cloaking device on there should be a detection penalty for fitting it to a non covert ops ship.since capital ships have been introduced, some gangs run with a cyno to bring their caps in if engaged, so no longer a tactical battle but a blob fest.also instead of pushing for game changes maybe discuss how to balance what is currently in game and work towards fixing the lag?my perspective of a csm is ""how/what can i communicate to ccp to make this game better"" or ""ccp has this idea, what do you as the player think?"" as opposed to ""i have a campaign"" some good thoughts, but perhaps not all agree and some don't come to the forums to have input in it. a csm should give and get ideas in game, it will allow a larger player base of input, and like a diplomat explain when one idea has to come before another so people know they are being listened to.my perspective of a csm is like being a diplomat, you listen to all and represent them. if you have an idea allow everyone the opportunity to critique it as they allow you to critique theirs, in game. i have a feeling it will be like negotiations of how/what to do first ;-)"
4/22/2008,"i think the fundamental data for ""radar"" is already in the game: ship sizes and masses indicate how big their blib would be.i love the idea to remove the meta-level-intel that local is right now and replace it with a line of ships and skills that are fokussed on just that: intel! awacs capital ships anyone?"
4/22/2008,"if there is one thing i'd like to see come out of csm, it would be for ccp to understand local as the intel tool is totally weak - and even if a long-range scanner gave someone the same benefits as watching local, it would make sense and they would still need skills and modules for it."
4/22/2008,"over the next couple of days i'm climbing ben nevis and snowdon so apologies for not being able to answer questions during that time, however i will catch up on this on my return. thanks for your time."
4/22/2008,"i like the idea in 0.0.a number of points i've added on multiple occasions over the last 4 years.leave the amount of people in local [x] just not names.allow + standing pilots to show up.on a sidenote if the csm candidate could have a platform for things like these i think you'd see alot more involvement from the community. some of the replys to this thread lead me to believe peeps are running for csm just get a free plane ticket, a news item and some drinks. although pedro's ""all your wildest dreams will come true"" might should be avoided."
4/22/2008,"i'm pretty much agreed with dc. when you read a lot of the responses in these sorts of threads it's hard to miss the notion that many players these days feel they have some sort of right to be able to mine/rat in 0.0 (theoretically the most dangerous areas of eve) while taking the most minimal of precautions to protect themselves (no scouts, no team work to secure an area etc). even many of the suggested alternatives amount to the same basic thing.ccp really do need to just bite the bullet and make 0.0 the dangerous space it used to be, high risk and high rewards for those with the brains and balls to make it there.certainly some mechanics such as cloaking may need looking at but eve really needs the sort of challenging environment back that it once had."
4/22/2008,so you are in favour of them removing local?
4/23/2008,"before removing local, nerf the map, less is more as jade said, all that intel from the map is hindering not helping. also nerf the overview, people need not see who is in what ship, they only need to know the ship and it's corporate affiliation, let them guess the rest."
4/23/2008,"2 things here:i love the idea, it would make eve much more ""realistic"" (even though we know it isn't and never will be). i also loved the story (and was very very disappointed when i read about how it wasn't true). i have only a few suggestions-cloaked covert ops shouldn't be seen on the ""passive"" radar (as someone else suggested), but should be seen on the active radar, but as a sevearly reduced signiture (that would increase if they're using mwd) that could only be seen within ""line of sight"" (aka 250 km).- recons should be seen in passive radar, but as a reduced signiture that mimics that of a frigate.-stealth bombers shouldn't show up in passive and should show up sometimes in active depending on the radar operators skills and the stealth bombers skills.-i can't agree with the em current idea, while very good (and ripe for imaginative use), it doesn't address two problems with it: we can't really move around in space, even at the very fast speed of 3-10 km/s we simply can fly fast enough to make it feisable, otherwise we're stuck again in the ""warp to 0"" problem someone else mentioned. this could be solved by having an ""overdrive option"", it takes a full minute to start up, and it takes 30 seconds to stop but allows you to go at maybe 10% or 1% of your warpdrive capabilities (you also go in a striaght line). the community is constantly complaining about lag, but i can't see this helping in anyway. but that's not a real problem, and i can see how it wouldn't contribute much to the lag anyways.i also really liked the idea of sovernighty and stations. they should be able to place armored and defended ""outposts"" in space that actively or passivly scan the area with the active ones showing up in the scan quite easily. this puts a whole new use to the skill of hacking, a covert ops could warp to it while cloaked and hack it (they wouldn't have to take down the cloak) and be able to insert a ""time trojan"" in the form of datachips in 5/10/15 minute increments so a coordinated team can swoop in and take down the intelligence network and actually be able to do covort op like things.now for the meta-comment: ccp probably won't listen to us, and it's both good and bad that we can accept that, but at this point harping on that is avoiding the purpose of the thread which is to simply talk about something we would/wouldn't like."
4/23/2008,"right-o, fair enough old chap. yes, definitely. many of the ideas i've presented in the csm manifesto are just that, suggestions and ideas from other players with experience in these elements of the game. i feel its important for a candidate to be good at listening and have a feel for which genuinely good ideas need to be promoted to the highest level of attention. most actual gameplay is fighting at the moment. 0.0, empire wars, constructing tactics and applications for new technology etc etc. i'm the executor of star fraction alliance that takes some admin, but i've got an excellent director team to share the work load. here's an example of what i like to do operation fedaykinhmmm, gameplay merits? or personal merits, not sure exactly how to answer that. star fraction's tech2 industry very important to our alliance - we have an extensive suite of blueprint originals and build all interceptors, assault frigates, most recon cruisers, 4 hacs, 4 command cruisers and a wide variety modules and equipment. i do take an interest in the current state of play economically - though the day to day management and planning of these things falls to sf alliance director talent generally."
4/23/2008,"the csm is and will never be an oversight committee, and they will more that likely act as a damage control if some scandal does happen again. besides, what corp in real life wants their clients to go in and act as a big brother to prevent a scandal ?now there are some that are running for the csm that think they will have the idea that they can go a say to ccp: change this and this, so that they and their corp/alliance can get what they want. and the few that have only applied to get a chance to get a free trip to iceland (a very bad turnout if they get elected).but the fact is that the csm is players that will have a direct line to ccp that can handle issues and ideas with the direct intent to be open minded to it and voice what they think is the best for the community and what thy want. and they shod look at both sides of the issue/idea and discuss for both sides.[at least that is how i foresee that the csm to ccp will work in general]and to the op: i like this idea, and it may open up for a new ship class and a mini profession also.though the local channel can be changed so that in 0.0 it only displays the resent talkers and no way shod it display the numbers in local and no way to use it to get names out without people talking.and i think it can be adapted to low sec as well, and ofc it is up to ccp if it is implemented this way."
4/23/2008,"the view list of the csm candidates, i think jade constantine looked the best, but there were some issues i'd have liked to have known about before throwing my full weight into it. but with these ideas and goals, as well the the opinion on bacon, i think i just found my candidate. i'll have to point this out to my corpies as well. much thanks for the effort jade."
4/23/2008,"untill you can adress how miners (who are required to be stationary) arent even more screwed than usual by these proposed changes then nothing will be taken seriously.mobility and gank owns stationary and defense. this is hardly arguable. if something makes mining even more dangerous than it is in low and no-sec now then you can expect people just wont mine or will empire hug or, at best, blob up even worse."
4/23/2008,"wouldn't the removal of local chat also mean that you remove a way to socialize with people, for good or bad. after all in my experience in high sec, local is quite often filled with interesting chat between parties that would have probably never talked to each other, because they wouldn't have known they are there. new players would be harmed too, by removing the first channel they are likely to ask for help.so there needs to be at least a replacement of sorts to ensure that you can still socialize with unknown players, otherwise eve can get a mmo, where you feel pretty lonely. just jumping around in empire seeing all the people in local, since you barely see them all in space gives a feeling of actual population, since you know all are players. (i doubt 700 people in jita are all alts of one person, but rather alts of 700 persons, knowing that, it provides a special experience once you think about it.)"
4/23/2008,"please remember that we are talking about the systems where there is no public, concord controlled communication channel (well where the shouldn't be any).i think the changes would be radical but absolutely awesome.adding real reconnaicance to the game would rock on the long run.and i think that everyone is well aware of changes needed. be it mining-ship-high-risc-tanks - or tech ii mining ships - or awacs caps or anti-camo-bursts... alot of possibilities and also alot of time being ""not perfectly balanced"". so what? come on, guys! if eve stops progressing, yes radical progressing that might be disliked by change-fearers, it will soon enough die. now if we want to keep playing eve and ccp wants to have a lifetime income by providing eve there have to be changes. big changes. changes that give rebirth to eve as a game. i'm looking forward to faction warfare. i'm looking forward to ambulation. and i shure as hell would like to see recon and surveilance become what their name suggest."
4/23/2008,"for economic reasons local cannot be removed, ccp can't afford to lose that many accounts. they tried it once by 'accident'. it was quickly reversed."
4/23/2008,"i like this idea for 0.0 certainly. i wouldn't like to see it removed in empire space though as it would make empire-based wars next to impossible.good ideas, and well presented though."
4/23/2008,"yeah, i mean i love cloaked ships too, i really do. but you do have to look at the gameplay angle and ensure there is still balance that gives people the opportunity to fight back. i guess you just have to get back to the idea that the cloak is a ""visual cloak"" primarily and hides people from visual sighting. and with the reduced scan result showing ""cloak present"" (not range or direction) thats enough warning for people to take counter action and look to their defense. (bare in mind that with the system i'm suggesting in the op all ships would give some kind of result on the lr scanner so the cloakers would still have an advantage of hiding their ship type, range, direction etc.)now cloaked ship outside of lr range scan is ""completely undetectable"" perhaps you play with the stats a bit and have the maximum range that cloaked vessels get detected even as a general ""unknown trace"" is lesser than max range for conventional vessels.in the bit of fiction in the op i was describing the main advantage of the cloaked ships in the engagement being ""unknown wild cards"" side a had its 4 falcons, side b had its 4 sabres. the conventional ships got detected one by one by recon ops (except the 4 side b ravens that warped from beyond the orbit of the last planet) - the cloaked ships were the hidden assets that the fleet commanders knew were out there but couldn't resolve with any specifics until they de-cloaked.) thats how i'd see the cloaking device function in in a map and local free environemnt - but you do need a payoff to allow the possibility of detection of presence alone to replace the disappearing local chat register in my opinion."
4/23/2008,"thank you radcjk, much appreciated and please pass my best wishes to your corp!"
4/23/2008,"here's the thing soporo. at the moment the map gives too much information. how many in space? how many npcs destroyed? how many jump activations? and local lets me know when i come into system there is somebody there. all i have to do as a ""hunter"" is zoom about with a ceptor and quarter the belts and look for a barge. the hard business of knowing where to look amongst the 1000 stars is already done for me. in the proposal i'm making in the op this map information is not available, you can hide your mining op in the darkness of space. choose a system with 1-2 entrances, have a scout at the entrance in scan range (or a system over) if you want to be really safe. otherwise rely on your obscurity in the depths of space and add proximity alerts to the long range scan and get out if you think incoming traces are hostile. these things cut both ways they really do. i tell you, if i'm out hunting miners belonging to a hostile nsbi alliance in 0.0 i can cover 40-50 systems in a hour zipping around in a 'ceptor and zooming in on map traces and bring my gang directly to you. take away that map and local intel and i've got to work at it - learn mining habits, put your names into location agents, watch my scan, use probes, (be very aware of counter ambushing) its all a good balance really.if its scary for a ninja miner in the ""big-black"" in this system its scary for everyone, raiders, defenders, pirates and pirate-hunters, everyone has imperfect information and works on gut-reaction, instincts and fragmentary intel.if you are mining as part of a big 0.0 entity then they should be protecting you. not just letting map intel and local do it for them."
4/23/2008,"this is a low sec/null sec proposal. there i'd advocate replacing local with constellation (delayed) chat where you only appear in the constellation chat window if you chat. people who want to chat can do, people who want to remain stealthy can do that too. in high sec the local situation should remain unchanged to properly illustrate the contrast between outlaw and policed regions."
4/23/2008,"i'd be chuffed if local showed everyone in the system in 1.0 to 0.7 and then only showed those that spoke in local chat from 0.6 to 0.0, the buffer of 0.6 and 0.5 would stop high sec alts or bacons watching ship movements near most low-sec entry pointsi'd love lots of other cool stuff like restricted scanning and interference from astral bodies but they're probably something to dream of in the far distant future :)"
4/23/2008,"until you have a system on paper that does not fall into all the pitfalls that need to be avoided all of the wishes and wants for local are just hot air.especially when there are a number of ""quick"" fixes that will solve pretty much all of the problems except the ""feel"" problem that can be implemented swiftly and easily.[i.e. let people scan cloaking ships, add 5 minute rat/mining aggression timer, don't show in local until you decloak from jump in(you still show if using a cloak)]an increase in the time and effort it takes to find ships is, plain and simple, a decrease in the amount of combat that will occur. this is for two reasons, the first being that it takes more time to find targets, the second being that players are more likely to run together for protection when they have less information to deal with.both of these things are not good for the game.edit: too little information and its too hard to make decisions, instead of doing things, people don't do things[e.g. with no local and no replacement no one would do anything without a cloak(and don't rat or mine at all) because everything they do could have them run into 50 cloaked recons]too much information and its too easy to make decisions, when risk and reward become perfectly clear only rewarding actions will be taken and no combat occurs because everyone runs away if they can't win an upcoming battle. such, very few upcoming battles become real battles."
4/23/2008,"a bit of a ramble ahead, since i have a migraine disrupting my train of thought. it's not related to this, promise.removing local would require huge changes to other systems; as such it could not be done in the foreseeable future without the risk of causing massive subscriber defection. here's why:getting fights in 0.0 is hard enough. right now, the map and local are the only ways of even knowing if anyone's in a system at all, and for alliances that control more than one system, this allows them a quick way to know where to respond to. removal of this intelligence provides them with only one alternative that can provide a similar level of security.gate-camping. lots of it.without local or the map, alliances that are serious about security will just form enormous capital-supported bubble-dropping gate-blobs on entrances into their territory and gank the pants off anyone that enters. it's a remarkably simple solution that does nothing to improve the game, and as a matter of fact just makes it worse. about the only thing that can survive such a gate-blob would be roaming nano-gangs, which are already widely-seen as being far too common. all this will accomplish is to make 0.0 even more inaccessible except to the very experienced and the very rich, and will make alliance security take even longer and be even more boring. not everyone wants to dedicate their life to claiming virtual space.the funny thing is, the people this would screw over the most are smaller alliances, who will have no hope of holding any space whatsoever (they already don't have a prayer against the modern death-star pos towers), since they can't always be available to fend off attacks from larger groups bent on stealing their space (as with this change they won't even know they're there until they start firing at a tower, and by then there's no time to scramble a large enough defense force), while larger alliances can afford to amputate access to their space with the above tactic while still having the capacity to respond to anything that slips past.adding new modules that benefit the defender overlook the fact that defenders already have massive advantages while taking it away from the people who need it; this would simply make gatecamping more tenable as it would be easier to stumble into one for the people just starting out in low-sec. ec-p8r is camped enough already even with the map and local, thank you. adding specialized ships with special modules simply assures that every gang will have one or two of these ships and nothing will effectively change.mustn't forget the effect on low-sec, either. this would also make gate-blobs and station-camps more common there, as most pirates will not search every single system with scan probes just for the possibility of finding a mission raven which is already nearly impossible to detect even if you know where it is.changing local means that the benefits of reduced intel will mostly be reaped by large, well-entrenched alliances with strong intel networks and by roving nanogangs (capable of escaping gatecamps) in populated low- or no-sec space. i'm just cynical enough to point out that you and your alliance historically fall into the latter category.as for cloaked ships, cloaking makes you invisible for a reason - so nobody can find you. that's the whole point of cloaking. the devices are expensive and require a good bit of training to use, and carry hefty penalties on non-specialized ships. they're fine as is.all in all, reducing intelligence makes warfare more static and uninteresting when no side wants to take risks. what i see a lot of people proposing is a return to the 'trench warfare' tactic of the world wars, only in space. as a predominantly high-sec carebear with eyes on eventually moving out to low-sec and no-sec, i don't want to have to gather an army and fight the battle of the somme just to mine some crokite. how would you address these new problems?"
4/23/2008,"i'd counter by saying without the map intel and absolute intelligence tool of local you will have a situation where a space claiming alliance wants to ""secure"" its space will have to split its forces amongst many gates and choke points and will become more vulnerable to ""feints"" ""fake attacks"" ""hit and run"" and black-ops deployment deeper into its territory. take away absolute information and risks need to be taken, it becomes far less effective to ""blob"" since intruders will simply attack on different fronts. this is a common hobby-horse argument any time a change impacting alliance life in 0.0 is proposed ""the small alliances will fair worse!"" - but i really don't buy it. reduced information means opportunity for everyone and makes space bigger once again. it becomes scary for everyone. large alliances cannot afford to permacamp all the entrances to their space with limited information and no local. hotdrops are dangerous, they involve risk. fake attack happens and counter hot drop is made? that means another entrance is open and undefended. small alliances slip through the gaps and take advantage of the fact their presence is no longer immediately highlighted on the map for everyone to see."
4/23/2008,"ok, so youve removed local and map intel and have completely ignored the suggestions to replace how that info is gathered.are organised gangs with scouts into 0.0 / lowsec such a bad thing? or should we all be making our way solo vs ai in this game.is intel (sensor pos arrays, etc) becoming an asset that has to be worked at by your alliance, defended by them, implimented by them a bad thing?would being harder to locate in low sec due to less intel really deter people from going there? or would more people fancy their chances?options are a good thing, more involvement is a good thing, less important things automated and requiring player input is a good thing. sure, youll have to be paying attention to your scanner if you venture into low sec for some high reward activities, but you wont be a shining beacon on the map for all to see either.i think putting intel gathering into the hands of the players is such a cool prospect, if youre organised and wily you'll have the element of suprise against your enemy, if youre disorganised then youll be walking into traps left right and centre until you change that.rather than looking at the map / local and getting specific numbers of an incoming blob and meeting it with a matching blob, guerilla warfare is going to become alot more attractive.i think changes to this aspect of eve opens up way too many cool avenues to be ignored."
4/23/2008,"you forget that the gate campers rely on map and local information too. it'll be much much easier to attack gate camps with benefit of surprise with no local warning for the campers. jump in a ""victim"" empty industrial to get aggression. jump in a counter gate-camp gank fleet from another gate thats moved into position from another entrance. current system the campers see local bloom and all de-aggress and jump out. this way we get a chance for engagements happening from imperfect knowledge and this in turn will make gate camping itself more hazardous, involving more pvp and consequentially giving more opportunity for blockade runners and travels to slip through the gaps into deeper 0.0 and protective obscurity.well i'm not a pirate but i already search most systems i send gangs through with 'ceptor patrols and scanning on the chance of finding -10 hostile nsbi'ers. the diligent and the cunning will benefit - the lazy and uncreative will find it more difficult. lacking map intel on dead ships will put the onus on locals to band together and report the presence of hostile camps - lacking map intel will make it easier to surprise those camps and scatter and destroy them. well cynical or not - i will tell you that i (and sf) historically use whatever technology we find appropriate to fight back against superior numbers and blob fleets. blackops, ceptor gangs, nano, ew superiority, hot drops, remote repping battleships, cloaked recon patrols ... whatever whatever. we'll adapt and make use of whatever technology exists to allow us to fight back. the game has changed many many times in our lifespan as an alliance/corp and we always make the best of the situations. what i can tell you is limited intel does not benefit centralized systems of control and the giant alliances will find it more difficult to patrol and control their space. instead of being spoon fed free lunch from the map screen and local updates they'll have to go out and patrol and thats a good thing for the game in my opinion."
4/23/2008,"i think you should re-read the op and look specifically at the mention of cloaking devices there and in follow up posts. you've missed the point really. it would not be possible for people to ""find"" cloaked ships with the scanner in my proposal - just that people should know they ""are out there - somewhere"".i don't think you've proven that assertion with your post allaria. admittedly you haven't yet seen the situations in 0.0 with your own eyes. the reality is that if you wanted to go ninja-mine some crokite in 0.0 at the moment you'd be much better served by a removoed local and reduced/removed map intel and force the alliance hunters to actually search for you rather than simply looking at the map and confirming with local when their scouts arrive and proceeding to keep an afk cloaker logged into your system for the next 23 hours until you get bored and log out / make a mistake and warp to the gate."
4/23/2008,"'fog of war' is quite a staple in rts games, the element of suprise and ability to outsmart an opponent make for alot more excitement and options rather than just clashing head on with everything you have.i know eve isnt an rts, but alliance warfare shares alot of parallels with it. while an effort is made to gather intel on real threats, it opens up the chance for lone opportunists to go about their business."
4/23/2008,"agree, as danton said a page ago - restrict available information makes the game bigger. uncertainty and unknown disposition of enemy forces will make for more chance and meeting engagements sure, but it'll be much easier for those that want to ""go deep"" and hide to do just that. i'd believe that restricting map tools/local will lead to more conflict between groups out ""looking for trouble"" (because neither will know the precise advantage/size of the other) but will make it more difficult to find people who don't want to be found. and thats how deep 0.0 should be."
4/23/2008,"some points.hit and run, and feints, already work pretty well. that's why you hear about nanogangs every time you turn around - they are the ideal in hit and run and they're already doing just fine. feints are commonly used by larger alliances when attacking pos's, since 50 people in frigates do not equal 50 people in battleships and capitals waiting to hotdrop on your pos while you're chasing said frigates. as for black ops, they can't do anything as it is, anyway. a recon-based gang can already do what it wants in most 0.0 space without needing a large, expensive, vulnerable black ops tender. these changes wouldn't affect their ability to do that.next point. small alliances will fare worse with any change to intelligence for one simple reason - larger alliances have more people and thus more people they can dedicate to intelligence-gathering. an alliance of 1000 people can easily afford to dedicate 20 highly-experienced pilots to scouting and recon, while that might be half the people that a smaller alliance has online at any given time - they can't afford to take such measures. plus, smaller alliances have a harder time pulling off feints and sneak attacks because they often don't have the people to do so. if you have 40 people online, and you need 30 to launch a serious attack, you only have 10 to feint with, whereas your defender, who benefits from interior lines as well as numbers, has 80 people available and can counter both fleets with a group of 40. of course, even if you slip through undetected, there's no guarantee you'll find anything before you get spotted, since your intel is worse than that of the controlling alliance.onto what koro said. intel in the hands of the players does make low-sec more dangerous because of one simple rule of piracy. the only thing that making targets harder to find would mean is that people looking for targets will go to places where targets are most likely to be found - gates and stations. that's why, historically, pirates plied known trade routes between major ports - they knew they would find ships there. same goes for eve, only in eve you can't catch the ships in transit so you need to catch them at port. making it harder to find ships off the trade lanes will increase piracy on the trade lanes.back to jade. gatecampers, ones with half a brain anyway, don't rely on local at all. an alt in a newbship, or better, something that cloaks, sitting on the other side of the gate they're camping is a far more effective early-warning system than the map or the directional scanners, since you not only get the advantage of knowing what's coming, but also who they are and what ships they're in. the map and local have nothing to do with it.most people will not scan systems as-is because it's usually a waste of time. removing local will make it a genuine waste of time - would you be so keen on checking a system that might have a ship in it, or would you rather limit it to systems you know have ships in them? i hate to agree with a goon, especially this one, but goumindong has a point when he says restricting intel reduces fights, because he's right. the only thing more painful than flying around in a gang for three hours without finding a target is flying around in a gang for three hours looking for possible targets that may not even exist.i'm not going to argue the cynicism point, simply because that's a personal opinion. however, limited intel strongly benefits from centralization, as that way everyone knows what intel is available rather than some people having some parts of it and not being able to put two and two together. that's why militaries require soldiers to report, so that an intelligence specialist or command officer can put all the various reports together and get a good idea of what's going on. alliances with the experienced manpower to dedicate to central intelligence are in a much better position than alliances that can't."
4/23/2008,"local as a game mechanic is just awful.however, it has been in the game forever and as such an equilibrium has built up around it. it defines how miners, ratters, pirates, high sec players, low sec players, 0 sec players, solo players, corp players, small alliance players and mega alliance players operate in this game. yanking it out will have repercussions to every playstyle in the game. i believe that local should be replaced with a proper sensor and intelligence gathering system. however, i am not really invested in the status quo so i don't really care which way they equilibrium shifts due to such a change. naturally people who feel that it will shift in a direction that is disadvantagous to them will oppose it whether for good reasons or bad ones. you just won't escape it."
4/23/2008,"allarria kriss, in response: 1. nano-gangs in the current environment are another item of discussion altogether really. i have my own opinions as to why nano-gang has become the primary mobile force in 0.0 warfare and it has a lot to do with the gradual spread and empowerment of pos equipment/jump bridge/hotdrop with full map intel and local monitoring. black ops ships provide a covert portal to a covert cyno that doesnt appear on the map. 2. your point of large vs small alliances doesnt really work since the ratio of alliance size doesnt map directly on the potential game impact of local removal and making the landscape much bigger through limited intel. if you have 40 people online you can make a roving gang of quiet competent capability  at the moment you plunge that into large alliance space youll be scouted and countered and hotdropped on through jump bridges. without local chat and reduced map options you have a far greater chance of penetrating enemy borders and finding an enemy gang that has not been configured precisely to counter you.3. gatecampers rely on local. sorry allaria, but thats just the case. yes they run alts in systems around  but those alts are watching local  often by the time a force lands on the gate its too late. the clever ones are watching local/scanners/+the map for blobs also. trust me on this: ive fought these people for a long long time.4. re the restricting local / reducing fights. its just an incorrect assessment. people play this game for fun they want fights. roving pvp gangs want action. at the moment the problem is that its too easy to pick and choose your perfect fight. if you have a gang of 10 people out and you meet 15 (from your scout intel watching local) you might think the better of it and run. (if you meet 20-30 you definitely will)  but without local you arent suddenly going to lose all desire for pvp combat in eve  youll still be out looking for trouble and watching the scanners but it will be more difficult of judge the odds and numbers in advance. opting out of engagement on first comparison of local numbers will no longer be an option.5. re the big alliance thing and intel, if you have a huge multi region alliance with 500 people in chat the current state of the game allows them to see precisely where an incoming group is and track its movement through local scouts. they can see ninja ratters/ rogue miners / where npcs are dying, where jumps have occurred, they can focus their whole strength on the precise point of incursion. limited intelligence means that imperfect intel traces will need to be investigated properly by intelligent scouts and patrollers and groups will have to be split up. in no way can this be construed an advantage foe a large regionally distributed power over a smaller focused territorial entity with restricted critical focus."
4/23/2008,"and what will be the difference ?1. small alliance vs large alliance. well in the current situation, both have the same intel gathering (local) just the large alliance can throw more material into actual combat. that will be the case with or without local, so this is non-argument.2. hit and run - nano - they are there because it is so easy to avoid combat with map and local. you need to be fast to catch somebody. also they are best at disengaging when things turn south (i.e. local jumps too much with reds).3. so the smart gate campers in lowsec already have scouts at the other gate, without local, nothing will change for them. again non-argumentas you correctly mentioned, the reason for lowsec gate and station camps is the nature of lowsec (no bubbles). absence of local will have realy no effect on that.i can only agree with the waste of time scanning an empty system in place of just looking at local. but that's one minor annoyance. now you have to work for your targets. big problem, pirates have to find targets and not just wait for them ..."
4/23/2008,"jade: you're contradicting yourself now.but before i get to that part, i'll reply to the other points.#1 - nanogangs are a problem for a thousand different reasons that have already been beaten to death. i was just mentioning one that was relevent.#2 - ""your point of large vs small alliances doesnt really work since the ratio of alliance size doesnt map directly on the potential game impact of local removal and making the landscape much bigger through limited intel."" - put that in english, please. a communications expert like you should not be posting something so incomprehensible. i will try to respond anyway. more players = more people available = more coverage = better intel = win. all your proposal does is put off the hotdropping of the small alliance's fleet until somebody runs into them and reports them.#3 - gatecampers rely on local because local is there. if you remove it, they will simply use alt scouts like most of them already do. they will just need more of them.#4 - it's been proven statistically time and again that, while most people play eve for fun, they are not looking for pvp. all that your proposal means is that it is even harder for these people who are looking for pvp to find each other, and all roving gangs will catch are the occasional ratter or miner, not anything challenging like another fleet.#5 - larger alliances can easily control more space than smaller alliances because larger alliances have fewer chokepoints per system than smaller alliances controlling less space. some of their systems and constellations 'cover' others - sending someone to guard an apartment block is just as productive as sending someone to guard an individual apartment, except that the guard can now protect many more apartments. most space is the same way - regions have very few entry points per system compared to individual components of those regions. that point aside, most people already will not engage a force if they don't have good intel on it - simply knowing how big a force is tells you nothing. it could be 100 frigates, it could be 100 titans. you'd better go look before you suit up for a hotdrop, eh?your contradiction: you want people to have more fun pvping, but make having fun harder to do by making fights, especially good fights, harder to find. you encourage blob warfare and gatecamping by making pvp riskier (most pvpers are risk-averse, so the greater the risk, the bigger the blob) while limiting the chance that a small roving gang (which will show up only as a tiny blip in local or on the map and thus probably be ignored) will have of finding opponents. i for one fail to see how making pvp harder to find will make pvp more fun; if anything i think it'll be more of a pain in the arse. i don't want to have to fly around for an hour scanning four systems just to gank a ratter in an enyo.hugh: that's precisely my point. removing local has no impact on most of these things, so i don't see how it's going to make any difference."
4/23/2008,"allaria, most of your post is just repetition of the previous one so i'm not going over old ground. its easy to play quote wars contradicting each other endlessly but with such a gulf of understanding between the core concepts we'll agree to disagree where views are incompatible and move on. just a couple of points to close on: since i'm talking in this thread specifically about 0.0 and lowsec where actual pvp combat is prized by the player base i'm going to take your comment with a pinch of salt and just roll my eyes at the notion of such statistics. the notion of the ""good fight"" is by definition a subjective one. a ""good fight"" tends to be something that has the advantage in your favour. to the other guys its as ""bad fight"". currently knowing the numbers in local exactly its too easy to decide against non ""good fights"" ie ... where the numbers are roughly even or against you. not knowing that intelligence in advance will lead to more genuinely objective ""good fights"" (which are not in the numerical advantage of either side necessarily) but ends up in a battle that could go either way. in any case, we've argued back and forth on the issue and we're disagreeing on interpretation not fact (statistics or otherwise) so we'll leave it there. thanks for responding to the thread though!"
4/23/2008,"but you are the one disgreeing with local removal and putting up non-arguments where the absence or presence of local has no impact.try one reasonable argument where removal of local will have a huge impact (i have one, ninja/solo mining as those ships depend on very early warning or protection).i can see only positives if a resonable and effective replacement is implemented. that's one big if. i am all for local removal when that if is solved. until then it is up for discussion."
4/23/2008,"here's the end-all argument, then, hugh.if removing local has no impact, why remove it? ccp did it once by accident and there was open revolt. do you think they're going to make that mistake again? i don't think they will unless they have a very, very good substitute for it waiting in the wings. thus, i, like you, am against local removal until there's a well-planned practical alternative that's been well-tested and ready to go. which there isn't right now. so that makes me against local removal at this point in time."
4/23/2008,"because local creates perceived problems:1. people scream for cloak nerfs2. bacon3. cloaked rat farmers4. logoff tacticsetc. etc. etc.these are all there because of local. and you are against local removal at this point because there is no alternative solution - i do agree that's my stance too. but you are agreeing against local removal as such, not agains the solution voiced by jade. that's a principal difference."
4/23/2008,"here is my reason for removing local:it is really bad ui implementation. to me at least staring at a list of names, waiting for it to change is not my idea of 'playing the game' and it has an uncanny resemblence to what raiding in wow is like. there is no skill involved but it is just an exercise in endurane to see how long you can stare at the same list before your eyes gloss over."
4/23/2008,"jade hasn't voiced a solution. jade has reposted the same ideas that have been doing the rounds of these forums for months. i want to see something original, not the same old dead horses.edit: torik: how would this be any different from any other system that would be implemented? people will check for new hostiles as frequently as possible when in hostile territory."
4/23/2008,"after you, please! since you are so intent on attempting to rubbish the suggestions people are trying to build here."
4/23/2008,anyone who votes the removal of local gets a + in my book.now about those cheap cerbs...
4/23/2008,"jade, i've never been a massive fan, but you're far and away the best candidate. you have my votes."
4/23/2008,great discussion - i'd love to see the perfect information of local replaced with something where recon within a system is a tactical advantage.
4/23/2008,great post.nerf local now!....and while you are at it make stations destructable or let the attackers pillage them.
4/23/2008,have a quick attempt at making something new. this one's even thought-out and detailed. it took me all of half an hour. have fun flaming.step one: make similar intelligence tools available.your turn?
4/23/2008,"wasnt a flame dear, you just seemed very counter constructive. to be honest it doesnt even require new ship types but that never hurts. the systems are already in place in eve, map data, local logs, scanners. all that needs to change is how they are accessed and who has access.take a look at any contemporary strategic game and info gathering / fog of war features in it. knowing what your opponent is up to at all times makes for a very unexciting strategy game.but since youve taken the time to conceptualise a new ship type i'll go have a look. :)"
4/23/2008,"obviously any replacement system that would require people to keep staring at a display would be just as bad. any workable solution would have to involve automated scanning and proximity alerts. this would then have to be balanced out with equipment sensivity, range, signature and power usage issues. ie. a scanner setup that could detect people at the other side of the solar system would give out a ton of false positives, eat up most of your power and make you detectable by people with much weaker setups.edit: that ship idea of yours would fit this kind of setup nicely. a highly specfialized ship setup that would provide great scanning but would not be very functional in other ways due to all the equipment and power sources it has to carry."
4/23/2008,"i have not read every post but have seen some references to this so i will reiterate hoping for some clarification:in general i think local is a problem but the solutions so far seem lacking.1) while i like the notion of bringing skill back to scanning i am not keen on the idea of having to spam a scan button while mining/ratting in dangerous space. just not a good game mechanic. as some have noted there needs to be an automated system in place but how far does that go before you are essentially back to local?further, when i am in low sec or 0.0 knowing who just jumped in is very helpful to me as a miner/ratter/missioner. even if i have a 100% ""someone is there"" buzzer not knowing who it is means i will be running for a pos/station/ss every time the thing goes off. the only alternative is to have a large gang with me if i ever want to go into dangerous space and that simply is not possible most times. so, removing local, to me, would effectively block me out of doing anything in low/no sec on anything short of a large(ish) gang basis.2) added to #1 above is the removal of map info. often when people get ganked at gates and complain here they are told it is their own fault for not checking the map (even though the map is a lagged and imperfect tool for this it is better than nothing). without that info i am utterly at the mercy of gate camps. use scouts...fine...still does not sound like a gameplay improvement except for the pirates.again, in a general sense i like the notion of info warfare, fog of war, general uncertainty and so on. as a practical matter though i am not seeing how this improves much."
4/24/2008,"i'll bring up an idea for discussion that could replace local.just go back to basics: have a pinnable window that functions as a real-time radar screen, one that maybe looks like a shrunk version of homeworld's 3-d navigation interface. put a radial button in the corner that switches between ""active"" and ""passive"" scanning. ""active"" scanning would bring much better results, but it would make you easily detected. ""passive"" scanning would be reliant on other energies illuminating or reflecting off of someone else; such as someone using an active scanner nearby other ships, which would be illuminated at great range for a sensitive passive scan (which could be affected by special modules fitted in the highs, lessening the chance that a cloak could also be fitted including any firepower). the strength of the passive return would of course be affected by each ship's sig radius, giving an aggressive and large fleet extra presence in system. if there is no active scanning within range of a passive receiver, all ships would only be illuminated by perhaps the level of their powergrid, or their proximity to a star or other source of energy. the level of passive return would dictate how much information is received on the ship-type and general location, signified by the size, color, and clarity of the blip on your screen. pilots would be unknown until close contact is made.even though active scanning would make you clear to any passive viewer, the benefits of it would be enormous for the aggressor. though they would be unable to warp to their contacts, they would know exactly where they were, what they were flying, and who was flying it. though they would have a shorter range then passive scanning, and they are unable to detect cloaked ships, they would know instantly when and where that ship was if they uncloaked, and they could position themselves to trap the contact, and send probers to find him. the range of this active scanning should be short, maybe 10 - 15 au, with skills or fittings available to improve it.hum... (shrug)any thoughts or improvements?oh, and btw... the reason i think cloaked ships should be left alone is because they are already limited greatly in firepower. you can't do much even with a recon without support."
4/24/2008,"jade,every time i read, you inspire.it's a pretty sure thing you'll be getting my votes."
4/24/2008,i think cloaked ships should show up as unknowns/undifferentiated from a rat or a cosmic annomoly on the scanner and thus not trigger the proximity alarm. otherwise i feel it would disadvantage cov ops/recon players too much.
4/24/2008,confirm sir
4/24/2008,"yes, local gives too much intelligence, but scanning gives far too little intelligence."
4/24/2008,"i support this... would be a nice anti-macro thing as well imo. no more, local jump loggofski"
4/24/2008,"what he said. counts for this thread as well as for the stuff on your website.op was a nice read and the proposed fix for the loss of local is the way to go. sure its a huge step, but i think its for the better of the game. space will become bigger (and scarier), teamwork will be more rewarded (good thing for a mmo), soloplayers can use the proximity alert or something similar), more adrenalin, more tactic, more fielding t1 stuff, more ships blown up, etc. etc.. im all for it.keep up the good work."
4/24/2008,"excellent op and a generally excellent idea; not entirely to my taste but not far off either. a couple of things i would add:local chat should be turned from instantaneous mode to delayed mode rather than remove it all together (ie you have to say something in local to appear).all ships should have a 'broadcast identity' option which automatically places your name and, perhaps, ship type in local when turned on.- this should be compulsory in 0.1 - 1.0 sec with the punishment being a global criminal flag when turned off (though it should have options to automate it based on sec level of system etc to prevent accidental concordokken)- this should be optional in 0.0 (again with the option to automatically turn it off/on when you enter/leave 0.0) as it may be desirable to turn on when operating in safe alliance space in order to avoid scaring the cr@p out of each other by showing up on scan without warning.i agree that the on-board scanner should definitely be improved: - the absolute maximum range of the ship scanner should be increased, maybe even unlimited, but with lower resolution and less information available at longer ranges.- should be built into the hud rather than rely on a pop-up window- should be hot-key controllable as much as possible- should be filterable and have user defined pre-sets (as opposed to simply using no filters or the overview filters)- however i do not believe the scanner alone should be able to provide automatic warnings of a ship entering range but i think an automatic scanning module would be a good idea, however when in operation it would kill your engines (cycle time of 5 seconds or so). this would reduce (though unfortunately not remove) the viability of the auto-logoff tactic employed by many ratters in 0.0 (as opposed to the automated scanner option which would make it easier) but would benefit stationary operations such as mining ops, which would be those most at risk from removing local.- the ability to detect the presence of a cloaked ship but not its precise location or ship type i like a lot, if local was removed but cloaks not changed then these would get a big bonus that i do not think is needed."
4/24/2008,"nice read.however, before anything else you need to decide where you want pvp to go. whether you want it going fun way or real way. what you described in your little fiction is real way. fun? maybe. to selected few. also, you skipped the boring stuff; you know all the void scans before that fleet got its fight.you are looking at this from fc's point of view. sending people left and right, scan this, report that, camp here, warp there, etc. fun, huh? now reverse the view ... a reasonably bad analogy, try putting yourself into role of single infantry unit in an rts game. fun, huh?you need attractors in space for fights to happen. they can be gates, poses or intel, that there's juicy target one jump ahead. as much as your little story could look awesome on 6 o'clock news, channel would have trouble all the other days when nothing could be reported. since i very much doubt anybody would enjoy coverage of some fleet spending 10 minutes scanning a system. for 10 systems.but most importantly, i'm afraid thisholds true so whole debate is pointless imho."
4/24/2008,lol if local gets removed you guys are gunna be sooooooooo sorry
4/24/2008,"is an fps game more or less fun for knowing who is in the next room? is an rts game more or less fun for having ""fog of war"" turned on. if everyone lacks perfect overview and tactical information then all is fine and balanced. eve won't suddenly stop undocking if local went away in 0.0. people will be ratting, patrolling, agenting and building pos and whatnot and since these activities will not automatically signal presence on the map and in local there will be a radical upsurge in that rarest of eve engagement paradigms - the meeting engagement. depends really, in game my character can fly pretty much any kind of ship. sometimes i fc, sometimes i scout, sometimes i tackle, sometimes i like the stand-off nano stuff. everything has its appeal and i tell you there is enjoyment to be found buzzing around in a crow quartering systems looking for targets as much as in ordering a fleet around. its different kinds of fun granted, but sometimes you want to kick back and just find and tackle while somebody else makes the big decisions for a change. in the local-free environment every decision would be more exciting and scouting even more critical - we'd have a lot less ""x contacts in local immediately run/log off/dock"" stuff going on. it really doesn't take 10mins to scan a system - trust me on this"
4/24/2008,thank you guys - really is much appreciated comment. all the best!
4/24/2008,"so your proposal is only no local in 0.0? since the vast majority of 0.0 is empty what you just said would seem to be the case. however, in low sec i think it is completely wrong. i have tried my level best to find low sec that is mostly pirate free. i was moon probing so i would spend a fair amount of time in various systems and i never went more than 15 minutes (and generally a lot less time) without some pirate zooming through.while on the face of it your suggestion means the incoming pirate would need to scan the system to find me in practice i am long gone the second i see him. pvp > pve fit so if i am doing anything except hunting other players i need to get the hell out fast.when you spend enough time in an area of low sec you learn who will leave you alone and can continue whatever it is with some assurance you'll be ok. with no local i would have to assume everyone is a bad guy meaning i would be running for a pos/ss/station every few minutes. not fun.further, with no window to look outside of a station how do i know if i am undocking into a station camp? with local i can get some sense if bad guys are at least in the system. with your proposal undocking will be an adventure every time and frankly that stinks."
4/24/2008,"i'm open to persuasion on the solution for lowsec. gut reaction is that local should be restricted in some form there though. whether it be delayed/display or simply not there yet to see. i guess i'm a bit luckier than you with lowsec though, last night i made an appalling gaff and delivered a friends ship 40 jumps to the tale-end of space to hakana system through some really lonely unoccupied lowsec (when i should have been taking it to ihakana at the other end of space). and let me tell you it was a big slow ship! seriously though, pirate camps in lowsec - yeah, i can see a problem, perhaps allowing the map intelligence for lowsec but not nullsec is the way to go. i'm actually in favor of windows for stations but i think we might need to wait for ambulation to get them."
4/24/2008,thank you for answering question you didn't know i asked.
4/24/2008,poasting on teh intarnetz takes zero intelligence!
4/24/2008,"dammit, the eve forums just ate my long and thought out reply, and i don't have much time to retype it. they really need to do something about this **** - it told me i wasn't logged in and didn't at least do me the courtesy of keeping and posting the content i just typed when i did log back in again.anyway, long time no see, jade.i've got a couple of concerns regarding your suggestions. my apologies if they have already been addressed in previous replies; i'm trying to finish typing this before i get ready for work and don't have time to read the whole thread.okay, my concerns are twofold: that this will decrease the chances of getting an engagement and increase the likelihood of blobbage.the first is pretty straightforward: greater difficulty in locating people (and knowing whether they are friendly or hostile) will result in more time spent searching, sometimes fruitlessly, and less chance and time spent pew-pewing.the latter is also fairly cut and dried, if a bit more in-depth. first and foremost, your proposed system would seem to favor numbers when searching for enemies; more people to case a system would result in better chances of finding something to shoot (assuming there's anyone to shoot in the system in the first place). the second is simple human nature: increase the uncertainty factor and people will take steps to ensure that, if unforseen events do occur, they will be ready for them. i see the upshot of this as most gangs bringing more numbers to ensure that if they do run into something they didn't expect, they'll have a greater ability to deal with it. tbqh, i find your ideas intriguing, but these concerns would have to be addressed before i could endorse them.now let's see if the forum gods eat my repost. this time i'm copying what i typed beforehand."
4/24/2008,"then again. these games are fundamentally different. not only do they offer some certain and important information regarding opponents[in more rts's is where the opponent starts how many of them are there and with what resources, in fps games its how many of them are there and their base capabilities], but they also are more or less riskless. if you lose the game, the time it takes to start again is near zero.because sides are not fixed and risks are higher makes eve fundamentally a different game from these. and then the analogy breaks down.the argument also breaks down due to time. that you increase the amount of time it takes for the engagement to happen may reduce its frequency. this is especially true for deep 0.0 ops. an increase in the time it takes to find targets combined with the both the decreased likelihood that people will produce and the increased likelihood that they will form together for defense mean that engagements are more likely to be much fewer with many more people on either side.she has said it won't happen the way we claim, but hasn't put up a strong argument to that effect."
4/24/2008,"hey there wrayeth! nice to see you're still around and up to mischief no problems, i'll summarize the general answers to the concerns below:well lets look at what happens now. we put together a gang or go solo, we check out the map perhaps looking for blobs, we set the autopilot destination and then move quickly to the trace location. our scouts are ahead in local and they report the presence of ships as they pass through. if we see a group much bigger than ours we generally evade, if their scouts see us coming they general evade, safespot, dock, logout or cloak etc etc. the problem is we have too much intel about enemy dispositions. you almost never get the wonderful ""meeting engagement"" in eve since both sides are instantly aware of the relative numbers and generally have time to evade in some way to avoid a pitched even battle.remove local and map intel and everyone is in the dark beyond the range of their sensors. we'll still go patrolling, we'll still have forward scouts to report on gate camping and run through systems with max range scans but we won't have the certain knowledge of x enemy ships in system and neither will the enemy have certain knowledge of our numbers. now some people say that this means everyone will just go and hide in dock and never fight but come on wrayeth, guys like you and i know that people play this game for fighting fun and games as well as anything else. people will be patrolling, they'll be baiting, they'll be setting traps, they'll be maneuvering, forming pincers, feints and reversals and all that lovely stuff we'd like to be happening. and remember, in actuality this isn't so different than we have to do at the moment, we bring a gang into system and just seeing people in local doesn't get us fights and kills - we have to narrow down the position of enemy ships and search to find them. thats why scan skills in interceptor pilots are so vital. removing local if anything increases the chance of getting fights since people are not getting immediate bacon-style warnings of enemy presence. yes and no, realistically 20+ interceptors can't search a system much faster than 4, its not just a numbers game - its pilot skill at play. most systems in eve i can confirm/deny enemy presence in about 2 mins without even looking at local right now - open system map plot a triangle course that takes in all major groupings and cruise with max range scanner - its not rocket science. might seem that way in theory, but remove map intel and everyone has uncertainty - large space holding entities will need to spread their intel and patrols wider to actually control space. they will be vulnerable to false intel, feints, unknown traces etc. also, if i'm a 10 man gang meeting a 100 man gang, my scout intel is still going to pick up a huge blob on the scanner and bail out. blobs are slow - and they need intel to pursue after all"
4/24/2008,"would this idea of the removal of local be acceptable if changed to a less efficient local chat based more on the new player help channel? if you have not started a new character in a while, or it may only be on new accounts, but you can watch the help channel and never be listed on it until you speak...this is like playing hide and seek at night, you have a good hiding place, as long as you stay quiet, it remains a good hiding place... talk, move (or as i did once, snore) and your good hiding place is no longer as good...the only added functionality would be that local would not show everyone in system, it would only show those that have used local... i would also add 2 items, first is a timer, second is system detection... system detection is any uncloaked ship within x km of a npc structure (gate or station) would be detected while they are in that range... ships that are detected are shown as they are now in local... the timer is once you are no longer detected (talking or within x km of a structure) there is a chance that the system will lose track of you and you drop off the local chat list... just like you had left the system...it is not the elimination of local, but the modification of how it works."
4/24/2008,"i have to say i agree with wrayeth and guomindong here.i think the proposal as it stands could potentially lead to a dramatic decline in the number and quality of fights by encouraging ganking and blobbage.while the more pvp oriented 'small gang' corps may go to the efforts outlined here i suspect that many groups will simply fall back on the old 'safety in numbers' philosophy.while i can see where you are coming from jade i think you are totally misreading how the majority of people play this game. what will happen when a pilot is ganked by 10 enemies. will his own alliance send just 10 people to respond when they have no clear idea how many enemies are in the area? will they assume that the 10 pilots are merely an advance guard for another fleet 2 jumps away? while there is already a tendency to blobbage i can only see that being worsened by this proposal.yes they can dispatch scouts to scan all the surrounding systems (which could be a very large number of systems) but that takes time, organisation and will.we already see people on these forums complaining about nano-hac gangs and the pointlessness/effort required to engage them. speed gangs have not resulted in more pvp (unless you count the ability to catch the odd careless npcer as pvp)because many players cannot even be bothered to gather the required ships to combat them and this proposal could produce a similar result!while some organisations will make the effort many more will simply blob up (or dock up) on the assumption that there are many more enemies around than there actually are. indeed (as with the nano-hac gangs) they may simply refuse to respond at all because it all takes too much effort.this proposal (as it stands) will from my viewpoint make eve combat less likely than it is already. yes we already have blobs but i think this proposal may actually make the situation worse.i do like the whole concept of 'uncertainty and fear' that removing local could bring but i simply don't see how it will encourgage good fights.all it will lead to is the death of careless individuals caught by surprise who will simply get ganked (as they already are). while that may be good for pirates i fail to see how its really going to help improve the frequency or quality of pvp in eve on a larger scale.of course there may be ways around this but so far i have yet to be convinced..."
4/24/2008,"i think some people are making the mistake of looking at a proposal like this and failing to employ any vision or imagination in how the basic idea would be integrated into the reality of the game.surely concerns like ""it'd be too hard to find fights"" could be easily addressed during the development of the actual mechanics and solutions found for minor problems such as these. i hope csm candidates weighing in can demonstrate their skills in this area, especially with this idea which has tremendous potential and merit.it would be my expectation that anyone elected to the csm be skilled at constructive criticism and capable of taking an idea and running with it instead of simply offering a shrug and a ""it's got flaws."" especially when their job is going to partly consist of recognizing good ideas from the community and helping to develop them for presentation to ccp! we need council members who can pitch an idea to ccp with maximum effect."
4/24/2008,"yes it's quite easy to be 'visionary' when trying to win votes isn't it?lets forget about words such as pragmatic, realistic and achievable and focus on 'vision' instead. it is so much more exciting isn't it!recognising good ideas is fine - provided that they are actually good ideas and more importantly balanced!we can of course all jump on existing lobbies and claim to be 'visionaries' in order to get elected but what exactly will we achieve when we present ill-thought or agenda driven proposals to ccp.should we all be sheep and quietly accept jade as the all knowing eve meister or should we point out flaws and issues in her thinking so that those ideas can be refined and improved into something that would actually work and might have a chance of being implemented by ccp? jade should welcome this opportunity to fine tune her thinking!but if it is a sheep you want then don't vote for me! hmmmm - may have to turn that into a banner"
4/24/2008,3 simple solutions...1rs: make the cloaking ships use fuel and only recons and cover ops have a bonus of compsumption and only the covers and the recons have a spacial bay for the fuel who are too heavy and the non recon ships or cover ops dont so 450 idrogen isotopes can last 30 min 40 min ..2cond: remove tha friking jump freigters! and the jump arrais from poses!!!!.. .. lots of ppl are in is primary sistem all daylong only left the primary sistem wen they need to sell they ****y minerals.. this 2 things only promove the carebears alliances and make the things for this ppl more easy we need 00 like all days i need to cruise 20 jumps to get one hostile mate3rd: make the cloaked ship posible to prove they can be proved with special proves and you only can prove the ship like the all days remember ??? like shoting 3 proves and thath things ??? so you can scanthe area but still is dificult but still posible to caths the cloaked bonused ships ... so the ships who dont have bonus can be proved more easy but still hard to ..sry mi engrish im spanish and barely can speack sry and by the way im half ork xd to
4/24/2008,"a couple of others have said the same and i've answered them in detail above - the key point is to understand exactly what happens when the local/map intel goes away. there isn't a way to simply ""outblob"" intel failures - you have to scan for and discover enemy gangs and use that read intel gathered from ships in space to make the engagement decision. i think its a bit ironic to suggest that removing local would actually reduce the quality of fights and encourage ganking and blobs since to my eyes the current state of the game has reached the absolute optimum peak for this tendency already - now we're trying to unwind this and improve the territory somewhat. as explained in posts above it really doesn't work that way. if a defensive force retreats to ""the blob"" and doesn't move its extremely easy to scout and avoid. the raiders will simply look elsewhere for more engage-able targets and the blob will not be able to move quickly enough to pursue. + of course, i honestly don't think anything could make eve more blob-friendly than the current status quo of jump/bridge/perfect local and map intel and rapid deployment on any movement. on that point we agree to disagree, but its worth pointing out that the way people play the game is determined largely by the mechanics in place. that doesn't necessarily mean its the way they want to play the game. case in point your line about nano-ships below: this is actually an entirely different issue - and something worthy of debate in its own right but i don't believe every 0.0 raider pilots nano-ships because its what they want to be flying. i strongly believe that nano-ship culture has evolved because its simply the only way to fight in the current environment of 0.0 where the defending side has all advantages, cyno jammed and jump-bridged systems and the ability to focus the entirety of the defensive blob on any incoming force. many players would much use battleships, rounded fleets, slower more powerful vessels but its suicide to do so in the current state of the game. enhanced defender advantage and near instant reinforcement by jump-bridge hot-drop means that an aggressor force must be flying ships that can near-instantly disengage when local blooms on the incoming hotdrop and multiple incoming forces appear. our own experience of 0.0 warfare in providence just showed that hardin - anytime anti cva bs groups engaged providence forces the battle would always conclude with defenders hotdropping double the numbers from jump-bridges and ending the fight with a convincing blob. now you can't expect players to keep losing ships on a failed tactic and conventional slow vessels in enemy 0.0 sovereignty space against jump bridge reinforcement is a ""failed tactic"". this is why your enemies in providence moved to nano-ships and cloakers - it was a tactic that traded firepower for maneuverability and ability to disengage. so the point is - you need to be able to see the big picture, its not enough to complain about nano-ships, you need to understand why they have become the sole practical raiding option."
4/24/2008,"then that brings us into the realm of discussing sovereign mechanics and bringing vulnerable infrastructure outside of pos shields hardin. nobody who puts up equipment in 0.0 should have the option of simply staying docked forever and not defending it. this is a pretty essential principle of eve-online, if you want to establish and empire then you'd better be prepared to defend it. but really, i think you are making too much of the difficulty of finding enemies without using local as a perfect 100% reliable intel tool. anyone who flies an interceptor knows how quickly you can quarter a system and report hull traces to the fc. larger alliances will certainly be able to station scouts and cloakers and have a fair idea of enemy numbers incoming - they won't have absolute certainty in the way they do now, but people will adapt and war will continue. its a bit silly to suggest that everyone would simply remain perma-docked forever if they couldn't know for certain what the total number of pilots in local was obviously we disagree. i believe that the tactical uncertainty will lead to more incidence of combat because neither side has the option of simply counting local numbers and docking/going safe/logging off or otherwise making the disengagement decision based on absolute local intel. the blob argument is also unproven really and seems more a gut instinct than a reasoned one. ultimately we the player base know that there is a problem with the perfect intel function of local and map statistics - ccp know this from a development perspective too. question posed in this thread is about how we address that problem and deal with the issues of implementation. i think you're a bit limited in your view of how combat happens hardin. its understandable because you come from the bias of big alliance pos ownership, perfect intel channels for local and jump-bridge hot-drops on anything that moves. but on this issue you need to listen a bit more to the experience of pilots that do the raiding thing and aren't counting on being able to sit out fights from behind pos shields or deploy overwhelming numbers in friendly cyno-jammed systems.your comments on nano-ship warfare showed a bit of naivety on the issue i think - try and ask people their opinion on why nano-ships have come to dominate the 0.0 playing field (i'm not just talking about the ships themselves, i'm talking about the big picture of the space combat in 0.0 and the environments those ships are designed to survive in). ask yourself what happens to a non-nano raiding gang that enters providence at the moment and put yourself into the head of a player trying to construct a fleet that can survive being jump-bridge hotdropped and dictor bubbled in hostile space. when you can see these things from other perspectives it'll be helpful to revisit the local issue i think."
4/24/2008,"you are wrong about what happens in this game when local goes away, your argument to support that position is a false analogy, and you are also wrong about the ability to out-blob intelligence failures.intelligence networks all follow the same laws of cooperative networks[not sure this is the right word here], but their value is ""equal"" to the number of nodes they have squared. larger alliances are more easily able to dedicate more people to scanning and have larger gangs all scanning. this increases the number of nodes they have and lets them get better and more accurate information in faster. only by increasing the amount of information that parties have access to or removing the ability to gather information can you limit the advantage that larger gangs and alliances have in this regard.no, the prevalence of nano-gangs has entirely to do with the fact that the ships reduce risks much too severely[i.e. they are overpowered]. defensive gangs for every type of operation that is not attacking a pos are now nearly all compromised of nano-ships[and for good reason].even fleets today are split into the nano-ships and the battleships[and the capitals]. a great example is bob which flies with nearly no frigates, ceptors, or interdictors now-a-days simply because they have become obsolete to fast tech 2 cruisers.back in the day when nano-fibers were +20m/s, overdrives were +velocity -agility and i-stabs were useless this was not the case because you could not make a cruiser as fast as a frigate but with more hit points and better dps."
4/24/2008,"a nice story at the start... nothing like it to get the crowd going, and slightly distracted through all the hype. i'm not saying that's wrong, just simply pointing that out to anyone who may not have noticed it and been swayed.local is handy, but when it is abused then it becomes a problem.the changes you suggest are *massive*! not in themselves, but the effects they can and will have. you can't simply say ""get rid of local"" - and you haven't, but it does introduce a number of other issues. how do you propose to counter the problems created?bacon and tools like it are bad, but local isn't the devil incarnate. without it, we would spend literally hours scanning, probing, scanning again, warping in only to find the enemy had gone,etc, etc.it would make for *very* boring gameplay and slow everything down to a snails pace.i would suggest keeping local (maybe in some watered-down state) but banning things like bacon and the goons version of it, or simply breaking the log server so these tools can no longer be used.a watered down version of local might be:121: in system114: neutral3: orange standing (up to -4.99 corp ratings/standings)2: red standing (-4.99 to -10 corp ratings/standings)2: war targets (anyone you are at war with)this way you can simply see the number of people in the system, and if you have any targets. you cannot see the actual player - unless of course they speak, which would be stupid in a war, right?so i think an overhaul, rather than scrapping it totally."
4/24/2008,did you ever try probing befor the massive change to it? that was when it took skill to probe out people and not only skillpoints. the thing you describe sounds great to me.
4/24/2008,"i like your idea about local not being available in 0.0 space. i also like the idea of local showing pilot numbers and status only. overall, its stimulated some good debating and discussion- its certainly made me think on the issue! most players are bringing up valid points and objections. this is an excellent example of how a csm forum topic will probably look! as you can see, its going to be hard gaining 5% player support for an idea. even if a representative agrees with the idea, it's still going to be hard getting it through a csm meeting.however, i must disagree with your point regarding detecting cloaked ships. cloaking is essentially electronic detection avoidance, with large swathes of the electromagnetic spectrum affected. you are proposing circumventing the whole purpose of the cloaked ship- it can sneak up on you and lock you down. this just makes 0.0 sec space a little more uncomfortable for its inhabitants, and a little more dangerous. instead of making them detectable, surely a small increase in the penalty targeting time after uncloak would be better? this way, if you are suprised, you may just get time (if you are paying attention) to get away/respond.this, of course, still allows players to sit near gates collecting entry/exit information and relaying it to their corp/alliances! however, this is being done icly, so i have no problem with it at all.arithron vote arithron- honesty and integrity you can trust!"
4/24/2008,"well i think its important to engage the imagination a bit too - this is a game after all and it does need appeal our sense of wonder and entertainment as well as stat-grinding and eft spreadsheet fandom! its certainly a big issue i agree, hence its a discussion thread and i'm very interested to here what everyone thinks on the subject and there have been many excellent posts in this thread and a lot of good debate. i do think that you've falling into the same mistake as hardin and others to focus on the length of time it takes to scan systems though ashlee - it really really isn't as slow a process as you are suggesting.otherwise the concept for watered down local is interesting, but i think it will still show too much information and focus fights in on the blob, rather than distributing combat and conflict across a wider area.certainly agree on the banning of bacon and other alliance versions of the software though. these things need to go."
4/24/2008,"there's also the fact that if and when local is removed there will certainly be a revamp of the on-board scanner that will to some extent take the place of the intel lost via local.what i imagine is something like a sonar - passively detecting the presence of other players (not empty ships) within a certain range - that doesn't cover the entire system. so you could check for the presence of players by warping to just a couple celestials in a system. that eliminates the omniscience of local chat without blinding players so much that they can't ever find each other to fight. i think a revamp of the way the scanner works (to make it more passive) could lead to some exciting things, like what jade describes in the op."
4/24/2008,"as always, you're advocating unfair advantages and almost no effort or consequences for the attacking party. i don't think that the ability for lolkids to log in for an hour, ruin someone's investment (a ship, a pos) without any danger or effort and then disappearing to brag on the forums is the right direction for eve.please die until you run out of clones. thxbai."
4/24/2008,i was under the impression that the main objection to these changes is that it would make the job of the attacker much harder.
4/24/2008,"while i don't want to detract too much from the main topic of this thread i have to disagree with you with the reason nano-ship culture evolved. yes hot-dropping is one of the primary causes but i disagree that this is purely down to sov warfare.the fact is that some enlightened people - such as omniscient order - developed nano-tactics long before they became flavour of the month. why? because they could see that it allowed them to engage targets with minimal risk to themselves, as goumindong has already highlighted. the fact is that nano 'culture' had started to develop prior to the introduction of jump bridges. this was partly in response to general tendency for people to blob but more importantly became evident with the introduction of carriers and dreads and more laterly titans.yes if people really want to roam 0.0 now in security and safety they are left with little option but to nano but that is not (as you seem to want to insist) purely a consequence of sov warfare but a consequence of people's ability to hot drop ships full stop! the simple fact is that people who care about their 'efficiency' would still be using nanos even if jump bridges and cyno jammers went away tomorrow. in fact if it wasnt for cynojammers people would probably have to use them even more for fear of being 'titaned' in every engagement!but that is all irrelevant anyway because i wasn't actually complaining about you or anyone else using nano's - as i have acknowledged above they are the wise choice in some situations. you were fighting a guerilla war against cva - you were outnumbered and outgunned - i have no issue with you opting to use nanos to keep yourself safe.the point that i was making was that while nanos may be useful in certain circumstances do not lead to more or better fights and pvp - in fact quite the opposite...and that is how i see a basic removal of local turning out (unless it is balanced properly).by all means use the opportunity to smack about cva blobs again and to bang on about your sov warfare hobby horse but please don't accuse me of not seeing the bigger picture when everything you write quite clearly screams ""this is my and my corps agenda - sod game balance""edit: as a rider to that i do want to highlight one recent phenomena and that is that some alliances such as -a- and tcf (i use these two as they are the ones i know about) have actually started flying into hostile space in non-nano gangs purely looking for 'good fights'. cva has had some great good old fashioned slugfests with them recently purely because they have come to our space and been prepared to fight even if they knew they would probably be outnumbered on our home turf but would get a traditional conventional fight, without us dropping a bunch of caps on them.they have been great fun and indicate to me that a lot of the problems that people want to blame on game mechanics are down to their own attitutde towards playing this game and in particular obsessions with killboard stats and efficiency!"
4/24/2008,i don't have the knowledge to really comment on the rest of the post but this phrase for me sums up the main bone of contention in this issue.local is so important to pretty much anything that is done in the game that any change to it is gonna change the status quo. so if you want to change/remove local you have to accept that it will upset the game balance and force a new equilibirum between the playstyles. i do not see any way a sensible change could be made that still preserve the current balance in the game.
4/24/2008,"i think you are making a mistake to make the connection between nano-ships and removing local, you're just confusing two different issues. don't really know what you are talking about here hardin. reality is you come from the big-alliance school of pvp where pos/sovereignty/hot-drops are the order of the day. thats your experience and its obviously your own interest. you are right to say i'm more interested in small scale roving pvp and tactical engagements rather than huge pos reinforcement battles -correct. but ultimately both interests need representation on the csm so i'm not going to be arguing you shouldn't be there. but don't be silly and accuse me of bias when you're own is very evident on the subject too. its different styles of play and both need representation."
4/24/2008,"very true - and you are doing a damn good job of representing your side of the arguement (damn this has been a long read!)however, no matter how you replace local/ scanner whatever, you are moving the advantange from the defender to the attacker - which in my opinion is completely the wrong way around.also - if you think about even modern radar abilities, states can 'see' enemys entering their territory (sure it doesnt pop a name of the pilot up, but it does pretty much everything else.)based on that 'local' or a list of blue, neut and reds should be avaliable to every member of a soverenty holding power in their own terratory based on this. (and i would add that to high sec because the empire factions would have this information too and probably make it avaiable to friendly pilots)"
4/24/2008,"not to stray too far from the topic, but that may be something that factors into an eventual change to how sovereignty works, based on some recent dev posts - there is talk of allowing sov holding alliances to check the logs on stargates to see who has been using them.but back to this topic - i don't think this particular discussion benefits from viewing it through an ""attacker/defender"" lens. the omniscience of the local chat list is something everyone acknowledges as lacking in dynamism, including most importantly ccp. so if local is going to go the question is what can replace it that will be fun and functional?anything other than the current system will be in some way a movement towards less than perfect information, so how can less than perfect info be fun and not frustrating? jade's story is great because it highlights exactly that - how a lack of information can be fun instead of frustrating."
4/24/2008,"dont want to argue with you on semantics, but ccp has never said that they are going to remove local - they have just said that it is one of the things they are considering."
4/24/2008,"i have from the very start of this process made it quite clear that i want the csm to represent the multiplicity of game styles available to the players of eve.however where i (seemingly) differ from you jade is that i am not focused on pushing a corp or alliance agenda.take sov warfare: i have already acknowledged that changes have to be made to create more opportunities for the attacker and where i do disagree with your proposal and suggestions i do so not because i am part of a sov holding alliance, or because the proposal is coming from you, but because i genuinely feel that some of the proposed changes are unbalanced and will not be in eve's long term interests.similarly, on the issue of local, i can see why some people are such advocates for its removal. however, i also see very good reasons why the removal of local would actually diminish (rather than increase) the likelihood of enjoyable pvp.obviously we will have to agree to disagree sometimes but we also have to be able to compromise and adapt our standpoints based upon the input we receive from all the players of eve and not just those that reflect the interests of our own particular corps.specifically and quickly on local removal:1) uncertainty - uncertainty increases the desire for safety. safety is obtained by either not travelling to risky areas or seeking saftey in numbers - its human nature. the removal of local increases uncertainty gigantically and unless an effective alternative is put in place it is, in my opinion, more likely to reduce pvp action than increase it.2) tedium - making things harder is not in itself wrong. i am sure there are many vets who long for a really hardcore eve. the problem is there is a fine line between challenging and tedious. make life too difficult and you run the risk of driving people out of the game. and while we are at it lets just make eve that little bit more unpleasant and daunting for people joining the game, after all its not like they have enough to get to grips with already.3) solo play - the removal of local will pretty much eliminate solo play in 0.0. that's fine if you believe that 0.0 should be a mercilessly hostile unforgiving place but not so fine if you believe in developing economies and creating empires in 0.0. it's not like we should be doing anything that would encourage people to leave empire anyway!while those are my major concerns there are also big issues around login traps. jump scout in, scan gate, one enemy in local, move scout on, jump fleet in, **** there's now 50 people on the gate - no warning whatsoeveralso undocking. no local - no idea who is in the system as you can't scan. okay let's put windows on the station - erm what if they are all in cloakers? okay lets introduce in station scanners - erm what if they are all in cloakers?as it stands it just seems way too imbalanced and impractical to me. maybe there are ways around some of the issues i have outlined. maybe i am just being too 'carebear' for my own good but i honestly think that the removal of local without an adeqaute alternative would severely damage the playing experience for the vast majority of players!"
4/24/2008,"imo, all that removing local completely would achieve (without changing anything else) is a slowdown in activity in the general sense, i.e. it would simply add a timesink to the game, as both sides would have to invest more time just looking for people. and i don't know about you, but i'm up for making eve more fun, not less.see, the usefulness of intel provided by local depends not just on the information itself, but how it is received by whoever's reading it, or even if it's being received at all. many a time i've caught people who weren't paying attention to it, just as i've been caught one or twice myself. that's what makes pseudo-macros like bacon so dangerous to the health of the game; it removes that human element of situational awareness that differentiates the smart player from the dumb.certainly i'm open to a ""watering down"" of local to the effect of providing a count of how many blues, greys and reds for example, along with a re-assessment of how the map works with a view to a fog-of-war type effect, but a complete removal is just not feasible as far as the fun factor of the game is concerned.and this is coming from a roamer./ben"
4/24/2008,"i think something along these lines isnt far from the correct way to go. also, it might well help with jump in lag, all those portaits to fill in/ names to list etc."
4/24/2008,"well hardin, if you want me to accept that you are intending to represent the whole range of play styles in eve and take you at your word on that then the least you can do in return is take me at mine and don't assume narrow bias while claiming otherwise yourself. clearly we're both very passionate about the game of eve and have different perceptions and experiences in the game, and we do have variant interpretations and assessments of current problems.i've already said that the csm needs different viewpoints and areas of specialty to succeed, fingers crossed it gets that. we need csm reps prepared to engage with and inspire debate in the eve community and see good suggestions raised to the ccp council. i think if nothing else we can both agree that this thread is an example of the sort of discussion that achieves genuinely useful feedback."
4/24/2008,fair enough
4/24/2008,"the only problem with this statement is that you appear to be very keen on pushing this line of thinking (even tieing it with your campain in the thread title)and as far as i can see it only helps the small roving pirate, and thus, you cannot claim to support all the range of playing styles."
4/24/2008,"i have a couple of questions to those that favour the removal of local, after reading this thread.1.) what about local channel's primary purpose - communication?scrapping it might be great from an intel point of view, but i'm not seeing anyone putting forward suggestions on what to do about the great big hole in the social element of the mmo that removing it creates. every mmo has a local channel because being multiplayer means people talk.might be alright for all the anti-social types out in 0.0 where every impairor and kestrel is a enemy alt scout coming to get you, but back in empire, even in low sec, it's much more heavily used for what it is - chat.i don't think i favour taking away something as fundamental as chat without seeing better ideas put forward that include this element too.2.) as a method of encouraging pvp.i think the argument that scouting, gatecamps etc will all bring more pvp forget one thing. the 0.0 mechanics of pvp encourage blobbing, but also territorial warfare.surely this will just create standby fleets ready to engage as soon as the first alliance member receives that handy mail from concord that tells them their pos shields are dropping?i mean, having a capital fleet to cyno in on whichever system has pos going into reinforced will be the easiest way to protect them.ah, but what about the miners and the ratters you will cry. well, exactly my point, most pvpers responses to a miner or ratter being attacked by a roving gang will simply remain the same ""lolz"" and then move on to looking for something to gank themselves instead of defending anything.when 0.0 alliances become about defending their assets more than just pos and outposts, then i can see it making a difference to pvp, but most alliances seem, to me at least, not to care about the individual gankings and raids that go on unless they're the ones doing it.eve is 90% aggression and 10% defense because defense is boring.raiding fleet in enemy space is far more fun to your pvp player than scouting home systems just so carebear king can strip zyd in his hulk more easily - even if it is for the good of the alliance. (which in some cases it is and some its not).anyway, just my views from reading this."
4/24/2008,"you can easily still have the channel. when people talk about removing local they talk about removing its functionality as an intelligence tool. i.e. setting it to delayed mode, or ""off"" so that the channel list won't ever update or will only update when someone talks. kinda how if you open up any large chat channel it will look like no one is in until any person talks, then only they show.2. this is a very legitimate complaint and one that i share[as well as the slanting towards attacking]. which is why any removal of local functionality would need to be packaged with a new mechanic that had the same key functionality as local. this key functionality is 1. presence2. standinglocal produces some other information like name, [notes based on show info], corp/alliance, etc that does not need to be figured.for more information see this link, and follow the discussion that goes on. the discussion that is in the link that is in the link is also a good read regarding the problems of local and why removing its functionality."
4/25/2008,"the problem with removing or delaying local is it is a bit of a conversation killer, but then perhaps i am unusual in that even in low sec i'd probably natter away to another pilot i saw at a station or in an asteroid belt. (mining of course )but i guess it's probably easier to adapt to assumed silence with people hidden unless they speak than to no possibility of communication at all - after all, if i can't yelp for help and the locals have a good laugh at my blunders it would make the gankings less fun for all the bystanders. as for the thread, thanks i will have a look."
4/25/2008,"i believe in the long run getting rid of local would create more problems then it solves. while there are some inherent issues with it overall it's such an ingrained part of the game now i think it would be difficult to replace.i look at my own experiences in 0.0 space in survival mode (and as someone who has played this game solo at times). i jump into a system. i'm cloaked initially but unless the pirate gatecamp is at that gate i really have no warning. am i supposed to stop and probe out every system i'm jumping thru on my way somewhere? not realistic and way to time consuming we might as well just get rid of highways. after all i remember 84 jump trips before those came in (and before ap). now it'll take just as long to go 20 when we have to scan people out.likewise now when i jump in i can see local, see those orange skulls and think ""hey there are pirates around here"". maybe i'll scout a bit, warp in at 100km to a gate or warp to a safe location before doing anything. i have the choice to protect myself. without local you're fair game.i completely agree with hardin on this one. while local isn't always the greatest it is the way we've played for years and moreso it's the way many have stayed alive (or at least less-dead) for years. another point is what i would think would be a decline in combat. right now generally two evenly matched fleets will engage. sure one side likes the advantage but usually if the fleets are close it's ""hey lets rumble"". now imagine where you have no idea what the other fleet has. right now you can send scouts to other systems to see if reinforcements are there or check the map for pilots in space. not anymore. i see gank gank gank the end result of doing away with local. i just don't believe it's realistic and furthermore believe it would decrease the pvp opportunties in eve for 0.0 dwellers to a point where the game could lose interest to them. even with a ""sonar"" type of scanner if you can't see the opposite gate your warping to you're completely blind. i'm sorry but if i'm in a system and i see 20 pirates in local i'm going to take precautions. with this model the only precaution i have is making sure my clone is updated.while archbishop is in a corp i do play solo alt characters at times in 0.0 space and i know if something like this went through as a solo player i'd be back hiding in empire. stuff where fleets of alliance mates can drum up 50 ships is fine but for the solo or small corp player it's completely unrealistic. right now those solo an small corp players have a life in 0.0 and local is one of the only real ways they have to protect themselves. taken away it's gone regardless of what type of scanner you get. people want some semblence of security and like it or not there are a sizeable number of eve players who are solo or in small corps. i can see them moving back to empire because of something like this after being ganked over and over again by unseen gatecamps. i don't think thats what ccp wants.archbishop"
4/25/2008,"it's the eternal question of eve:do you want things safe or do you want them interesting?local is the 'safe' thing right now. people are used to it and it provides them with near perfect information.if you remove local, no matter what you replace it with, you will create a period of 'interesting' where old assumptions mustbe abandoned and new tactics developed."
4/25/2008,"well, this is the thread i was thinking of:"
4/25/2008,"i must admit straight away, that i have only skimmed some of the posts (and ignored most) as i simply dont currently have the time to give this topic all the attention it requires right now.i agree with the main arguments against removing local in that it would move the game balance quite drastically towards favoring the attacker. i won't go into all that again - it has already been covered. however, i do see the general frustration with local, and perhaps it's possible to come up with some sort of ""middle way""?so here's an idea that might be good or bad: imagine local is ""updated"" by either having people using gates into the system, taking aggressive action or flying capitals.also, imagine a module coming in 3 sizes (frig, cruiser and bs). this module would have a rather high cpu and power requirement limiting the striking capability of the ship it's fitted to, but it would allow you to jump to planets and stars within range without using either gates, jumpbridges or cynos.the range is could then be 0.3 light years per rank of some skill invented for the purpose.finally this module would have some restrictions on use: you can't fit a cloak on the same ship as this module and you can't activate the module for a period of 30 minutes after taking aggressive action.the idea of this being to give raiders some sort of ""first strike/surprise"" capability - but at a cost. after attacking you can't cloak or use this ""supercyno"" module for an extended period of time, making you somewhat vulnerable to the defensive response.personally, i would also like to see the logoffski trick hampered by letting ships fitted with this module remain in space for 30 minutes after logoff (me no like logoffskis).i haven't exactly thought this one through, but the idea might be worth some consideration."
4/25/2008,i am tired of saying it all over again but:local needs to die (without replacement)buff the scannerthats it... repeat that for 5 years ... and here we are ... sad isnt it???ccp utterly failed on instas removement so i hardly see anything cool coming out of this change.
4/25/2008,"hat off to you, sir!a very nice post and damn solid arguments.count me amongst the supporters."
4/25/2008,"thank you sinnae, very much appreciated."
4/26/2008,"if those advocating the removal of local would answer a couple of quick questions from me it would allow everyone to make a more informed decision. for many years now we've seen ccp make some decisions to change the game only to have a patch a short while later to ""fix"" some ""unintended consequence"" of their ""improvement"". 1. if local is removed how are solo players who operate in 0.0 supposed to live there anymore and enjoy the benefits of 0.0 space while staying as solo players? given the increased risk of ganking when you warp into a gate and have no idea if someone is there or not (like a 30 ship pirate blob) i would think the enjoyment of the game by these solo players would be greatley diminished. i also think they would flee back to empire where they can ""see"" whats around them.2. on long distance trips thru 0.0 space are you supposed to stop and ""scan"" the system now everytime you jump with some new ""sonar module"" sort of thing? how long would this take? it basically ends autopilot if you have to stop everytime you jump and do this.jade's idea is great if we want to change this into eve-alliance-online and have everyone join an alliance so we can all fly around in a battlegroup and scan out the enemy. the reality is far different for many in eve however and i don't believe making changes to the game which basically lead the solo players to the altar of sacrifice and gankarmageddon is the answer. not everyone is in an alliance and can do these things. likewise even if people are in an alliance maybe they're not some battle hungry alliance of pvp killers. maybe they're peaceful mining industrialist carebears venturing into 0.0 to make their fortune. not everyone in eve is looking for endless pvp and ""wild times"".while something like that may not be intended by removing local i do believe it would be another in the long line of ""unintended consequences"" to ccp patches and ""improvements"". those two questions above stand for anyone willing to take a shot at them. if a compelling argument can be made i'll listen. but i'm going on the experience of someone with nearly 6 years in eve counting beta who has played the solo game in 0.0 and knows the reality of ""flying alone out there"". now there is something that no one has brought up however (that surprises me). what if in 0.0 space any war declared enemy doesnt appear in local? you can see everyone else (like those 15 guys with -10.0 sec status) but if you're corporation is wardec'd you can't see those enemies. i mean if people want the thrill of the hunt and chase why not this? it gives that hunt and chase to those who want it while keeping the status quo for those who don't.even so i do see something like this causing pvp to slow down quite a bit as corps are reduced to ""scanning and jumping... scanning and jumping"" to accomplish anything. sounds kind of boring to me.archbishop"
4/26/2008,"some of these issues have definitely been addressed in this thread already archbishop but just to provide a decent summary to your points: 1. the removal of local will not really change the solo dynamic negatively in 0.0. at the moment lone-players dont really move with perfect freedom archie. sure you can warp to outbound - but each time you jump through the gate you take the same risk you outline for the local-less scenario. how do you know you arent jumping through into a sensor-boosted / hic/rapier camp? you dont, thats eve. how do you escape? well, speed, cloaks, ew? maneuverability. pretty much the same evasion tools you'd need now if you jump to a gate and get caught by a bubble off gate. only difference is that when warping to an outbound you can opt to go to scan point and check first. when jumping through a gate you don't have that option (and that is the current status quo).at least with the scenario you outline (warping to a gate) you have an option of moving with scanner open and being pre-warned (or warping to close celestial and checking)  or if its a common route for you then by all means make a line of in-line scan points 1000 klicks or so form the outbound and be warned of the gate status. doing this gives you more information and warning than the process of simply jumping through the gate without scout does now.2. if you read the suggestion were talking about a new form of long range scanner that is always on and can be configured to give proximity warnings on the acquisition of new contacts. yes of course, going to outbound scanpoints as a precaution would break your autopilot but seriously, who uses autopilot in 0.0 archbishop?3. i dont think your previous points support this concept turning eve into alliance online  on the contrary i believe that reducing the perfect map intelligence and local monitoring functionality will reduce the ability of alliances to control and dominate space and will allow solo/small group players far greater opportunity to evade and exist in 0.0 without continual interference from sitting powers. at the moment any ratting/mining op can be seen by everyone in eve by scanning the map. discovering the presence of interlopers is ridiculously easy just by scanning through local with a quick trip. reduce intelligence functionality and you are making it easy for the little guy to evade notice and isn't that really what you were worried about?anyway, thanks for your comments archbishop and i hope you'll read the feedback to your points with an open mind.all the best."
4/26/2008,good writeup.
4/26/2008,"something that hardin wrote caught my attention here.to paraphrase he noted that less information equated to a less safe environment - the options then being to stay in a safe area, or to seek safety in numbers: thus reducing the viability of 'solo' play.its a sound argument in that respect, which might point us towards solutions.i know ive mentioned the aspect of 'terrain' in terms of system space as an important factor, but ill detract on this for a minute and talk about concentration of force.if we think of the scanner perhaps it should detect not just individual elements (such as ships) but the combined effect of large numbers of ships in one location. for example, the scanner might act to detect 'mass signature' readings created by ships in close proximity to one another.in essence the scanner would actually show blobs as, well blobs of mass on ""radar"". this might be fairly simple to calculate by totaling the signature radius of all ships within a given grid for example.now, to bring back my thoughts on 'terrain' we can then add an overlay of backround noise and interferance around certain objects / environments in space. where this background noise is strong individual ships would be lost amongst the clutter but larger ships / 'blobs' of ships would still be apparent.furthering this subject we can consider the popular 'active vs passive' scanning method. here we might imagine an active 'ping' clearing away a certain amount of background noise (albiet at the cost of a higher signature radius) within a narrow arc of view and range.even more tantalising we can see the prospect of 'camoflaging' your ship for specific environments through the use of specialised modules, or the creation of probes that produce false images of high mass concetrations.edit: visual representationany thoughts on this?c."
4/26/2008,"do you ever log in, jade?"
4/26/2008,"mmmhmmm, but generally quite late in the us tz at the moment lavista, i don't often play in the uk tz unless we've got an arranged op. drop me a pm on the sf forums (or shc) if you want to arrange a chat."
4/26/2008,this is a brilliant idea!
4/26/2008,yes it is isnt it - anti blob too when you think about it.c.
4/26/2008,"agreed to a point although lets look at it a moment from the aspect of the stationary solo/small alliance player in a system. lets say the abc mining corp is out mining in 0.0 and has 3-4 mining ships or even a rorqual and 2 guys in ravens to defend against belt rats and they're just minding their own business. with the current local system if 10 pirates jump into system they'll be seen. with no local that warning is gone. sure some proximity sensors might help and the two defending ravens could swap a high end weapon for a ""scanner"" to keep scanning but why then would this be any different from what we have now.that's sort of the point i'm making here. with an improved sensor system it's really no different from current local. people are supporting a revamped sensor and map system to help aid the local ""benefits"" lost yet why even dump local if we're going to offer totally usable substitutes? in the end that's the hidden point of my message. either they'll be big changes or it isn't a change at all and i have to agree with some that ccp doesn't move in big steps. in the end i think the abandonment of 0.0 by alot of solo and small alliance players would happen, i believe we'd see alot more gatecamping and alot more ganking and in the end no real improvement.i do agree with you jade that local was never intended to become an early warning system. that's what's evolved though and thats what we've had for five plus years. while we can tweak it a bit, maybe make it so war declared enemies don't appear or something, in the end i just don't think it's wise to mess with.i will agree with you on dumping the map inteligence. likewise i don't believe the map should be used for intel. maps are for convenience not recon. when i'm driving down the highway and looking at a map it tells me theres a gas station at the next exit but it doesn't give me the price per gallon of gas. yes dump the map intel and while they're at it make the map only informational. things like services are great but info like pilots in system, corp member locations, podkills, etc are only intel based. who gives us that intel? it isn't realistic.that said i'd support an alternative. what if (even without sovereignty) a corporation could deploy ""spy satellites"" that could monitor a system gate? you could only deploy a few of them per corp but you could put them where you believe your enemy is operating. they'd require maintenance and would shut down after awhile. it would require special skills to operate and the benefit would be more ""realistic"" then some all seeing map we can pull up.this would be good. you could detect a 20 ship pirate gatecamp before you warp in on top of them at least.good discussion everyone!archie"
4/26/2008,"this is a good example to work with. with local, the pirate scout jumps in, sees players in system, and starts hunting for them. the mining op sees someone pop into local, and knows something might be up.with a scanner-based system the pirate jumps into system and doesn't know if anyone is there and the mining op doesn't know anyone jumped into system. now the pirate starts searching for pings on his sonar. he gets a hit - but at the same time the mining op gets a ping too, and the game is on. they both have imperfect information.now in your example the mining op would actually do better to station their guards at the stargates leading into the sytem. then when a pirate scout jumps in, they see him, but he still doesn't know where the mining op is located, and the battle becomes a system-wide situation with a front at the stargate while the mining op in the belt has to start making decisions about what action to take, as intel comes in from the front lines.this sort of scenario is just more dynamic and has more possibilities than the current local chat list. it's not that an improved scanner system would be either identical to local or just not as good - it's that an improved scanner has a wider range of dynamic possibilities than local for how intel plays into conflict.your question about ""if local is just getting replaced by something that does the same thing, why bother replacing it?"" is understandable - but the real reason local needs to be replaced is not that intel is bad, it's that it's a static system.imagine eve was a game with a single class of ships that are all fast and powerful. then someone suggests getting rid of that single class of ships and instead introducing some ships that are light and fast but fragile, and other ships that are heavier and well-armored, but slower. the same question you raise could be asked then: ""why take away our ships that do everything if you're just replacing them with two different classes of ships that amount to the same thing?"" the answer is to make the game more dynamic.replacing the static tool of local with a more dynamic tool that can range from being superior to local intel to inferior, depending on how it is used, will make the intel side of eve more dynamic and more fun. that's what i'd like to see happen anyway."
4/27/2008,"id agree here.the current system is akin to being on a flat becalmed lake. the players 'view' is essentially limitless in terms of 'who' is there. however if we add storms, squalls of rain, mist and fog banks to this lake the picture changes and becomes more dynamic and requires more skill as a result.c."
4/27/2008,"but with this example you are showing that you need far more people to do the same op. now i havent mined since '04 so please dont tell me im getting it wrong, im just using it as an example.in the first instance you have a 3-4 miners and 1-2 guards + possibly a hauler or two. thats max 8 people. now if you remove local, you need someone one each gate, and in most average systems thats another two people so we are up to 10 and everyones profits decrease. now someone warps in, the scouts on the gate tell them someone ebil has appeared and they all get to a safe spot.the game has become no more dynamic, the results are the same, accept you have just made the game a little less fun for everyone. 2 people have spent their evenings staring at a star gate, and the miners have made less money because of it. now mineral prices will rise, pirates will start whining that their ships are more expensive...you get my drift."
4/27/2008,"or you introduce another mechanic. a perimeter beacon, spy satellite, call it what you want. but it gets dropped by a member of the mining gang at the star gate. that gang member can now go elsewhere in the system, maybe mine, maybe keep the rats away but he gets an alert as soon as someone enters that gate."
4/27/2008,"existing in 0.0 would indeed require more vigilance without local, i don't deny that. but again, it's as though battleships were great ewar platforms, and then ccp introduces dedicated ewar ships and downgrades the battleships' ewar potential - people might complain that they're just requiring them to have more pilots in a gang in order to use ewar, but creating specializations in the end makes the game better, even if it's more ""work"".if, in our mining op example, having ""eyes"" for the op was something advantageous then maybe recon probes could be changed to act as those 'spy beacons' that max brought up. the mining op could hire a covops pilot to keep probes up covering the gates to passively detect anyone entering the system and give an early warning to the mining op before the pirates know the op even exists."
4/27/2008,"any replacement of local needs to be well worked-out so that it does not shift balance around too much, but nevertheless manages to add excitement to the game for everyone.one more idea for the pile.how about being able to automatically detect certain warp signatures as well, with the chance of your ship detecting it increasing if the ship emitting the signature is heading straight towards you.(makes sense from a science standpoint, warp drive emits ftl particles, if it heads straight to/away from you your scanner will detect abnormal amounts of those particles coming from the same direction)"
4/27/2008,"an interesting idea.a: pirate sits quietly at a belt ready to ambush his prey.b: miner sits at a belt, sees a warp drive spike on scanner - time to flee!= works for both parties. certainly worthy of consideration anke'.c.ps: please someone fix these forums this has taken three attempts just to post a reply!"
4/27/2008,"ive given up... i had a long post and it wouldnt let me post it.edit - now its let me post that, trying to see if i can get the other post posted, i cant be bothered to type it all out again but the gist was:if you do this, then what is the point, you have just removed local, onlt to replace it with something that acts just like local, but requires more effort.whats wrong with more effort you might ask? fun. this is a game, its not a second job. i will draw another comparason within this game. there was talk about people having cyno blockers up 23/7 in every system which ccp didnt like. they were talking about making it having to be refueled every 12 hours or similar.that would have achieved nothing appart from making people feel this is a job rather than a game. it wouldnt have taken the cyno blockers down, it would have just caused the alliances to spend their entire lives fueling it - and making them hate the game for making them do it.removing local will cause the same if you replace it with a time consuming alternative - people will just do that alternative, hate the time consuming nature of it, get bored of eve and play less or leave. (yes thats rather extreme, but im just making my point)if you want to make eve 'harder' remove local entirely. i wont be happy, it think it will be a griefers paradise. however the alternative is to remove local, replace it with a silly time consuming scanner system which will annoy people who will do it to try and stay safe, and nothing will change appart from everyone enjoying themselves less."
4/27/2008,yeah its a pain - do what i do and copy the whole thing before you post it.c.
4/27/2008,"how does the miner know the warp drive spike is not just his hauler coming back to the belt, leaving the belt, a friendly moving through the system, a friendly ratter in another belt.etc etc etc etc."
4/27/2008,"i like jades's ideas on this matter. a lone hunter in say a battleship would have a snowballs chance of getting somewhere out in null space, if he knows his stuff. meanwhile the, smart ratter/miner can hide off the beaten trail and be pretty safe. all the morons in the alliance will be huddled around the 3-4 systems with the best spawns and the best ore. guess where the hunter(s) goes looking first?"
4/27/2008,"csm's take notelocal soulution is simpleanyone in local can warp to anyone with the rules....1. you cannot warp to cov ops, perhaps probe em out with a long delay (which is long enough to catch afk cov ops)2. warping to a non-cov ops cloak ship puts you in grid at a random distace (distance to be balanced on test server)3. you cannot warp to someone in deadspace. probe em out as usual.bingo - local is no longer stupid. if you see someone in local, you can get a fight out of them if its 0.0 rather than the current cloak*** tactics and afk intel bot tactics.also nerfs all isk farmers as well as all intel bots !think about it. whats wrong with warping to anyone in local? nothing and this will remove all nevitive local problems as well."
4/27/2008,"you make a valid point in all honesty but the scenario i posted was is answer to a specific question about miners and what they could do to remain safe. the alternative there was to use either alts or mains dedicated to watching gates.i think we need to peel this back and refocus on why people want to change local. then discuss again encompassing all scenarios. i really do not think there is a one size fits all solution to this. thanks for your point of view, it's extremely valid."
4/27/2008,"i think local has come to the fore for a number of reasons.obviously players dont want to get ganked by overwhelming numbers: the tactic of scouting ahead witha lone ship, whilst having a massive fleet a jump or two out is now well used and understood. warp core stabs, having been nerfed, provide little hope to players now (in fact virtually no one fits them compared to 2 years ago) - a factor exaccerbated by hics.so how does a player escape the gank? well he cant - his only option is to run as soon as a hostile appears: even just one hostile because of the risk of further ships 'over the horizon'. bacon is a good example of the pressing need for immediate intel in this regard.and this applies both ways: the scout can immediately see if its worth attempting a hunt in a given system.so we have a stalemate: the hunters get fewer and fewer 'hunting kills' and so resort to gatecamping, hotdrops or logon traps typically utilising overwhelming force (blobs).even if both sides are pvp 'centric the fights dont occur as everyone is busy tallying up numbers in local to achieve superiority of numbers. thats a cyclical effect with fleets growing and growing until one side 'looses' the tally and docks up, runs to a pos or just logs off for the night.at least thats my view - others may disagree. c."
4/28/2008,"i say, ban bacon, keep local and all you whiners about local out there, shut up cause you will whine when its gone and you keep getting ganked"
4/28/2008,"we've had local since the game began, why should we change something that is so established.i really am sick of the nerf this nerf that, get rid of this, do this, don't do that attitude of the player base it really has gotten out of hand.everything in this game can be overcome, used to your advantage if you just think about how you play instead of crying about it.it's so easy to get kills even with local if you just use a bit of common sense, this game has been dumbed down a lot in the last year or so it's not the game i signed on for, which is probably why i don't play as much as i used to anymore.get over yourselves and get on with the game, yes the game sheesh."
4/28/2008,"agreed jade. i am so tired of not being able to kill anything because as soon as i enter local everyone and their mother warps out of the belt and cloaks.. or if i bring a gang of 5, the gang of 3 cloaks because they know i am a gang of 5 if they can at all count. this would also help to fix scouts in a station 5 jumps down the pipe rousing the blob as soon as we get close, so /signed"
4/28/2008,"what everyone forgets is that this is just a game and you are supposed to have fun, not make it complicated to be as realistic as real life is. so ...local as it is today:you jump in sys, you know if there is hostiles in it and how much. you dont know where in sys they are, what ship they are in, are they active or not, so you have to scan them and look for them. removing local:you jump in sys, you dont know if there is any1 there, but you scan the whole sys hoping there would be some1 to fight ...now considering avarage play time is 2-3 hours per day (my guess) you can cover well over 20 jumps looking for fights. you may find some ... removing local and making you scan all the sys you enter you would be able to cover maybe 10 sys, just maybe.so removing local will in that way decrease your chance to find trouble (fight) (do pvp).2. the lone rater/miner in 0.0. this kind of player is pve fitted, hostiles entering sys will be pvp fitted. removing local will make that player spam ""scan"" button in order to survive. hostile who entered sys looking for targets know that the most probable place to find one is in belts. that means that the player rating/mining will see the hostile on scan who is already warping to him, checking the belts, and wont have time to escape. miner/rater will have even lower chances of survival if the hostile gang enters sys, the bigger the gang, less chance of survival as they can check belts in one sweep ... reading posts in this topic and others concernig removal of local i noticed its all about making your fleet invisible and undetected by enemy. imo 0.0 isn't just about fleet vs fleet, and gate camps ... i dont mind if local gets changed as long as there is some other early warning system that gives solo player equal chances of surviving as the hunter will have of finding/killing him.ps: spelling :p"
4/28/2008,"we're seeing a lot of the same comments popping up in relation to this issue. personally i think it's just a misunderstanding of what is being suggested and why, so this is my take on clearing some of that up:1) misconception: replacing local is being suggested in order to favor one group or playstyle over another.in truth, replacing local is being suggested to increase dynamism in the intel aspect of the game. it's the difference between an rts with a fog of war and one without - adding a fog of war doesn't shift the balance of power, it affects all parties equally.the pirate will be affected by the same limitations and have the same options to gather intel as the miner or the mega-alliance member.2) misconception: if the balance of power will stay the same, why bother changing it at all? it's just more work!replacing local with a dynamic scouting/scanning intel system would be adding a new layer to the game. it opens up new weapons tools and tactics to be used in the intel battle that takes place prior to the combat battle. so although balance wouldn't be affected in a political sense, the possibilities for gaining and losing advantage would be widened and a more complex game resulting.3) misconception: the op's proposal is to simply remove local.many straw man arguments can be concocted centering around doomsday scenarios that would result from simply shutting off local tomorrow and seeing what happens. but what jade asks in the op's story is that we open our imaginations to the possibilities of trading our static local intel for something more dynamic and layered, that can be as simple or as elegant or as complex as we can imagine. let's not assume that players would be ""forced to sit and hit scan every five seconds"" when we can easily imagine a revamped scanner that automatically and constantly scans for us. since the possibilities are wide open, let us not be deterred by 'what is' when we can concieve of a better 'what may be'."
4/28/2008,"i can't help but respond to this. you actually believe the game is currently hard? i've been almost as long as you and essentially started over now but for a universe that is supposed to be brutal and unforgiving, they sure put in alot of get rich quick elements over the years.i don't think i am alone in having my jaw drop to the floor at this. considering this is how every major group (including cva) plays what do you mean by 'fall back'? this is being done already anyway. short of a few players, i very rarely see any cva 'come out to play' without significantly greater numbers on their side. i can understand this to a degree. people hate to lose and love to win. having larger numbers reduces risk and effectively ensures the win but it also removes all semblance of tactical planning. unfortunately, the state of eve currently encourages and promotes this.yes, lets leave large regions of space controlled groups that have now become complacent, paranoid and lazy. that works much better.while i'm not 100% behind all jade's ideas, i do like the direction of the ideas. some people say this particular idea prevents soloing in dangerous areas. well gosh golly, what a thought. if i am going alone into a bad neighborhood that isn't patrolled at all by law enforcement, isn't it reasonable to expect a very high level of confrontation and danger? go into that same place with a large group, the threat level lowers.i do not believe i am the only one who misses the 'risk' from the beginning days of eve. as the *****ing and moaning dragged on over the years, ccp made things far too easy and more forgiving and by doing so, took away from some of the themed elements. now i am going to pick on hardin and cva some more as i have more experience with them (purely from an outside point of view) but they also make a good example. here you have an alliance that appears, by just their own manpower, to be able to manage 100-150 players on average for an active fleet. factor in their allies, you could see about 200-250 on average. yet they maintain and control an entire region of systems that is quite large in size. does that make any sense compared to the npc empires? yes, player driven ones are done in a different context but look how easy it is now to pull this off. you would expect large areas should be controlled by large alliances that have the manpower and organization to do so. however, items and ships now exist to make it feasible for groups to do this without much thought which make it feel alot like munchkin gaming. i see this idea as one extra step to recapturing some of the elements that made us want to join eve."

4/28/2008,"please visit your user settings to re-enable images.csm manifesto 2008 - jade constantine eve online is a very special game. love it or hate it, (and sometimes both at the same time) we all acknowledge it has something unique that keeps us coming back, keeps us training those skills, evolving with the technology, fighting our virtual foes and chasing the dreams so beautifully envisioned in every fabric of this engaging and utterly ruthless mmorpg.its about the universe: its big, its brutal, and its totally uncompromising. its filled with predators and bullies, rivals and spies, assassins, psychopaths, patriots and the occasional hero. the environment can grind ambitions to dust and send you packing with relentless, terrible cruelty; you can see your hopes broken, corporations and alliances crushed and devastated, you can witness fantastically expensive and rare spaceships burning and annihilated before your astonished eyes and the work of years undone in moments in a frenzy of betrayal and intrigue that wouldnt be out of place in the darkest espionage novels of the cold war.but all this matters; its remembered. because eve is a single universe with a single history, and whether we play villains or heroes or driven individuals just trying to survive, our stories remain. talk about eve and you talk about eve. talk about the death of the phoenix alliance in the gnw of 2004 and you are talking about something everyone of that age lived through. talk about the great war and its a subject with a common frame of reference for all eve players - our characters are not lost in an endless repeating mirrored maze of shards and instances and duplicate game-worlds, they stand their place in the one universe and as they succeed or fail they leave their mark in the virtual history. to play eve is to live eve and experience the aggregate accomplishment of a hundred thousand players who have come and gone in this same universe before you.eve is unique amongst online games; a single virtual world where consequence and reputation are universal and accomplishment is absolute. its a rare treasure and compelling vision, and truly something worth fighting to preserve.the state of the artmy favourite review of eve online in any medium remains the brief quote from pcgamer magazine that is repeated each month in the top games column:a slow burning, complex and utterly beautiful mmorpg. live that iain m. banks dream.those words have always done an excellent job of summing up for me the player what i see in the game of eve online and how i describe my hobby to non-gamers and people fascinated by this strange universe where i play a green-haired pseudo-french revolutionary back-lit by a demonic red glow of shipboard machinery.i grew up with iain m. banks, you see; i read his great reinvention of the golden age space opera novel consider phlebas when i first started university and was smitten by the visions of vast star-faring civilizations at war with energies putting the suns to shame and wasting planets and space stations and vast fleets of warships in a bitter ideological war for domination. as a novel it works on so many levels: it has a sense of wonder and scale and terrible devastation, it has very human protagonists, spaceship fights and flights, rogues ducking and diving beneath the notice of near-omnipotent artificial intelligences and the sense that the wider universe is shifting in the chaos of total war while the characters chase their own ambitions with single-minded energy.eve online is precisely that."
4/28/2008,"as i fly jades customised warship of choice through the chaos of border systems in providence i know that elsewhere in the single universe capital vessels are dying in sieges and traps, battleship fleets are clashing for the ambition of their captains and leaders, blockade-running smugglers are taking the wealth of 0.0 back to the core markets for profit, religious zealots are clashing with their victims, traders are falling for scams and petty intrigues, and war profiteers are counting their profits while dreaming of plans to hurt their enemies a hundred systems away with complex schemes within schemes in this interconnected universe of bitter chance and endless possibility.the universe is vast and the cast of combatants, friends, enemies and neutrals just trying to make their own way is immense. it has a sense of scale that all other games lack, but ive never once felt irrelevant in this setting. ive never lost the sense of wonder just looking at my starship in the void and wondering what can happen. never doubted that words can persuade and spark conflict, never forgotten that the right actions at the right time can be the fulcrum of accomplishment and change the whole virtual universe for better or worse. we are tiny specks against the tapestry of stars but our characters are everything an individual yearns to be or darkly dreams of becoming, every deed has consequence, every act of violence impacts the collective balance, every betrayal can be repaid and vengeance (though rarely swift) is always a shadow rising on the windward horizon.any eve character can rise to found an empire (or destroy one). any can strive to be the most famed warrior, the deadliest pirate, the most loathed betrayer, the great statesman and peacemaker or the hair-trigger protagonist of the war that destroys the ambitions and hopes of thousands united under the fragile banners of territorial pride. all we need is wit and will (and a little luck) and some sweet words of persuasion and the universe of eve opens up before us. just like the characters in consider phlebas well be immortalised with our shining moments of choice in the heart of the political maelstrom without. a lot of words, i admit. but then what less does one say about a game thats kept the interest for five years and still occupies an iron grip on gaming choice and preference?truth is eve is a seductive and addictive mistress with alluring smile and flashing eyes and a cruelty beneath the surface of her moods like rocks beneath the sometimes placid ocean. its not just about numbers and nerfing and units and balancing. its not about whether we side with pirates or mission runners, or traders, or tech2 cartels or whatnot. its not about whether we give advantages to side x,y,z in whatever war is raging. and its not a popularity contest between counterstrike players dueling rapid-fire frags in the neon glow of their monitor screens.no, its deeper than that. eve is a game but its also a passion and a place of shared community, imagination and enjoyment. the other players in your corporation or alliance, those names in text or voices in ventrilo, come to mean a lot more than the players of other games that came and went and got sequels and burned out their licenses while eve was still maturing and evolving. eve continues and the friendships and camaraderie we make in this game mean something. were sharing something special; were building a community and the trust and friendships that come from teamwork, mutual interest and collective imagination."
4/28/2008,"the council of stellar managementwith this document im hoping to seduce you into voting for me to represent the eve community on the founding council of stellar management (csm).its an important position and this inaugural council is going to be under the spotlight for its manner, its own accomplishments and its general approach to the task at hand. its going to be highly controversial in some ways (we all know this), there are going to be debates and arguments, and there are a lot of improvements that need making. were going to see big alliances dominate the proceedings on pure number base; were going to see special interest groups arguing for radical re-balancing of core mechanics, well see cults of the personality and superstars arise in the player domain and were going to see ccp publicise the new oversight and capitalise on player involvement to improve tarnished aspects of their reputation. some good some bad, some scandal and some genuine improvements are possible, but ultimately we have an opportunity here to find a voice and take responsibility for pushing the game of eve in the directions we want to see it go, and thats got to be a good thing.but what i want to make sure is that in all the politics and alliance interest and ego-polishing there is a representation for the player who, like me, truly loves that iain m. banks dream and finds the imaginative potential of this gorgeous single server environment as strong today as it ever was five years ago and will fight with every breath for the continuation and enhancement of that splendid vision. i love this dark and dangerous universe with an adult twist of nihilism and intrigue; i adore the battlefields strewn with the wrecks of a thousand ships and the sweet taste of victory made sweeter yet for the memory of defeats in times before. eve is a game where a player can make a name and reputation and rise from obscurity to command the attention and notice of the universe. i did it once and it was the greatest ride of my gaming life. now i want to make sure that every new player starting out in this game has the same potential and opportunities i had and that eve continues to be the truly open sandbox environment where everything is possible for the reckless and the wise alike.apologies then for the long preamble but i thought it best we make sure a compatibility of imagination, vision and outlook exists before we get into the nitty-gritty of the policies and interests ill be presenting below. if youve come with me this far then i think we might be onto something, you and i; maybe we wont agree on everything (who does?) but you will at least understand why im going to say the things i do below and all id ask is that you think a while with an open mind and cast your vote with conscience after considering all the options and possibilities before you. and i wont be offended if the vision of chaos and destruction scares you a little bit, but really, dont we all enjoy being scared from time to time?csm policy advocacylets get something clear from the beginning. im not going to promise to be all things to all people, other candidates will do that and if you like the safety-blanket of a universal trust me ive got all your best interests at heart message you might not find my politics entirely to your taste.i have enthusiasms and interests of my own you see; i have things i care about and wish to see improved and promoted within the environment of eve online. i imagine that makes me an unwise politician in the context of the csm elections but it does at least ensure that you are going to see well in advance exactly what you are going to be getting from my candidacy if you choose to trust me your vote. so here goes:"
4/28/2008,"enhancing dynamism in 0.0 space warfarethere is a problem with the current empire building and endgame conflict engine in eve. pos structures for sovereignty, the prevalence of cyno jammers strangling open space and nullifying entire ship classes, the danger of indestructible outpost spam in 0.0 cheapening the business (and risk) of establishing territorial roots. at present, the speed of territorial conquest in 0.0 has slowed to a crawl with dynamics akin to the trench warfare of ww1 with fixed positions and machine gun nests dominating the landscape. its stopped being fun, its stopped being accessible, its become a typical mmorpg grind which is a cardinal sin for a game that was designed from the ground up to avoid typical boring grind gameplay in its fluid sandbox environment.the art and vision of eve the epic space opera has been damaged by the introduction of empire-building elements prioritizing defence and safety and consequence-free building in what is supposed to be the most hazardous environment in the game universe. the dark and dangerous 0.0 void where all can be lost to war and fate has changed to sim-city-in-space where all you need to defend your interests is to keep towers fuelled 24/7 and ensure your cyno jammer is anchored at the nastiest pos tower configuration possible. small scale territorial conflict is not practical anymore since the defence advantage is so vast that massive assets are required to assault even the smallest 0.0 landholders. in essence, the balance between attack and defence has gone wrong and needs to be adjusted.1. the cyno jammer module needs to be addressed urgently. they should never be the kind of starbase module that one anchors in each system in 0.0, flicks the on-switch, and never needs to worry about maintenance or priority ever again. at the moment the game encourages each alliance to anchor these things *everywhere* and in doing so encourages precisely the kind of massive numerical fleet warfare that the game infrastructure clearly cannot handle.nobody enjoys laggy blob warfare. but that is exactly the kind of fighting required to make any kind of progress against the ubiquitous cyno jammer defended pocket empires across the map right now. for eve to reach its beautiful potential as a space-conflict simulator with grand fleets clashing in vital engagements across multiple fronts in 0.0 as empires rise and fall the developers need to take a serious look at the implications of all pos technology in general and the jump-blocking cyno jammer module as an item of the highest priority.2. make outposts vulnerable to destruction. for some this is a taboo subject. the idea that a multi-billion isk investment in fixed infrastructure in 0.0 should be destroyable in some fashion frankly horrifies some residents of nullsec and the alliances there, but really, isnt it contrary to eves nature that its possible to build something in open space and have it stand as an indestructible monument forever more? where is the accomplishment in building a station if it cannot be destroyed if your forces are defeated? where is the drama and the grandeur of a desperate defence if the aggressors cannot burn and pillage your possessions and obliterate your dreams in a cataclysm of fire and fury?"
4/28/2008,"and, less poetically  what happens to eve when all of 0.0 is covered in indestructible outposts at some point in the future? when there are so many of these structures that nobody considers them worth defending and they remain as empty shells bereft of purpose or emotional meaning. my point is that for something to have value, it has to have vulnerability  to build and maintain an outpost should be an accomplishment and defending such things should be a major endeavour and never involve lets go to empire and bore the aggressors and return and put up more towers to get it back in 3 months time when theyve gone away again. players risk more total isk loss in the hull and fittings of motherships and titans, the game of eve doesnt need indestructible capture the flag gameplay in 0.0 space.3. introduce competitive mobile infrastructure. the balance of power in 0.0 has tipped wildly in favour of the fixed territorial paradigm. all technology and advantages encourage (and necessitate) the establishment of static base building and sovereignty maintenance. this forces players through one single set of hoops if they want to reach the highest tech levels and end content for the game. the problem is that it damages eves original vision as a player-led creative sandbox for open experimentation and diversity of playstyles. sure, we need territorial empires and tyrants and star bases and exclusion zones, but they are just one part of the ecosystem - they should never be the only option.where are the cloaked pirate bases? the mobile refineries? the guerrilla resistance movements operating from converted freighters in enemy space? smugglers and blockade runners, spies and assassins, rogue traders and loners scraping an existence from the underbelly of these empires? there should be advantages for the fixed power, but there should be options and alternatives for the mobile force. a balance needs to be rediscovered and the high level content options for eve need to be widened and made more diverse to maintain its appeal for existing and new players. owning sovereignty 4 and an invulnerable outpost should not be the universal endgame for every organisation in eve.4. encourage diversity in pvp engagement opportunity. deriving from all the above. the challenge for the csm and game direction in general is how to raise the beautiful pvp combat aspect of eve online from its current doldrums to a new height of variety and enjoyable opportunity. combat in 0.0 currently is about pos warfare and siege or securing gates during pos siege. there really isnt anything else of value to attack or defend. the stated intention of delivering midrange targets for small unit pvp needs to be revisited and made to work this time. infrastructure items need removed from pos gun proximity  pos themselves need re-working from the swiss army knife tool they are now to things with variety and specialisation. moon mining towers should not be as difficult to attack as sovereignty claiming defence towers. elements in the defence grid like system scanners, jump bridges and cyno jammers should be vulnerable structures in their own right  not simply modules spammed out within the universal aegis of the ubiquitous death star pos."
4/28/2008,"new environments and precious items need to be found and secured, in-game hacking of defensive objects, counter-siege deployable objects (anti cyno jammers!), forward bases, warp range standoff batteries; even using asteroids as weapons! basically, we need more places and environments in which to fight and reasons to do the fighting there. diversity and variety are the spice of life and eve combat in 0.0. give players a diversity of targets and multiple objectives in war and skirmish and youll make valuable progress in the fight to reduce dependence on blob-warfare.promoting improvement and variety in empire warfarewhile the 0.0 dynamic in conflict has benefited from a vast amount of developer attention over the years, the core mechanics of empire war and the conflicts and smaller battles between predators and vigilantes on the verges of policed space has received virtually none. at core these tiny struggles between pirate and victim, between small corporations fighting turf wars over lowsec assets and trading slights, these conflicts in empire between rivals and bounty hunters searching for profit in the slaying of illegals are every bit as important as the vast games of empires raging in deep 0.0. these conflicts are the content that attract and maintain new players and enrich the environment for all of us.not every eve player has the desire or ambition to fight vast fleet battles; some prefer their pvp in small unit scale, some like the thrill of lone hunting, and there is a whole ecology of stainless steel rats living in the wainscoting of eves society between the safe zones of core empire and the high-pressure sovereignty war of player-controlled 0.0. and this is not mere minority interest; this is a major area of the game for many, many people. not everyone who plays eve is a 24/7 alliance warrior in it for the alarm clock pos sieges and black-screen lag clashes for the honour of the supreme commander of their coalition. empire conflict is important and it needs advocacy at the csm to ensure it gets the attention and developer support it needs to reach real potential.1. piracy, bounties and transferable kill rights. there are some very simple but compelling ideas doing the circuits of the eve ideas and suggestions forums. allowing surrender for victims (powering down of weapons), allowing pirates to shoot to disable (ie disable a ship rather than destroying it when it runs out of structure); both great ideas, that would immeasurably enrich that career choice. and as for transferable kill rights - its a brilliant concept. if you get killed by an illegal in empire, you get a kill right on the aggressor. why shouldnt you be able to sell that kill right to a 3rd party bounty hunter (who must be +sec status)?"
4/28/2008,"so lets go a step further and allow the sold killright to function as a special kind of location agent that lets the bounty hunter track down the illegal and take a shot to deliver a form of justice to the victim. its neat, its simple, and it brings another form of pvp to the game and will make eve more exciting for pirates and bounty hunters both. (oh yes, and make it so bounty can only be collected by the person who owns the kill right. no more self-termination by alts for profit.) successful completion of a kill right contract by an accredited hunter gets lps from concord and can buy special, pretty things from the lp shop. thats right, missions that trigger pvp  why not? its this kind of idea we should be exploring to widen the appeal of the game and break the obsession/domination of massive slug fests only.2. enhanced corporate strife, open mercenary contracts. the war-dec system in eve is pretty ancient now and a very blunt stick. its largely unchanged since the beginning of the game five years ago. one side picks a target, votes or selects the enemy, pays the fee and corporate / alliance warfare begins. there are no win conditions save blowing up ships / outlasting the endurance of declarer  no real structure, no penalty for doing hideously badly or award for doing well. at the minimum we could do with some kind of corporate / alliance statistic showing their ratio of wins / losses / ship tonnage / efficiency just to know who was really terrible at conflict and who did well (very important for merc corporations credibility). but what we really need are terms of the fighting  is it to kill ships? is it to drive the target from xyz system? is it to reduce target membership? is it to destroy a pos? is it to protect / nullify somebody elses wardec? there needs to be some variety and there needs to be a penalty for failing in the objective. i remember five years ago noticing the surrender option in the war panel and wondering what the cost was going to be for losing a war. that question needs to be revisited and its something we all need to ask and consider.plus, when a victim corporation has an incoming wardec shouldnt they be able to automatically advertise for help by publishing the plea on a roster of requests for aid that mercenary corporations could answer and accept as a binding contract? the mercenaries get involved and automatically get paid a bounty for each vessel of particular type from a fund that the victim corporation establishes at point of bid. establish a proper game structure for mercenary work, eve is the ideal environment for this. i would like to see proper ranking tables and in-game adverts for mercenary agencies trading on their reputation and past accomplishment. endless development time has gone into pos mechanics; lets have some devoted to encouraging the spread of player-led professions with actual player on player action rather than beating the dead horse of player on pos grinding."
4/28/2008,"3. fix black ops technology! its a great idea on paper; weve had covert frigates, cloaking, light raiding cruisers and now jump capable stealth battleships that can make miniature jump-portals for mobile forces to use to jump behind the lines of sitting territorial powers. sounds really exciting, guerrilla ops, tense manoeuvre with cloaks and secret jumps and espionage but the potential has suffered with a sloppy deployment and the universal spam of cyno-jammers (those things again) on most approaches to 0.0 from empire. eve is a game of intrigue and spying and all kinds of information and psyops warfare, lets ensure that technology to support this career choice is correctly implemented and available to the player base as a valid and entirely playable option. i believe the field of black-ops should include methods of hacking/disabling player structures, planting tracking devices, listening bugs, and making the business of espionage less meta and more in-game technology with systems, modules and skills produced to empower and balance such endeavors.the current crop of black operations battleships represent a very interesting game development that could deliver variety in play style and great opportunities for new conflict but theyve been introduced sloppily without properly understanding the reality in game at the moment and they need attention so they can support an appropriately sneaky play-choice for players wishing to specialise in battlefield recon and special operations in the eve universe. i think most agree at the minimum covert cyno-fields need to be immune to conventional cyno-jammers, but in addition these ships need increased jump range (to allow them to traverse the long real-space pirate jumps between regions) and they certainly need radically increased cargo bays to store the fuel needed to jump themselves and other vessels into the combat zone.4. ensure faction warfare is done right. this is the big one. its been promised for years, the great hope of the roleplay community post-aurora and something that could be absolutely brilliant for everybody who seeks roleplay conflict and pvp entertainment in empire. the concept at core: were playing in a living universe where npc empires (amarr, matari, gallente, caldari and other minor factions) are intriguing, plotting, scheming and ultimately fighting each other. our characters, corporations, and alliances develop standings and loyalties for one side or another through the process of game activities (agents and such) and could get embroiled in actual conflict with player entities supporting the rival powers.faction warfare promises actual game consequence for these conflicts and reasons for people to get involved in rp campaigns between the npc powers. maybe the federation moves on the state and tries to take over a border region, thus evicting all those lovely level 4 agents the caldari fans were farming for years? wouldnt that convince the caldari agent runners to get involved with the fight and confront the gallante loyalists and runners in a pitched battle to defend their interests? is it something anyone could get involved in? maybe external corps and alliances sign up for one side or another and fight all opponents in free sanctioned war decs and at the end of the month the side that inflicts the most casualties gets awarded the win! real game changes happen! war heroes and combat aces are made; medals get handed out - rare faction kit to the victorious corps! everyone cheers! maybe its a dream, but its a good dream and its something the csm definitely needs to encourage because its precisely this kind of thing that eve needs to remain fresh and competitive and healthy in the wider game market."
4/28/2008,"fleet battle lag and blob warfareso i think by now youll be getting the point of my candidacy. these are the things i care about and im convinced that arguing for increased developer priority in these areas will improve the game and enrich the game experience for everyone. im not one of these people that believe there will ever be a silver bullet lag solution that miraculously solves the problem of blob warfare and makes 1000 ship battles run with silky smooth responsiveness. i believe the solution to lag is breaking down conflict opportunities into smaller theatres  ive played and enjoyed eve combat for almost five years now and to my eyes and judgement the game simply works better at certain scales than others. this is my conviction and its what ill be arguing for  so i guess that means im an anti-blobwar candidate as well as anarchist outpost destroyer!but thats my position, and its the platform im going to be standing on for the csm elections. i think we should be improving the game by adding new things and more variety and enriching the possible career options for new and existing players in smaller corporations and alliances. i really think its a mistake to keep banging our heads against the wall of lag cures while we do nothing to practically discourage massive uberblobbing in 0.0 combat. if you make mechanics that force people to blob they will blob. the solution is almost childishly simple  change those mechanics so players dont have to blob to compete, introduce realistic intermediate objectives and spread out the field of combat:what if taking down a station took a simultaneous assault by an attacking force on several different power cores at different places in the system? (not at deathstar pos!) in one move youd have split up one big blob fight at x point into multiple smaller battles across a variety of objectives. the attacking and defending commanders would have to split up their forces into genuine wings and allocate resources intelligently. the point is that we should be looking at ways of breaking down the advantage of blob-warfare as a disincentive for alliances choosing it as their preferred option in waging wars. at the moment if you have greater numbers there is no reason not to blob out your enemy - the lag and damaged module response time of the big blob fight generally removes all player skill from the environment and turns it to simple weight of numbers and attrition and this is really not anything ccp should be encouraging.virtually all clever technologies die pointlessly in the lag environment and render their presence irrelevant, and this really is the biggest challenge to the state of the pvp game in eve at the current time. case in point the bomber role for stealth bombers - conceived as an anti-blob weapon but its really not going to work when the incoming paper thin bombers are going to be zapped before they load the grid to no appreciable effect. the developers need to ask themselves a question  is the best defense to this technology going to be to put more ships on grid and produce lag reducing the ability for anyone to do anything clever? if the answer is yes then its back to the drawing board.eve needs more technology (vessels/weapons) that actually punish the fleet blob cruelly and without mercy. how about putting the bomb warheads on a cruise missile that can fly at warp speed for 1au and explode against an object in space with an area effect? put 200 ships round a gate and youre really going to be hurting when warp-speed cruise missile bombs start exploding on that gate. it punishes the defender for blobbing for a change and that is precisely what is needed."
4/28/2008,"so lets think seriously about the implications of new technology and battlefield weapons and positively discriminate in favor of ideas that break up the blob, that drive commanders to make more intelligent decisions and split up their forces to achieve multiple simultaneous objectives and give a role back to smaller corporations and groups of skilled and daring players.the titan was a great anti-blob concept for example. doomsday weapon destroying hundreds of ships with one shot  superb! it actually encouraged mixed fleets, lighter ships that could escape the blast, better scouting, splitting groups  added a big risk to static gate camping and thoughtless blobbing. it was something that meant the commander had to be aware of the danger of a tactical nuke on the battlefield and avoid the unrealistic uberblob that had previously haunted the game.but combine that with ridiculously simple to deploy and maintain cyno jammer module (that requires truly massive blob of ships to destroy at powerful deathstar pos) in an environment where only one side is going to have capital ships in the fight and everyone knows exactly when and where the fight is going to be and you have a terrible mess. you have gameplay priorities at conflict with themselves and utter contradiction of purpose in reducing blob-warfare. cant blame the players for blobbing up when its the only way to remove a module that prevents them bringing in siege ships and getting an even fight. and you cant blame the players for opting out of territorial warfare when they are forced to blob in an environment when the anti-blob doomsday weapon is king.somewhere along the road there needs to be some common sense and a general rationalization of the problem with territorial warfare in eve so that improvements can be made to the clear benefit of all.it doesnt need tinkering with these things in isolation; it needs clear and rational plan with the objective of reducing the necessity for lag-inducing blob-fighting while increasing the speed, enjoyment, and opportunity for player interaction in the territorial conflict model. its a tall order and a complex task. and end of the day you the electorate have the responsibility for selecting candidates wholl be able to make these arguments and correctly advise the developers in the choices to be made."
4/28/2008,"candidate credentialsso there you go, as i said im not im not all things to all people in this campaign. i freely admit i have a very personal interest in making eve better through the specific policy items ive discussed above and im not claiming to be able to represent everyone and everything else with an impartial and dispassionate reserve. what i can promise absolutely is that i love this game of eve online with genuine enthusiasm and if you share my desire to see it improved and enhanced in the areas ive discussed ill do my level best to make sure the developers are persuaded and debated in the right directions to make these things happen.game experienceso to the funny bit, i imagine its possible youve read all that and still dont realise who the heck i am so ill give a little overview of my experience as a player of eve online and what ive spent my time doing over the years to demonstrate, if nothing else, that ive had the opportunity at least to understand the things im talking about!i started playing eve with the character jade constantine way back in 2003, a few weeks after the retail release of the game. i didnt play in beta, i didnt even know about the game until a friend of mine convinced me to buy it and plan a corporation that could fight the system and set the universe ablaze on a diet of revolutionary zeal and free space ethics. i was intrigued, then addicted, then ended up doing exactly what was written on the back of the game and started a sequence of wars and conflicts in the interest of free trade and commerce in the player sphere of 0.0.amusingly enough, jade was rolled up with mining skills and more than anything i visualized her as a workers revolutionary organising against the big cartels and founding a breakaway movement of capsule pilots devoted to fighting the imperialism of the core empire and founding their own roving communities on graft and free space economics. quite quickly the focus shifted ingame to trade in robotics and plutonium running and the corporation i founded, jericho fraction, became one of the earliest really serious blockade running outfits bringing rare goods with excellent profit margins from the wilds of venal through empire to the receptive markets of khanid and domain for 20m isk profit a cargo (back when that was a lot of money).dodging pirates - most notably the famous space invaders - we made a lot of money just moving goods around, learned our pvp lessons through evasion tricks and misdirection, and invested wisely in funky modules to make our bestowers the fastest industrials in space capable of evading gate camps back when instajumps hadnt been invented and you could still squeeze eight extruded heatsinks into an armageddon without any hint of a stacking nerf.eventually though the pirates got organized and the risks were increasing so i decided to join one of eves first alliances and convince them from within to be freespacers in exchange for teaching them about the hallowed plutonium trade runs that were still massively profitable. this led to the first incident in a recurring theme of my eve experience  the clash of freespace vs territorialist ethics. eves first megacorporation, namely taggart transdimensional industries under the notorious randite ideologue ragnar, had moved into the venal alliance alongside our own jericho fraction and they wanted mineral rights, territorial exclusion to protect those rights, and moreover wanted to run venal as a private fiefdom to enhance the power and prestige of taggart itself."
4/28/2008,"this was the archetypal big bad player-led imperialist hierarchy right in my face and i opted to destroy it. i committed myself to preparing for the fight to come, winning allies, hiring mercenaries, spies and agents; i funded allied corporations, manoeuvred, wrote press releases and readied my weapons and realized just how alive this environment felt  eve was a fabulously compelling game, grand strategy, game of thrones, intrigue and bravery and brutal realpolitik rolled into one and i was hooked.what happened is a tale for another time, but suffice to say it propelled my character into fame and notoriety and kept her there for years to come. other wars came and went and would conclude for me in the greatest conflict in the game to date that we called the great northern war that saw thousands of battleships clashing in the void of 0.0 while the politicians and heroes of the warring sides fought tooth and nail in the sphere of public relations and influence on the eve forums for the very real advantage of foreign intervention, morale boosting and brutal political parody. what a game!along the way ive changed from rebel miner to rogue trader to revolutionary ideologue and guerrilla firebrand. ive fought desperate battles, ive commanded fleets, ive had a loaded freighter killed by war targets in empire that i managed to forget all about! ive fought in empire; in 0.0; ive summoned fleets of frigates and deployed massed groups of dreadnaughts in desperate sieges. i fly all races of ships and consider the best defence against nerfing is to train whatever looks artificially weak at the moment (so one can only be pleasantly surprised when the balancing comes).ive experienced some of the best events ever run by ccp, duelled with murderous right-wingers at the elarel pleasure gardens massacre, ran against trade-rivals for immense profits in the transcranial microcontroller craze, debated with sisters of eve and mordu vessels and been condemned as a dangerous outlaw by amarrian patriarchs and enjoyed it all. ive played in three alliance tournaments, given in-character interviews for eon, the ingame news service, third party fansites and seen my words translated into many languages and made friends around the world in the course of playing this lovely game.at the last though id say my proudest accomplishment is sticking with the vision and ideal we had with the establishment of jericho fraction corporation at a friends house in watford almost five years ago now. we wanted to take revolutionary ethics and anarcho-capitalist free trade bias into this red in tooth and claw game universe and make ourselves famous for the deeds and accomplishment to come. we wanted to write our corporate name into the history books of the single server for all to see and live up to the claims on the back of the box.i think we probably succeeded wildly beyond those dreams and its a testament to everyone thats ever played a part in the story of jericho fraction and the star fraction alliance that weve come so far and achieved so much against dreadful odds and terrible foes to stand where we are today.so if i can promise nothing else then i promise great endurance and commitment to the cause!"

4/28/2008,"well it definitely needs gambling games, brutal death match fights, hi-stakes poker, cruel blood sports and semi-naked karate girls fighting for money in gallente lowsec hubs. serious answer is content that promotes the seedier side of eve and makes the game universe come alive. i have to admit ever since i heard about ambulation i had this secret fantasy about playing a ten billion isk sit down poker game on a soon to be exploding player outpost out in 0.0 with isd covering the detonation and imminent bankrupcy of many of the players. (which as anyone who might have read it will recognize as close to a famous scene in consider phlebas.)bars and shopping are all very well, but it needs the ability to gamble and win and lose and change the situation in the game to be meaningful as well.i don't think it would be appropriate for eve to have a combat engine that affects pod pilots though - just detracts from the nature of immortal captains with instant recloning for my taste. maybe espionage, hacking, planting sensors on the avatars, disguise kits, listening bugs on the hq, maybe that sort of thing would be interesting? but honestly, i think its going to going to be seedy bars in empire styles, adult-themed entertainment, hi-stakes gambling and people playing space-pool for the pink slips of their faction battleships and at the end of the day ... doesn't sound too bad"

4/28/2008,a very interesting and concise analysis at the end there - you focus upon trading mechanisms in terms of bounty hunting and so forth. whats your view regarding the 'cliff edges' that seperate the geographic elements of high / low and .0 space - should the sec rating system and the laws that govern it be blended as opposed to being so distinctly different?c.

4/28/2008,"in my honest opinion the gtc system (the secure trade) has its pros and cons.on one side it can be looked at as a cheat for the sellers to get isk using real money and creating an unfair advantage to others. but it also creates a way for the players that cant afford the monthly fee to play the game, given they pay for their game time with in game currency.the other side is that it crates a way that in combats the rmt the farmers/macro miners do create and i would rather let ccp get the money than someone else and give someone to play longer.i have been on both sides of the gtc buying and selling, and i have a the view that it gives the legit player a chance to obtain isk without giving real money to someone that exploits mmo players for the sole purpose of making real money."

4/28/2008,"as briefly as possible, what are the core axioms and principles that lead you to your views on how eve can be improved? no more than 10 please."
4/28/2008,"high-sec is ""safer, not safe"". if some members of goonswarm choose to ride bikes in empire and blow up haulers then that is there right so long as they do not exploit the systems in place to keep that working. it is not hard to defend yourself from these types of attacks. a friendly logistics ship in the belt with a single rep will likely make attacks fail. as well there is always the option to ""pre-load"" concord in the belt via a suicide attack of your own.if the playerbase has a problem with that they need to get together and do something about it and there is certainly things that they can do to stop these types of things from happening.as well, i am not sure i would qualify jihadswarm as ""griefing"". it may just be that the motives just aren't clear."
4/28/2008,"as thread title. what do you think about how lowsec works today? does it need a boost? does it need some kind of new gameplay element? does it need more security? is the risk vs. reward worth it? etc. etc.also, most importantly: what would you do with lowsec if you become a csm?kind regards-jm"
4/28/2008,"most importantly, i would listen to the ideas about improving lowsec from players that live there and those that would like to live there. then, if there was enough support for an idea, i'd debate it in a csm meeting and vote on the issue, after carefully weighing up the ramifications and advantages / disadvantages. afterall, thats what i'll be elected to do...the reward is definately worth the risk, if you have nerves of steel and, of course, a good cloaker.take care,bruce hansen"
4/28/2008,"lowsec could do with a boost, having been in lowsec a few times now the bounties are definitely an attraction but that is almost directly proportional to the danger. i myself would propse an insurance multiplier for lowsec only (please discuss on my thread at: [csm candidate] nickaelhoopas arithron stated in the post above i would also listen to the players who live there and have to fend for themselves on a regular basis and at a meeting (if elected) would raise the points delicatly as any wrong changes could become catastrophic."
4/28/2008,"as said by the guys above me - the csm is there to listen to players concerns and act on them first.but to the question: low sec currently has no role other than being a buffer between empire and 0.0 that may sound like an obvious statement, but most people ignore it. i'd like to see it become something more strategic than it already is and have a role other than for moon mining, cyno-staging and gate camping. then again, it's not something i think about regularly so some discussion from those that use it regularly would be welcome."
4/28/2008,"im a massive fan of low sec because i feel it best represents the dark underbelly of eves cosmopolitan society. what id like to see is more flavour added to low sec: smuggling, gambling dens, ruined stations rank with decay, hidden gates and losts ruins of alien species filled with their debris and forgotten tech.i dont really want high sec +, or .0 -. i want to see something new, a place of danger, terror even: something that makes the inquisitive and curious mind want to stay despite the filth and squallor. low sec should be a pirate haven - not waterd down for high sec mission runners - we already have that.c."
4/28/2008,"low-sec needs a mechanism to enforce player control. that is, it is difficult to police low-sec via player mechanisms. in empire everyone is policed. in 0.0 the owners of the space police it as they wish. in low-sec, players should police it to an ideal. faction warfare might be this method, i don't know.i also don't know how we could reasonably make player police in low-sec and make it reasonably contestable."

4/28/2008,"1) to be totally honest eve is very simple to use at the moment although i have noticed that a lot of new players have been asking me about the ui being difficult to understand and some what complicated to get used to. i am considering putting across as one of my point that during the tutorials buttons that need to be clicked on by a player have a bright red border so they can easily be recognised and memorised for future use.2) simply people baiting the new players and destroying them for no reason at all would be the biggest turn off in my opinion, although there would be an evident lack of comments on the forum about this due to said players leaving the game for good. i would love to discuss this further with the community but my current idea employs new players not being able to go in lowsec and porably within 2 jumps of their home station for the first week until they get used to the game and its mechanics.3) i would not say that i am clueless to the game, i know a lot and i would like to apply that in my campaign but i need input from players to make the right decisions to take forward to the first csm meeting (providing of course a chair is won).i feel that anyone can be ready for the csm role, they dont need to be 3 years old and have x amount of level 5 skills. the only quality that i feel they should have is the ability to listen, communicate and learn as well as being able to stray away from their first opinions in favor of something more adequately suited.nickaelhoop"

4/28/2008,"check the new players missions, the string of 10 missions require to get to a station with inventing facilities and that is not generally feasible in 2 jumps. limiting the range of a new character to 2 jumps for a week can be a heavy limitations, it will make the game feel small and restricted and get a lot of new players in 4-5 systems, with problems of lag and heavily depleted belts. not allowing them to enter low sec for the first week instead is a good idea i recall being pod killed the 3 day or so as a small trauma, especially as i wasn't getting why they were doing that."
4/28/2008,"the current state of the cloak/logoff mechanic's means that 0.0 ratting is safer than lvl4 missions in lowsec. as someone who does the odd bit of solo pvp now and again, it defeats the purpose to find system after system of log off/cloak/wcs ratters. what are your views on cloak/logoff tactics and your views on addressing this balance?"
4/28/2008,"my view on cloakers is that they are fine for use in 0.0 sec space. the player using the cloaker, afterall, can't rat or mine etc when its being used. they are designed for covert ops, so i guess you'd have to class ratting in 0.0 as such (pve as opposed to pvp). afterall, 0.0 space isn't just for pvp. gatecamps, warp bubbles and the like give you good and valid methods for thwarting these sort of ops. at least the person doing these type of things has thought about what dangers lie ahead and taken ic steps to prevent ship loss!as for logging off in 0.0 space; are you saying that only ratters and a small percentage of explorers/miners do this, or would you agree that it happens in battles also? personally, i don't think its honourable at all...as for wcs (assuming you are referring to warp core stabs), see post regarding cloakers. i would apply same ideas, since also a valid ic thing to do.logging off is a hard issue to address! we all have to do it sometime...take care,bruce hansen"
4/28/2008,"my views can be seen here and up until about post 65.cloaking and log off mechanics need a change because they allow players to too easily avoid combat when they would rightly be cornered.wcs however, is not an issue, they pay for that ability in lock time and range and bubbles and hictors plenty strong enough to reduce their use."

4/28/2008,"hello,currently if you wan't to wardec an alliance, you get slapped with hefty concord bribe bill. after ""alliance p nerf"", having a good empire war has been .. well hard. how do you view current system of wardecs? do you think they should be lowered so you can dec with lower cost? how about restriction only 3 wars per corporate (not alliance) is valid or not?thanks, your local (banned) forum troll."
4/28/2008,"i think the current system in place is adequate for the majority of players and alliances.the way i see it is that it gives you sufficient thought as to who you would want to ""wardec"" and is it the right thing to do? it also allows you to concentrate your members during important conflicts (obviously this doesn't apply to major alliaces with huge numbers of corporations involved) instead of them being spread out thinly fighting 20 other alliances.as for the cost i have never seen the bill, can anyone give me a price?"
4/28/2008,"you'll probably hate me for this, but i personally think the price of current wardecs is minuscule compared to the isk that is flowing into the economy at the moment. the cost of setting up an alliance used to be a major effort, now it can be achieved within a month by a single player. when you take all that into consideration, the way the wardec system is structured around an isk value makes no sense any more unless it scales with eve's economy - which it isn't and would soon make it impossible for the poor to wardec the rich.so, i think a new war dec system needs to be implemented - i have no idea what it should be, isk does need to be involved, but maybe base it around the sovereignty system in that it's x amount of isk per system controlled to wardec an alliance with a minimum base amount. empire based corps/alliances are then cheaper to wardec, whereas disrupting 0.0 alliances empire work becomes slightly more expensive and gives a reason for alliances to contest for 0.0 space. again, it's only an idea (and one i just thought up randomly), but a decent discussion about it has been needed for a while now."
4/28/2008,"every point is valid, albeit good or bad .as some people may have guessed from my post i don't really have an idea of the system at the moment (i openly admit that and i guess it is one con of age of my character and my knowledge).that a good idea omber zombie, it shows you have a working knowledge and a possible solution to a problem.personally i think more ideas should be conceived to help players, not to make it easier for them to be blown to bits, just my 2 isk ."
4/28/2008,"interesting topic,corp level: i dont think the current war dec system is 100% good, main reasons is that the corp that gets deced can avoid it to easily, and the aggressor can withdraw form the war even if the war is set to mutual (in cases the corp they deced is to strong for them to handle). alliance level: most off the alliance on alliance fighting is out in 0.0 and there you really dont need a war dec. as for empire wars it is totally different since there are no real way to set a goal for the war (for both corp level and alliance level). as for costs they are fine as they are, though i like omber zombies idea (though it is just tossed out there). restriction is there due to a reason, though it should he higher than 3 active decs form a corp, and still be unlimited for alliances. maybe a small boost for active wars from a corp form 3 to 5 ?"

4/28/2008,"well, since we don't actually bring issues to the table (you do, via the csm forums) i find this a difficult question to answer.if i was a player not running for council, i may post a topic on the csm forums about changing some things for characters that think pvp in empire (such as gatecamping and killing shuttles) is a good thing.take care,bruce hansen"
4/28/2008,sorry - to clarify;as we dont yet have a fully operative csm forum - based upon recent forum activity what do you percieve as being the critical issue for players at this time.c.
4/28/2008,"other than ""lag"" which none of us can really do anything about.the current state of starbase and sovereignty warfare. specifically how it pushes smaller alliances out of the game, or to put it more simply, ""attacking stuff is too hard"".the second most pressing issue would probably be speed, its current implementation and how it marginalizes lower skilled players and many ship types which ought to be valuable in all types of warfare. and the third would probably be increasing u.i. functionality in all systems, especially the scanner, activation and reload of modules, and the fleet command tools."
4/28/2008,"the ""primary issue"" in my eyes is simply keeping the new players playing.i have heard and read of countless cases where new players have fleeted up with people and then without warning, popped. this has to stop and then all the other issues can be raised, after all, there is nothing worse than coming into a new game with little or no knowledge and then suddenly getting destroyed with no reason what so ever.sure you can discuss the state of the economy (no comments made, just an example) but it will only get worse of there isn't an assortment of new players coming into the game to support it.simply put, all new players should have some sort of ""safety system"" in place."
4/28/2008,well my primary issue is why do we need a bunch of players who win a trip by popular vote to go to iceland to tell the devs what the primary issues are when they know full well what they are because they play the fricken game anyway. i feel like ive been taking crazy pills.
4/28/2008,"i think they thought it was about time they gave something back into the community, something that made them more involved other than filing petitions and making complaint posts."
4/28/2008,any chance the csm candidates could post there views on removing local as thats one of the crucial things for me and a lot of others when it comes to desiding who to vote for
4/28/2008,you understand they arnt being elected as devs to decide on this kinda stuff yea?
4/28/2008,"my view on removing local: don't...its been fine for years!some nice ideas have come up in other threads regarding some possible changes that would enhance local for some different types of players (eg, war parties). however, my feeling is that local in empire (where 80% of the player base is) is fine the way it is. afterall, it doesn't tell you much except who is in system...their locations are still for interested parties to discover. i have read some funny posts regarding local, e.g. some players watch local and logoff when they see aggressors entering! so what, they didn't want you to shoot their mining barge up, so you can get your name on a killboard somewhere?changes in 0.0 space could have merit, although it would need some careful thought about exactly what changes to make (if possible to change local for just one security status). this might be a good discussion on a csm topic forum. any decision taken by the csm council would still have to convinve the ccp devs.anyway, there's my 2 isk's worth.take care,bruce hansen"
4/28/2008,"but the csm will have a direct line to the devs and the ability to bring issues to them for ccp to address/respond to.there has been much discussion of the local channel on the forums, and only a few vague hints from the devs about their plans for it. the csm would be able to directly raise the issue and make recommendations that ccp would respond to with direct feedback on the concerns raised.hence, these sorts of issues are important because it will be the elected council members who vote to decide what issues will be raised and which will be left alone."
4/28/2008,"csm discussion - local chat removallinks to a discussion thread i authored on the subject. short answer is i think local needs to go in 0.0 for sure and needs serious attention in lowsec. it is important we get significant upgrades to scanner functionality and ease of use at the same time though. as part of the same discussion i believe most commonly available map intel needs to be removed from 0.0 also. (kills, pilots in space, npc ships eaten) that kind of thing."
4/28/2008,"delicate matter, i dont think that local should be removed form all of eve, and i do know that it is a powerful intel tool.high sec: as it is today, since it is way to easy communicating with people that live in that area of space, and its a way to encourage socializing with others.low sec: only shows recent talkers (same as alliance and other public channels).no sec: no local at all, but that depends on more/better functions added to the local scanner and/or by other means.and i do agree with jade that with the removal of local in no sec, other forms of intel given by the map should be removed as well. so it can fit into the risk vs. reward in 0.0."
4/28/2008,"...who would it be?obviously you wouldn't be running if you didn't think you were good enough for the job, but if you weren't in that position, who would you vote for and why would you vote for them. i've already posed this question to a few candidates, so if you're one of them you are under no obligation to answer.thanks in advance."
4/28/2008,"vote ""abstain"""
4/28/2008,"interessting topic.the ones analysing the candidates the most are the candidates themselves, i guess."
4/28/2008,i would probably go omber zombie. he's a veteran player and i have known him a long time (not that our paths crossed that often. he is a solid chap with good ideas and i think he will make a great contribution to csm.although have to admit that if verone hadn't stood down he would have been my first option!edit: also i overlooked serenity for whom i also have great admiration for in terms if the tools he has developed for the community!
4/28/2008,"hardin or bane glorious. though i have clear biases in those two directions its still probably the best of the lot. i was liking verone before he backed out, but that is moot now.all i know is that it would not ever be jade constantine."
4/28/2008,having read all the campaigns made by all the candidates my vote is still undecided. i will not however be voting for myself as that in my opinion is big headed and somewhat selfish.in the current standings i would give my vote to ankhesentapemkah (subject to change as stated above) because she has a strong mind and doesn't stray far from the set objectives which is a huge bonus. also her ability to listen to other players and their views is great
4/28/2008,i would have gone for lavistavista.lavista vista mostly due to the work on the eve bank and i see him as a trust worthy guy.
4/28/2008,i think me and hardin are going to be swapping votes for pretty much the exact same reasons
4/28/2008,i'd vote omber zombie (edit: i have removed all references to ruminant mammals of the ovis genus.)
4/28/2008,"i think serenity steele and dierdra vaal are best of the rest at the moment. community-minded, excellent knowledge of specific game areas, clear platforms and no nonsense."
4/28/2008,exploiting bumping machanics
4/28/2008,first comments csm candidates?
4/28/2008,"don't be silly, this is still spam..."
4/29/2008,"hi, as this is an issue close to my heart, after reading your blogs, do you think that being a ""single woman"" will help or hinder your campaign to become csm? has it helped or hindered you in eve as a whole? what are your views on improving the environment for women in eve?thank you for taking the time out to answer."
4/29/2008,i don't think women should be able to vote or run for elected office. how can you convince me otherwise?
4/29/2008,i rule
4/29/2008,"destructible outposts promote genuine risk/reward dynamism in the 0.0 environment and provide a focal point to exciting war climax engagements, they would be destroyed by self destruct sequence triggered by the conqueror, defended by potential re-conquest during destruct timer to cancel the explosion, rebuilt for a discount from the ruins of the destroyed station and salvage would be in the form of hanger access in the wreck; additionally id like to remove sovereignty claims from pos and return these structures to a purely industrial function, and yes these are things id advocate to the csm if im elected."
4/29/2008,****.
4/29/2008,does that mean i get your vote viper
4/29/2008,"as much as i'd like to see quite a few of your points implemented ingame, i think it's a bit too early, or perhaps just the wrong time entirely, to see them worked into current game mechanics.also, do you feel there is a problem with ""nanoships"" currently, and what would you do to ""fix"" if so."
4/29/2008,"well ultimately for these changes to make it onto the dev schedule the community need to be in favour. if i get elected i can advocate these changes, if the community wants them i can vote for these changes to make it on the agenda, but ultimately it will come to a discussion with ccp council. question you need to ask yourself is are you for a candidate who has these interests in the game and has the kind of vision for eve i've expressed in the manifesto. every example and idea in the long text above is there simply to inform you how my mind and imagination and sense of game balance and development works. its so you get a handle on how i'm likely to vote in the event i make it through the election. i'm being completely open about my interests and personal preferences here and if you like this stuff then i'd like your trust and vote.i think its more a problem with conquerable 0.0 infrastructure and defense advantage. nano-fleets are popular/essential because any raiding force in 0.0 sovereign space is likely to get jump-bridge hot-dropped on by twice the number of defenders utilizing the rapid logistics of their pos network.this means attackers honestly can't fly anything other than nano-raiders with any reasonable expectation of getting out of engagements that turn bad quickly.the problem is the prevalence of jump-bridges and horrible sovereignty mechanics that allow the defending sides to insta-blob large ships and hot-drop on any engaged raiders. short answer, i don't think the nano-ships are to blame. reduce or restrict jump bridge spam and slow down the rate that defenders can congregate on any incoming raid and you'll see more conventional gangs and fewer pure-nano fleets. i fly these things myself viper, at the moment sf raids 0.0 almost exclusively with polycarb-fitted ships because to do otherwise is crazy - you just get bubbled and hotdropped any time you commit to a larger fight with slower ships. i'd love to be flying battleship gangs again but its not going to happen by nerfing nano - that stuff will just reduce all incidence of raiding playstyle not convince people to suicide vulnerable slowboats to the inevitable hotdrop.nano-ships are expensive, vulnerable and easily countered by the appropriate counter-measures. at the moment they are niche performers in a landscape of hot-drops and jump-bridges and 0.0 blobbing. outside of that landscape all traditional balance still applies and nano isn't a problem."
4/29/2008,"one of the things i love is how many culture-variant names i see on ships in game. there's a chap i see with the surname ""horza,"" as well. and it's interesting that in banks' first novel, the (anti? proto? tragically greek? git?)-hero is an enemy of this amazing culture he's created.i suppose you're aware of how horzalike you are in this context, jade; there are several candidates i'd like to support (and will, should they be elected), but i know that if there's anyone who can be counted on to balance the megahugealliance's interests in space in favor of keeping freedom and openess in game, it'll be you; so given one vote, i give mine to you.everyone hopes and wants a neutral csm board; everyone also hopefully realizes that it's impossible to achieve fully. i think (and hope :d) you'll keep out your own issue-bias when you can, but i want some of that bias represented on the csm. for the benefit of the big players as well as the small; few things can kill a game as quickly as massive vet-blocks getting everything they want too fast .regards,bhand yeah i'm piloting a ship named the bora horza gobuchul.edit: oh brilliant. i get around you and my posts get all wordy and by the time i get to the end i forgot my original question :i *hate* to bring any hint of the ""local rules!"" ""screw local!"" ""screw you!"" brouhaha in here, but... when ambulating, and no excuses about being pod-tied into concord and sensors and comms and godlike infosystems can be made: should we know who else is in station in any way? or find out the hard way by running into them?dammit, i don't want some godmode knowlege of who else is in station. i want to walk down a corridor, turn a corner, and stop dead as hardin and i come face to face, blinking for a second......or go instation, ask my agent where someone is, and get the answer, ""two floors down."" hillarity shall ensue, oh yesssss."
4/29/2008,"i wanna know what experience you have with industry in general. are you able to represent the people who care about the secondary market, for instance?i mean, i guess most people have high-sec characters, in order to make isk, which does something carebearish. but is the same true for you, and do you have any experience?if yes, what is the most annoying thing for you, when you do these things?"
4/29/2008,can i just say - this is why we need jade on the csm.
4/29/2008,"as far as im aware jade,and as good or bad as i may think your proposals are, none of them will be implemented as the whole point of the csm candidacy is not to change any of the game mechanics, but to see that the game is being ran fairly, and so we dont get a repeat performance of gm's helping out there favourite allaince's or corps.anyway good luck jade....but as you will prob already know, my vote will lay with someone else...lolregardsrenosha"
4/29/2008,"i thought that was the purpose of ccp's internal affairs department?afaik the purpose of the csm is to act as a layer between ccp and the players, to communicate the concerns of the playerbase to the developers, to identify good proposals and suggestions and advise ccp from the point of view of a player.that role i think fits jade like a glove."
4/29/2008,"points 1) and 2) respectively of your manifesto are only a single solution to point 3). would you still support cyno jammer mechanics and indestructable outposts if some alternative solution were to be found that allows for many more gameplay styles including your own alliance's revolutionary and/or guerilla style insurgency?and if not, why not?"
4/29/2008,"thank you harlequin! brilliant to see you back in the game and on the forums by the way. and yep, good old horza, well if the federation is the pro-culture and i'm profoundly anti fed nationalist it kinda makes sense. its certainly a role i'm happy to play - and thanks a lot for your vote! its an exciting and dangerous time in many ways. the wrong alliance blocs could do a lot of harm to the game and i foresee the first csm being a defining moment for this community really. like i've said in the manifesto - my voice is there to speak for players like me that still love this eve dream and love the potential opportunities for cybernetic rats in the stainless steel wainscoting of overarching alliance power. screw the end game, lets keep fighting! in 0.0/lowsec with no local rules i'd say we shouldn't know who else in the station until we meet them. in empire there'd probably be a docking roster or something and concord oversight, but with these shady locations in marginal space i think the captains will want their privacy a bit. then my friend, you'll be reaching for a virtual blade or snub-nosed projectile hand cannon and be cursing the devs they said no for station combat in eve damn straight."
4/29/2008,"i don't do industry on my account or alts. never have really. so speaking personally (as in have i ever done much building) nope. most i've ever built would be a couple of cruisers, torpedoes, cap charges or something from tech1 blueprints. however, in my corporation i currently have directors who are amongst the most effective industrial producers in the game at the moment, in the tech2 market, and in the capital market. these guys really know their stuff and suffice to say i do get to hear a lot about the challenges and issues to particular elements of the production/supply/marketing process. can you be a little more specific as to which secondary market elements you'd like to know about and what concerns there are please? i don't have any specific isk-making characters and as i said, have no real hands-on experience with this specialization - i generally pvp for money. when i need to know i ask people who are experts in the field. rest assured if it comes down to voting and informed choice on such issues if very thoroughly briefed by people who do know everything there is to know about these areas.well chatting to some industrialist contacts i'm hearing the following issues at the moment:very high price tech2 dyposium moon derived components; reactor units, shield emitters etc etc. questions about the distributing of these moons, perhaps there should new seeding of moons in lowsec perhaps? generally feeling the distribution is currently wrong.issues on establishing more factory/lab slots - pointed out that pos management isn't fun and some industrialists like the ship/module building game but don't want to get into pos management to enlarge slot availability. emphasis on fun production empire's rather than baby sitting the pos tamagotchi monster. on production: some people lament the batch system of ship building output ships - questions about whether it would be possible to have things coming out of the factory in single units again.extra skills needed: advanced(advanced mass production) maybe call it industrial empire or something + (+5 factory slots a level) same for lab operation. basically industrialists don't like the necessity to have multiple production alts just to get enough factory build jobs running. would much rather further specialize on existing production characters.same for market sales, more skills beyond tycoon wanted. production efficiency implants would be nice?on market ""pvp"". standings based tariffs (ie if you are -10 from the buyer you pay a penalty fee, if you are neutral you get the market price, if you are +10 you get it cheaper.) that kind of thing.just some issues i'm hearing about lavista."
4/29/2008,"common misconception that renosha and you are in quite famous company amongst those making that mistake. i've given a detailed answer to this subject already on shc herethat refers directly to the csm pdf made available by the organizer. brief summary:1. csm reps can ask questions and make proposals to the ccp council on issues of importance to the general health and future of eve.2. csm reps can vote on whether to escalate a public motion (5% electorate vote) to ccp council response. (important we get a fair and balanced csm council to ensure that good public motions will get supported and encouraged - 5/9 rep votes needed).3. csm reps can and will advocate and debate in direct interaction with the ccp council in iceland to influence official judgments and decisions on the issues raised.4. csm reps are responsible for communicating back the results of these motions, suggestions, questions etc, and ensuring that the eve public are engaged in process of developing the game. at no point in the founding pdf does it state these issues are solely involved with corruption investigations/internal affairs oversight, or policing gm's and ccp staff.our prospective job as csm reps is to watch for hot topics from the community, inspire and encourage good debate and raise popular and important topics to the csm shortlist and refine that down for the agenda in iceland. face to face talks will decide the outcome of the issues and ccp undertake to give us detailed answers and feedback."
4/29/2008,"exactly so, (and thank you!)"
4/29/2008,"i really like what i read on you manisfesto. although most of it sounds like a long shot, it is definitely what i would expect to change in eve to ensure it remain fun for all.questions:1) what is your view on empire dwellers, specifically the mission running pilots who would not even risk isk and limb and stays in npc corporations, do empire complexes and basically complains about 'pvpers' hassling them to 'get out more'? or the typical 'carebear' that most pvpers tend to refer them to.2) do you feel that player run corps/alliance should have an ideal/minimum size before being able to form compared to current mechanincs that allows pilots to form corps/alliances on a whim wihout any other pilot support?3) what is your view on current insurance payout mechanics and how do you think we can improve if you think something is lacking from it?4) what is your current stance on the rmt issues in eve including ccp's method of handling the problem? and how do you think we can improve the managements of it?5) would you support a dumbed down eve if it can attract 50% more subscribers?looking forward to your replies. cheers."
4/29/2008,yup you have my vote so far and most of my mains corp members votes as well.
4/29/2008,"jade, how can support destroyable outposts when you also claim to support ""dynamism"" and ""the little guy"". destroyable outposts hurt smaller alliances who wish to play in the 0.0 sovereignty game. this is because large alliances will destroy outposts of their competitors, and anyone wishing to enter space must build their own. these outposts must be defended and it will always be very hard for a small defender to defend against a larger one. the attacker then destroys the outpost and leaves and if the small alliance wants that space they have to put up another outpost.but if the outpost cannot be destroyed then they do not have to furnish the cost a second time[or first time if they are going after one already built] they attack. and the larger alliance has to commit forces in order to keep that outpost out of enemy hands[instead of just destroying it and then coming back to destroy it if they put up another]. how can you reconcile your positions when they are mutually exclusive.? or do you simply not care about small players and instead care about pushing your corporations agenda for the game?"
4/29/2008,"its a far wider impact than just small unit pvp consequence really. the current terrible situation with 0.0 territorial warfare affects everyone involved with it. this really isn't just small unit raiding corporations wanting to be able to destroy 0.0 holdings in an eyeblink.under the proposals i made to illustrate the need for dynamism in space combat you'd still need to fight a significant military campaign to gain the ability to take (and thence self-destruct) an outpost. this stuff will be of the utmost significance to all sizes of alliance and territorial entity and will have a real impact on the current sprawling afk-defensive playstyle that populates 0.0. the problem at the moment is the wasteland of empty systems with more pos than players and cyno-jammers/arranged reinforcement battles, ensuring that if somebody does want to change something its going to be a laggy-dogpile battle rather than decent fleet fight.i believe eve needs destructible outposts to make 0.0 powers take their holdings seriously and apply the proper active defensive effort to make sure they can't be taken and occupied for little real meaning. otherwise the landscape eventually gets filled with a desert of semi occupied ""flags"" that increase in number and blandness until nobody really cares who owns what and nobody has the defense focus or inclination to engage in serious fighting to defend them. allow an aggressor the option of razing an outpost it takes and suddenly 0.0 becomes interesting again and powers have to make a significant commitment to defend the critical locations. ironically some have claimed that this would lead to a situation where huge 0.0 powers would automatically destroy all the outposts of smaller powers but what it really achieves is to make anyone more circumspect in regard to overstretch and over-greedy landholdings. if you've only got a couple of outposts you'll fight with your whole fleet and focus to defend them and retake them in the self-destruct countdown if they do get taken. if you've got 100 outposts you don't really care about and the far-flung locations are attacked then sure, you'll lose them because you don't care enough.eve is a game where commitment wins fights. dedication brings results. a smaller corporation can achieve fantastic victories over a much larger corporation just because it has discipline, good activity, clear goals and focus. same really on the alliance level. a bloated 2000 man alliance is comprised of any number of people at varying levels of commitment to the cause and if they are trying to defend dozens of outposts simultaneously they'll do much less well than a focused smaller alliance concentrating on just a few. at the moment the primary argument against destructible outpost concept comes from lazy large alliances that hate the idea that smaller focused groups will make them pay for their greedy land grabbing and lackluster defensive commitment with focused assaults with slash and burn objectives. eve status quo as it is now allows these ""lazy powers"" to pretty much ignore the activities of smaller groups because they know ""at some point in the future"" they can just come back and reclaim what they have lost. make it possible to destroy outposts and suddenly war becomes real and threat's significant - eve 0.0 changes from sim-city to civilization and gets truly dynamic again."
4/29/2008,"no, the ""lazy powers"" simply won't hold the space. they will instead simply destroy the stations and then not bother to defend it because if anyone puts anything up[a daunting task], they can just come back and blow it up again. all the benefits of denying space to your enemies and none of the work."
4/29/2008,"thank you, glad you feel that way, its definitely what i'm aiming for and to demonstrate the right kind of thinking in the csm role. people have a right to play the game in any way they choose really. if they don't want pvp its up to them. hisec mission-running in npc corps is pretty damn safe and only suicide ganking is really going to be a threat to their way of gameplay - but is quite easily prepared for and countered. what i'd really like to see is these guys (and girls) lured into higher risk systems/low-sec and such by excitement and rewards. not by nerfing or damaging the hi-sec experience, but just by providing more content and interesting bits and pieces in more dangerous space. i think people adjust to the pvp environment of eve at different rates and nobody says closed to possibility forever. one of star fraction's industrial director's hasn't pvp'ed for 4.5 years at this point but a couple of weeks ago was coming up with ship loadouts and concepts for ""giving it a go"" and seeing if that part of the game is fun. thats the point, people choose their level of risk based on gameplay interest and potential profits. (should point out that while our industrial director hasn't actively sought spaceship combat against players for most of the game, he's been dodgying pirates, blockade-running, ducking and diving while making filthy amounts of isk - its not an insulation from the rest of the server, just a way of handling your preference in interaction.) interesting question, but i'm going to say ""no"" there shouldn't be a restriction. if an individual pilot wants to form a corp then invest in alliance creation skills and payment just to have a flashy logo and more expensive incoming wardecs then its up to them. they need to pay a maintenance fee for the alliance and it gives them certain functionality - thats fair enough. i would however be in favor of introducing a clean up (maybe yearly check) to remove defunct corporations just to free up names and office spaces. i'd actually love a more dynamic insurance system that ups your premiums if you keep getting blown up and makes you pay a premium for insurance if you are low security rated. i think there is a lot that could be done with the insurance system to make it more interesting and let standings play an increased role. on the whole i don't like the minimum insurance payout either. i think it puts too much isk back into the economy from fights and eve needs cash-sinks/fiscal impact to strip money from the economy and let pvp battles and slaughterfests in 0.0 actually reach critical dispute resolution levels (when one side literally is out of cash).i don't like rmt in the game. i think it spoils the environment and balance of play. absolutely not. eve is pretty damn successful as it is."
4/29/2008,"it's good to see some things never change jade i'm delighted you stuck to your ussual propaganda method of throwing a novel at any potential opposition in order to avoid any serious criticism. while i doubt i hold any true significance in your eyes you'll always be remembered by me as my first real enemy, although at the time i had no idea of jericho fraction's history. despite our ups and down you are, for the moment looking like my canidate of choice, if for no other reason than that i know you ruthlessly persue your interests and they happen to more or less correspond with my own. that said there is one issue that i would seriously encourage you to either clarify or reconsider:you frequently mention eve's ""sandbox"" nature and seem to claim that maintaining this unique quality is of the upmost importance. however this idea of corp. ""stats"" surely goes against this. let's take your example of the credibility of mercenary corporations. with their stats published to the world a huge chunk of the game is removed, namely propaganda. fame and respect are things i feel should be worked for on all fronts. indeed jericho fraction's own former and continuing fame were heavily influenced by propaganda campaigns. let us now move on to consider the individual players taking myself as an example. my first ever war was against your own corporation, a mere few weeks into the game. i lost more ships in that month or so of war than i have in the last year or two. do i regret it? not at all, one of the most enjoyable times in my eve career, and certainly the most educational. it destroyed the noobish preconceptions i had about pvp and taught me to think for myself and, more importantly, outside the box. while my triumphs were few, they were each a true triumph for me atleast, and i hope you will atleast agree that i was almost always willing to fight. now let us consider the new player of today. how many would be willing to be so daring, to lose so many ships in the name of self-improvement and sheer fun if their stats were to be forever publicised to the world, their embaressing defeats highlighted to the eve community, their corporation or avatar ever a laughing stock among those who know better. such daring rookies are few and far between as it is, should we discourage this minority with such a ruthless punishement?all i can really see this sort of change accomplishing is encouraging the already widespread paranoia of losing one's ship. already blob's are wide spread, people take unneccesary precautions to protect their precious pixels. bringing to light ""who was really terrible"" would merely further reward this type of general cowardice and reduce the enjoyment of pvp. i myself am reluctant even to use killboards because it encourages me to take the same precations in the name of ""stats"". reconsider.regards,kehmor"
4/29/2008,"you were my probably my 2nd ever 1v1 pvp victory kehmor. and i promise you back then we weren't much more seasoned than you were as a fighting corp. pojo's typhoon schooled us all while the war was on. i still remember our caracal duel distinctly, and i'm very glad you have stuck with the game yourself. well remember this stuff is going to happen in some way or another with faction warfare, there will be dynamic results based on in-game accomplishment, ships killed, lp collected, establishments nuked, widgets salvaged etc etc. every merc corp of note at the moment runs a killboard and invites their clients to take a look at it to assess whether they are worth hiring - why shouldn't this functionality be tapped into to make a more useful war-declaration and fighting system? you are certainly right with regard to jf's early history, we were a tiny corp with a huge reputation and used pr to emphasize all victories and positively paint our defeats, the same could still be done - ultimately, you can't lie about killing ships or getting killed and not be called to task about it on the forums anyhow. you have to weigh up the current problems with the unfocused war-dec system against the benefit of hiding or occluding engagement stats i think. absolutely you won a tonne of respect from us for engaging and fighting hard for your rp principles as caldari nationalists. and i'm really glad you took a positive experience from the conflict. -continued"
4/29/2008,"well bare in mind i'm not talking about personal stats here. i'm talking about a war-system actually tracking the results of that war and leading to a result based on the actual engagements in space while its active. i'm not suggesting every pilot in eve has a public kill record that follows them around like a bad smell if they got blown up a lot as new players. this is a corporate reputation thing. its useful for mercenaries to opt in to a public assessment of their capability to make it easier to sell their services - that would be their shop window really. otherwise its a game mechanic thing to assess whether a war is still active and in the balance or whether one side or the other has won. we could certainly compromise on the suggestion and make the public side of conflict result listing an opt-in option that merc corps could agree to if they think its worth while for them. other conflicts would be resolved by comparing the hidden/internal engagement stats but unless they are mercs and trading on results there'd be no reason for them to publicize these things. i dunno, i can see your point on the personal/individual/character level yes. in general i agree, not every eve character should be tracked in this way and there is no purpose for the publicizing of performance on the corp/alliance level unless its a merc corp that wants these things made public as a sales technique. of course in the bounty-hunting suggestion i link to in the op there you'd have an example of bounty hunting players listing their accomplishments on a leader board too but thats again an opt-in, profession choice, rather than a general tracker. as to people being embarrassed about losing and just playing even more carefully - well, like i said, it shouldn't be a universally reported thing for everyone. i'm primarily interested in this functionality for a) interior mechanic for deciding concord wars b) external op-in listing for professional entities and c) leader boards for eves deadliest bounty-hunters. flashy show-offs can certainly pursue flashy show-off pr results, but the average eve player shouldn't be ""punished"" with embarrassment over terrible kill figures. anyway kehmor, don't worry about me going all ""elite-pvp"" on you, i lose loads of ships and list them all on our public killboard aways. i've always considered being brave enough to keep fighting and take a bullet for the team is a much better assessment of whether i want to hire someone than absolute killboard efficiency anyways - the people with the best ratios in eve tend to have a very boring/selfish fight style that doesn't work well in our alliance anyways. hope this addresses your concern somewhat kehmor. and again, very glad you're playing! and i hope you're a stone cold cerberus ace by now!"
4/29/2008,just wanted to let you know you have my support jade. i've taken the time to read through many of your posts in the past and more recently with your csm candidacy and i must say more often than not i agree with you. you have a good grasp of how things really are in eve and what the true causes of many of the problems this game has.all that being said you officially have my endorsement and will have my vote when the time comes.
4/29/2008,"you didn't actually answer my question. i get what you're saying and i agree about the problemshypothetically, if i did have a solution that had significant advantages over yours and fewer disadvantages or cons, solved all the problems you cite and more, would you drop your solution?what i'm really asking is are you willing to lay aside your own ideas and represent the ideas of others if they are better than yours?edit: and argue other's points with the same vigor?"
4/29/2008,"i'm not really keen on playing games with arcane debating techniques spoon thumb. and i don't like leading questions - hence the way i chose to answer you earlier. i much prefer people to just come out and say what they think, make proposals, let us all take a look at them and give appropriate value to good ideas. basically, just say what you think! i can't answer your question above (for example) because its a logical trap (i have to answer yes or it means i'm nuts) but i am interested in hearing your solutions to the problems of 0.0 sovereignty and overpowering defense advantage though, and if i like what i hear i'll be very happy to support your ideas and advocate them. i don't care which organization you are from, if you've got good ideas that are in the interest of dynamism in space combat i'll happily support them. yes absolutely."

4/29/2008,i will vote for you if you refer to yourself in all offical csm material as hardon.
4/29/2008,"this quote is taken from hardin's csm site:i have a question for hardin:after stating the above on your site, how do you plan on down-playing the fact that you have been heavily influential in the leadership of a large alliance that has controlled an entire 0.0 region for 4 years. the cva has many influential allies in the surrounding regions, the core of whom are referred to by outsiders as ""the amarrian block."" if this is not a mega-block, would the term ""huge"" describe it properly?"
4/29/2008,"always nice to answer questions from my friends in star fraction firstly, we have only fully controlled providence for less than a year - not four. yes our influence over providence is something which has grown slowly but steadly since the launch of 'operation deliverance' but by no means could we claim to have controlled the region until relatively recently.secondly, i would hardly call myself heavily influential within that 'bloc' (if that is what you want to call it). i am not the leader of the cva, although many assume that i am simply because i am the most public face of the alliance.third, the cva itself only comprises 789 pilots currently and that is after a year of growth! a look at this -"
4/29/2008,how neutral against changes in game mechanics like the proposed destructionable outpostsor rebalancing of bridges jammers etc?
4/29/2008,"i have already said elsewhere that i am open to suggestions in these areas provided they maintain some balance.even regarding the issue of 'destructible' outposts i am not without compromise. as i said on the ooc forums:""i am not necessarily opposed to outposts going pop... provided that: - ccp reduces the effort required to build and maintain them- comes up with a workable solution to the issue of people's assets stored in those stations - that there is a reasonable time lag 'destruct countdown' involved so that the people who want outposts to pop have to maintain control and 'defend' the station for a reasonable period."" and there are other options than the black and white suggestion that outposts simply exist or don't exist. others have suggested the idea of 'derelict' & 'disabled' stations which also have promise.personally i don't think outposts should be destructible (although i will look at both sides of the case) because i believe they are a key part of the process of developing 0.0 and attracting people to come and live there - something which will enhance pvp opportunities not hinder them. yes they do mean people can play dock monkey... but hell its not hard to avoid pvp in 0.0 even if there isn't a station in local if people want to - so stations are not the problem. but in addition to that i also like them from a roleplay perspective. they add a permanence and a history to the game that no other structure does. i am looking forward to the day that eve front in game wiki goes live so that i can write a history of 'unity/deliverance reclaimed' in 9uy detailing the various sieges - so that when a pilot jumps into the system they can get a feel of the epic battles that have been fought over the station. (and i invite you to do the same zoolkhan )while ushra'khan no longer have the station it is still a legacy and reminder that they were there - that they existed. i hope players of eve in 10 years time can jump into 9uy and look up the ownership history of the station and get an idea of the ebb and flow of eve politics and warfare (whether or not cva still controls it )i also believe that some of the proponents of 'destructible' outposts are not seeing the larger picture. they seemingly wish to turn the clock back to 2004 when a small number of mega alliances 'owned' huge tracts of space - simply because there was no way for smaller alliances to get established and defend their claims. if outposts were destructible then the megablocks would simply play a scorched earth game and there would be no real motivation for smaller alliances to populate 0.0 when everything they build could be torched at the whim of megablock enemy. this could be rectified by making outposts cheaper to build and maintain so that they are not so much of an investment risk but i have my doubts about how realistic that is. i believe the opportunity to build outposts and then effectively defend them against 'the blob' is one of the reason 0.0 is becoming increasingly crowded and increasingly fractious, divided and warlike - which in my opinion is a positive trend in eve because it inevitably leads to more conflict!saying that i also believe smaller 'guerilla' forces should be given more options to 'annoy' a sov holder without the need to engage in full scale pos warfare. for example the ability to completely shut down a station (no services - including no docking) for a specific period (i.e. two weeks). obviously something like this offers huge potential for pure griefing so again the mechanics would need to be closely examined before being implemented..so in summary, yes it is my personal belief is that outpost should not be destructible. however if someone can come up with a good compromise or suggestion that addresses some of my reservations then i am not going to rule it out simply because i am a member of the cva."
4/29/2008,"hi hardin,i've noticed you haven't weighed in on many (any?) of the ""what's the most important issue"" questions - can we get a definitive answer on what you feel is the most important issue that you would bring to ccp as a member of council?specifically, your response to this question in the evemag interview is very vague - you say you are:i hesitate to interpret this as saying you will champion the rights of sovereignty holders without a clear confirmation from you - is that the case?"
4/29/2008,"my question was simple hardin. i was not asking for your opionion, but if you can ensureneutrality on that topic even though your alliance has , what? 8 ops now and potentially a lot to loose if the current game mechanics would receive a change in favor to the attackers.this comes down to the ability to divide ingame from oog - someone who can divide itwould spot the inbalance(?) and perhaps initiate a change although it would not make the ingamefriends and allies too happy. a unpopular decision so to speak, can you handle that?perhaps in fewer lines?"
4/29/2008,"well you have my vote hardin, good luck regardsrenosha"
4/29/2008,"sorry if this has been asked before, but:what is your opinion of the local chat channel, and it's powerful function to allow people to completely avoid pvp?"
4/29/2008,"i am not going on to csm to 'champion' anything for anyone.unlike jade, (for whom, incidentally, you seem to be doing such a great cheerleading job) i do not believe that at this stage the candidates for the csm should be sticking flags in the ground and drawing lines in the sand.i believe that approach is counterproductive, close minded and certainly not the approach i would expect from someone who is try to convince us that they are willing to work as part of a team because that is what the csm should be.yes we are all to some extent biased, based upon our experiences in this game (as indicated by my post above) and yes i expect some hearty, healthy debate.however, if the csm is to be effective its members have to be open minded and make decisions based upon what they think is best for the interests of the game and not just for the benefit of their own alliances or playstyles and i am afraid jade just hasn't convinced me on that score.i really don't want to spend a week in iceland with a bunch of people who have already decided how everyone else should play the game and who are not willing to compromise because they have already sold their souls to a variety of forum bandwagons.fortunately, i am confident that the majority of candidates don't want that either!"
4/29/2008,well i did already answer this kinda in my blog www.hardinfaq.blogspot.comis hardin biaised?yes. i think anyone who says they are not biaised should be shot as a liar right now. there are things in my eve history and how i play the game which have influenced my perspective on certain things. these perceptions could be regarded as 'bias' but similarly can simply be seen as my point of view. while i do believe i am open-minded and open to new ideas (as every amarrian should :p) i will be honest and say that i am not a blank page and that i will not automatically endorse every idea suggested to me in an effort to win this election. that said i am in general an amiable chap and will judge every idea on its merits - not on the basis of which person or alliance proposed it.yes i can separate ingame from out of game and as i have said before i will not support cva interests simply because they are cva interests - although of course my experience will colour my perspective on certain issues and it will be up to other csm members to change my mind (or vice versa ).at the end of the day i am an eve player who loves this game and wants this game to improve. maybe it is a naive hope that csm will be successful tool in that improvement process but i certainly want us to make an effort!
4/29/2008,"but surely, if the csm's role is to raise issues before ccp, at some point you have to choose what issues to raise. will you shed some light on what sorts of issues you personally would bring up for the council to vote on and then present to ccp? or would you not bring up any issues and only vote on others' proposals?"
4/29/2008,i really don't think raising issues is going to be a problem - as this forum already demonstrates! i mean exactly how many issues can we get honestly expect to get through?if no one else decides to raise them then amongst the first issues i would raise ismacroers (reducing)bacon (banning)roleplay (enhancing)pos warfare (improving)pos maintenance (simplifying)lag (destroying)newbies (encouraging)0.0 (developing)markets (improving)dev transparency (illuminating)destroyers (boosting)somehow i think others may beat me to it
4/29/2008,"posting my opinion from another thread:similarly, on the issue of local, i can see why some people are such advocates for its removal. however, i also see very good reasons why the removal of local would actually diminish (rather than increase) the likelihood of enjoyable pvp.obviously we will have to agree to disagree sometimes but we also have to be able to compromise and adapt our standpoints based upon the input we receive from all the players of eve and not just those that reflect the interests of our own particular corps.specifically and quickly on local removal:1) uncertainty - uncertainty increases the desire for safety. safety is obtained by either not travelling to risky areas or seeking saftey in numbers - its human nature. the removal of local increases uncertainty gigantically and unless an effective alternative is put in place it is, in my opinion, more likely to reduce pvp action than increase it.2) tedium - making things harder is not in itself wrong. i am sure there are many vets who long for a really hardcore eve. the problem is there is a fine line between challenging and tedious. make life too difficult and you run the risk of driving people out of the game. and while we are at it lets just make eve that little bit more unpleasant and daunting for people joining the game, after all its not like they have enough to get to grips with already.3) solo play - the removal of local will pretty much eliminate solo play in 0.0. that's fine if you believe that 0.0 should be a mercilessly hostile unforgiving place but not so fine if you believe in developing economies and creating empires in 0.0. it's not like we should be doing anything that would encourage people to leave empire space anyway!while those are my major concerns there are also big issues around login traps. jump scout in, scan gate, one enemy in local, move scout on, jump fleet in, **** there's now 50 people on the gate - no warning whatsoever!also undocking. no local - no idea who is in the system as you can't scan. okay let's put windows on the station - erm what if they are all in cloakers? okay lets introduce in station scanners - erm what if they are all in cloakers?as it stands it just seems way too imbalanced and impractical to me and if it was going to be introduced should have been introduced 4 years ago! maybe there are ways around some of the issues i have outlined. maybe i am just being too 'carebear' for my own good but i honestly think that the removal of local without an adeqaute alternative would severely damage the playing experience for the vast majority of players!i also forgot to add 'sociability' to that. while many players do not interact outside their own corps many others do. removing local could make eve even more unfriendly (particularly for new players) place than it is now.there options about how you could reduce the impact of removing local - for instance the channel still exists but only people who talk are shown and instead of a complete list of everyone in the system it instead shows a break down of:blues xxneutrals xxreds xxwar targets xxnot sure how practicable that is though!in summary, i believe the removal of local without some adequate form of replacement will actually reduce pvp opportunities (based on my understanding of human nature). it will lead to a reduction in quality pvp and increased blobbage and gankage - particularly of individuals and small groups. it will not infact make targets easier to find and kill because those targets will have either moved to empire or some other less risky profession!"
4/29/2008,"thanks, that's the sort of thing i was asking after.i'd like to hear some specifics on:roleplay (enhancing)pos warfare (improving)pos maintenance (simplifying)0.0 (developing)as your ideas on exactly how these areas can be enhanced, improved, simplified and developed are central to what you would support/push for on the council and thus important for us to know."
4/29/2008,"hey there guys! finally a section where i can be cool and have a question thread. i hold off from posting it in general discussion till the csm forum was running. but here we are! first of all, welcome to my thread. please feel free to post questions! my campaign site is here.my discussion on the state of the economy is here.as for real life. i am a student from denmark, with my main interests in computer science and physics. so for the majority of the actual length of the first csm, i will be able to dedicate quite a good amount of time to csm, should i be elected.that is about it for now. i'll expand this post as we go on, but now i gotta get some breakfast and catch up with all these sweet threads that just begs to be answered! if you wanna contact me, you can either evemail, email or catch me on messenger. my details are on my campaign site! i appreciate your support guyscheers.charlie ""lavista"" eriksen"
4/29/2008,"heya lavista vista! glad to see you have a spot. one question i have yet to see answered exactly how will we vote? i ahve looked over as much as i could and no where do i see that discussed, might you know? btw i do know some want it changed but changed from what?"
4/29/2008,"well, as i understand it, here's how it goes:from monday, may 5th, there will be a link on the front-page, and likely also on the login screen, which will take you to the website, where you will be able to vote for 1 candidates(you can vote with several accounts). and people are allowed to vote ""abstain"".the top 9 candidates(those with most votes) will get a position. omber zombie wrote a nice post of what he wants changed. one of the interesting things i agree with him on, for instance, is that 1 vote isn't enough. we have 2 ""groups"" of people, the pvp and industry guys. while they might overlap, i would still love to vote for 2 types of candidates, to have both aspects of the game, represented.but hopefully we will learn something from the first time, and csm 2 will be even better. i know i will try and make csm 1 as smooth as possible, if i get elected. and hopefully i will be able to pass on tricks to the people on csm 2, to keep the success going, if it turns out that way! but for csm 2 we will probably see a person have like 3 votes, which they can spread over 3 candidates. that would be nice."
4/29/2008,thanks ever so much.
4/29/2008,"mynas says you're a bob alt.anyway, with your already in depth experience with ccp, i feel there could be a conflict of interest between your other projects and csm, could you ever see this becoming the case, even the slightest possibility?"
4/29/2008,"mynas says a lot, some would say too much."
4/29/2008,i've taken your suggestion and answered it here
4/29/2008,"imo the cliff edges (0.5 to 0.0 gates) create very interesting game play and a diverse environment. i wouldn't like to see the cliffs blended into low-sec. i would be very interested to see if an alliance could affect a low-sec environment themselves, and how this would can be made interesting and rewarding game-play."
4/29/2008,"good day to you ms steele,i'm thinking you will have a good chance of getting my vote, even if you are caldarian :)you have done some really great projects for the entire community, rivaled only by chribba's work.my question : as a full time thief which has been serving the rens hub systems since 2004 i would like to know what improvements you think could be made that would effect the pilfering profession in a positive way?i envision -better directional scanner - bring back the old scanner display.better scan probes - make them as effective as when they were originally released.skills and equipment to allow the anchoring of secured cans that have expired.perhaps a new ship class for thieves and salvagers.what are your thoughts ?have a nice day :)menod penter - mayor of rens"
4/29/2008,"in my experience, all an alliance (or corporation) would need to do to exert an immediate influence on a low-sec environment is gather a couple of command ships, bs, and a hic or two on the low-sec side of the divide and do pretty much what one does with the same kit in 0.0 itself - what with the gate guns being as rubbish as they are. as it is, i'm pleased that you're running serenity. it'll make it that much harder for me to decide who i'll be voting for when the balloon goes up."
4/29/2008,"this is a question i intend to pose to several candidates who fit the same category:given the likelihood that many players may vote after doing nothing more than reading the candidate profiles (here), why is it that you felt it unimportant or unnecessary to exert a minimal amount of effort and post some key aspects of yourself or points of your campaign? as i see it, the candidate profile is the single most important place to get your point accross clearly and concisely, as it will be read by the most players, and many will never see anything else. based on this, it seems you expected people to vote for you based solely on a trite catchphrase, rather than anything of real substance.if you could not be bothered to do the work necessary to put out your information in your profile, why should we believe that you are up to the task of doing all the work that will be associated with a seat on the csm?"
4/29/2008,"i gave this specific issue a thought before running for csm. i see a potential conflict of interest between the player bases views i have to represent as a csm candidate may alienate sections of the player base against my projects. i don't see my projects effecting my performance as csm, since the projects are driven by desire to improve the eve.if you are referring specifically to any commercial interest i may have with the strategic map book, my agreement is with the publisher mmm publishing, not ccp, so i don't see a conflict there."
4/29/2008,"interesting profession, and not one i morally support, but accept it as part of the eve sandbox. off the top of my head ...in terms of the features for thieves, i would think along the lines of the ability to skill-based hack secure cans anchored in space - perhaps linked to the duration before expiry of the can, similarly perhaps for hacking pos. you could even extend it to hacking secure cans in corporation hangers.to balance this, maybe:- the skill level of the anchoring person determines the level of difficulty to hack the can and a ""kill-right"" or similar given to the person who's can was being hacked. - a long-length time-out on being able to make another attempt on the same canto make this effective would need a mechanic implemented to buying/selling kill-rights for bounty hunters to track down and kill thieves to be effective. imo this area is all about balance. as a thief, you could game this mechanism by:- manipulating the market for your own kill-rights, thus buying up anyone else's ability to kill you at prices under the value of the cargo you looted. - (or) game the mechanism by looting your own alts cargo to bump up your kill prices to high levels - this in turn would would need to be balanced by bounties on your head. -- of course you could game that by placing a massive bounty on your own head and only undocking to loot more of your own cans. that would need to be balanced by displaying how many kill-rights are currently in circulation for your thief.and so on ... at the end of the day it needs a good thinking through of the issues of balance."
4/29/2008,there were a couple of reasons:- i was close to the deadline before organising my personal and work life to be ready to take the commitment the csm requires.- i'm not one for long speeches- the intention was to have a simple message that is easy to remember while highlighting the core values i bring to the role- it should ring true to anyone who i have had contact with in eve- i aimed to pique players interest to click the link for my personal site.your assumption that i could not be bothered is false.
4/29/2008,"no, i was just putting that there as i am currently at work and don't have the time to fill it out properly yet - better something for everyone to read than nothing at all."
4/29/2008,vote oz for his drive for a different voting system!
4/29/2008,"you don't have your corp-tag on and i don't recognize your name. additionally, i have to ask a question so i don't get the hose for trolling: how do plan on over-coming the slight obstacle that no one knows who you?"
4/29/2008,"a fair question, thank you for the opportunity to reply:i am known in the eve community, but maybe in different circles than those you travel within? i have been mostly involved in the science/blueprint/manufacturing/trading side of eve for the past 2.5 years. ask about (try the bpo channel) - i'm that guy that has been asking for conflagration m bpo's for the past 2 years. i realise that it is hard to get a feeling for candidates that you have not personally dealt with in-game before. i have nothing to hide, so feel free to pose reasonable questions!take care,bruce hansen"
4/29/2008,"to all candidates, what changes, if any, would you suggest for the invention process?feel free to admit a lack of knowledge on the subject."

4/29/2008,"like arithron i whod like to see more seeding of decryptors.even the idea off me/pe research is somewhat a good idea, that will level the playing ground between bpo and copies, though it can have a bad turnout in the long run.edit:i have just started with the invention part of the game so i dont have any extensive know all to it"

4/29/2008,"besides the very obvious ""balance"" there are a few key axioms in eve that bind it together.1. eve is game and should be fun2. specialization should produce decreasing marginal returns3. everyone and everything has a role.4. there should be no hegemony of the rich or old[also, see point 2]5. risk should correlate positively with reward.if you can hold to these then you can really make the game a better place for everyone involved. currently a few are failing.ed: if i mischaracterize your question please let me know and ill change it right up."

4/29/2008,"i'm curious; in a game that's so intensely capitalistic, why do you think that there should be no hegemony of the rich? where are you going with this idea?"
4/29/2008,the logoff(ski) issue?1) capital logoffs (15 minute timer)2) bs logoff at jump in
4/29/2008,"can you expand on these points pls.they already do as far as i am aware its called stacking penalties can you be more specific pls.is this in reference to the titan and the fact that a lot of your alliance seem to think a blob of friggies should be able to tackle and kill them, or are you referring to something else and if so what?.this point seems to be saying that those who work hard are smart, successful and have been working at it for a long time should not benefit from it.id like you to also explain this in detail as well pls."
4/29/2008,"question: please explain the answers in this postto start with, lecrotta, i would appreciate it if you did not troll this thread. you have a main and can post with it, and if not, then your previous statements disqualify you from having a reasoned debate on this subject as can be seen by the ignorance and strawman you have already spewed forth in your short time here. e.g.but to answer your questions, the list is a guide of how you ought to balance eve. such the ""i thought this happened"" has no relevance. if its happening its good. there are areas where it is not happening[speed/agility and tech 2 cruisers specifically, and these break a few of the other axioms as well]. but that is really besides the point other than the issue that not conforming with the axioms they ought to be changed so that they do.regarding titans. again, this is a point of balance. everyone needs to be useful in order to keep everyone having fun. no one believes that we should be able to kill a titan with frigates, please refrain from strawman in the future.you are confusing hegemony with benefit. they are two very different terms with two very different meanings. eve has never been a game where the rich or old can dominate the poor. not in design ideal, nor in execution. there have been points where this has failed[and fails now], but it is still a core design principle. to give an example of this hegemony in another game, you could look at wow. if you are not level 70 with epic gear[or very close], don't bother fighting others, keep grinding npcs and run away from the others.but eve is, at its core, a pvp game, and hegemony destroys that. especially hegemony of the rich and old for they offer no real way to breach.there is nothing to explain, maybe you should try a dictionary if you don't understand what is going on with such a simple statement as this one.and now to address the non-trollhegemony of the rich and old creates a perpetual subservience of the poor and young. this is explicitly bad for the game as fewer players will wish to continue past their trial. why would they when they cannot have any effect until they are old and rich, where in those who are old and rich now will be even more powerful by the time they get there?this point goes hand in hand with the specialization point and the risk/reward point. when there is a hegemony of the rich and old they are able to exploit low risk situations for higher reward and their specialization is rewarded in strength and not just versatility. instead of having a higher risk for that higher reward and less value for that specialization.this creates old guards that only die when their will to play the game ends. this is not fun for anyone really. it means less young people will continue to play the game and it means less change in politics and sovereignty. the game thrives on both of these things."
4/29/2008,"i was not trolling i was asking for clarification on several of your points and i would post with my main but he is banned for posting cat pictures on caod.now i downloaded your documents and read through them and found them well presented if a little vague and now im asking for clarification on the bullet points you put on here, you did say you would answer them after all."
4/29/2008,can you explain what you want clarified? because most of what i posted is fairly self explanatory. do you want to know why i think these axioms are central to how eve should be balanced? do you want to know what a specific balance created by these i think should be implemented?
4/29/2008,"you posted a list of ideals and not ideas, now ideals are great but you can use them to justify all manner of unnecessary changes after the fact. so what i am asking for is a list of things that you consider are most in need of changing, with these ideals as the principal reason for the change:2. specialization should produce decreasing marginal returns3. everyone and everything has a role.4. there should be no hegemony of the rich or old[also, see point 2]5. risk should correlate positively with reward."
4/29/2008,"the same thing i said in the top issues threadspecifically i want to make it much easier to attack strategic and economic pos modules[though i would add a reinforcement timer on them. i want to reduce the strength and effectiveness of aoes. there was an idea of making a dd into an ewar module which seemed like it would be really nice to keep it useful but not overpowered and game breaking.i want to possibly move dreads off grid from their targets[while only making them effective against pos's and capitals.regarding speed, i think there needs to be more and stronger counters. i think that smaller ships should have more inherent advantage via sig radius and speed and i think speed mods need looking at. this touches on hegemony, role, specialization and risk. [specifically probably my web idea, though final numbers would need to be tweaked, and i would either revert speed mods back to pre-revelations status, or i would separate them into +speed, + agility, and - signature radius with no overlap]u.i. just pertains to the usability of the game in general which touches on point one and the rest of the points if it increases functionality in a way that takes a lot of the disadvantage out of not knowing the u.i."
4/29/2008,"without wanting to be accused of being a strawman it seems to me that all you have done is rephrase your pet gripes about the ddd, nano and cloaking/scanning into a more positive sounding format. id hoped it was not true and that you would have put together considerably more and varied content but it seems im going to be disapointed.this is what i feel a candidate should offer:but all you seem to be doing is pushing your own agenda and personal issues from your own limited perspective of the game."
4/29/2008,"i am not sure why you would consider these ""pet gripes"". if i have ever had a ""pet gripe"" it would have clearly been the amarran problems[and i disagreed with many of the solutions they implemented]. these problems shown in ddd, nano, and cloaking/scanning are problems which are very significant and integral to the game[i also note how you conveniently ignore the issues with pos's], they are not pet issues of mine but issues which affect all players in the game in negative ways. they are the largest issues of the moment and since that is what you asked about, that is what i talked about.there are certainly others, remote sensor damps and tracking disruptor stacking, the inability of small ships to be valuable due to webs, the problems with leadership skills, the problem of tiering(you will need to scroll down to post 11, the direct link does not seem to be working), the problems of overlapping ship design which currently effects the maller, prophecy, abaddon, tempest, punisher, as well as a variety of other ships, and how we can quickly and easily make good changes to pos warfare.there will certainly be more[u.i. usability, bad target calling mechanics, problems with deaggressing timers not scaling well, problems with specific ships, lack of market based economic warfare, lack of structure to form proper isk based loans and other contract overhauls(while good they can easily be improved)]. but if i had the time to deal with all of those i would be a game developer and not a csm candidate.do not be confused with the issues i bring up and my own agenda, most of the time i will bring up an issue because i feel that changing it will benefit the game as a whole. also do not be confused with my ability to recognize good ideas and expand and bring them forth.the simply pos spam solution, and the movement of dreads off grid were both not my solutions. i was not the one who originally proposed increasing the drone bay on the tempest. i was not the one who originally proposed increasing clip size of artillery. i have not been the first to want market based economic warfare, i was not the first to propose simply scanning down cloaked ships nor was i to propose rat aggression timers[i think]. i am absolutely certain that i was not the first to come up with some afs being moved to the leadership line. i am not under the illusion that my ideas are necessarily the best, though naturally i feel they have strong merit or i would not have proposed them. but i do feel that the ideas i propose and bring to the table, whether or not they are mine, are all strong ideas and the problems that they hope to solve are all important."
4/29/2008,i will not deny that some of your ideas have merit although a lot of them seem to reduce the overall effectiveness of single ship types/styles of fit and lean towards a one ship can combat all style of eve. and while this may seem like a good idea to less skilled and newer players it also takes away the ability for ppl to put together a gang or fleet of varied specialized ships and pilots in favor of conformity and universal fitting/ship types.
4/29/2008,"motives for jihadswarm as stated by the goonswarm rep:""vile rat emphasized that this was not a campaign against new pod pilots, but against those who by now should be making it in lawless space with all of its dangers."" (source)i.e., goonswarm has a definitive view on who should be playing where and doing what, and those who do not should be coerced through force. that sounds pretty clear to me.how do you reconcile this with the public statements of members of goonswarm that they are not in fact ""playing eve,"" but instead playing their own game. this game is one which transcends eve and in which ""fun"" is defined as causing trouble and distress for others, and for which the end goal is to make other players close their accounts and stop playing? (source)apparently, not all of your alliance agrees with the motives and objectivs you claim they have. why should the playerbase trust your motives to be any different?"
4/29/2008,"in this case, they are. either kugutsmen's actions were right or they were wrong. which is it?"
4/29/2008,"i never intend to move towards ""one ship can combat all styles"". and would say instead that i want to move away from that. i think you are referring to nano-ships at the moment so i will address this with regards to that. with nano-ships it is the exact problem that the tech 2 cruisers when fit for speed are so strong that their abilities overshadow the abilities of all other ships and fits to the point where if you want to compete[and by compete, i mean 'kill these types of ships'] you need to have about as many of these ships in your fleet as your opponent. it has come to the point where major alliances simply don't use frigates anymore[a good example is bob, which no longer flies interceptors and dictors in favor of recaons/hacs/hictors]. simply because the frigates are superfluous in all types of combat.the specific problem can be exemplified by looking at two specific ships. the first is the thorax, and the second is the brutix. when fit for speed, a brutix performs the same role that the thorax does, except better, it has more hit points, more dps, longer range[larger blasters], the same size drone bay, is faster and as agile[or more agile and as fast], it locks targets faster, and has a better active tank[when both are fit as such]. and this is not ""it does any one of these things"" but ""it does all of these things better at the same time"". unless the thorax fits speed mods[something it should not have to do for various reasons] the brutix actually makes a better thorax than the thorax."
4/29/2008,"actually the brutix fits the same sized guns just two more of them than the thorax and yes its a better ship than the thorax in all regards cos its a battlecruiser instead of just a cruiser.it seems to me that you want to stop ppl from upgrading as nobody who can fly a ceptor or a af would fly a normal t1 frigate, nobody who could fly a interdictor or hic would fly a ceptor and so on and so on. your trying to devolve ppl, ships and modules/fitting styles who have spent a lot of isk and time training for ships that are improvements over lower sp ones they have outgrown."
4/29/2008,"from reading what g is saying is that 1 set of ships isn't supposed to obsolete the other, in other words the brutix obsoletes the thorax making it pointless to use a thorax. a battlecruiser should have a role, not obsolete its smaller variation. i have a ? though for g, i understand your reasoning behind the brutix and thorax, what are your ideas behind thorax and diemos. obviously the diemos obsoletes it. do you believe the t2 ship should be penalized or left as is?"
4/29/2008,"no, the brutix will be fitting higher tier blasters. not larger as in large > medium. larger as in bigger. unless the thorax is fitting neutron blasters[in which case the brutix has just as much range].no, its that the upgrade from these types of ships is much too severe. the value you gain too much. it is not that people should not be flying these ships but the advantage that they bring does not correlate with the risk. currently the game is very nearly ""don't come unless you can fly a t2 cruiser or better"". because they pretty much obsolete everything below them.it seems to me you are simply attempting to strawman me instead of addressing the actual argument."
4/29/2008,"posted with an alt (kaben), usually don't care who i post with but will post with main."
4/29/2008,"most of the t2 ships should be left as they are so long as the means that they use to make themselves overpowered is reduced. that a deimos is stronger than a thorax is not a huge issue, since both are very ""generalist"" ships and don't benefit from the advantages of speed mods. the increased benefit of flying the deimos comes at a significantly higher risk.[which is not really so with a brutix due to insurance, and also not so with the majority of t2 cruisers].it would be nice if the deimos had a specialist role like most other hacs, but i don't see that as something we could reasonably change today.the key point is that there is a much smaller difference between the deimos and thorax than there are between the other hacs which mainly comes in their ability to be fast, agile, and do significant dps outside of web range without sacrificing much of anything.such, instead of the deimos being 25% better than a thorax at its primary role[dps in the short range] with 25-30% more ehp, the hacs are 25% better at doing dps with survival rates with 50% more ehp, while going 100% faster, while being able to dps from 50% farther away. these factors combine to make them be able to disengage too easily. disengaging too easily lowers risk below the value that will correlate with our increased risk/reward model that eve has going for it."
4/29/2008,how is it? whether his actions are o.k. are dependent on information that i do not know about and such cannot answer. nor is it exclusive that you ought to protect whistle blowers but not protect illegal actions to obtain that information.
4/29/2008,"a t2 cruiser or better fitted t2 costs at least 200 mil with rigs how can you say that its wrong for a ship like this to far outclass all ships below it, cos as far as im concerned it should far out class them. this is my issue with your ideas as they are reducing what ppl have ratted trained and paid monthly fees for a long time to achieve, yes in eve right now there is a lot of t2 ships about but also there are a lot of ppl training for them because they are great fun to fly, remember your ""make eve lots of fun"" number one rule."
4/29/2008,"another question, which you will probably ignore as well, but i am asking it of several candidates who did the same thing, so in the interest of fairness i direct it to you as well:given the likelihood that many players may vote after doing nothing more than reading the candidate profiles (here), why is it that you felt it unimportant or unnecessary to exert a minimal amount of effort and post some key aspects of yourself or points of your campaign? as i see it, the candidate profile is the single most important place to get your point accross clearly and concisely, as it will be read by the most players, and many will never see anything else. if you can't put forth anything to catch voters' interest here, they're not going to bother following a url with no description attached.if you could not be bothered to do the work necessary to put out your information in your profile, why should we believe that you are up to the task of doing all the work that will be associated with a seat on the csm?"
4/29/2008,"vile rat is no longer the goonswarm diplomat. nor would his word be taken at face value. goons like to have fun, and if people think that we have some grand-overarching theme and act on it, we will have fun. its funny when people think that we are doing things for reasons other than to have fun, like we have some campaign against the people in empire. no, jihad swarm started when one goon was like ""i'm having fun suiciding hulks in empire, come suicide hulks in empire with me"" and a bunch of goons screamed ""allahu akbar"" and bought some suicide ships.you are misinterpreting the statements. he is mentioning how you can ""win"" at eve. because in eve you will not destroy a person unless they stop playing. since the advent of jump clones you simply cannot ever permanently destroy a character. goons play ""goons in space"" they do not play eve. this means they are out for fun first and foremost. that they don't care if you have fun at the same time does not mean that they do not want the mechanics that the game is played via to be fun and fair it simply means that they are going to use those mechanics to have fun and if someone gets in their way then its not their fault.i am getting to them all, it just takes time."
4/29/2008,"then i guess the question would be which takes precedence? protecting whistleblowers, or not protecting illegal actions? since you say you can't give an opinion for lack of information, then take it as a hypothetical. let's assume for the sake of argument that kugutsmen's actions which led to his whistleblowing were in line with his history of less then legal/appropriate means. if this was the case, should he be protected as a whistleblower or subject to the legal consequence of his actions? by the very definition, protecting and not protecting someone are mutually exclusive, they are opposites for crying out loud!"
4/29/2008,"a thorax with a estamil's modified invulnerability field costs over a billion isk. clearly it should far outclass all ships below it.[furthermore they are expensive because they are so good, and their loss rate, being much much much farther below others actually makes them much more isk efficient instead of less as dictated by the standard risk/reward model in eve.people have ratted and trained and paid monthly fees for a long time to achieve a lot of things. and each and every time it was imbalanced it was nerfed, many times with good cause. would you like to to run through the times the ""omg, but i trained for it"" argument has been used to justify unjustifiable positions? i can guarantee it will take me a long long time to come up with all of them.isk has never been a reason for ships to be imbalanced and never will be."
4/29/2008,"if he obtained the information illegally then his punishments are understandable as are criminal charges. if not, then no, it was unwarranted."
4/29/2008,if they aren't going to be bothered to follow a link they aren't going to be bothered to read a description. if you do not believe that what i wrote regarding that shows that i am up for the task then i don't know what to say.
4/29/2008,"but that is the issue bud, you think that the difference between t1 cruiser and below vs t2 cruiser is out of balance while a t1 cruiser costs 4-5 mil base unfitted and a t2 cruiser costs 100 mil base unfitted, this alone should make the t2 a massively (20x) better ship but if you fit both with t2 stuff and rigs the difference is slight compared to the cost in isk and training time."
4/29/2008,"a tech 2 heavy pulse laser costs roughly 100 times as much as a tech 1 heavy pulse laser. clearly then the tech 2 heavy pulse laser ought to be roughly 100 times better than the tech 1 heavy pulse laser...now that the idiocy of that argument has been exposed:if t2 ships become less valuable because they are no longer ships that you can get in and, if you are smart and careful, never lose while still engaging then their price will fall.it has always been the case that ships do not gain value linearly with their cost."
4/29/2008,"was he the goonswarm diplomat at the time of this statement? if so, it is still a valid representation of goon policy. if not, and it was an unauthorized statement contrary to the will of the leadership of goonswarm, then where is the public denounciation of such policy as the work of a rogue member and not representative of the alliance as a whole? if you don't keep control of your members' public statements, you are responsible for whatever perceptions those statements create.it worries me if the goons think that the only way to win eve is to make other players quit. is it not enough if you simply drive other players from your space, force them to withdraw to where they are no longer a threat to you? or is the only possible method of winning to harass such players to the point that they delete the game from their hard drive? this seems to be what he is saying, how is that ""misinterpreted?"" what part of it have i got wrong?also, how is it beneficial to the continuing health and growth of eve if your goal is to drive players away? chasing away players has the inevitable outcome of reducing subscriptions, less funding for ccp, and the eventual destruction of the game. in this light, shouldn't there be a different goal to your game?""you may be playing eve online, but be warned: we are playing something awful.""""the ability to inflict that huge amount of actual, real-life damage on someone is amazingly satisfying""""the way that you win in eve is you basically make life so miserable for someone else that they actually quit the game and don't come back.""(quotes taken from source linked earlier)these statements speak volumes about what type of game the goons are playing. eve is a game about spaceship combat, about risk and reward, about gain and loss. when all done within the context of the game, it can be fun regardless of which side of a battle you are on. but there is a limit, this all stops at the keyboard. except the goons take it beyond that. their game is to make players ""miserable,"" to completely destroy their will and desire to play. that's really great for community building, and a great perspective for the csm, isn't it? fair enough. you seemed to be responding out of order, and so i jumped to a conclusion. my apology for the mistake and my thanks for taking the time to respond."
4/29/2008,"look who is the strawman now, im not saying that a t2 cruiser is 20x better nor am i saying it should be and i am not saying that pulse lazers should be 100x better in fact as you clearly point out the differences are very very slight compared to the cost in isk and training time for both ships and modules in regards to t1 and t2. also insuring t2 ships is pointless so when you lose one its a big loss instead of just a insurance cost when you lose a t1 ship."
4/29/2008,"when there are over 60 candidates, you want people to go and read 60 webpages? i think that's a ridiculous expectation. your initial profile should give enough for a player to decide if they have enough interest in you as a candidate for it to be worth it for them to follow the link and read more. the profile statements provide a snapshot of who you are and what you stand for, and should be a means of narrowing down one's choices. not putting up any information in the statement either shows you are lazy, too busy to do something important, or have no platform on which to run."
4/29/2008,"this depends entirely on how often you lose them. insuring a hac is pointless because you can reasonably expect to hold onto it for more than three months not because it would not offset your losses. no, if you can reasonably expect to lose any ship in 3 months then insurance is a great deal in all instances, no matter the ship."
4/29/2008,or it means i mis-calculated the number of people that would be running and was optimistic that people would take the time to get to know candidates through various outlets. that it is not there is not an indication of lack of work. maybe a little idealism that people will take a little time.
4/29/2008,"personally i don't think g has a prob with t2 ships. i believe the problem stems from rock/paper/scissors in that there is a counter to things, but the problem stems when someone introduces dynamite. in this case dynamite needs a counter and from looking at what the devs do mostly is remove dynamite from the equation leaving us again with rock/paper/scissors until someone figures out how to make dynamite again."
4/29/2008,"i can accept that explanation. were there fewer candidates, i can see it being fairly reasonable to assume that more players would look at individual sites. however, regardless of the number of candidates, i think there will always be a certain portion of the population who will be just interested enough to look at initial statements, but no further. with this in mind, i think it would be in every candidate's best interest to take any opportunity to describe their platform, particularly in an official listing where you will be compared side-by-side with all the other candidates. i'm afraid that this may be a costly miscalculation for you and others. oh well, at least you put up the url, some didn't even bother to post a single word."
4/29/2008,"in jv1v when goons were ""fofo'ing"" in local after a successful battle a gm asked remdeial[the goon ceo at the time] to make them stop. he responded ""i am just the head of an internet spaceship guild. i can't make them stop""goons aren't a massive collective as we may seem. if you don't trust what i am saying and instead think that jihad swarm was some machiavellian scheme against players in empire then i won't be able to convince you.there really is no way to really beat a player. see ra for a good example[or goonswarm]. anyone can simply run to low-sec and build up to attack you again. this is fun and good for the game since it continues the dynamism. that we understand that you cannot truly beat someone without making them quit only means that we understand the nature of the game.if we drove everyone out of the game we would not be able to have fun. this would be bad for the swarm.you need to understand a bit about goonswarm and its history to understand these comments[specifically bob saying they were going to grief gs out of the game, which is what started this whole mess in the south, and these 'proclamations']. there is a lot of group mentality in the swarm, but its entirely due to fun and not due to some malicious feelings for the game or its players.we move to hit morale because that is how you win. its how you win on the sov map and its how you win in the game and its how you have fun. goons don't win when goons don't log on. and this holds for every single alliance and organization in the game. we want a game we want to log into to play, its that simple."

4/29/2008,"that's nice, but it completely sidestepped the question. the statement was publicly made to ccp in the form of an isd anouncement. it was made to sound as if it represented the alliance's objectives as a whole. if it did not, and was only the words of a single member, then your authorized reps should have been doing some damage control. since they did not, i have to assume that the motives for jihadswarm were as publicly stated.goonswarm is an alliance. an alliance can remove corps that don't adhere to policies. a corp can remove players that disobey orders. failure to keep control of members is a matter of choice, not ability. i agree it would be bad, for the game as a whole, for players to be driven to quit. why then is this an oft-stated goal of the goons, to make others miserable to the point of forcing them out of the game? if you truly believe that this is the nature of the game, and the only way to win, then i have to conclude that we are in fact playing two very different games. i play for my own fun and experience, not to destroy that of others. i'll blow up their ships, they'll blow up mine. i may try to make it difficult for them to operate in certain regions of space. i may try to wear down their wallets until they cannot afford to fight me for a time. but once i have forced them to back down, i do not pursue and harass them until i have made them ""miserable."" i do not make it impossible for them to do anything in the game until they are forced to quit. if they can build up and later come back, great, we can have some more fun. if they quit, then they no longer play and i no longer have a potential opponent, so we both lose. making other players quit is by no means a way to ""win"" eve. i'd have to say that with some rare exceptions, everyone loses each time a player quits, because then there is one less person contributing to a game that is built on player interaction.having said all that, i have to admit i have a bit more respect for you than certain others of your alliance. you have not attempted to deny the history or objectives of your group. you do not obscure or ignore what has happened in the past. i cannot agree with or endorse your rationalizations for such history, but i appreciate that you at least seem to be honest about it."
4/29/2008,"hello,i decided before i sat down for this intro that if i spent more than five minutes writing it, i've probably spent too long, so i'll keep this short. and yeah, my whole slogan thing is on the candidate listing page here.i'm just a guy who has a lot of interest in balance and improving eve online overall. i originally started as an amarr pilot two years and five months ago, when a real life friend of mine who was a career pirate convinced me to try it out. i joined goonfleet, and eventually he sort of got tired of the game as is natural and moved on to other things. however, many of my goonfleet friends and friends from corporations and alliances outside of or not even affiliated with goonfleet have also left eve, mostly just to burning out naturally. these people brought a certain enjoyment to the game that i wish could return, but that cannot happen until i help alleviate the things that made them burn out in the first place.back in 2006, mr rooflez - then a member of goonfleet - made a thread that convinced the developers to buff battlecruiser agility in revelations. following his example, i've done my part to give useful feedback to ccp to help the continual improvement of eve. over the past year, i have worked very hard through posting on the eve-o forums and reading people's thoughts on game balance. i have given feedback and ideas to ccp, some of which was actually accepted and implemented, such as the ""free move"" feature for easier fleet organization, implemented in trinity last december. i've also bugreported some very harmful bugs and exploits that have reduced lag and made the game more fun for everyone.the things i think the csm should put priority on discussing are, in no particular order:1. making pos warfare more accessible and more fun2. helping encourage small gang pvp, or simply encouraging more enthusiasm for pvp in general3. buffing upper-tier large autocannons (they really need it)4. making the game more accessible to new players5. ""capital ships online""6. improving corporate tools7. reducing lag (of course)8. making the user interface more digestible and intuitivethat's basically the whole deal. my website is"
4/29/2008,it seems there is a lot of talk about bacon ( and other local monitoring tools ) i think it would be nice if all csm's could post their opinion about these tools in this topic.
4/29/2008,"they will be gone before the 21th june, 2008.that is my stance and prediction."
4/29/2008,"first of all, i guess ccp in person of grimmi postet the point of view.nevertheless, future csms should keep this discussion/this problem in mind.personal statement:it's a a mixed blessing. on the one hand, those guys, who have a disadvantage outta that execrate bacon, on the other hand, those guys who wanna do afk-mining are affected in their kind of gaming.imho, all those things should be banned (regarding the minig-robot fact)."
4/29/2008,"hiposts i've made about bacon can be found here so you can understand point of view:bacon ain't sizzling and here where i describe it as unbalancing and an evil application.although as others have noted, ccp have promised removal/rendered useless. i hope to see that actioned very soon and hope i'm not alone in that opinion."
4/29/2008,bacon is bad for the game. fingers crossed ccp close the log-server data glitch that lets this program (and others like it) function.if bacon is still around should i be elected of csm i'll certainly be voting for this to be raised as an issue and condemned by ccp.
4/29/2008,"yep, exactly!if it isn't fixed the first time csm talks to ccp, i for one will make sure that ccp posts an update on what is going on. it needs to be fixed, and it needs to be fixed sooner rather than later."
4/29/2008,^ i fall under the same view of the two posts above me.
4/29/2008,"i think the issue that bacon has raised is a deeper one than most realise. the issue blew up into a massive controversy only after a particular group developed it and then publicly offered it to the community the fact is other groups had developed very similar tools to do the same job, but kept quiet about them (notably goonswarm). ccp have acknowledged that they were aware of this use of the gamelogs but took no position or action on it until it became public. if the logs are encrypted to prevent their use (as ccp have said there is no easy way to monitor if such tools are being used) all someone has to do if they hack the enctyption is to keep quiet about it. i believe it was kerion in an interview on evetv at fanfest said that he knew there were more devs in the goons than some other alliances. i believe to is the primary role of the csm to check that ccp maintain a level playing field for all and that their employees are prevented from gaining in game advantage using the internal affairs dept vigorously and pro-actively. i think the bacon affair has once again shown that ccp take the view if the player base don't know about an issue it isn't a problem. csm members should be duty bound to hold them to account and prevent such things from happening again"
4/29/2008,"i am 100% against it, mostly due to the way that it uses the logserver log, and it will give an unfair advantage compared to the people that dont use it, and the shear possibilities that can be built into bacon (macro like behaviour can easily be added to the program).i do not support bacon or any other program that uses unintended use of game/logserver logs."
4/29/2008,"imo low sec is the bastard child of 0.0 and empire circa 2005. it's unbalanced in terms of risk and reward in different activities. personally i'd rather be in empire or 0.0 any day of the week.it needs changing, how exactly is up to players that live there and those that don't see it as a useful play experience bridge to 0.0 to put their views forward. i'd weigh up their views, try second-guess ways any multi-point solution could be gamed to break low-sec entirely and then put up a case for the changes."
4/29/2008,"i've been playing eve online for more than a year now, and since then i've done almost everything there is to be done in this game -- i have a very broad range of experience, most particularly in the following areas:i'm an internet spaceship fleet commander, and have been for about the last nine months. i've fc'd gangs of between 5-150 people, including capfleets, and coordinated between gangs of up to four alliances at a time.i've flown nearly every shiptype from frigates to carriers, on my three combat characters. i have something like 250+ kills on my corp's killboard, so i'm a pretty experienced pvper.i've developed and installed moon mining chains for both corporate and personal use, and spent twelve hours at a time anchoring the damn poses.while we're discussing poses, i've theorycrafted and installed about two dozen control towers, ranging from small minmatar ratting poses to large complex reactor towers to faction-fitted domination control towers. i've also done my share of pos gunning, and have killed dreadnoughts using only the control tower itself.i've incapacitated cynojammers with battleship gangs and sieged towers for hours at a time. i've also provided the cyno for numerous hot drops.i've fought in lowsec, and escorted freighters through 0.0-0.4 space for dozens of jumps. i've also nearly lost a freighter, but that's a story for another time.you could probably say that i'm an experienced player based on the above, and it's the experiences that i have in this game that i believe make me a pretty good candidate. here's why:i know eve's game mechanics better than most, and i know how they can be used effectively. i have a wide breadth of knowledge, and the context to know how game mechanics interrelate.i know how to communicate, and i have nine months' experience in doing so as an fc. in real life, i am also a damn fine public speaker, albeit an extremely nerdy one.playing for so long, and across so many parts of the game, i know exactly how some areas of the game could be improved - and have demonstrated that in the features and ideas forum."
4/29/2008,"what is your experience with the industrial side of the game?you say you have done about everything to be done in this game. but the only thing remotely close to industry, is the moon-mining stuff. but that's more pos warfare related."
4/29/2008,"quite a bit.i've developed, installed and maintained half a dozen low-end complex reaction chains for both personal and corporate use. i think you're confusing pos logistics with pos warfare, as well: these chains were established in feythabolis months after the region was secured, so without shooting a thing.i have a bpo collection of my own, and have been producing in goonspace for personal profit for some time now. i've also been producing for my corporation at times using the corporate bpos, particularly in the lead-up to an offensive.on the corporate industry side as well, i've been responsible for the logistics behind moving billions of isk in materials from 0.0 to lowsec and vice versa, on a number of occasions. i'm very well aware of freighter mechanics as well, both on the side of 0.0 freighters and the afk-in-highsec kind."
4/29/2008,"everything you have mentioned so far is on the massive scale, large gangs, billions of isk, chains of poses, etc. what is your experiance of and thoughts for those of us who live a smaller simpler life?"
4/29/2008,"i've only been involved with corporate and alliance activities for about six or seven months now. prior to then, my activities have been entirely small-scale: ratting for personal profit, running small gangs around space, small-time production and at times a little mining as well.the thing is, i've kept to that. i'm australia, so being part of a us-based alliance it's extremely difficult to raise anything other than a small gang to run around with in the first place; likewise, for the first three or four months that i played, i ran around in poorly-fitted vigils as i learned to play the game well.so, i think i have a pretty solid level of experience of the 'simpler' life in these games. do you have a more specific question for me to answer, based on that?"
4/29/2008,will ccp be releasing a verified list of candidates' alternative character names across all accounts?
4/29/2008,"i'd happily list all my characters. but i doubt ccp will list not verify them, due to their privacy policy."
4/29/2008,"ok, i will probably lose popularity point by asking this, eventhough ill not hide behind an alt:a)what would be the added value of this except optentially destroying the candidatesingame experience already before the vote?b) some of us have several accounts, how deep do you want to dig?c) what do you expect to find?example from a csm pov:ingame i might be a cap pilot and my alts help me with logistics, cynofields etcand one could assume that a csm would appreciate if the ingame enemy finds out about thisby fair and conventional means."
4/29/2008,"i agree to a large degree. some people will make themself vulnerable by revealing alts.personally i have a pvp character(templer relleg), ceo alt(lavista ceo), ebank alt(ebank lavista), research alts(ly, le, livista vista), a hauling alt which is being deleted now, in order to make more research characters, because lavista can fly a hauler now.i'm known as chadk other places on the internet, ""chadk"" was my first trial account. chaddy is a character of mine, but i haven't played it for a long time.so i have nothing to hide. but i fully understand if people don't want to release this information, and i fully respect it."
4/29/2008,"the three characters i use most often are called daveydweeb, dannie trejo and mahfreightah."
4/29/2008,i lol'ed a bit in real life.you can say a lot about the goons. but they are very creative!
4/29/2008,"you are representing the community as a person, and we need to judge you on that basis. simply taking the actions of one character in a multi-character game is not a good enough measure of someone's worthiness as a community representative.i want to know all your characters from all your accounts, which is why i would like ccp to provide and/or verify the list. i would even go as far as requesting ccp to list the names of any character you have owned in the past.i hope to find nothing, but i expect a few worms to crawl out of the woodwork.i can appreciate the example you provided of how this could ruin a candidates gameplay, but honestly the pros outweigh the cons here. far more damage can be caused by an unworthy candidate being accepted onto the council than by your enemies having a list of your alternative characters.granted this runs a little deeper than at first glance, but that is exactly why i want this list revealed."
4/29/2008,"it's a pretty good in-joke, too. :3"
4/29/2008,"i could imagine.. on ventrilo: ""please don't shoot maaah freigtah!!!11!!111!""."
4/29/2008,"actually, it was suas, so quite the opposite."
4/29/2008,"i disagreea) we are not crimals be brought in front of a tribunalb) we have very little benefits from doing this, the danger of corruption is lowthe personal effort and investment too high for doing something bad imo.nobody would waste so much time energy and personal life just for having a laugh at somebodys expense.c) if ccp would give in, they would have failed to announce it in time - which was before application phase for csm, when the conditions have been set and the candidates have agreed to those and started to scan their passworts - now its too late, one cannotchange the rules of a game after it has begun.""1:0 for arsenal, no wait .. the judge walks on the field, he announces a new rule.the goal is not valid unless the goalkeeper admist beeing atheist!""d) i would expect the benefit of the doubtbut most of all:e) one should judge us by our rl actions, and they are yet to come, and not be distracted too much from ingamestuff.if someone would approach me in private, and requests to knowmore about me, i would like to have the ability to decide on a case to case bases whom ias a candidate but also as a player can trust and whom not.well this is my 2 cents, and you yet have to name a proper expample for what your reason behind this is. .. other than.. unspecified dangers.i am still eager to learn of what dangers it is youre fearing, that would not be compensated automatically by a 9 heads council with most different folks sitting in it from most differentdirections.... and the brain that ccp has - the existence of a council doesnt mean they do follow every bad advise that could possibly result from the council of mordor that is not disclosing its alts."
4/29/2008,i have already listed them on my blog but for the sake of public record:hardinsiobhangaint killler
4/29/2008,"no i don't think ccp will be doing this. and for the record i agree with zoolkan. its nobody's business really. ccp have already done due diligence in checking rl identity, passport and location data, and ensured candidates have a clean record to run."
4/29/2008,"it's not really about that. i need to make a judgement on your character from a very limited amount of information. i cannot exactly send a private investigator after you to delve into your personal affairs. the only recourse i have to assessing you as a person are your replies on this forum and your activities within a virtual universe.ccp have the ability to supply me with that information about you, and rather than me needing to convince you it is the correct thing to release that information, you should be convincing me of the evils of doing so.arguing from a privacy aspect is ludicrous when you have supplied your country of residence and full name.arguing there will be a diminished gameplay experience for you also doesn't float. asking us to judge you on your rl actions and give you the benefit of the doubt could effectively turn this first election into a wasted vote, and any subsequent vote for a first-time candidate. we cannot judge you on your rl actions, so we need to be provided with the next best thing."
4/29/2008,"you're misinterpreting my reasons for wanting this information. to put it bluntly, i do not care about the crazies, that is ccp's concern. and you are correct, i'm sure they have done their part and will continue to do so by putting procedures in place to deal with any potential nasty situations.i want this for one reason and one reason alone, to judge your character by having your actions on all characters across all accounts brought into focus. that dictates the only reasonable way in which way can interpret your character as a person.it is my business, it should be everyone's. we are not voting for a forum personality or famous character. we are voting for a person, and we deserve the right to see their ingame roles in an entirety."
4/29/2008,i rest my case. thank you for taking the time to respond.
4/29/2008,"i have only my main, ""goumindong"" a market alt ""loany"" and a throw-away alt that may be used to haul stuff around empire. they are all on the same account"
4/29/2008,"i just have the one account and the three characters on it:my main: nickaelhoopa refiner until i get my skill up: imitai veroneand for the same reasons above, a trader: garofalo"
4/29/2008,"i don't think it's much to ask for alt names.think of it this way, i as a voter and not going to vote for a person who personally scammed a few hundred mil from me. why should i? if one of the alts did something in game i didn't like i really don't want to reward that person by voting for them in something that can really effect the game.anyone that says ""that's wrong"" is only fooling to themselves. if i was running for csm and went around suicide ganking haulers, destroying barges, scamming people all over the place and being a general a-hole in game. would i expect people to vote for me if they knew who i was?so i don't think it's much to ask for alts. the only people it will effect is the people that use their alts to be a-holes in game."
4/29/2008,"i already released these names before into the public domain on another thread:arithron (main)antarre (sales and aquisitions fella)sharyn swallows (entertainment and telemarketing)take care,bruce hansen"
4/29/2008,"by some weird turn of events, the above post ended up double posting...sorry bout that!"
4/29/2008,"though i dont really see the need to give out that kind of information, and i dont need to.but since i dont have anything to hide:bolla: my builder t1 and t2 (form invention)mad pirate: retired suicide alt that now acts as my back alt.+ 3 noob alts used to look up market prices and scouts"
4/29/2008,i'm with zoolkhan and jade constantine on this one.imo it's simply not relevant. i'm not revealing the name of my exotic dancer or slaver hound either.i'd just like to clear my name anyway by adding that my alts are:mynas atochsirmollebutterdogliliankhani hope managed to offend a few people by failing to list their names.
4/29/2008,judging by how goons play the game i'd say i prefer jades take on things. metagaming and suicide ganking campaigns just aren't cricket.
4/29/2008,e.g.it goes on for quite a few pages before it gets derailed.
4/29/2008,"won't support any one from the goon hive, bob, or any one who is pure pvp.i will vote for those who are for solo play, belive in empire as fairly safe space and industrailes and the little guys."
4/29/2008,"he is completely incorrect of course, but i'd invite the general eve electorate to have a read of my csm manifesto thread and decide for themselves really. if people like what i have to say and agree with my thoughts on the vision and direction for the game thats good enough for me. i've no time to waste with petty sideswipes at other candidates, they'll be judged by the electorate soon enough."
4/29/2008,"candidates who are incapable of civil, objective or logical debate. i don't fancy spending 3 days locked in a room with people unwilling or incapable of delivering results"
4/29/2008,your words not mine
4/29/2008,absolutely agree serenity. fingers crossed these attributes become apparent over the course of the campaign and voters make an informed choice to avoid the bad apples.
4/29/2008,"why anyone would vote for goumindong aside from goons is beyond reason.a candidate having no appreciable platform to speak of (as of this post), while being part of a 2000+ player alliance that takes pride in pushing game-breaking meta-gaming tactics to their limit, seems rather disingenuous to me."
4/29/2008,"please keep the slander and lies to a minimum.specifically not only do we not ""push game-breaking meta-gaming tactics to their limit"", but i indeed have a platform if you are inclined to read it and have had for quite some time.furthermore, no goons will be voting for me."
4/29/2008,"i'm not interested in sending uneducated, easy to impress, nice people to ccp. the candidates who basicly say: 'i'll be nice to you, vote for me because you can."" and generally show no critical facilities, are just going to be a waste of time.if the idea is to help transparency and keep ccp honest - we need to vote for the difficult candidates who can argue coherently and rigourously. jade and serenity are nice folks, but i can't see that advancing the game, just reinforcing the status quo.i want someone to take the devs and designers to task and review their procedures and strategies."
4/29/2008,"i would not vote for anyone in goon. their declared way of playing the game is just not compatible with the way most of us want to.aside from the meta gaming element, they are more responsible than any other alliance for the whole blob fiasco we find the game in now."
4/29/2008,"somebody who doesn't understand reason. that is about it. but i'm really yet to see anybody, for who this is true."
4/29/2008,same. the goons have enough numbers(friends included) to vote themselfes in they dont need my help :-)
4/29/2008,simply put i wouldnt vote for any candidate belonging to one of the big alliances and who is playing eve for less than 3 years.
4/29/2008,"i won't vote for people with a strong bias, people who (i feel) are from groups that have done eve a dis service or people who are capable of writing 17 paragraphs without actually saying anything."
4/29/2008,"well, i was actually discussing this with jade recently.isn't it better to be biased, than just saying ""vote for me, i'm not biased, and i will listen to everybody""? to me, it shows to me that a biased person actually knows something, where the non-biased person, doesn't.also, according to some people, my whole document about the state of the economy(10 pages or so), said nothing. also, isn't a good politician a person who can write alot, but say nothing, yet have the listener hear what he wants to hear? in the end, the csm has to represent the community. so there is a balance."
4/29/2008,"i'm entirely serious when i say this: jade constantine. the ability to communicate concisely is crucial in the context of the csm, whereas jade chose to post a 7,100-word essay across fifteen posts just in order to introduce himself."
4/29/2008,"i want the csm to be unbiased as i want them to translate our problems and requests to ccp without any personal agendas, unfiltered. regardless of playstyle or (possibly) ingame background.people who write without actualling saying anything will smother any discussion into nothingness, resulting in non-action and never actually getting to the point of a problem. all that adds is static lowering the signal to noise ratio.i understand the principle or a majority vote but thing is; we're not voting to elect for a group to be in control, we're voting for a comittee to help the powers that be in our name. there's a huge difference in requirements for both types and as i see it, people confuse the csm with running for elections while having your own agenda and having the power to make decisions. that's not what the csm is.p.s; i don't want a politican that tells me what i want to hear, i want a politican that tells me what he thinks, pinpoints problems and gets to work to solve them."
4/29/2008,"csm has to vote for an issue, before it will even reach the iceland agenda. so while the agenda of the individual isn't as important, it is still important, in order for people to see that this candidate that argue about things, can do so in a clear manner and in general has a clue.the role of the csm is an advisory role, as well as a link between ccp and the community. if 5 out of the 9 candidates doesn't agree with a topic, it just wont be discussed at the iceland meeting. if the csm is just the ""yes""-people of the community, i would hate to see where eve would end up."
4/29/2008,there's a difference between filtering out idiotic requests (i want my <insert ship> to have 8-8-8 slots and 99% resists!!!!!) and coloring the problems and requests of the eve population for your own benefits before pesenting them to ccp.
4/29/2008,how do can i support jade constantine?
4/29/2008,"i'm really ntot sure how a request can be to your own benefit. while it might be in my interest, for instance, to change the way the market works, it doesn't mean i want that for person benefit.you have to come with an example of how a csm member would be able to colour problems and requests, and actuall have ccp do something about it. it seems extremely unlikely, leave alone impossible, for it to be as big a problem as you seem to make it."
4/29/2008,"if the majority of the csm's are from big space holding alliances then the chances of a request from the playerbase lowering the defensive posiblities and making it easier to attack sovereignity systems will probably be watered down.if people feels that eve should be more catered around teamwork and thus jumpfreighters should be nerfed and that carriers should be even less useable as haulers because that in effect increases the size of the universe. also, it narrows down the area of influence an alliance can have and advocates more teamwork and effort into holding space.pvpers would love that, alliance holders, traders and industry alts would hate it. it would however be better for the game itself long term. so if the csm is made up of mostly pvpers then the idea would be looked into and worked out and presented to ccp. the ones that would not benefit from such a change would discard it, either immediately or simply by covering it with bull**** and then 'forgetting' about it."
4/29/2008,"doubtful. you'll find that most sov-holding alliance members think that pos warfare is too easy for the defender, an attitude that i can certainly appreciate as someone who's been successful on both sides of that coin.i've incapacitated defended cynojammers with a battleship gang, and killed dreadnoughts from the safety of a pos force field. i think you can probably guess which position i preferred."
4/29/2008,"i wouldn't vote for any candidate using the csm as some kind of personal soapbox from which to lobby ccp about their pet peeves with regard to game design and balance.as far as i'm concerned the whole point of it is to provide a little transparency to the goings on within ccp and help avoid tinfoil-hattery on the epic scale of several well-known threadnaughts and perceived/imagined issues of the past few years. not to give a select few some kind of direct channel to the devs with which to attempt to influence the direction and design of the game; which from the sounds of some of the candidates' forum utterances, some of them believe is the case.edit: just realised that this was directed at csm candidates but meh, i stand by my opinion and hope i'm not alone."
4/29/2008,"that was the original idea of csm. but if you believe the trolls, ccp changed it and converted it into a pr trick."
4/29/2008,"you're not alone, bolded for truth."
4/29/2008,goumindong would be the last person i would want as all his ideas and calls for nerfs involve no real in game experience flying the ships in gangs or in actual combat.a candidate should have a solid background in the aspects of eve he has opinions on carebears on carebear issues pvpers on pvp issues with even these issues divided into sub groups each with positive and negative proponents.
4/29/2008,"on my personal opinion, i wouldn't vote some of these goon peoples. question is why!i think, that these guys are not just headin in for the game itself. rather they are standing for an interest of an alliance of more than 4000 people (not to forget the homies and buddies in addition) who, certainly, have enough informal in-game power which might be ""completed"" by the factor of more direct lobby work via one or two ""csm-goons""."
4/29/2008,*delete*
4/29/2008,please keep the lies and slander to a minumum. i both have ample in game experience in gangs and actual combat.
4/29/2008,"as i have said before i do not consider 206 kills and 24 losses over 18 months ""real"" in game experience considering all the aspects of pvp that you wish to change."
4/29/2008,"experience is not measured in kills and losses. it can be a good indicator, but it has no bearing on the pilots skills, ability and knowledge of the systems. you should also note that many people who do meet your criteria for kills and losses agree with me on many of the core issues.[i think especially ironic was dinique over at shc saying how terrible i was at ship balance and then proposing changes that i had been saying were my ideal changes for the ship for quite some time]. anyway, here is an example that shows why experience is not measured in kills and losses. which pilot is better, the one who fights when he cannot win, or the one that runs away when he cannot win? clearly the answer is the one who runs away when he cannot win. and we do a lot of that in gs[though we certainly make mistakes all the time], even though we have a reputation for suiciding into fleets. a good example. a few weeks ago, i got to be active nearly every day of the week on fleet ops in a bs defending and assaulting pos's. this earned me one loss and about 10 various kills, and maybe 3 or 4 kills in real good combat. this happened for various reasons, but none of them detracting from my experience. the other day i had time to go out and do some random roaming pvp and all it garnered was shuttles and pods[because that was all that was around aside from the large bob ****-off gang that engaging would have slaughtered us], and then another i get to bait and kill a rapier and gisti-b crow. but none of these are good indicators of my experience because they don't tell the whole story.then of course there is the standard ""play time"" issue."
4/29/2008,"while i understand that a individual can gain some experience in 18 months i find it hard to reconcile the fact that you make claims of experience enough to know that things need changing in all the varied forms of pvp in eve. while your stats clearly show otherwise, and you also point out yourself that your game/play time is a issue in regards to your lack of kills and losses implying that you cannot log in and play much and that also adds to your lack of actual in game experience.now i am not saying that you are not entitled to an opinion or that on occasion you may be right. but you claim first hand knowledge of problems with the game when your ideas clearly come from others whine's about life and eve not being fair because they lost a few ships or cannot out think or fly a enemy."
4/29/2008,"slander again. my ideas do not come from others ""whine's about life and eve not being fair because they lost a few ships and cannot out think of fly an enemy"". to the contrary they are amalgamations between the better of eves players who think that the state of the game is a problem.should i say that the people whom i argue against simply have no skill and bury that lack of skill and intelligence behind overpowered tactics? so when someone comes along and says ""hey this is overpowered"" they naturally flock to defend the mechanic which makes them look better than they are?should i instead say that these people are unable to see a difference between a wish to balance the game and a wish to nerf other players? that they think any part of the game that is unbalancedno that would dilute my argument and do disservice to the people with whom i am arguing against as you do yourself by making this accusations. the arguments that people are using to defend the things that i am attacking are the same arguments that they used to defend other overpowered tactics which have been nerfed for the good of the game[remote doomsdays and speed mods come to mind, the defending case is pretty much the exact same as it was before the first nerf, and is just as wrong]. and the case has not changed much.as i have explained stats do not show the entire picture. do i have a killmail on the carriers i helped kill in the campaign against corm and rise?[truncated, not that it would matter, i was shooting at fighters most of the time]. do the killmails show the intelligence of the people i fight against? no[otherwise the recent solo rapier kill would read 'olol don't bump a battlecruiser off a station in an aggressed cruiser you dolt' instead of what it does otherwise].regarding time to log in and play yes, my time is restricted, though not more than most people, and nor would this matter as lessons are not learned immediately but in time."
4/29/2008,"i'm not voting for any goon, or anyone else whose group/personal history is contrary to the betterment of the game and the purposes of the csm.also not voting for anyone who couldn't put forth the effort to make a good first impression by actually listing useful information about themselves and their campaign in their csm candidate profile submission.and i'm not voting for anyone who refuses to clearly state their position. they are either being deceitful in trying to be all things to everyone, or are comletely uninformed and ignorant of the important issues, or are incapable of forming an opinion and arguing a point of view. none of these are conducive to a successful csmi'll definetely agree here, i want to know a candidate's mind before i trust him with my vote. everyone has a bias, i just want to know what bias i'm getting before i vote. um, no, that may describe a successful politician, but definetely not a good politician, there's an important distinction. such a politician may be elected repeatedly, but he is not likely good for the interests of those he represents. saying nothing and letting everyone hear what they want is just another method of lying through your teeth and obscuring the truth. it also does not speak well to your skills as a communicator if you can't convey your ideas clearly so that everyone understands your meaning. if everyone has a different understanding of what you say, there is a definite problem. either you are incapable of communicating properly, or you are being intentionally vague."
4/29/2008,i would not vote for a person that is not open with the voters and a person that can not work in a team setting.

4/29/2008,"it's gonna be fairly hard to fix.i wouldn't mind having it fixed. but i really can't come up with a creative idea, which removes the loophole, without removing a feature of the gang system."
4/29/2008,"to be totally honest it isn't our job to come up with solutions to problems. i think that is what people fail to realise, that is ccp's job.the csm is only there to act as a bridge between the community and ccp, we only report on what people want to fix or have looked at and then ccp developers look into the problem and find a creative solution that will have the least detrimental impact on all of us."
4/29/2008,complete consent!
4/29/2008,addendum: without removing a feature of the gang system intended to prevent abuse in other ways that would likely be more severe than the one currently being used.especially when it has a very easy answer on the part of the mark. don't respond to cries for help without collateral equal to the value of your ship unless you know and trust the person.
4/29/2008,"there is a famous saying that goes something like:there is a sucker born every minute...there is an easy way to stop this happening....for players to wise up a little and stop complaining when they do something stupid. luckily, they get to learn from their mistakes....take care,bruce hansen"
4/29/2008,"i dont want to remove it, though i am probably going to be hated for thiswhen some one is ganged (after the mark) that has a active war going on, a warning is sent to everyone in gang a warning that states that there is a person that has joined with a active war. (just thrown out there)though the best way to dont help strangers or people you dont trust."
4/29/2008,"i don't think you can reconcile an attempt to fix this scam with ccp's established attitude that eve should be a brutal game that emphasises shrewdness. ccp has previously publicised -- hell, glorified -- the actions of scammers such as the ghsc, and this really is an example of exactly the same policy."
4/29/2008,"i disagree with nikaelhoop. it may be ccp's job to fix it, but it's the job of csm to present the player bases arguments for, and suggestions how, to fix issues.i would support fixing it, because the war-dec mechanic for gangs is to enable consensual participation in other corp/alliance wars by joining gangs at war, it is not intended to trap and kill new players of eve.this is evident in the facts that:- a warning message is displayed to new players on joining such a gang- notification given to gang-members when a new war-deced player joins the gangjoining a war-dec pilot to gang while someone is in warp is deliberate abuse of this mechanic.how to fix it? it might be possible along the lines of only enabling players in npc corps to join gangs with other players in npc corps - which in itself has consequences for new player experience that require evaluation."
4/29/2008,"it was merely a thought i had at the time, of course if it is decided that ccp will look into it they will find a nice solution but i'm sure suggestions will be appreciated"
4/29/2008,and how would you suggest changing cloaking mechanics?
4/29/2008,"i think adding fuel could be interesting.couple that with the ability for one to probe for a ship on grid, which will allow you to approach the cloaker, would be interesting.but this should only be true for non-covert ops cloaks."
4/29/2008,who are you asking that question to? because i just answered it
4/29/2008,any csm candidate that wants to answer the question
4/29/2008,"my personal perception:i don't have any problem with cloaking (and it's mechanics). it's a possible and legal way of gaming (so do i).logoff tactics is a anathema to me. according to my opinion (in this case the soldier come through) it's recreancy before the enemy (i hope it don't sound so hard). none the less this ""logoff"" is a security kit in case of loosing connection, computer crashed or sth like this. currently i see no feasible solution in that case."
4/29/2008,"i'd prefer a re-working of gate routes - i'm not 100% certain of the current routing and i'm a) in a lecture and b) about to leave it, so i can't really do any checking.though what i'd like to see is a re-working of the route that instead places jita onto a ""ring"" of linked systems, with some of those systems then branching out onto the most common routes. that way, instead of a normal intersection styled cross-road that jams so easily, you have a larger round-about/traffic circle in play. this way jita remains a ""core"" system but the load is still somewhat distributed out across more systems and potentially, even regions - with some smart mapping.so assuming you keep jita as some sort of hub - as part of that ring - it could be the best ap route to one or more regions, but at the same time the ap will now go via a different region/system set to other regions, unlike the present routing seems to operate.edit: if you want to get really complicated, you could create a sort of ""thick"", internally meshed ring where individual systems form a mesh in the shape of a 3d ring - imagine it like a large donut with a small hole in the middle - so you have to travel via a path (one of multiple) within the donut to make your way around the hole. no one system or route takes you over the ""hole"" in the middle quickly, but there are multiple routes in the donut that you can take to get around the hole eventually.carefully breaking up the ring with different regions should (completely theoretically) break the single-hub mechanic.and to get even more complicated, when faction warfare comes in (whatever it is, lol) - you could literally ""break"" market trade down to constellation-size instead of region size in concert with the meshed ring.however, i don't presume my idea is without holes, or not more than one at least."
4/29/2008,just changing the gates around so its 1 jump from the end of the long jump into caldari space but a deadend system so only traders go there would be nice.
4/29/2008,add in rotating jita cn 4/4 so the undock traffic jam can be aliviated.
4/29/2008,"traffic jams, at least in my experience, haven't been a problem since the last patch.but lets face it, jita is the product of scale, due to the law of the network. you can't kill this in any sensible way. we just have to fix the underlying problem, which ccp is working on."
4/29/2008,i have never understood why people expect ccp to fix this. we pilots control where the stuff is sold and where we go to buy it. if everyone and thier brother insist on going to the same crowded system what exactly do you expect ccp to do about it.sell it somewhere else at the same price and people will start buying it there. or is that to simple?
4/29/2008,"a simple solution would be a ""avoid system x"" option for autopilot. it would make possible to plot a route avoiding jita with ease even for people that hasn't memorized the systems around it and would be very nice to have in a lot of other conditions."
4/29/2008,the simplest solution to make the autopilot avoid jita is to add gates so that every system connected to jita has a gate to every other system connected to jita.
4/29/2008,"this might work.but it might too make jita even more attractive.jita naturally evolved into what it is today, just like rens. the players decided to make it their market hubs. alter anything, and the players find a new place to overcrowd it.so far alternative autopilot routes is the best idea i heared to ease the load from jita systemexcept of course adding more datacenter power to the related nodes which might not be as easy as said."
4/29/2008,"no.i often take a shuttle and autopilot to jita, if my hauler is there. i'm simply too lazy to fly there manually. i would rather have it take double the time and be able to multitask, than not being able to multitask."
4/29/2008,"eh ?if you have something in a system you want to pickup, and you want to use the autopilot, you put a waypoint in that system so that the ap stops there. since i'm not proposing the removal of any gates, you would still fly the same route as you do now.the only difference is when someone plots a route that would currently take them through jita without placing a waypoint in jita. whatever algorithm eve uses to calculate routes will avoid jita simply because the extra gates guarantee that the shortest route will not go through it."
4/29/2008,"oh yeah, my bad. i read it as if you said that autopilot just shouldn't be able to enter jita edit: but my stance on to do about jita, is in my first post in this thread. *stops posting during a lecture*"
4/29/2008,"i'm not a csm candidate but i have a constructive opinion a few csm candiates might or might not like.jita thrives because of selection (everyone knows that if it exists, your sure to find it here), competition (so many sellers/producers you are as likly to get a good price as anywhere else, might not be the best but it wont be inflated), location (have to pass through it for many routes whether shopping or not and it's reletivly convinient to get to if you are shopping), and volume (as byproduct of all of the above, theres alot of each thing for sale and inventory moves quick.1. selection. cant mess with that too much, it's player controlled who sells what and how many different flavors of it. but while everythings in jita, not alot in some other regional hubs so diversifying is probably good.2. competition. this is actually a good thing. the bad part, like with selection, is that it's all in jita when far too many other trade hubs have only one or two producers for some high tech/expensive items. 3. location. cant do much about people's perceptions of convinience, but you can fix the through traffic. rearrange the gates so that no direct route through any two systems includes jita as a jump, but keep the gates to jita in the systems that have them. the effect would be a ""pit stop"" of sorts, where you could get to jita as easily as now but it would be 1 jump to the side of the main ""highway""4. volume. here is where i think the key to spreading jita out is. much like npc buy/sell orders get adjusted for demand in the trade market, ccp could institute a similar idea for npc taxes. the more trading volume is done in a particular system, the taxes increase slightly. low volume areas have lower taxes. clearly, greedy regulatory agencies would like to have a larger piece of the pie of a place like jita, where they might encourage low tax as a means of promoting economic growth in less developed systems. the npc fees are already skill based to an extent, so trade characters have an advantage, but they could also be made to be standing-reliant, encouraging, through convinience, that non-caldari to trade in their own regional hubs.while i leave it to ccp and others more qualified to work out the number specifics, the general affect would be to encourage market diversification through people naturally wanting more isk. if they continue to sell in jita as the taxes go up, either their profits will go down making them likly to look elsewhere to sell, or the prices will rise making consumers inclined to shop elsewhere in search of a better deal."
4/29/2008,"how come? why add features to disencourage people to do something?why not rather encourage people to go elsewhere? what the issues with jita are:1. lag2. market mechanics you point out very finely, that competition is good. but i do think that because of scale, the current market mechanics just aren't really fit to handle the massive amount of competition, anymore. but the first point will be fixed by ccp, due this year.the last issue we will have to discuss with the community, csm and ccp, how we make these handle the increasing scale.i came with a few ideas in my discussion thread about the economics. but neither can be implemented alone and i think that we will have to see a major revision of the market, which changes the fundamental principles of it, while allowing real-life like behaviours.potbs uses an interesting mechanics, but i don't think it will work in eve, as-is, but it's a very interesting concept, we could adopt to a certain degree."
4/29/2008,"since the effected players would be travelling through the systems around jita anyway, i don't see much of an increase in traffic there. so the only extra lag would be the extra gates, which shouldn't be noticeable.what this would do is simply make the players passing through the area avoid jita, so they don't contribute to or experience the lag there.fair enough. as you said there isn't a traffic jam outside 4-4 since they added the exit angles. my suggestion just removes the traffic that is passing through jita without stopping. to be honest, i have no idea how much these players contribute to the lag, so it might not make any noticeable effect to the players in jita. all i can guarantee is that people passing through will avoid being caught by jita's various load related issues.i'd also advise ccp somehow configuring agents in the surrounding systems to never place a combat mission there. either by moving agents away from the area or some special tweak to the code (so agents in jita will always send players away from it for combat). again this is focusing on lowering the number of people who get caught in the lag and i can't predict how much it will effect anyone who is in jita for another reason."
4/29/2008,"right, that is what i was wondering about too.i recall a dev stating that the main load on the node is due to items being moved trough the market(item manipulation in general). so i'm not sure how effective it would be, but for the sake of getting around jita, your idea does indeed have merrits. but for solving lag, i have my doubts.so i'm pretty sure, that one of the most requested changes to the csm, is to make people able to go around in a circle, around jita. but i doubt ccp will do it, due to having to change the map, thus making the new map serenity is making, obsolete. but who knows, ccp might just do it, with factional warfare."

4/29/2008,"link to manifestoi am yusra, ceo of the political organization per capita. or at least, what may become a political organization if all goes according to plan.given it's unorthodox nature, i feel i should to explain the specifics of what makes my candidacy different from the others here.the aim of per capita is to combine the benefits of direct democracy with free market capitalism. in other words: to enable citizens to vote directly on issues, whilst also making money.per capita is an eve corporation: if i am nominated to the council of stellar management then shares in this corporation will be made publically available.as a shareholder, your shareholders vote will dictate my vote on the council. in other words, as a council member i will vote on each issue according to the majority will of per capita's shareholders. the standard eve corporate voting mechanism will be used, meaning that the more shares you own, the more power your vote carries. being a shareholder has another benefit: income made by the corporation will be paid back in the form of dividends. the suggested starting amount will be 80%, although this can of course be reviewed and changed by a majority shareholder decision. once the corporation has sufficient operating capital then this amount can be increased to 100%.this income will come from two places:the first is sale of shares. the initial initial public offering will pay back 80% to shareholders. then, after the ipo, the intention is to issue new shares as per market demand. the sale of these will result in further dividends.of course this has never been tried before, so it's impossible to say what that demand will be. maybe, once the ipo is complete, shares will only need to be traded on the secondary market. but, given that in this case money is enabling the direct purchase of power, i am... optimistic.however, this is only the secondary means of generating income for shareholders. the primary means is per capita's core purpose: any individual will be able to pay to have an issue considered by the shareholders. this person can be a per capita shareholder, or any other citizen of eve. and this can be any issue they choose. they write their issue, and, alongside a payment, submit it to per capita for consideration.the shareholders then vote on whether the issue is raised within the council. if the issue is accepted then the money is kept and dividended, if it is rejected then the money is returned, except for a small handling fee.shareholders will have to consider each issues' merits, although they will also consider how much money is being offered. given that they earn money from raising issues to the council, they have a clear incentive to accept them, especially if the plaintiff is offering a lot.having said that, if too many issues are accepted, then their value declines and new customers will be hard to find. after all, the council of stellar management will not take seriously a long list of insignificant complaints, and our shareholders will have to bear this in mind.we are selling something of value, but if too much of it is sold, then that value will decline. that is the responsibility of shareholders to decide, and also my role as ceo: to ensure that business value is retained.in terms of trust and transparency, i'm sure many might have concerns. i am working closely with serenity steele to ensure that per capita is set up and managed correctly. serenity will be acting as a guarantor for the corporation and will be closely involved in its operation. additionally we are looking for independent auditors. the intention is to run per capita's finances in a way that is 100% transparent to shareholders, plus have major decisions dictated by shareholder vote.... continued in next post .."
4/29/2008,"i feel that per capita has the potential bring several unique benefits to the council and to eve.to those that feel this is undemocratic, a corruption of politics, i would certainly not claim that it alone represents true democracy, but as one voice in the council i think it will add value.using the existing mechanism of shareholder voting, issues will be able to be quickly and easily decided within the corporation. this provides a way for the opinions of a large number of citizens to be counted in a direct way. given that the aim of the council is to represent the community, this has obvious merits. merits that go beyond our trust in representative democracy alone.i also see the market-driven nature of the vote as a benefit. it will enable the representation of money, of wealth, within eve. wealth comes with power, and power comes with interest in eve. those with wealth have frequently much to say about eve, and much to gain or lose. their interest is, if you like, highly interested. given that individuals will have to pay to have issues raised, it follows that they will focus on issues that matter. after all, if an issue is trivial, why pay for it? the barrier to entry becomes a filter for quality. a filter that is doubly-applied, first by the plaintif, and then by the shareholders.it also might make you, as shareholders, rather rich. if any powerful individuals attempt to buy up very many shares, or if they pay handsomely to promote their agenda, then the profits might be more than insignificant. compared to the limited payouts available via more traditional ipos and banking, there is at least the potential to make considerably more. alongside, of course, the risk of not.in the longer term, i see the potential for per capita to become a political party within eve in a real sense. the council has a limit of two terms for any individual to serve on it. hence i could at most serve two terms as ceo. however, i could be replaced as ceo having served these two terms and the corporation could continue: with the new ceo running as candidate for the csm. in this way, per capita might outlast the two term limit imposed on individuals.but, overall, and perhaps most significantly, i see this as an experiment in politics. an example of what politics can be like if we drop the barrier between capitalism and democracy and stand back and let the market decide. to me that is something i'm curious to see the results of. it is also something i think is very, very eve.thank you for reading. if you have any questions please ask them here."
4/29/2008,"this is the definition of a pyramid scheme, champ."
4/29/2008,"one additional issue that needs clarification. i was asked if this is just a plan to scam large amounts of isk. the answer is no, although the plan is certainly to attempt to make good money for shareholders. some details:- as part of the ipo i will retain some shares in per capita. these will be my source of income from the corporation. this creates the incentive for me to raise money for shareholders, since this is the only way to make money for myself. our interests are aligned, in other words. the specifics of this will be published prior to the election, once all the specific details of the ipo are finalized. these are currently being worked on by myself and serenity steele.- the corporation will publish a list of its major shareholders on a monthly basis, as well as dividends paid out.- the current intention is to pay our independent auditors directly from company funds, rather than via shares. this is to ensure a degree of separation. the need for this, plus some minor incidental costs (eg office space) is the reason for the initial dividend payout amount to be set at 80%. i welcome all feedback on this. the intention is to design a financial setup that is fair, reasonable, and transparent."
4/29/2008,so you have an interest in making money off this?that's not a nice attitude!
4/29/2008,"it doesn't have to be a nice attitude, what with it being a pyramid scheme and all."
4/29/2008,"if the intention was purely to make money by selling more and more shares then it would be a pyramid scheme.however, that part is incidental: the aim is only to sell more shares if there is demand. if there is no demand, then no problem. the long term aim is not simply to sell more and more shares, but rather to provide enough shares to meet market demand. what drives this demand? the desire to be able to vote on csm issues...the primary mechanisms are:- what is being 'sold' is the ability to vote on issues raised at the csm. the in-game share system is being used because it enables a simple voting system that already exists. in addition, since existing shareholders have to vote to approve the creation of new shares, the corporation may collectively decide to stop issuing. - the primary source of income (if there is any) is private individuals bringing issues to the corporation. perhaps no one will want to do this. but if they do, shareholders make money. this has nothing to do with a pyramid scheme. thank you for asking however."
4/29/2008,"of course i have an interest in making money! this will take a large amount of my time to administer, for which it is reasonable to be paid. plus, as i pointed out, since my income will come only as a shareholder, this creates an incentive to make money for all shareholders. it's the standard setup used by most rl corporations. bear in mind that if the corporation makes no money, then i make none.the amount of shares has to be reasonable. if it's too much then of course no one will want to get involved. the exact amount isn't set yet, i'm working on it currently with serenity, and the details will be provided as part of the ipo. market pressure will ensure the amount is reasonable."
4/29/2008,"no, that's entirely untrue. you've already established that you're going to be using the shares to make a personal profit, something that no other csm candidate has been crass enough to suggest. this is purely for your personal interests and, because the degree of profit to be made diminishes with each successive wave of shares and each dividend is drawn heavily from the sale of those same shares, it satisfies the definition of a pyramid scheme.your justification for the scheme -- other than making money off the idiots who give it to you -- is to facilitate ""direct democracy"", but when you charge individuals to raise issues and give the greatest voting ability to the largest shareholders, you're violating the democratic ideal in favour of an oligarchy of fools.let me also point out that your corporation is a very poor facsimile of the existing system: your corp allows people to raise issues which, if they receive sufficient support, are taken to a higher level of decision-making. this is precisely the same damn system as the existing implementation of the csm, with the exception that it's broken: csm council members cannot raise issues themselves, so you're making a promise you cannot possibly keep."
4/29/2008,"i understand your concerns, daveydweeb, but you have misunderstood. i suggest you read the above again carefully, plus what i have to say below....as i have stated clearly, the aim of per capita is to combine the benefits of direct democracy with free market capitalism.this is not an exercise in pure democracy. i am not claiming this, so to accuse me of 'violating a democratic ideal' is accurate. that is the whole point. it is an exercise in combining two things:- direct democracy: namely the ability of an individual (in this case a shareholder) to vote directly on an issue, rather than leaving the decision up to a representative. unlike other csm members, you do not have to trust me to vote on my instincts. instead, you can vote to tell me how to vote. directly.- free market capitalism: namely to let market forces determine the value of this direct democracy. to allow market forces to determine how much people are willing to pay to both raise issues, and have the right to vote on them. let the market decide.the market will dictate how much people want to pay to both raise issues and vote: if it's 1000 isk, then that's what its worth. if it's 1 million, then that's what it's worth. just like the price of any module or ship on the eve market. this is no different.all profit will be returned to shareholders. in other words; the corporation only exists to enable the trade of votes and political issues. the corporation is in no way dependent on the sale of additional shares (as per a pyramid scheme). additionally, since share issues must be voted on, if the shareholders decide to issue no more shares, then none will be issued.i welcome your feedback. it is my utmost concern that these financial and procedural specifics are well understood. i'm sure others would react as you do, my aim is to clarify."
4/29/2008,remember if you're for phasing out of tech ii bpos then you're for endless grinding and more horrid pos'.
4/29/2008,"i would offer you a longer response, but your question is kinda vague. you don't put forward any issue.as such, i think that the t2 bpo's are just fine. it wouldn't be too smart to convert them into bpc's."
4/29/2008,"with the refinments to invention, cartels of t2 bpo holders are no longer an issue. the main issue with t2 is high end moon minerals being monopolized by select few alliances."
4/29/2008,"this topic was covered recently in another thread. i think the only t2 bpo ""issue"" is on the forums. i think this is just beating a dead horse."
4/29/2008,i'm not sure i see the causal link here.
4/29/2008,put the damned t2 bpos on the market. seed them like other bpos. this business where the market is not allowed to do its job and its impossble to get most t2 bpos is absurd.
4/29/2008,have you tried invention?
4/29/2008,"i'm guessing you've never tried your hand at invention, then.edit: efb"
4/29/2008,"+2 for you in my books, sir"
4/29/2008,"tech2 bpos in the game currently are absolutely fine, they've been shuffled around now and bought and auctioned and traded and reached their current owners through the workings of a free market economy in the game. its no longer about freebies from the lottery and now much more about 2-3 year funding planning on x auction amount. if i want to buy myself a nighthawk bpo in the current environment i'm going to be paying 55billion isk and its going to take several years to pay back the investment. thats entirely reasonable and its actually unreasonable to suggest that at any point in the future that bpo should suddenly turn to a bpc and make my investment meaningless. invention is a fully viable alternative for startup industrial outfits - tech2 bpo owning is no longer the beginning and end of the equation, and current tech2 owners have to bid for supply on components derived from moon minding holdings the same as anyone else does. in short, i think the tech2 system in eve is currently pretty good, there are opportunities for risk takers (tech2 auctions,) opportunities for the average industrialist (invention), opportunities for cartels and raw materials cartels (moon minerals and components) and taken as a whole, it works."
4/29/2008,"jade is completely right. i was gonna write a large post about that, now that i'm home from class, but jade beat me to it.also, you have to remember that t2 bpo's actually increase the stability of the t2 markets. this is because the build costs on t2(the more t2 components the item uses, the large stabilizing effect the t2 bpo's have) bpo's is smaller. so while they can't keep up with the supply, the are able to do it to a small degree, and thus decrease the volatility of the market, if the moon minerals swing.so all in all, t2 bpo's are good for the consumers. they aren't an isk printer anymore. in fact, you will see t2 bpo's selling for many times the yearly profit. for instance, i have seen some t2 bpo's being sold at prices, which would make it do about 1-3% return on investment per month."
4/29/2008,"with 300 millions worth of datacores and decryptors i got enough runs to do 15 rapiers. it will take me about a week to build them. my margin per ship is much lower than the one of a t2 bpo builder, but i have more than double his output, which mean i'll still make a confortable amount of money. and that's with using only 3 factory slots. i could triple that output easily, assuming i had the capital for buying enough construction components.t2 bpos are fine. invention is mostly fine, too, with just the me/pe of input bpc and effect of meta 0 items needing looking at."
4/29/2008,"the reason i raised the issue wasn't anything to do with the affect of pure invention per say but more to get an idea of what side of the fence you sit on with regards to the bpos. whilst many agree they are fine as they are, there are also probably an equal number who disagree and will always disagree as they can't see themselves being in a position of owning an ""isk printing machine"" and think it's highly unfair that nothing is done about this. yes we all know about 95% of the t2 bpos are rubbish and you can invent anything anything anyway but this point of view remains so, each thinking they should go or stay.it should be the role of the csm candidate to collate all points of view for/against and remain unbiased towards any side in the csm role."
4/29/2008,"right now they're only two real isk-printing machines: dyspro/prom moons and invention. only invention require some sweat, and rare moons require you to be in a big alliance."
4/29/2008,"but isn't the idea that csm should filter out logic-less whine?i mean, i'm yet to see any argument for why t2 bpo's should be removed, with invention in place.unless you can give me 1 reason why t2 bpo's are bad, i don't consider them to be a problem. but i probably need perspective, and if you can give me a good argument against them, i'm sure it will be included in any discussion, to at least try and prove why t2 bpo's are bad."
4/29/2008,"in my opinion the t2 bpos shod stay as they are, now how that will effect the t3 invention it is a bit too early to say. and that some people still think they are isk printing machines should go into a bit more work and buy one for them self. and as stated before it is not the producers that get the isk printer at the moment it is the 0.0 alliances that have the good moons."
4/29/2008,"fwiw...lavista...sometimes a good illustration of what is wheat, versus what is chaff is needed the op is an example of chaff for example."
4/29/2008,"i agree it is chaff i never said i'm against t2 bpo as i've owned a few and currently own one now. i was trying to gauge really a perspective of the csm stance as there are people who would like them removed (me i don't know tbh as there are pros and cons) and i am hoping to see a candidate who filters the whines from all sides, without bias to one camp only."
4/29/2008,"let me see if i am understanding this discussion so far (some arguments have taken from other threads) :the t2 bpo's are just fine the way they are becausethey've been shuffled around now and bought and auctioned and traded and reached their current owners through the workings of a free market economy in the game. invention is a fully viable alternative for start-up industrial outfits. current t2 owners have to bid for supply on components derived from moon minding holdings the same as anyone else does.t2 bpo's actually increase the stability of the t2 markets.most t2 bpos arent isk printing machines as invention now ensures that sell prices have to be competitive with invention t2 stuff.if they werent in-game, many items wouldnt be available as invention costs would be more than players willing to pay for items.some hard-to-invent items would sky-rocket in price if t2 bpos removed.the t2 bpos should be replaced/removed becausecertain corps or alliances have a monopoly on certain t2 items and the lower price cap (due to the ability to improve me) and faster production rate (from improving pe) means that they can make good profit and sell below invent cost.the price of t2 bpo puts the owning of a t2 bpo beyond the reach of newer players and corps.with invention failures and run limits, most players cant afford to invent and compete, since t2 holders have an advantage of always succeeding and having lower costs.the requirements for invention, coupled with high skills required for many items (eg, ships), means that only older players can realistically invent- and these are those players that are more likely to just have the bpo or the disposable isk.newer players want to be able to build and sell the more profitable t2 items onto markets.inventors can invent more lots than a bpo can produce.of course, t2 bpo owners, if they wanted, could also invent alongside their t2 bpo production.has anybody have any further thoughts to add to this list of pros and cons?bruce hansen"
4/29/2008,"deconstructing the ""cons"":* certain corps or alliances have a monopoly on certain t2 items and the lower price cap (due to the ability to improve me) and faster production rate (from improving pe) means that they can make good profit and sell below invent cost.nobody in his right mind will sell *significantly* below invention cost unless the market is so saturated that inventors would have bailed out a long time ago anyway (so they would only be competing with other bpo holders anyway).prices are mainly set by inventors (the ones that have most of the potential supply in hands) for all ""in demand"" items... while items ""not in demand"" would only become prohibitively expensive without t2 bpos (so expensive nobody would bother inventing them, since nobody would be buying them at all in the first place).* the price of t2 bpo puts the owning of a t2 bpo beyond the reach of newer players and corps.the price of a titan/mothership does the same, should they be so cheap a 1-month player could afford them ?also, the price is 100% set by the players. some t2 bpos have nothing but a sentimental value, still prices asked are huge.bottom line... so what if new players/corps can't afford t2 bpos ? it's not a good reason to remove them.* with invention failures and run limits, most players can<U+FFFD>t afford to invent and compete, since t2 holders have an advantage of always succeeding and having lower costs.you don't compete with bpo holders, you only compete with other inventors.you only need to look at the prices of t2 items that have no bpos in existance to see what i mean.* the requirements for invention, coupled with high skills required for many items (eg, ships), means that only older players can realistically invent- and these are those players that are more likely to just have the bpo or the disposable isk.the higher the entry barrier, the better the market for those that finally get there.you only need to look at the t1 market to see what a disaster for profits a very low barrier of entry causes.heck, i would even argue the entry barrier for invention is not nearly high enough as it is.* newer players want to be able to build and sell the more profitable t2 items onto markets.if they are so profitable, then let them get the needed skills and funding with other activities.but as soon as they get there, they will realize that it's not the milk-and-honey land they thought it would be, and that simply manufacturing t1 ammo in a mission hub would bring them better profits for the capital they can afford to invest.* inventors can invent more lots than a bpo can produce.how's that a con for t2 bpos existing ?"
4/29/2008,"its in the 'reasons to remove t2 bpo' section. essentially, if i understand the argument correctly, the t2 bpo aren't needed to keep up supply as more bpc can be invented and built from in a month than items built from a bpo alone.bruce hansen"
4/29/2008,"really? remove bpos in favor of bpcs and we'll have many more pos' churn out bpcs to grind that thing called invention, what's not to see?"
4/29/2008,"for the items in demand, true.but for those items that ""manufacturing from high me bpo"" is still barely profitable, it would be the death bell ringing."

4/29/2008,"i speak as a entity who wants to wardec others, not to avoid them. thats other debate.i want that single corp can wardec more than silly 3 corps/alliances and in alliance, wardec prices shouldn't rise 50m/100m/150m/200m .. etc steps because having a few wars going on, will soon cost one billion each week and as a poor griefer alliance, thats alot! rich 0.0 alliances can abuse empire space while poor people cannot get dips on their wealth in form of pvp-loot."
4/29/2008,"on the whole i think wardec fees are to high. the reason for this has nothing much to do with veteran players (since we can all afford to throw a couple of hundred million at a wardec for a week or so). but it does negatively impact starting war-corps and junior pvpers who can be priced out of the market and forced to do pve and mission/rat grinding just to raise the stake for a wardec against an alliance. however. i do think there is also a problem with the war-dec system in and of itself and the lack of objectives/win conditions makes it currently a tired old mechanic that more often than not becomes a way for people to score the occassional kill and go to ground with no consequence. i'd like to see the wardec fees made cheaper. but in combination with an actual resolution/win mechanic that determines the result of the war. if a corporation wardecs a target and loses 75% of the engagements if should probably be awarded a ""loss"" and prevented from a re-war-dec for a month. if the exchange remains even-ish (25-75%) war can continue. if they actually ""win"" they get awarded the victory and some kind of ""victory boon"" against the target for a month (maybe 1% tax rate directly scooped from losers wallet for the month as ""reparations"").obviously this ties into some of the ideas in my csm manifesto and would have a role for mercenaries involving themselves in the war and having a direct affect on the war stats. summary. yes, i think war-costs should be cheaper because at the moment they unfairly penalize starting pvp'ers who want an early war with their first corps. (and since eve is an open pvp game that sells itself on these options and alternatives this is a bad thing.)but - war system needs work. and definitely needs a resolution mechanic to decide who wins or loses to prevent declared wars from dragging on forever without resolution. (as they can do when veteran player finances come into the equation)."
4/29/2008,"what are the candidates' opinion of this little nugget i just pulled out of.... *ahem* ... anyway...ccp refuses to classify as an exploit the entire membership of a wardecced corp hopping to a newly created corp to avoid the wardec. so, let's change it so that, if several members (or a large percentage) of your target corp end up in another, you can dec this other corp free of charge. i don't mean in cases where a few people bolt from corp a and end up in corp b. i mean where 24 people leave a 25 person corp and all 24 end up in corp c, which incidently happens to have 24 new members who joined up the same day it was created. i've had that happen to me and it was very annoying. at one point, i felt like i had half of verge vendor under a wardec trying to keep up with it."
4/29/2008,"i've never liked war-dec evasion by corp-hopping (while the declared on corp refuses to formally surrender and agree terms). the idea i express in the post both above could probably solve this if you made actual corp membership part of the win conditions for a basic war - too many jump ship and the war will be over with a victory awarded to the aggressor. the defeated corp pays ""reparations"" in some form. if people want to avoid paying even that then the corp could go bankrupt and be struck off perhaps. detail needs adding to this proposal in formal discussion and brainstorming - but the principle is to bring resolution to wars through what actually happens in game."
4/29/2008,"well any chances must affect both sides, and having dished out a few millions to dec a corp only to find out that everyone or close to everyone has left and created a new corp, and starts doing the same thing that caused you to dec them in the first place. does that sound right ?now i agree that the last war dec fee nerf was a bit harsh, but changing the fees without having the game mechanics in place to achieve something by having a war does not help much."
4/29/2008,"ugh, that is a hard one cailais. 1 line? poor jade! <3 but i'll try my best at a 1-liner.the biggest problem at present is the product of scale. scale can been seen in regards to lag, economic issues and 0.0 warfare, and quite a few other issues(the solution isn't sharding, fear not)."
4/29/2008,"i think the biggest issue in eve at this time is the feeling that the csm is useless, will damage the game, or will give some people an advantage over others.will we tell ccp what we want and they will fix it in the next patch? no of course not. there are a lot of good and helpful posts in the forums, there is also a lot of garbage as well as a great number of malicious posts. i believe that over time a group of people presenting practical ideas based on what people want to ccp will make this a better game."
4/29/2008,"this statements take balls, because every large space holding entity now fear for their fortresses and vote someone who avoids this topic.i do however, concur"
4/29/2008,"tough to pinpoint a primary issue as i have loads. if i reduce it to three main issues, is that ok?the inability to deal with known criminals, griefers, and other scum that hides in highsec. lofty definately needs to go as well.lack of content (both pve and pvp) for solo players and small corps/groups of friends. i hope faction warfare will be a step in the right direction though.boring r&d, mining and production. needs to be much more dynamic."
4/29/2008,"big issue is really space combat dynamism in 0.0 and empire. and by dynamism i mean opportunity for involvement and participation and good fun pvp:0.0 suffers hugely from massive defense advantage and the blunt instruments of cyno-jammer, jump-bridge, sovereignty battle at reinforcement timer bottlenecks and as a consequence resolution is laggy, unsatisfying and generally out of the reach of any but the largest entities in the game. this really needs serious resolution and i think most of the csm candidates and a good proportion of the eve electorate know this.but it doesn't stop there, eve-pvp is not just 0.0 territorial conquest. the lure and imaginative potential of eve is in its freedom of choice and sandbox nature where players can choose the profession, specialty and in-game focus they want to pursue. at the moment here is next to no support for variant conflict mechanics and pvp mini-professions. the war dec system needs attention, bounty hunting and mercenary options need supporting, lowsec is currently a wasteland where nobody really needs to go. this all adds up to a problem with limited pvp opportunity and lack of dynamic lure to get people involved."
4/29/2008,as stated on my candidate thread:
4/29/2008,"as others have rightly pointed out there are lots of issues.one primary gameplay issue that needs resolving if i was allowed to ignore lag and pos warfare (as that has several iterations to go through according to ccp) and low sec space which involves a myriad of interconnecting issues... i would suggest the retention of new players via implementation of better gang mechanics. i.e. sort out gang mechanics.it's not rocket science that we need to retain all players but the number on 14 day trial that get past the initial learning curve only to quit after hitting the very real harsh mistress of eve by getting blown up in a so called friendly gang must number high.i doubt many players will want a carebear type of game and would like eve to remain the harsh mistress that she is, so i believe discussion needs to be brought to the table on this issue.a non gameplay issue (but affects gameplay) is customer service. i'm sorry i can't stop typing! petition queue times and quality of responses need improvement but i'm unsure if that lies within the scope of the csm. i'm fairly certain that gm's are very hardworking people and get a lot of flack however some stress and tension on both sides can be avoided by introducing a service level agreement where customers know what response times to expect and gm's have targets to achieve. that's one possible solution, there are probably more."
4/29/2008,"the biggest issue as i see it at the moment is bacon and other programs that use the log server file in a unintended fashion.and ofc farmers, macros and rmt that can destroy the game."
4/29/2008,"more i hear from you the more i like what i hear, you have my vote!!"
4/29/2008,"i disagree with this, it's an important issue that needs to and can be resolved technically in the short-term, it's not the biggest issue facing eve today."
4/29/2008,"remove local anywhere, in any way, and tons of people will find it much less worthwhile to participate in eve. it's the pirates and griefers who want to nerf or remove local, but if that happens, the game will devolve to where there are only pirates and griefers and newbs. as the newbs get popped and podkilled to satisfy senseless and pointless killboards, they will leave. the pirates and griefers think eve is an arcade game. it isn't."
4/29/2008,"i'm concerned far more about the social impact of losing local than any intel stuff or otherwise.how do candidates suggest this is accounted for if local is removed from 0.0, especially considering how empty 0.0 can be already for people looking for social interactions as well as pvp?"
4/29/2008,"when people suggest removing local they do not suggest removing the chat functionality, only the intelligence functionality.for a good discussion regarding this see posts 38-65 of this threadand my responses in this thread"
4/29/2008,"i really can't add anything to this post. jade hits the nail right on the head, as i see it."
4/29/2008,"my opinion is that local should stay no matter what security status you are in/based in.it is a great social tool and, as many people have commented, a simple intelligence tool for those that are paranoid."
4/29/2008,"for those of you that feel local should go away (based on security level or something else)...would you be ok with local staying if it was less efficient? (if local acted like the noob help channel and only listed those that ""used"" it and only maintained track of those that do a set group of actions like ""within xx km of a gate or station"", speak in local and so on)"
4/29/2008,"i would like to present a few ideas for the candidates and would appreciate any comments on them.0.0 warfaretoday the state of 0.0 warfare is seing the blob reign supreme. in order to keep it profitable for the players to build up 0.0 infrastructure, the defensive side in 0.0 has been boosted compared to the offensive one so that it is stronger.the effect of this is that there is little room for smaller entities to challenge the sovereignty of larger ones. while you may always fit a group of ships and get a fun fight, the chances of having a real impact on 0.0 is limited. how should we find a place for the smaller non nano gangs/corps/alliances in sovereignty warfare?should pos defenses be fitted and destroyed much like ships are today? imagine fitting a ""battleship"" type thingie with modules and the anchoring it to a pos structure. a smaller gang could then attack the pos defenses, weaken the defenses and get away with loot. good idea? bad idea? rotten idea?should we introduce mini pos and pixi pos that can be deployed at a safespot, doesn't show up on overview, allow cruiser and frig sized hulls to ""dock"" and be discoverable only by the use of scan probes and only if an enemy pilot is docked and active at the pos (or he has recently logged off at one)? the idea is to allow for smaller entities to establish bases deep in enemy territory. how should such a thing be balanced?sov is pretty much a question of having the more large pos and sov level a question of how long you've had them. this effectively prevents smaller entities from challenging sovereignty of larger ones. should sov level be changed to a point system where also the mini and pixi pos described above has a value and sov level is determined by how many percent of total points an alliance has?what other ideas do you have on this topic? please also think ""out of the box"" throwing up new ideas rather than simply modifying old ones. we need csm to be a bunch of imaginative beer drinking nerds who will blend in with the rest of ccp - that way you stand a better chance of spying at hem effectively. player enabled contentshould we players be allowed to invent stuff from scratch? should i be able to prefit my favourite cruiser and then do an invention run on it, creating an x run bpc with modules prefitted on it - modules that i would be unable to remove? should such a bpc have a mineral bonus to production?should i be able to invent new drones/fighters in much the same way?should i be able to do invention and improve on existing bp's? ie should i be able to add an extra mid slot to my zealot bpo/bpc and what should the impact be on mineral cost? should i be able to improve power and cpu output the same way?roleplayi feel the the actions of the playerbase has very little impact on the politics of the empires. should it be possible for players to somehow impact on how the empires interact or shold this be left to ccp?when (if) factional warfare comes, should it be possible for the minmatar playerbase to induce the brutor tribe to sponsor an attack on the amarr colonies assigning ships much like fighters to participating pilots?what (if anything) should be done to further rp in the world of eve?and finally:i have repeatedly petitioned ccp to hand out a free bhaalgorn bpo's to pilots answering to the name of octavinus augustus. they have so far refused to comply. will you as a csm member fight for my rights, face up to ccp and insist i be given what i deserve (in the spirit of compromise, i'd be willing to settle for 2 zealot bpo's)?i'd be very interested to hear your thoughts on these topics. please share."
4/29/2008,something along these lines would be very cool.
4/29/2008,"relating to your question, if someone of csm or csm itself would invent in this case, there should be more details announced.on which premise did you call up ccp to hand out this bpo?on which premise do you deserve this bpo?do you want to ""buy"" a csm/the csm with 2 zea bpo's?"

4/29/2008,"octavinus, could please place each of your questions in a separate post, to enable answering individually? i suggest you will receive more responses this way and it will be easier for others to compare candidate responses."
4/29/2008,every since i started playing eve lag has been with me. those early missions where the accelerator gates fire you into the middle of a hostile swarm on npcs and you die from lag before you ship responds to commmands.shopping trips to jita.0.0 fleet battles where you jump through as gate and wake up in a pod back in your home station never having seen the enemy. this my friends if where ccp need to allocate their development resource. it's all well and good adding new content but it's a bit pointless if we can't use the content we already have.
4/29/2008,is i already mentioned here action on part of ccp is necessary!
4/29/2008,i agree and to prove it here is my answer to the eve mag.
4/29/2008,"regarding the ""lag issue"" -> it is an issue granted, but i personally don't think its something that is ever going to get solved in isolation through implementation of new uber servers or endless need-for-speed refinements and efficiency-enhancing back end alterations.reality of the situation is that lag = a failure in game objectives and territorial conflict mechanics at the moment that have made it too attractive (and easy) to out-blob one's opponents utilizing sovereignty tools and starbase equipment. and this is only made worse by the current territorial conquest engine that allows the defenders to specify their period of highest numbers and activity when they want the critical fights to play out. leads to dog-piling on an epic scale = lag.lots of people look back to the ""golden age"" of eve when there was no lag(tm) and large fleet battles happened between adversaries and huge fun and entertainment was had by all.partially this is just nostalgia - partially its the fact that numbers were fewer then, partially its the fact that fights were not ""alarm clock ops"" and could be triggered at other times than at the defender's choosing and were by consequence far more likely to be uncertain and less numerically-charged affairs all round.solution to ""lag"" - is stop forcing the player base to fight single pitched battles at single points in space at predetermined times.spread out the objectives, make defenders ""guess"" more. keep the battlefield fluid and distributed and actively balance the game to encourage all sides to split their huge ""uber blobs"" into smaller task forces pursuing multiple simultaneous objectives at remote locations.its a pretty damning indictment of the current 0.0 territorial status quo a lot of this could be achieved by simply rolling the clock back to 2004/05 grade capturable stations and attendant ""ping pong"" because at least there you had the ability to spread out an attack force and engage multiple points of enemy vulnerability and encourage the defender to split up their forces if they wanted to stop all the ongoing ""flips"" on that particular night.now i know. yes yes, ""all current territorials hate station ping-pong"" because it means you need an actual 24/7 presence in space to stop the bad-guys taking the mickey out of your defenses - but really, was it so much against the vision and essence of eve when the defender did have ""weak times"" and ""vulnerable periods"" where particular timezones were a problem for them?i mean, if i'm flying with star fraction's us/pacific wing and we're peaking at a half dozen battleships because its our ""weak tz"" does that mean that when we get bounced by 20 enemy guys from hawaii our ships should ""go into reinforced mode"" and the foes are going to have to come back in euro primetime to finish the fight? funny example i grant you, but its pretty much the principle of current 0.0 territorial warfare and its the reason why the critical fights in pos domination always turn into immensely lag-filled nonsensical 15min module lag travesties rather than playing out as decent fleet battles.just when did we all accept the principle that the defender always gets to fight in his or her strong tz anyway?---so the point here regarding ""lag"" is that i just don't believe its meaningful to name ""lag reduction"" as a csm campaign pledge without actually getting your teeth into the core issue of gameplay balance and focus that necessitates lag-inducing numbers-fests as the only method of territorial conquest resolution available to players.deal with the actual cause of ""lag"" by all means. come up with proposals to reduce reliance and promotion of the uber-blob in starship combat. 50 vs 50 works fine in eve pretty much. lets have gameplay systems that split a horrible 250v250 grind slideshow fight into 5 different enjoyable mini-battles at remote points in the contested territory and then you're on the right track in my opinion."
4/29/2008,"right, i largely agree with jade.what we will see is a large reduction of lag, once infiniband hits. there's no question about it. but it wont happen without a lot of work from ccps side, by impelementing load balancing systems, which works on the fly. it's all about delegating services, which are taking up a lot of cpu for one system, to different nodes. this will reduce the cpu bottleneck, by being able to offload as many tasks to as many different nodes, as possible. we still have to consider that it can be expensive to offload tasks, but sometimes the benefits will outweigh it a lot.so while i agree jade that if there is lag, it's a failure on the objective of the game. but i think jade is missing that it's a product of scale and the network effect.you can't stop people from blobbing. it's perfectly sensible. where there is people, people will go. be it the market(more to buy, more potential sales) or pvp(more people to shoot). so while fixing lag is a real thing, and should be done, it shouldn't be done alone. we should still encourage smaller groups of people to do something, rather then encourage blobbing."
4/29/2008,"yeah but this is the point. ccp have continually made the code and network better and more efficient throughout the history of eve. whats changed is not that they've suddenly dropped the ball and ccp devx has accidentally coded ""[[if fighters launch = make more lag]]"" in the patch code. as they've improved the lag situation player base has gotten bigger, single objectives have encouraged dog-piling and more and more ships cram into the same grid/system/node and make the situation seem worse. think of it like a family house. perfectly fine when its a man and wife, they have loads of space and a beautiful living environment. they then have a couple of children, then a couple more. slowly the house gets crowed. the father converts the antic, puts some more beds in the spare room and it all gets crowded. (he's trying hard to stay abreast of the situation.) children grow up get boyfriends and girlfriends and want to move in! more house conversions, they turn the shed into another bedroom and partition the living room into another bedsit and all the time its getting more and more crowded! eventually something's got to give and they have to tell their offspring to go and get a place to live of their own because ultimately thats the only proper resolution. eve terms -> few years ago a 50 vs 50 fleet battle was massive! it pushed the server. it was epic and impressive and made everyone's jaw dropped. but as the server has improved fights get bigger and bigger and the server cannot keep up with the maximum blobbing potential of the largest alliances. if infiniband and code optimizations allow 500v500 battles to work smoothly then the alliances will bring 1000v1000 and complain about lag. ultimately you've just got to split up objectives and bite the bullet about disincentivizing mindless fleet dog-pile."
4/29/2008,strange i honestly hadn't thought of lag as a product of game mechanics in the same why as others seem to have.some observations of my own:why do pos' cause so much lag indeed all anchorable structures? just visit an ice belt to see what i mean.why do caps cause more lag than bs?why do fighters cause more lag than drones?would it be possible to have the options to remove objects from your view not just the overview?
4/29/2008,"we all suffer fear and hate lag. i am not going to repeat already spoken words of the co-candidates above me.i would be very surprised though, if ccp has not yet figured out that we hate lag..this is why i assume, there might be a technical limitation, some kind of bottleneck behind this lag which is just not shared with the player base. that would be bad press for ccp, obviously they cannot talk tech details too much with us w/o risking issues with their business partners running the data centers, the sql servers or nas.it is my opinion that we need to know the issue better in order to address it.perhaps we should focus on workarounding what we cannot change for technical reasons, setting a more attractive frame for smaller scale combat would be a start.(i do not mean the usual vaga/nano gangs)currently there is no way around large fleet battles if you want to conquer territorypeople fear that, lag has become an additional defense system. (people jumping in are ususally those with pants down, as the others were already waiting with grid loaded)reducing the need of blobfights would be avoiding the lag, w/o fixing the issue at its technical roots, i would certainly ask ccp why they keep it his way and continue to even promote large fleet warfare each time a camera or press pass is waived at their faces:-)i realize that my suggestion does not look convincing on the 2nd look - because even if the need is removed, people would still blob for the sake of a swift victory... tough topicreality vs marketing - who shall be the victor? i direct this question to ccp."
4/29/2008,i feel the inferband will help when it is put up.ccp have said the lag in jita is due to the amount of transaction going on and not really the amount of players. i feel ccp could improve it by spliting the loads of this area in to three nodes. first node deals with the players their ships and cargo in the system. second deals with the market and the third deals with hangers. this spliting would have benfits to the player just flying though the system or buying items. it would also give three cpus of that area. however there are downsides first one node dies bye jita. also programming this would mean changes to how the current nodes work. would bring bugs ccp have a great programming team but they are human and they will make mistakes. it however is a limited fix even with this in place it would slowing become a lag fest again. to stop this maybe a limit on how much you can have in a hanger at one time. i feel ten level 5 freighters of space at one time. the limit has to be linked to the amount you have on the market to stop out of date market orders creating overfill.
4/29/2008,"alternatively fix jita lag the same way station office hoarding was fixed. look at introducing a system whereby it becomes more expensive to post sell and buy orders in popular stations. the more sell and buy orders in a particular station the higher the penalty tariff on orders. eventually the free market system will balance itself out and it'll become less profitable to trade from jita when other alternative hubs have lower penalty tariffs. lazy buyers/sellers can pay a premium if they choose, enterprising traders and salesmen can establish other smaller hubs. eventually jita trade diminishes because if it doesn't the tariff on buying and selling keeps rising month by month. just a rough idea, but it would eventually work - concept is that you ""fix lag"" by better distributing the player base."
4/29/2008,"did you mean ""infiniband""? really fast connection between servers.that would help if that isthe bottleneck, if it is the cpu or disk i/o then it helps nothing i am afraid.if transactions are the problem, then this is database traffic - in which case i would assume the problem to be cpu and/or disk i/o sided.however, unfortunately i was not beeing offered a job as ccp-it service engineer so i shut up here:)i think though that lag has many facettes, and i classify slow transactions in jita less critical than personal losses of subcapital and capital ships in fleet fights due to inabliitiy to act/react/respond.we seem to see the ""trade hub lag"" which may be due to transactions we also see module lag (introduced by the latest series of patches according to my own experience)where a commander would wait for minutes until a pressed button would start to have an effectand then we see grid load delaysand delays due to having more than a few pilots jumping into a system or into a gridthe problem is everywhere, and jita - is against popular belief, not the reason :pall named lag types can be explained with the load of database tablesthe more objects (hangar items, things in space etc) plus change of the object attributes(transactions, position-changes, session changes)the more the back end side cpu / i/o is loaded. ... well.. i guess. another topic is theclientside performance:when i was on a fanfest 2 years ago, they announced the graphix expansion we just started to enjoy. they said due to the new techniques of texture mapping, use of shaders and whatnot - the load on the client cpu would rather drop than increase.one thing as your rep would be to ask them why they lied."
4/29/2008,"no, the issue is cpu"
4/29/2008,"that probably isn't the main bottleneck. most of the lag in eve iirc is created by the way that eve sends data to the client. which is to say it sends one big packet instead of lots of small packets.this means that when you jump into a big gate camp you don't get incremental load you get it all at once. and that load is going to come in the form of a 5-10mb packet. now if your machine can't handle that 5-10mb packet or it gets lost or damaged you crash, don't update and the server has to send the 5-10mb packet again.there is a lot of gain that can be had by changing the network structure and i am sure ccp is working on fixing it."
4/29/2008,"i'll tell you a little story about another mmo, i was in the early beta of this mmo and no it wasn't wow, it is older then wow and eve for that matter.there was an issue, massive combat on a continent. every continent was it's own server. what was interesting is at 350 people the lag started, then at 375 it started to desync, at 400 people lag made it unplayable and you'd randomly disconnect.what is interesting about this is these exact same numbers of people on a nod in eve it starts the same thing. now this other game's hardware would have been 7-8 years old today. and we all know how much hardware advancement have been made in 7-8 years. however i still believe there is an underlaying hardware limit. a limit that seems to start getting hit at 350 people.no matter how many network controllers or type of network was available this appears to be the magical limit.now jita itself can handle 500-600 people i've been in there with 600 people, however a lone system in 0.0 space can't handle above 300, it starts to lag out etc.although i'm not a candidate i believe the only change to make jita and lag disappear in general is to change mechanics that force people to use the game differently. can be as simple as setting limits on orders at stations, we all know jita has lots of people because everything is there. if the market was changed in a way that people would only buy/sell in jita for a cost you'd start to see radical changes.imagine buy and sell orders with broker and taxes directly related to the amount of traffic a system has. very much like how much office rental is calculated.you'd instantly see a massive change to how jita works, systems surrounding jita would get more buy and sell order. 0.01 isk price changes would no longer cost you 100 isk but could cost you 50,000 isk etc.a small change like that would do radically change the idea of market hubs you'd think it was a new game.edit:- i should point out this would only effect changes to market hubs like jita and not effect 0.0 pvp or fleet ops."
4/29/2008,"it's not hard to notice that some of the candidates are not overly fond of each other in game, and on the forums. my question is ""how do you plan on dealing with another csm member that proposes ideas and sugestions that you oppose when you are a member?""be nice. be specific. give an example of how you have dealt with this both in rl and in forums."
4/29/2008,"just because you don't like them as a player, it doesn't mean you can't work with them.but also remember that just because a discussion can get a bit ""nasty"" on the forums, people often change once it's over voice communcation or even in real life.but personally, i don't think it's gonna be a problem at all. i have talked to a handful of candidates on ventrilo. they are all nice people."
4/29/2008,"agreed that it's usually easier in person, but with the passion that most of the candidates show for the game, someone with an opposing view to what you enjoy, could cause problems."
4/29/2008,"i guess, one could pick up zool's notice:the csms have to devide csm work and business from game play.foreground is the work on received inputs from the community, not to fight out personal belongings from game play. imho it's a need, that csms do this division.thereby csms have to remain reticent. a diplomatic and constructive debate has to be the fundament on effective and successful work"
4/29/2008,"in theory, yes.but i think that different perspectives rather cause interesting discussions, which leads to a better solution. while it might create a heated debate(will happen, probably), it doesn't mean we don't like each other.while i might agree with some of what x says, i can still think x is a nice person"
4/29/2008,"i believe once people met in person in game rivalities will step into the backgroundi have not seen any form of council in any part of the world where all would just have friends and hug each other nonstop.debates are bound to happen, and probably also needed. and ccp is about to offloadthis hard work to slave.. erm csms :-)but i think most of us are grown ups and as such able to focus on a topicfrom a rl angle, which is hopefully not just a direct a mirror of the ic/ig angle."
4/29/2008,"all the people on the csm vent / csm halls channel a few days back sounded like friendly, mature people i could work with.and as a neutral in game, i don't have issues with them in there either. well except for the one that hired the trolls and assassins."
4/29/2008,"there is an eve vent?could someone be so kind as to pm me the details or even better post them here for everyone to use :).thank you.anyway,i would consider it very selfish if people disagreed strongly on a subject. the person should be smart enough to look into the idea and see it the way they see it and possibly say ""yes, your suggestion is better because..."" or a polite ""i still don't see the advantage of your view"".of course i am not saying there will be no disagreement but i'm just suggesting that every point be conisdered and to be looked at though the eyes of others."
4/29/2008,"ultimately i'm sure people will be reasonable. at the weekend we had a pretty good discussion with a group of csm candidates at the event run by revan neferis. i hosted voice discussions on the sf vent for a bit too. i think everyone there found it a pleasant experience and there was no childish nonsense. some things we agreed on, some things we disagreed on, but handling debate in a mature and respectful fashion without personal pettiness is the decent option.csm is a democratic body, its down to 5 votes of 9. if elected i'll do my level best to advocate and persuade on behalf of ideas and issues i support but if i lose a vote in council i lose the vote - its time to move on. this kind of representative body has no use for people who endlessly harp on about discussions and arguments they've been out-voted on. and its important that the player electorate of eve do their best to select a panel of nine representatives who are able to work as part of a team, and realize that debate and persuasion and not haranguing and arrogant superiority complex is the route to a successful inaugural csm body.look for candidates open to suggestion. look for candidates able to smile and laugh at themselves occasionally.sense of humour is absolutely neccessary if we're going to be couped up with crazy eve players for 5 days"
4/29/2008,thereby i accompany nickaelhoop
4/29/2008,"no, there isn't.but i think i will go and rent a 30 slot ventrilo server and have csm people come on there, and let people join and ask them questions. brb."
4/29/2008,"good idea, i guess i can't follow as quick as others do (as i'm not native english) but i'll do my very best... otherwise just imagine this german freak as one-ear-listener (matchable with a two-finger-writer) ^^"
4/29/2008,"that's ok :pi found a host for a teamspeak server, as i was unable to get my hands on a ventrilo server.i will create a new post about the server, once it's up and running."
4/29/2008,"not looking for anecdotal stories or specifics.what degree of social interaction should be supported in the game? what balance of pvp and pve content should eve have? what scope levels should eve have? where in the mmo market do you see eve now and in the future?that kind of thingedit: edit2: ok completely took my sig out, now no bias :)"
4/29/2008,"imho, as much as possible! i guess we'll see what this ""social interaction"" really might be, when ""walk on station"" comes up.moreover one has to write a dissertation on that and even this would not be an adequate answer.i think this shouldn't be a question for candidates and those, who are currently interested in this politic during the hustings. one should think about a general survey.i'd like to read a more specified question than this one(perhaps i don't get it again ^^"
4/29/2008,sorry for being vague again :p scope creep
4/29/2008,"so, as far as i see your point of interest, i'd like to know, to what extent ccp has project groups on already mentioned problems (lags, clusterbuilding and servers) compared to the efforts they place to upcoming novelties (e. g. ""walk on station"").currently i'd like to see more efforts on already mentioned probs, than inventing sth. totally new"
4/29/2008,"the introduction of eve voice has made the social side of the game slightly better as you can talk much faster than you can type. the introduction of being able to walk about stations and planets (i think it is in the works edit**) would add an element of play that would attract different people who orginally thought the game was all about spaceships.the balance between pvp and pve is entirely up to the player in question, obviously i would love to see a figure around 50% for each but it will change a substantial amount.i see eve up in the top 3 mmo's and hopefully 1st in the future as it is an excellent game indeed"
4/29/2008,"just as rl politicians have the same problem, populist policies are not always necessarily the best way forward either for the majority or for the long term shape of the game.how will csm candidated deal with this balance, or will they purposely play devil's advocate so dev's can feed back why they aren't doing what the player base wants?edit: this question goes out to candidates and the player base"
4/29/2008,"i think time will show, whether the accomplished campaigns (-> populist policies?) and the persons (or in some cases groups) will take the disired effect on eve the community would like to see.i don't get the meaning of the second paragraph..."
4/29/2008,"i mean i haven't poured over the documentation about exactly what csm candidates actually do and i think it'll be the same for most people.do people think the csm candidates should be more mouthpiece of the people, the representative of the people, negotiator on behalf of the people, a conduit for dev/player base interactions, some sort of arbitrator / middleman?"
4/29/2008,"my appreciation of a csm-member is (as i already mentioned):a candidate has to be a person, who might be able to stand in ""front"" of the community as a direct organ for the community facing problems with ccp (and the invented council) without nodding off, trying to find diplomatic solutions and who feels him-/herself responsible till the end for the communitys concerning.additional to that:i don't understand it that way, that every individual stated petition will be discussed in this csm. it has to be the csm-members job, to find a generalized and preferably generally accepted topic, which takes place in ccp-csm debates.nevertheless i see the future work of the csm as a continuous-floating process of information flow und actual share to the games development, whereby my point of view on ""nodding off"" results. in this connection, the csm and it's work needs to be transparent 100%!"
4/29/2008,"the prime example of a mindlessly popularist policy in this election campaign is ""reducing lag"". everyone hates it, ccp has been trying to reduce it for years and isn't about to change its priorities because x,y,z motions are made deploring ""lag"" even more. there are gameplay alterations that could be made to address and minimize the incidence of lag in key areas sure -> (like providing disincentive to dog-pile reinforcement battles for example). but simply standing on a platform of ""vote for me and i'll reduce lag"" is the epitome of a bland popularism akin to promising ""tax cuts"" with no detail or examination of exactly where the money is going to come from. rl politicians know that ""tax cuts"" get votes because voters are naive.lets hope the eve electorate is a little more sophisticated than that."
4/29/2008,reffering to?
4/29/2008,"""manifesto pledges and campaigning on knee jerk popularism."""
4/29/2008,thank you for nothing -.- i just asked you to whom you are refferuing to!
4/29/2008,"i'm not going to be drawn on specific criticism of other candidates demos, this election is about the big issues and which of us can best represent the eve public on the csm council. there is no role for petty backbiting on the campaign trail when we might be sitting together in council in a month depending on the election results."

4/29/2008,"id probably vote for jade and i agree with hardin, verone would have been also a serious target for my votesome candidates i simply dont know despite my age. my personal minimum requirements for a canidate is:a) ability do keep in game events and rl stuff divided (example: youll see no ""for matar"" quotes from me in my campaign or csm related posts,although i use to be an matari roleplayer) b) ability to realize at any time, that one is just a councillor, not a ruler - just the extended arm of the player base. not for own ego in council, not for own alliance, not for own race, not for the veterans, not for the rookies, not for a specific nation...for the entire player base a candidate needs to be.usually if honesty and ability meets - there is a candidatethis can be figured out by forum posts sometimes from campaign statements too, if one can filter the marketing."

4/30/2008,"ah good times, i seem to recall that fight lasted several minutes with multiple warp ins/outs in order to achieve an ew advantage. is till credit your victory to your better skills (and thus faster lock time) but prehaps that is just me being ussual arrogant self. prehaps a rematch is in order? anyway, back on topic: that clears a few matters up, however i still see problems arising. first and foremost it would discourage pvp corps from recruiting rookies. again this is another way of discouraging young players from throwing caution to the wind and getting stuck in to the wonderful world of pvp why would a mercenary corp take the time to train some young blood when he will inevitably tarnish their record with foolish errors. while at the moment such losses do little to tarnish a mercenaries corp's rep (as kills are what the contracter is generally interested in) as soon as you begin to introduce statistics such as ""efficiency"" the loss of a few t1 fit rifters can mean the difference in getting the job or being shunned as noobs. or are you suggesting that the value of losses etc. is taken into account? were that the case i must question what sort of time commitment such a system would require to implement, and whether there are not more pressing matters to attend to?secondly, newer corporations, or indeed older ones that are just moving in to pvp, would be just as open to this ""bad smell"" during their initial pvp adventures. this would encourage the reforming of corps in order to obtain clean slates, something that, i think you will agree, would take away from the game experience. when i consider my character i think of more than just my attributes. kehmor has fought in countless wars, ruthlessly murdered and scammed. he has worked as a mercenary and now, in a strange twist of fate, finds himself as a pirate hunter. i wouldn't trade the avatar for one with twice the skill points.now consider corporations. when i was a director in blood inquisition i felt a great reluctance to abandon something i had worked hard for. now in pak i again feel part of a collective, and even another corporation with the same members and a similar name would not be the same thing. we have history, old grudges and allies that creep back into existence when one least expects it. any system that encouraged corporations to abandon their home in order for nice stats would take away from the feeling of meaning and significance that this game provides. i am fortunate enough to be flying with a group of ace pilots who can proudly boast their kill/loss ratios, however consider the two year old industrial corporation that decides to move in to the realm of pvp. they suffer the ussual newbie losses we all went through in our early days of combat and are left with what? a two year legacy tarnished in an instant by a game mechanic. unable to recruit and quickly losing members what option do they have but to ""re-roll"" their corporation and lose the history that came with it.although fully specced in caldari i find i only really enjoy flying the falcon, my love of big numbers has seen me convert to gallente gank boats. ironic considering my rp roots. anyway, running out of characters and cba to make two posts.regards,kehmor"
4/30/2008,"ah, seems i was too hasty and should have taken time to read your response properly. thus a second post is required afterall.fortunately i considered this response before making my initial post and have my next annoyingly petty reply ready and waiting. any ""optional"" system would not really be optional. there is a certain corp pride felt by every member of every corp. in eve (excluding the corp robbers and freeloaders). there would be an undeniable internal pressure for any semi-established corporation to make use of such a feature. any who didn't would again instantly be classified as ""noobs"", as it would be assumed they had something to hide. so, once they have activated this ""option"", what then? well it is as i said before, they restrict recruitment, introduce overly paranoid pvp guidelines, and generally aid the ever declining state of pvp in eve.now this interests me, but i fail to see how such a thing could be implemented fairly. who is to say that an industrial corp has ""lost"" a war simply because they have lost some ships, it could have been their most profitable week for the last year merely because they chose not to actively fight and instead continue with their industrial endeavours. would both sides have to agree on a deciding factor? this seems unlikely to work in many cases.on to rewards, what do i get for ""winning"" a war? isk? loot? sure, but from where? the losing side prehaps? again we encounter issues of what is a fair way of determining that my corporation has won? how about external isk or lp is introduced? so i make an alt corp and beat it rutlessly into the ground in exchange for the cash. how about reputation? a big gold star in pak's corp info, awesome. again, what's to stop me recycling alt corps in order to aid me in this quest for status?re-reading your (many) posts, i also noticed you mentioned a penalty for failing to achieve war goals. this does sound nice on paper but certain fundemental mechanics make it impossible to introduce. i don't know what you feel these war goals should be, but say for example it was to kill the enemy ceo. we are at war for a month, and it turns out this chap has died in real life. what now? we are expected to tarnish our record because somewhere in the world a pasty fat nerd ate his last slice of re-heated pizza and had a heart attack? or say it is to achieve 100 kills within a week? the corp we are at war with, after losing 99 ships in a day decide it would be best to jump ship and form a new corp until we get bored, or indeed, consume our very own fatal slice of domino's.anyway, my last thoughts on the matter for now, it just seems to me that this one idea was thrown in there for the sake of attracting a few votes, something your campaign has thus far avoided. hope you prove me wrong.regards,kehmor"
4/30/2008,1) capital fleets logging off when in combat (disappearing in 15 minutes)2) battleships logging off at jump in and disappearing in 60sis that an issue?
4/30/2008,"ok, here is my idea:sov 1 is gained by having more pos in a system than anyone else (as current).sov 2 and 3 is gained by placing lots of small anchorable structures around a system. these serve the npc population of a system, basically the schools and hospitals and power stations, the infrastructure.insurgents or small gangs can hit these small soft targets. if they do it for long enough, sov starts dropping. if a system is well managed and defended, sov starts risingif you just whack a pos somewhere out in deep 0.0 and just refuel it once a month, you don't automatically get sov levels and all the associated shiny toys---advantages: no sov steps. sov is sliding scale, therefore small and medium sized attackers have an effect relative to the time and effort and size of force they put in. industrialists have something to do in 0.0 beyond fuel pos and make guns for pvpers. now they can create their own little empires extra effort needed to build sov levels means 0.0 entities have to concentrate into smaller areas, thus allowing for new groups more chance to come in and colonise the vast swaythes of 0.0 currently claimed by alliances but not really used. sov level is relative to the isk, time, skill in managing and general effort put in rather than just some low constant of effort plus time as it is atmconstants: big alliances can still drop in from on high and destroy pos with mega blobs. defenders however have the extra option to burn the small target infrastructure behind them as they retreatdisadvantages: still need caps to take down pos still get camping at gates. raiders still need to get into a system outposts still an issue if left indestructable? isk sinks & inflation. there is still too little isk being lost by pvpers with result of the real terms value lost from ship destruction falling---i'm also a big fan of tactical environments, and i think they can help remove some of the bland same-ness of space just for aesthetic reasons more than anything as well as make pvp more interestingin conclusion, pvp in 0.0 can be made more dynamic and interesting with the above suggestion without actually nerfing cyno jammers or having destructable outposts. the issue of outposts, which is highly contentious, i feel is part of a wider debate of which ""dynamism in 0.0 pvp"" is just one aspect (others being isk sinks/inflation, declining real terms value from pvp losses, and reasons jade cites about untouchable assets and trend of 0.0 filling up with them, all of which along with pvp are interconnected)"
4/30/2008,"well kehmor, the thing about kill records and mercs not wanting to recruit new players  im going to disagree about what makes a successful combat corporation/alliance there. sure you can massage the stats and play with nothing but uber high skillpoint pvp pros to protect your record. but, the reality of eve is that people burnout, they take breaks, they get on with their lives, they come and go and have variable playtimes available. stats are one thing, but having an active and enthusiastic corporate environment is something else and far more useful in the long term. in star fraction for example we recruit relatively new players, 2-3 months in game, we put a premium on personality and select applicants we actually want to be spending time with. in the short term sure, this means our killboard stats are not as good as the burn edens and tri uber pvp corps out there. we sit on around 70% success rate overall and its good but not that good, but it means we are continually replacing numbers and keeping the movement strong and active. thats the long term view on playing eve and its noticeable that jf is still around and going strong after nearly five years while any number of stats-loving elites are gone to dust and emo self-destruction. point is kill numbers are not everything. to your question specifically maybe the merc corp sucks this up and makes it part of the pr appeal, promises activity and enthusiasm and devil-may-care hilarity rather than yawn-tastic cloaked-raven bombardment and near 100% efficiency.in terms of the merc-stats/contract efficiency id say yes, by all means incorporate things like damage caused, kills per day, activity levels, things like this  its up to the merc corp to decide which aspects of its appeal it wants to promote. re the bad smell / re-rolling corps to lose early records  how about you can reset any time you like pretty much. the clients will be able to see when your records date from so if youve reset 3 months ago youll be a) relatively new, but b) will have a clean record to begin from. again, remember this is at the corp/alliance (pr) level its not about your character specifically and being called on your entire eve record.if an industrial corp decided to change its focus and rebrand itself as a mercenary outfit after 3 years of being uber miners in maut then its not unreasonable for those guys to publicise their results post the transition and begin their new pr history on combat engagements from the moment they choose the mercenary specialization.re the peer pressure about public engagement stats well, first im saying this is an option specifically for corps/alliance that would appear on an in-game hiring roster of mercenaries  and would specifically track accomplishments over accepted contracts. (random kills and nbsi wouldnt be relevant, just results in contracted mercenary wars). and secondly with regard to the general shame at not having killboards etc. not everyone in eve at the moment has a public killboard. some corps opt to keep their stuff private and that doesnt make them worse or less effective pvpers. anybody judging x,y,z corp entity in eve on appearances alone is likely to be badly surprised sometimes.on the war-mechanics, heres the basic concept: you declare war. the eve-system then tracks the results in this war (tonnage/av market value of ships/equipment blown up being the basic measure) if the overall exchange damage is > 75% or < 25% after 2 weeks (say the maximum default period) then the system is going to trigger a war end condition with either a win or lose for the attacker/defender. (if the numbers are somewhere in between war can continue)."
4/30/2008,"basically if we wardec random fat territorialist supply corp and shoot down 20 haulers for no losses in week1, and 15 haulers in week2 (with no losses) then the war is ending with a win for us at the beginning of week3. we get a victory boon = x% of the target tax rate delivered to our corp wallet for example.if the fat territorialists actually brought some fighters to oppose us and the results were (we shot down 20 haulers and they downed a couple of battleships) and the overall numbers remained between 25/75% efficiency the war continues (and we have the option of continuing the pay the war bill - if we don't and the war finishes in the middle zone its a draw. no result). whereas if they took it really seriously and hunted us like dogs and reduced our efficiency to -25% wed suffer a loss and involuntary penalty with the war cancelled, some kind of automatic war-reparations payout added to our alliance/corp bills. id see mercenaries fit into this equation by letting them be ""bought into somebody elses wardec and join their statistics to the allied force (in order to pro-actively prevent the conflict ending with the whitewash win for the attacker) - (hence again the importance of the performance tracking for registered mercenary corps - so the defender can have an idea of exactly what they are buying)its a very rough idea, but it illustrates some thinking of where the war-dec system should be going in my opinion. csm candidates have been asked questions about the war-dec system, are wardecs too expensive? what do we think about griefing wardecs  should bigger alliances cost more? etc etc. we do need an answer on these issues and in my opinion the introduction of actual goals and penalty/reward calculations for sanctioned war-decs could add a useful balance and very interesting possibility for the future of the game.its not so much about chasing votes kehmor, as in just thinking about problems that have been raised. if somebody asks me my opinion are wardec fees too extensive at the moment? im obligated to think seriously about the answer and consider the big-picture pertaining to general conflict dynamism in eve. i mean you can say yes and advocate making them cheap but then every-wannabe empire ganker and his little dog too will wardec everybody with a freighter for ongoing free jita ganks. you can say no (or even make them more expensive) and then you price younger pvpers and war-corps out of the equation and force them to do their fighting out of hi-sec. the true answer is that the system is too crude at the moment and could be something far more nuanced exciting. challenge of csm, eve electorate, ccp development team in concert is to express precisely what that something should be and agree its shape and roll-out."
4/30/2008,"okay then spoon, first thing i have to say is that while my gut feeling remains that even sovereignty 1 from pos is wrong, i do think the idea of general attackable infrastructure items away from the pos guns and thereby valid targets for raiding and conflict has some merit. that though said though, why not just make it about planets? make sovereignty about putting orbital facilities (headquarters, administrative hubs, propaganda centres and such) in the orbits above planets and have the actual sovereignty of a system determined by the collective loyalty of the planetary population. let both sides influence this by blowing up/establishing orbital facilities and dropping trade goods and equipment down to the planetary population (luxuries and flash grav vehicles to bribe them, guns and bombs and nerve gas to increase instability). make the business of sovereignty about blockade running, interdiction and generally influencing the simulated politics in the system.(thats all a bit blue sky and planetary environment-tastic but it would be a way of simulating sovereignty without pos.)and thats a key point i keep coming back too spoon-thumb. i think sovereignty from pos is the greatest single problem that links all other 0.0 problems with dynamism. they are blob-makers. they are the things you have to hit if you want to cause lasting damage and conquest or nullify conquest and the nature of the things makes warfare boring and blob-tastic. hard to shoot down, impossible to destroy in one sitting, reinforcement timer means you have no initiative and will have to fight the collective war-blob of the defenders (and every other nap member) in order to destroy it. its a concept that hugely damages the war-simulation in 0.0, the whole reinforcement timer paradigm has had a terrible effect and these are the real underlying issues.now i like some of your bullets, the sliding scale is good, its nice for industrialists to have something to build, its good to have intermediate objectives for small/medium gangs to hit. but without actually dealing with the problem of pos being the sovereignty claimers at core (youd still have to destroy / outspam all pos in an outpost system to take the outpost) you havent really dealt with the core issue.re tactical environments  definitely, i love the concept and it would really help differentiate terrain and engagement variety. callais made a really good post on the subject in my removing local / discussion thread. herein conclusion while there are good ideas there spoonthumb, i still think you havent tackled the basic problem of pos/sovereignty role in 0.0 wars. these things are a strong disincentive to a dynamic environment  they promote forced alarm-clock blobbing and a two-speed culture in 0.0 (caps/everything else). as a concept they just dont work. ultimately having a nuanced system for increased sovereignty levels is a pretty good idea, but if the foundation level is still about pos spamming, you have the same old problem for the attacker in that theyve got to destroy or outspam the enemy pos network to attack the outposts."
4/30/2008,are you going to answer my questions or ignore me like you do anytime someone blows on your house of cards?
4/30/2008,"you're pulling my heartstrings, jade! +1 vote"
4/30/2008,"thank you very much for your endorsement. its very gratifying to see people taking a deep interest in these issues and looking at the big picture for the future of the game. i think its why it was very important to express the whole scope of opinions and general candidate understanding of current gameplay issues; the eve electorate really needs to know who its voting for and to have faith and confidence in the vision, passion, and general fellow-gamer insight into these concerns on the csm."
4/30/2008,"1) becomes an issue with uber tanks that can shrug off damage for 15 minutes definitely. i know full well that expensively-fitted amarrian carriers and motherships can pretty much achieve this with triage/uber bonuses and simply disappear if things look dodgy. much more a potential problem in the small gang/pirating/lowsec hot-drop environment too because likely enemies just don't have a dps on hand to kill them in the time limit. longer aggression timers on bigger ship hulls? (maybe 30mins for cap ships). its annoying i understand that you might have to spend a bit longer cloaked on disengage before you can log off a capital ship, but might be a price worth paying to counter logoffski in fleet combats and skirmishes. 2) is just rubbish really. it shouldn't happen. i guess one fix might be counting bubbles as ""aggression"" against an incoming ship (even while cloaked) so that its impossible to simply do the log off and disappear in 60 secs trick. i can imagine that being a tricky programming issue though so i'm very open to suggestions on this. but the principle is clear, i think its a nasty little cheat/marginal exploit to do the log-off at jump-in while cloaked and subvert the aggression timer.to which (on this general subject) i'll add another peeve based on timers and thats the deaggression/redock timer. here's the thing, we've been through multiple iterations of ship hit-point boasts and buffs. ships today are 2-3 times harder to kill than they were a few years ago. but redock/jump timers are the same as they ever were. this means that aggression/dock/undock ""games"" are more common and powerful than they should be and realistically this is a very easy fix and something i'd definitely like to see dealt with. when 0.0 fighting becomes about dock/undock games with fat tanked ships leaving the bay, shooting off some rounds and then de-agressing to dock again seconds after there is a problem. it encourages overwhelming force/hot-drops as only way of killing in time and is a blob attractor as a result. cheesy tactics like these need clear fixes and its not unreasonable to increase the dock/jump timers in line with the hit point buffs that all ships have received in my opinion."
4/30/2008,"pos aren't broken, sov mechanics are. pos serve two functions atm; claiming a system and boosting sov level. you need to decouple claiming sov from sov levels. pos make sense as the method for claiming. a new system is needed for the levelling, which is what i proposed.---why not do this with planetary interaction? because you can have both. planetary interaction is a ""soon(tm)"". i'd rather not wait a year and a half to see sov mechanics get changed just so they can fit neatly in with planetary interaction.in fact, the sov system should be changed first, so that when planetary interaction comes, it slots in perfectly, and feels like a mere extension of an existing system rather than something imposed on top.---to elaborate:sliding scale sov should not have set levels. instead you have sov points like cuture points in civ 4. anchoring more pos in a system than a rival is equivalent to capturing a city in civ 4. it shows on the map as yours and resets the culture points to zero. if the city has temples and libraries, you gain control of them and start gaining culture points from them. if the enemy in their retreat however burned the temples and libraries, you have to rebuild them, which takes time and you get no points in the meantimeas you go past certain set levels of culture points, you get more squares of land around your city and less ""angry citizens"" or whatever.---in eve, this translates into the small and medium sized targets being the schools and hospitals that gain you ""sov points"" (pos would not get you any points alone). you don't magically get fuel bonuses from out of nowhere after a set length of time like atm.instead, for each sov point you get, it knocks some amount off the cost of fuel for starbases, because the local population who run your pos and man your reactors are healthier and better educatedequally, you can anchor a flat pack cyno jammer any time you want, but to attract the specialists who are qualified to run it, you need to have a certain quality of life in your system for its inhabitance. this level is represented by 4000 sov points or whateveredit: this fits in with the complaint that sov is artificial and why should you suddenly be able to magically anchor something that you couldn't yesterday when nothing has changed except a number in some concord database---what i'm really saying is that small corps and alliances should not be able to take sov from big ones. but they can make that sov meaningless."
4/30/2008,"thank you proxay, and i love the image too! much appreciated"
4/30/2008,\o/ my votes are in for hardin tbh
4/30/2008,"thanks verone - your endorsement is appreciated. regarding kelsin's questions i find it quite amusing that you need to know all this information when its quite clear that you are operating as jade's chief cheerleader - if not her unofficial campaign manager is there a realistic possibility that my answers will convince you to vote for me or are you just trying to make me say something stupid which you can jump up and down on and go 'nah na na na nah hardin is an idiot'? you first asked me which issues i was interested in - i gave you a list - were you happy no - now you want specifics - but specifics on carefully selected topics. will you be happy with those - probably not! nevertheless, i will rise to the bait.roleplay (enhancing): i would like ccp to take roleplay more seriously. i know that many knock 'roleplay' in eve but the backstory and history is of interest to large groups of players (probably more than we think). i would like to see an eve which is more dynamic in relation to roleplay, where the old established empires 'react', 'respond' and 'interact' with players and player empires more than they currently do.i would like to see more recognition given to pod pilot politics in the shape of 'empire' reactions to the initiatives of both individual pod pilots, corporations and alliances - although this is an area in which ccp has already improved massively of late (and this is an area in which ccp has to tread carefully to avoid claims of bias)i would like to see ccp endorse and support efforts such as eve front - which will give players the opportunity to contribute to the history and immersion of this game.and of course i would like storylines to progress a little faster and more logically. hell the amarr empire has been without an emperor for the past year with little to no ic justification. it is not good enough!i will also be interested in seeing the details of factional warfare and ensuring that this is something that adds to the roleplay of eve rather than detracts from it."
4/30/2008,"pos warfare (improving): i think pretty much everyone agrees that pos/sov warfare as it stands needs to be reformed. the question is improving it whilst maintaining balance.i do believe defenders should have the advantage to reflect their 'entrenched' state and their initial and ongoing investment (both in isk and time) in defensive structures. i don't think cynojammers are the problem. unless a defender is tipped off (or the attacker extremely incompetent) the initial strike to down a cynojammer (which takes place at a time and place of the attackers choosing) is relatively straightforward and painless.attackers then have the option of leaving those caps in the system until needed. in the event that the attacker does withdraw caps from the system and doesn't interdict the system (allowing the defender to regroup and repair/online cynojammers and jumpbridges) then the attacker is asking for trouble...nevertheless i do think it is excessive that after re-onlining the cynojammer the defender can then move as many assets into the system as it wants using the mechanic of jump bridges. the ability for defenders to uuse jump bridges to jump in multiple super caps and caps to defend a cynojammer (either via doomsdays or remote rep) when an attacker can only use conventionals (assuming the attacker didn't leave their cap fleet in the system after the initial attack) is imho unbalanced towards the defender.my suggestion would be that any jumpbridges put out of action by the attacker in the initial assault cannot be reactivated while there are poses in reinforced in the system. similarly new jumpbridges cannot be installed and activated while there are reinforced poses in a system. in this way if defenders wanted to move caps into a system to defend their cynojammer/poses would have to open a window in their cynojamming protection which the alert/organised attacker could also take advantage of. it also means that the defender will (may) need to fight to get its conventional defence fleet into the system rather than simply bypassing the attackers fleets by using jumpbridges.i am open to other ideas on this subject - but will not support any idea which pushes the balance too far in favour of either side. while siege warfare is tough for the attacker you just have to look at bob's recovery in querious and period basis to see how large well organised attackers can quickly capture space - particularly if the defender is not properly dedicated and motivated. pos maintenance (simplifying): one of the main objections i have to making it easier for attackers to kill poses is the amount of effort that pos owners need to go to to keep the buggers online. pos maintenance (as most people acknowledge) is not much fun and needlessly so.if the process of maintaining and refueling pos structures was simplified and made less demanding then i would certainly look more agreeably on proposals to make their destruction more 'fun' too. however as it stands, i see people investing significant amounts of isk and time in maintaining pos networks (with the exception being those lucky few who have the right moon materials) and believe this should be reflected in the effort that attackers have to go to to remove them.i believe ccp already has some work in progress in this area and look forward to finding out more."
4/30/2008,"0.0 (developing): one of the main reasons i was attracted to eve in the first place was the ability for players to build empires and civilisations in 0.0, empires shaped and molded by us as players and based upon our own ideologies and philosophies - something unique to eve as a single server game. over time ccp have released tools which have allowed alliances to start to develop an infrastructure in 0.0, to actually build real and solid things.since that happened we have seen a fragmentation of alliances. there are more space holding alliances in eve now than at any time in its history and this adds to the flavour and depth of eve politics, which can only be a good thing because inevitably it leads to friction and conflict. yet despite the tools sov holders have been given we still see the majority of eve pilots based in empire. why? the easy answer is that they are all carebears - but the reality is that the infrastructure and economy of most 0.0 regions (and even low-sec) regions still does not offer the economic incentives to outweigh the risk of relocating to 0.0 - nor does the nbsi attitude (an understandable attitude in view of current game mechanics) favoured by the majority of 0.0 alliances.i therefore believe that sov holders should be given further options with which to develop their space and stimulate their economies. one suggestion - which i have seen proposed - is the introduction of 'agents' to outposts with sov holding alliances able to 'pay' agents (the cost would depend on the level of the agent) to relocate to their stations and thus provide another incentive for people to move to 0.0 (of course the sov holding alliance benefits from the docking fees and general economic activity stimulated by this - while the pvpers raiding their space benefit from additional targets without having to worry about their ****ty sec status).of course that particular idea may prove unworkable purely from a technical standpoint (i am not a dev) but i would welcome tools which actually encourage alliances to realistically consider policies beyond the simplistic 'its not blue - shoot it' approach and to actually think about the development of their economies (beyond ratting, mining and moon mining). this is something which will enhance the game long term as it will help populate 0.0, increasing pvp opportunities for us all. i enjoy the depth of eve, the depth in history, the depth of ideologies, the depth of its economy, the depth of playstyles, the depth in tactics, the depth of personalities and the depth in politics but am worried that some want to remove this depth and turn 0.0 into counterstrike in space. i have made it clear in my blog (and above) that i do have a bias in how i view this game. my in game experiences shape these views. this is precisely why i believe i and other csm members should not be pushing specific policies and agendas at this stage. should the electorate have a reasonable idea about our general game philosophy and the type of characters we are - yes they should. but we are being elected to a team, a team which will look at all these ideas and issue and then (hopefully) come to educated and informed decisions which are in the best interests of the game. if the csm ends up being full of people who are standing to promote specific agendas - with no willingness to compromise and look beyond their own interests - then i am not very hopeful as to how this is going to turn out.fortunately, i believe the majority of candidates - candidates such as omber zombie, serenity steele, guomindong, zoolkhan and bane glorious, to name just a few - do have the best interests of the game at heart and i hope i get the chance to work with them."

4/30/2008,"i'll be voting for this homeboy, because he's not zealously for or against any one issue. it means his stances are moderate, non-extreme, and not too crazy. unlike some others ..."
4/30/2008,"i'll ask you the same question i have asked of similar candidates, specifically those who seem to feel it unnecessary to tell the players anything about your own ideas and opinions.what would you say to those of us who believe that a candidate's individual opinions give valuable and necessary insight into their thought process? as a csm representative, you will be required to make choices and decisions on various issues and then vote according to your decision. the players deserve some indication on which way you will lean when faced with these situations, which will be a regular part of your duties as a representative. not stating an opinion makes it appear as though you either have something to hide, or you are completely uninformed about the current issues in game, or you are just plain indecisive. none of these are very attractive characteristics for a representative.your own thoughts and ideas will form an important part of how you weigh arguments and make decisions. why do you not feel it important for your potential voters to know these ideas?"
4/30/2008,"i fully agree with this. i have discussed it with jade on a few occassions, and i think it's damn important.i think while individual opinion is important, it's also important for people to understand why you think so. so i'm trying to take a stance of not just state my opinion, but also create awareness of why the issues happen in the first place, how it manifests and makes a difference for people and why they should care, and how to eventually fix it.that is how i went about writing my first article about the state of the economy. and i have been going hard at providing these kind of conversations on the forums, as well. i think there is so much fud on the forum, that i have been thinking about creating a faq for those kinds of things. we keep comming to the same conclusions every time someone asks the same question. so why not get over with it, and make a nice thread which discusses all the issues, why they happen and how to maybe fix them(those would be ideas, ccp should have a say too, as for how they would prefer things, in order to make it possible in terms of mechanics).edit: rereading your post again, you make it sound like i don't take stances on issues, and that i'm just ""the voice of the community"", who has no interest. it couldn't be further from the truth. i'm heavily biased, if you are to believe some."
4/30/2008,"ok people, let me introduce myself to you.i am a 33 year old engineer, living in munich, germany. i enjoy crunching numbers in games just as much as irl, which is quite helpful in the kind of games i favor (strategy/management).i started playing eve in august 2005, and my main occupation ever since then had been running missions. in highsec, lowsec and recently also 0.0. since my other primary passion (besides killing evil people) involves the pimping of ships, my main focus regarding missions has always been on empire though. i also delve into trading occasionally as that is where the really big bucks are made, but i tend to find it too boring to occupy me for extended periods of time. mining? well i did it for maybe a week once. in my first month of play. never again since then, just not my cup of tea.as far as killing people goes, i am a good guy i guess, as in i take great pleasure in dead pirates, but could never get myself to shoot neutrals in lowsec. out in 0.0 though, i am a firm believer in nbsi, even while i consider that same doctrine in lowsec to be simple piracy and thus fight it there if i can.and even though i have been in player corporations for pretty much my entire eve-life, i believe the ability to also achieve things solo is of utmost importance to the success of eve as a game.about my agenda:seeing how i am such a mission ***** at heart, my primary agenda would be to counter the 'move all l4s to lowesec' people that we will undoubtedly get on the council. as far as balance is concerned with missions, i would fight for the status quo, as i see it working out quite okay the way it is atm. no need to make it any worse by moving them to lowsec or nuking bounties, but neither any need to boost them by increasing bounties or improving loot quality. (loot composition on the other hand definitely needs to be fixed, frigate abs from bs wrecks always irk me). lowsec itself (and also the low end 0.0) do need a boost imho, but this must not come at the expense of highsec dwellers.as far as piracy goes, i realize that we need pirates to keep the game exciting, but we also need some limits for them to keep them from spoiling the game too much for the more peaceful folks. so while i sometimes endorse boosts even for what is my chosen enemy, they must not always have their way. moderation is the clue.only if you are a suicide ganker, logontrapper, gang invite sploiter or any other such lowlife you definitely do not want me on the council, as i am vehemently opposed to such cheesy tactics that will yield maximum rewards for minimal risks at the expense of unsuspecting players.moving on towards ships and modules, which i consider my primary area of expertise, you will get total balance out of me. i never specialized in any races' ships, which means i can (and do) fly almost every subcapital ship and use all modules to good effect. meaning i have no personal agenda to further 'my' race over the others simply because there is no 'my' race. instead, i strive to achieve my idea of balance. which basically is described by 'different but equally capable'.as far as pvp mechanics go, i am a small gang fellow with very little care for long range fleet fights or pos sieges. i am quite opposed to the current nano trend, at least for cruisers and above. in my book, the line between big and small ships is drawn below cruisers. so frigs and dessies should be able to nano themselves to their hearts content and the speedtank should be a viable defense for them. for cruisers and above though (and that includes the vagabond), i don't mind them going fast if they are made for that, but them using that speed as actual tank should not work anymore."
4/30/2008,"also like i already said, the solo play aspects of eve need to be defended. there are lots of people out there saying that we could play x3 or something if we want to solo. i think this is dead wrong. even if in both games everything is just bits and bytes in some computer, the bits and bytes on the eve server are so much more real. and you do not have to fight with or against other players to interact. almost every item you buy or sell is interacting with one or even more than one player, something that cannot be said for some offline single player game. and for most people, whatever they achieve when soloing will eventually be used for pvp, even if it is 'only' market pvp, which actually is more cutthroat than pew pew more often than not.politically i am fairly neutral. i don't really give a rat's ass about any of the big alliance power games. the only entities that i do dislike are those that frequently employ the cheesy tactics that i mentioned above, and i can't think of any that i particularly like over any others (except my own alliance and its blues i guess ;)).so if you find your own concerns mirrored in one or more of my points, feel free to cast your vote for me. and spread the word, we do not want a council filled with alliance puppets, do we?now, some specific issues i see with eve and the solutions i favor:1. suicide ganking.while i agree that highsec should not be safe but safer, the level of 'safer' needs to be adjusted upwards a notch or three. if you cannot run a mission in the nextdoor system without a scout anymore because people will suicide-gank you with 5 t1 battleships for your meager 500 mil in gear, something is wrong. suicide ganking should really only be profitable on paper-thin ships carrying loads of valuables, or really pimped combat ships (like the ones i fly ).the solution to this is obviously to do away with insurance for ships killed by concord. and that means not even the basic payout but complete voiding. nada, nothing. recently someone posted a good optimization for this: you only lose insurance if the target dies. if your target lives, you get insurance. this provides a nice safety net for both suiciders and those prone to accidents with gang members. thus it does not even raise the risk level for the suiciders (still very close to 0 if you do your homework), but it steeply raises the value of bigger ships loot to be worth suiciding. which seems like the perfect solution to me. not that i would mind complete insurance revoking for any concord kills, but i wouldn't want to drown in 'griefer' tears.2. the lofty scam and gang mechanics in generalthese two are intertwined, so i address them in one topic. basically the current lofty scam exploits peoples' wrong belief that noone may fire on them in highsec. iirc, in the past it used to be so that if you were in same gang it was like if you were in same corp, i.e. free pew-pew and concord doesn't care. this was abused i guess, and changed so that it wouldn't work anymore.now that people found ways around that, i think it would be time to allow free pew pew among gang members again. no more false sense of security, no more accidents in highsec gangs, no more need for a complicated set of aggro rules applying to gangs. and the best protection against gang scams would still be to auto-reject invitations just like it is now. actually it would be nice to be able to only autoreject gangs, but not chats."
4/30/2008,"3. the nano.the population of eve seem somewhat split on whether there is a nano-problem or not, even if judging by the forums and my own ingame experience the supporters are more vocal but the anti-nanos are way more numerous. personally, i do see a problem.and the problem i see is not the speed in general, but that speeds making ships close to invulnerable are attainable by ships that are already plenty powerful even without it. basically the entire t2 cruiser class.so the solution i would favor would have something to do with nerfing 10mn mwds. anything that also nerfs frig sized ships would be wrong imho.also, the whole thing might have something to do with webs making anything caught by them vulnerable to even capital guns, while unwebed top speeds make stuff invulnerable even to weapons specifically designed to hit fast ships. so the (un)balance between highest and lowest speeds might need some looking at as well. personally, i would find it interesting to see what would happen if webs were completely removed and speeds were seriously cut across the board. would probably require way too much module rebalancing to be feasible, but still...4. skill queuethis is something that has cropped up time and again in the past. and while i personally would not really want to see a real skill queue, i would like to see something like a 'backup skill'. like, you set some very long skill as your backup skill, and whenever your currently training skill finishes, it switches to that backup skill. this would prevent sp loss at unconvenient skill end times, but would not really allow queueing.5. more love for the side factions!this really needs to happen someday soon, who knows, maybe it is planned for factional warfare. what i would mainly love to see are of course faction ships for khanid, thukker, mordus etc.. but also (more) modules from them, and especially modules with different stats! like for example a khanid bcu currently has the same as a cn or dg bcu. would be so much more interesting if it had for example a higher damage mod but a lower rof mod, so you end up with the same (or maybe even less for balances sake) dps, but a better volley.6. market mechanicsi find the way the market works fairly stupid. always buying from the lowest order regardless of what you clicked and how much you pay is so counterintuitive it makes me hurt. and seeing how many other avenues are open for cash transfers these days, the argument that it could otherwise be abused by isk sellers is pretty moot.imho you should see who market orders belong to, or actually allow players to create trademarks under which they can do their trades. and then of course you should by off the order you picked, not the cheapest one. like for example, i would gladly pay 10% more if i knew the isk goes to an alliancemate rather than a hostile.and of course this would do away with a large portion of the need for $1 undercutting.7. fix the forums!and please for the love of god get these forums sorted. i had to log in a few dozen times to get all this posted..."

4/30/2008,"unfortunately i've already pledged my vote to another candidate, but i highly recommend considering this candidate for those still deciding who to vote for"
4/30/2008,"you have my attention.i can't say i'm completely on board with all your ideas, particularly your proposed solution to the lofty scam, but in general i like the way you think. i'll be looking for more from you in the coming weeks."
4/30/2008,"so far you are my best candidate, as i agree with most of your points and where i disagree your position don't seem unreasonable. there is only a point i think you should reconsideri like the possibility to help some new player but at the same time i want some control on the situation to avoid to be the one scammed. it is true that if i am protected, with the current system, the other party is the one at risk, but if someone ask for help he should accept and consider the risk.a possible solution could be a different kind of gang, one were any new member of the gang should be approved by all the member. a similar system would be useless for a pvp gang, but useful for a pve gang, that usually is composed by a smaller number of people ."
4/30/2008,"actually for helping new players, i would prefer simply putting in a way to post clickable links to your position in chats (when you are not in any gang yourself anyway) so people can warp to you without being in your gang at all."
4/30/2008,"so you were too rushed and busy to from a statement which would be the first thing most players see about your campaign, and when listed among over 60 other candidates, may be your one and only chance to get them interested enough in you to find out anything more. it sounds to me as if you either have a poor order of priorities or you just don't have the time to devote to something like the csm.well, as a csm you are going to be doing a lot of communicating. your first impression is that you either don't have anything to say, or aren't any good at saying it.all it shows is that you like putting up a flashy appearance with no actual substance, and that you might know your way around a thesaurus. when people go through this many candidates, you've really only got one chance to say enough about yourself to get their attention before they move on to the next person in the list. trite catchphrases and no information is a poor way to represent yourself.so the only votes you expect or want to get are from those who already know you. fair enough.then you should have said something worth reading, something that actually told players about you and what you stood for. i find that most people have little appreciation for buzzwords, even less if there is nothing real attached to them. the fact is that you did not do it. if it had been important to you, you would have done it. the fact that you did not consider your first contact with the playerbase, and possibly your only contact with many of them, important enough to warrant a little more of your time and effort is rather troubling. what your profile says to me is, ""i have nothing to say, move on."" forming a campaign statement for your profile is a minimal amount of effort to convey your ideas to the players. i'll restate my question: if you were unwilling to do this work, why should anyone believe you will be up to the work requried as a representative?or would you rather i believe that it was important to you, but you were incapable of doing it? because frankly, i'd consider this even worse for your prospects as a representative."
4/30/2008,i think its fair to say that serenity did actually send a very clear message with his first action in the csm campaign setting up the eve csm candidate listing site as a service to the community. it said from the word go that he was interested in the process of the council and empowering prospective candidates by helping them link and potentially host their material. thats the very positive message i took from his action there anyway.in terms of the candidate message on the official listing. i tend to agree that candidates should probably have posted more detail there. and i would support ccp allowing candidates to change and edit their message there in the run up to the official voting (we still have a week) to ensure that they are all representing themselves on an even footing and have appropriate time to prepare their platform. the actual timescale of candidate application was quite rushed. i only finished mine a few days before the deadline and if i hadn't been watching the process of the csm planning as carefully as i had been its conceivable i wouldn't have been so prepared either. back to serenity though. i think he's a very strong candidate and i hope he gets elected alongside myself and we can work together to make this inaugural csm everything it can be. having spoken to and exchanged thoughts and eve-mails with serenity in the past i've no doubt we can collaborate and progressively discuss issues as respectful and mature players of this game to the clear benefit of the eve electorate and general player base.
4/30/2008,"i have to disagree with the idea that the messages should be allowed to be changed. i think that what the candidates posted with their profiles is very telling of what they felt important for a first impression. the fact that several candidates were not prepared enough, not aware enough, or not dedicated enough to make a proper descriptive statement should stand as testimony to their capability of being a csm representative.on a different note, another question for serenity steele. how do you explain your support and collaboration with yusra in devising a method of organized bribery for the candidates. yusra has advocated a system in which candidates' votes will be bought by those who can pay, and no issues will be brought to the csm without a paid purchase price, and in which she will personally profit. yusra has cited you as an accomplice in enabling this idea. how do you justify support of someting so abhorrent and contrary to the intentions of the csm?"
4/30/2008,"thanks for the advice talkuth, i'll keep it in mind for the next csm. as it's not possible to change it now, i'll have to live with it.it's unfortunate for me that you interpret my efforts as being ""unwilling"". anyone should believe i will be up to the work required as a representative because if they read my post carefully, they will see i arranged my personal and work to ensure i am able to live up to the commitment before applying."
4/30/2008,"""bringing diversity to the eve community""infinite diversity in infinite combinations represents a vulcan belief that beauty, growth, and progress all result from the union of the unlike. concord, as much as discord, requires the presence of at least two different notes. the brotherhood of man is an ideal based on learning to delight in our essential differences, as well as learning to recognize our similarities.this is what my campaign is all about, in a nutshell. i would direct you to my campaign blog for some background information as well as some of the issues that i have addressed.this thread is worth checking out since it contains my views on bacon, as well as some other thoughts on the game of eve.my hope is to represent all players equally, in as objective a way as possible. however, i would not be completely honest to suggest that all of us do not have our own agendas, based on our life experiences and philosophies, even our gender and skin color. all of these qualities make us who we are, and we cannot help but be influencedd by them.i am impressed with the field of candidates, and am looking forward to meeting others who are chosen. my challenge to you, the voter, is to consider casting your votes for diversity on the council. i believe i am the best choice of women. my presence on the council would not be as a ""token female"". people who know me describe me as fair, compassionate, persuasive, charismatic, and not afraid to make a decision and stand by it. when challenged, i am prepared to meet the challenge and defend my positions.i look forward to serving you, and ask for your vote."
4/30/2008,good luck with the campaign!
4/30/2008,"i'm afraid your post comes off as a lot of pretty words without actually saying anything. a lot of candidates have said similar, and i have the same problem with each of them. they are not being realistic. the fact is that it is impossible to ""represent all players equally,"" as all the players will not agree on all topics. the purpose of the csm as a whole is to represent all players, and it will do so by having members who represent different views from among the players. which views do you intend to represent? when it comes down to decision time, which way will you vote? what issues do you consider worth your time to address and either support or oppose?to be fair, your blog does list some actual issues. however, i would suggest that you put those issues here. blogs are nice for going into extra detail, but this thread is your primary point of contact with the playerbase. this is your official csm thread, many will not look any further for ideas that you do not present here. you've been much more honest than others about the existence of your own biases and opinions, i think you just need to do a little more work to actually communicate them.clearly state your issues and goals, and you will gather the support of those who agree with you. continue to claim to be able to do the impossible, in representing ""all players equally,"" and you'll come off as just another politician, willing to say anything to everyone just for the votes, without clearly communicating who you really are."
4/30/2008,"since my in-game corporation information is missing from my portrait, i will state here that i am chief operations officer of sentinels of justice tactical command.i am a defender of freedom, and i reject all forms of piracy. this is who my character is, however, as a player... i see a role for pirates and piracy. it's part of the game. i believe one of the most destructive aspects of the game is isk-farming and/or the selling of isk for cash. while there doesn't appear to be a real solution to this problem, it does remain that... a problem.here are some issues that i have personal opinions about... but am willing to consider alternative solutions to the overall problems of pirates having what i call ""the upper hand"".high sec ore thieves need to have immediate kill rights, in my opinion, longer than 15 minutes. the period of time for which those kill rights remain in effect can be a day... but there should be an opportunity for immediate action to be taken against someone who steals from your can. short of podding.kill rights should extend to any member(s) of your corp that happen to be in your ""gang"" when the target is a player that podded you and you were not at war.all low sec systems should allow for player corps to defend them without being interfered with. it can be as simple as the corp with the most poses in a system given ""free reign"" to deal with criminals in any way necessary. this also means if a pirate corp happens to have the most poses, then they earn the right to defend that part of space. gate guns and station defenses would not stop the corp that has ""defense rights"" from dealing with hostiles.i speak more on the issue of ""fixing low sec"" here.i am a strong proponent of transparency in the market. it is vital that players know to whom they are doing business. many corps prefer to give business to those they share philosophy with. i see no reason why an open market should not truly be that... open and transparent.i am in favor of special n00b zones in which skill training takes place at an accelerated pace (up to 5 times as fast as normal) and where only players with fewer than 2 or 3 mil skill points can be found. you can spend as little time there as you choose, but why not take advantage of the accelerated skill training? all of the activities are available to you that are available to any n00b player except for the ability to join a player corp. the market would contain all tech i or basic equipment at fixed prices. selling of ores and minerals is still possible as well.i am also a proponent of a sort of ""neutral zone"" between empire and 0.0 with a strict nrds policy built-in to the game. or perhaps no aggression at all except for entities at war. the idea of this would be to show players in a relatively ""safe"" way what awaits them in 0.0. give them a taste of the bounties and privileges of living in null space, but at the same time, hold some back. (there still has to be ""some"" incentive to move to 0.0) no poses can be built in this neutral territory, perhaps."
4/30/2008,"i'm sorry, but would that be the borda system he advocated, which will not work as he intends, since it is designed for single-winner elections, and would backfire as it would empower large alliances to elect multiple representatives without the need for outside votes? i'm sorry, but it's the one issue oz has actually bothered to post an opinion on, and with it he's demonstrated he doesn't know what he's talking about."
4/30/2008,"regardless of what system is settled on and who advocates what, it is vitally important to get discussion of the csm mechanics on the agenda. oz has so far shown that he's the most willing to bring the issue to the table and debate it, instead of the usual ridiculous bug/feature campaigns that most of the csms have opted for.as long as oz is willing to debate exactly which system should be implemented, and participate in a council-wide decision on the nature of the csm, exactly which system reforms he's brought up in his initial campaigning isn't that important."
4/30/2008,"i have a couple questions, and i don't mean for this to come off as thread****ting or anything like that, but i must criticize this. i read a bit of your blog, and it seems like the only thing you really wanted to discuss at the csm is how the csm could be managed more fairly, efficiently, and effectively. to this, i have two questions.1) while it seems like a fine thing to talk about, there are only 9 seats available for the csm. is being on the council the only way that your csm reforms could be considered, or do you think ccp would discuss them and possibly implement them on their own in future csm elections?2) if this is not your only issue, and i tend to give people the benefit of the doubt so i assume you have other concerns, what else do you feel the csm should talk about?"
4/30/2008,"what bothers me is that he argued quite heavily in favor of the system, even when shown how wrong he was in that the system would not have the effect he thought it would. doesn't this indicate that he is not open to considering the ideas of others, and will only push his own, regardless of what the best option is? to me this shows that he doesn't care whether he understands an issue before giving an opinion on it, and will cling to his opinion no matter what the facts show. isn't this detrimental to the purpose and success of the csm?"
4/30/2008,"hi there - i found this forum late so do excuse my tardiness at participating in this forum.my big issue is 'transparency' whic is more about ccps relationship with the playerbase than any specific in-game issue although it touched on almost everything. i've posted in some of the threads in this forum but you can see my site, policies and biography here:"
4/30/2008,"i'll ask you the same question i've asked some other candidates:given the likelihood that many players may vote after doing nothing more than reading the candidate profiles (here), why is it that you felt it unimportant or unnecessary to exert a minimal amount of effort and post some key aspects of yourself or points of your campaign? as i see it, the candidate profile is the single most important place to get your point accross clearly and concisely, as it will be read by the most players, and many will never see anything else. yet you felt it unecessary to post anything of any real substance. your statement says nothing about your campaign beyond a vague generality. it does not say anything about what issues you are for or against, it only gives a url for your website. considering that your name is just one in a list of more than 60, don't you think it would have been a good idea to give players a substantial reason to follow that link? your profile gives a first impression to many players, why did you not take the time to make it count?if you could not be bothered to do the work necessary to put out your campaign information in your profile, why should we believe that you are up to the task of doing all the work that will be associated with a seat on the csm?"
4/30/2008,"well for those too lazy or inept to click on a single hyperlink, i'll post my spiel here:about meim a 33 year old british guy, living in newhaven on the south coast of sussex. i am a freelance lamp web developer, have a wife, a dog and relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. i have some real life political experience, have served my time on turgid committees and am interested in politics, economics and philosophy. oh, and i have a law degree but dont let that put you off!you've said that already!oh right, yeah. you want to know more.dry biographical stuff first. i graduated from the university of essex in 1995 with a 2:1 honours degree in law after which i went to law school, didn't like it and founded a company instead. this firm saw me travel all over europe to trade events, giving me first hand experience of dealing with the diverse peoples of europe and north america.but times change and supply problems forced it to close. at this point i waved a magic wand and transformed myself into a web developer, teaching myself php, mysql as well as html and css. it was around this time, four-five years ago, that i started playing eve.and your time in eve?this is clearly going to be an abridged version.in the beginning i was a n00b. i started out as an empire dwelling carebear along with a couple of guys who i joined the game with from our battlefield 1942 clan. a couple are still playing! anyway, i drifted into a mate's corporation to help out with a war which was my first proper taste of pvp. i loved it. shortly after that my new corp migrated out to 0.0 in time to be a founding corp of fix alliance as the venerable cfs crumbled all around us.i spent a lot of time in fix, making both friends and enemasies, rising to the level of jcos (an alliance administrator, a director, if you will) only to depart at the end of a long and bloody war to form pure in the north. we formed this new alliance with the avowed determination to avoid the mistakes of the past so along with the infighting and cross-timezone schisms, we jettisoned electoral democracy and participative debate. this seemingly draconian, dictatorial position perversely acted to make pure very free. people were free to have fun, not having to worry about working out what to do and they were deprived of the opportunity to argue for their own self-interest leading to fewer fights, schisms and factionalism. it transpires that 'benevolent dictatorship' is the sweetest form of governemnt after all.i've not been hands-on in the day to day running of pure preferring instead to focus on single issues of importance although i was the first external relations minister...today i'm involved in co-ordinating invention efforts, preoccupied with the macro-economic issue of contolling our supply of money with a view to advantageously skewing the balance-of-trade and generally helping out when and where i can. i don't pvp as much as i'd like for a variety of reasons (got married, got an annoyingly self-obsessed border collie puppy who needs attention all the bloody time and i have to endure occaisional sensory imperfections which would make me dangerous to fly with!) but i do my bit.why elect me?firstly, and most importantly, i am an eve player who plays the game via the client rather than the eve-online forums. while the forums are important and entertaining, they are for me a poor second to achieving things in-game. caod occaisionally appears to me to be nothing more than a really bizarre scif-fi flavourerd wwe rant, one that i observe but studiously don't participate in.secondly i play the game in very broad ways  im involved in invention, manufacturing, research, npcing and pvp. i speak to people who do the rest (mining, complexes and so on) so i feel that i have a good grasp of the mood in most areas of eve."
4/30/2008,"i have ample experience of 0.0 life, including operating alliance structures; i ran fix for a while, i have been instrumental in setting up pure. this has involved an appreciation of how to create and operate trans-national social structures to provide a kind of coherence for the entity across 23/7. i should add that this issue fascinates me.fourthly i tend to look at issues from a macroscopic level while culling data from people on the ground. in pure this means i am looking at issues surrounding money supply as part of broader trading strategy in which i and others are involved. this appreciation for how large and often semi-imperceptible issues affect individual pilots is, i contend, something that we as players definitely, definitely want to see on the council.finally i promise to be an effective representative. i really want the csm to live up to its promise for useful and frank dialogue between players (paying customers) and ccp and believe that i can help to ensure that this is what happens. i will not be party to any whitewashes or tolerate corruption such as we saw last year. i will always try be available for contact so that i may represent your views (whoever you may be), or an echo of them, to ccp at meetings. and i promise not to be partisan or to try to abuse my position to benefit myself, my corporation or my alliance.concrete proposalsthese are things that i want to try and get adopted, should you elect me to the csm.1) greater transparency in the petitions process; some kind of record noting who's petition gets nodes rebooted for instance, viewable by people affected by that decision. if you are affected by the resolution of someone else's petition, you should have a right to know who opened it and which gm answered it. the benefit here for players is that you get less worked up about collusion/corruption because you can sort of see what's gone on which shouldn't really be a secret thing in matters like node reboots and yet right now, as we've seen, they are. the advantage for ccp is that they get to conclusively nail another irritating ghost that's been lingering post bob-dev scandal.2) improved corp and alliance tools, specifically the ability to grant roles to individuals not in your corp, communications streamlining and perhaps the ability to set departmental budgets. perhaps allowing alliance-wide 'blacklists' of dodgy pilots automatically unemployable so long as their name is on an alliance-administered list. things to better integrate corp systems and alliance systems. all sorts of things, really.3) push hard for improved node-support for system populations > 250 so that the mere arrival of a fairly average fleet doesn't tank the node. similarly make the usual gripes about lag. failing that, push ccp to make public what's known about where's laggiest/most unstable to level the playing field for all concerned, possibly via some kind of traffic report when you log in.4) lobby hard for the insurance system to better reflect the true costs of purchasing t2 ships."
4/30/2008,"i'll ask you the same question i have asked of similar candidates, specifically those who seem to feel it unnecessary to tell the players anything about your own ideas and opinions.why do you feel it ""inappropriate"" for the players to have some insight into how you think and where your personal biases are?what would you say to those of us who believe that a candidate's individual opinions give valuable and necessary insight into their thought process? as a csm representative, you will be required to make choices and decisions on various issues and then vote according to your decision. the players deserve some indication on which way you will lean when faced with these situations, which will be a regular part of your duties as a representative. not stating an opinion makes it appear as though you either have something to hide, or you are completely uninformed about the current issues in game, or you are just plain indecisive. none of these are very attractive characteristics for a representative.your own thoughts and ideas will form an important part of how you weigh arguments and make decisions. why do you not feel it important for your potential voters to know these ideas?"
4/30/2008,"hi talkuththanks for asking. i'll try to answer each point for you. if you feel i have not answered sufficiently please let me know.i really don't think it inappropriate to know how i think or what my personal biases are. i would like to think i am objective and behaving in a transparent manner but my main concern is that i do not want to be seen to be totally rigid and just have one particular goal aside from serving the players as fairly as possible.i have varied opinions on matters and have posted several times, not only here but on my blog revealing those opinions, see sig link.my overriding desire is to have a hand, as a member of a team, to improve eve in accordance with the csm framework and within the bounds of the role using the assigned mechanisms.but i agree with you! however i do make a very firm distinction between an opinion and an agenda...we've been here before on this point i think talkuth . i've stated so far my opinions on local, bacon, the csm itself, 0.0, pos sovereignty, low security space, piracy and anti-piracy, missions and mining.i'm not in any way attempting to be evasive or secretive. my opinions are a matter of public record and perhaps people agree with them or not. that's just natural.i do feel though that as a potential member of the csm that you have to have a degree of flexibility and while it's admirable to be strong and hold your ground sometimes it is a sign of strength to admit when you are wrong and be able to discuss toward resolution.perhaps its a case of semantics here but i see the role of the csm to bring the players voice to the table and be able to discuss it objectively. not to just bring my view to the table. i do see your point however and hope that i've cleared up matters."
4/30/2008,why do you feel that you can speak on the behalf of goonswarm when in fact no one in goonswarm can stand you and 50% of our forums have you on ignore because of your horrible posts?how can you claim to be a valid candidate when you couldn't even get 20 people to support your csm candidancy out of a forum of thousands of people?
4/30/2008,"according to the goonswarm killboard you have barely ever flown a t2 ship in a pvp situation. an absolution 4 times, and never used a hac. how can you say that the risk reward is broken on them if you have never flown/lost these t2 ships? could your opinion in anyway be biased because you do not want to use these ships that outperform the usual t1 versions?"
4/30/2008,"sounds kind-of out of line. as far as representing goonswarm or not, as far as i know this csm thing isn't about representing a corp or an alliance, but the playerbase as a whole, and i believe goumindong is doing relatively well at that."
4/30/2008,"i'm sorry, i thought this was a thread for questions to a csm candidate which is what i did.and my point was that goumindong comes up with such horrible ideas and posts them constantly that people just ignore what he is saying nowadays. and my mention of support for his candidancy references the internal voting we had to determine which candidate goonswarm as a whole would support for the csm.goumindong would be a horrible representitive as he doesn't have the first idea about game balance or how to make an argument."
4/30/2008,i do not have an sa account.
4/30/2008,"besides flying with and against these ships? besides flying ships with similar characteristics [though not all similar] and then amalgamating from there? besides testing their capabilities in non-live situations? besides intimate knowledge of the game mechanics governing tracking, explosion velocity, speed, inertia, et all? nothing besides those things. i did not have to fly typhoons and domis to know that they were utterly broken right after the rev 1 patch, and the same holds true for nano-ships. if there is a doubt, look a killboard like bob and tri and see where their losses crom from and the number of nano-ships that are killed by non-nano ships. then figure out how many of those were from stupidity[like my last two nano-kills, which had the pilots had half a brain or were paying attention would never have happened]note, there is very little wrong with the absolution in terms of risk/reward. it is not able to be made into a ship that is able to disengage like its smaller cousins. i would be flying that particular ship more, but getting my bs out of qy6 was of more strategic importance and the contract system screwed me over in terms of other means of retrieval[which is to say you can't contract damaged crystals in a gun]"
4/30/2008,"i will not be speaking on behalf of goonswarm and do not claim to, nor do any of our official reps. i will dispel rumors towards goonswarm when asked for me however.next time i will try to dumb myself down for you and post a bunch of image macros with cute animals on them, maybe that will increase my levels of support.the reason that i am ignored on gf.com is pretty much entirely due to bandwagoning.do you have evidence of this or are you going to spew more ad hominem?"
4/30/2008,"then you fundamentally do not understand how goonswarm operates. and this misunderstanding is what drives a lot of the funny that we see in the game. vile rat could have said anything and this would have been o.k. with the leadership and the people. because as an alliance we don't care what you think, and if what you think is wrong and funny, more the better.it is in the strictest of terms, otherwise there is no ""game over"" for the other player as there is in any other competitive game. this is very good for the game, but as an alliance it has much deeper meanings with regards to how you can win even temporarily. the short answer is ""you will win when you log on"" and so the most important aspect of fighting another alliance and tacking their space is making sure that you will log on, and they will not."
4/30/2008,"you sir, are one deluded man. i wanted to come up with something retortive, but your statement says all.clearly the typhoon & domi is overpowered"
4/30/2008,"were overpowered. were. back right after rev 1 when the istab boost came in. back when phoons and domis were going 3-5kms in tight orbits with stacks of heavy nos and tonnes of dps?yea, they were terribly and utterly broken and they got nerfed[quite a bit actually]"
4/30/2008,"how much dps? i don't exactly recall the nano-phoon and -domi being dps boats, when they were ""overpowered"".in fact, if someone brought a rapier/huginn with them, they were completely useless.they were flying bricks, if you managed to web them.leave alone the fact that you needed to fit them with rigs, likely snakes and faction mwd's if they should be worth anything. or pure skill-requirements in order to do dps. phoon is one of the most skill intensive ships in the game at present, if you wanna fly it right. that has always been true, the nano-time it had was no different. i mean, even now, if you want to do respectable dps, you need a lot of skills. imagine how little dps it would do with <U+FFFD> of the damage being reallocated to nos."
4/30/2008,"they were doing 500-600 dps in a full 3-5km/s oribt with 4 heavy nos running. pretty broken.ed: also they were not much more expensive than any other battleship at the time[everyone needed rigs to be competitive], not that isk is a reason to make things overpowered. but their ability to disengage and to move at such speed was clearly broken.i don't really want to get into an argument onto whether or not the battleships that could go faster than interceptor with better than cruiser agility were overpowered or not, if you want to get into it, you should go check out the threads where ryysa[who was flying 5km/s + phoons and nightmares at the time] pretty much wailed on everyone supporting the other side.ac's make up and made up less than 1/3rd of the dps that a typhoon puts out."
4/30/2008,"coming from a pilot who used to fly one, no you didn't need snakes. also from what i remember there was a rig that was deleted that added to the mwd bonus ability. the problem is that nos and neuts are damage (considering they weren't nerfed at this time), domi did around 400-500 damage with drones while nosing his enemy to feed its own cap hungry mwd. a huggin or rapier will not stop this ship alone it is a flying brick yes, but that is a benefit as webs won't effect it as much as smaller ships. it will cause him to flee and find an easier target. you did not need alot of isk to build one either, a decent amount, but considering the payout in terms of survivability, definetly cheaper then the old dble repped nosdomi. (keep in mind not a comparison of price, but a comparison of survivablity) a good pilot who keeps his eye on local will never loose it.did it need to be nerfed, coming from a pilot who just happened to have all the skills needed to fit this style of domi and flew it regularly, yes. also please don't include implants as a price for the ship, if the ship dies they still are imbedded into your skull so you didn't loose them....yet. only thing you lost was a ship worth about 200-500 mil depending if you used a faction mwd. not a huge loss, especially if you keep an eye on local the ship will more then paid for itself by tenfold.truthfully it doesn't really matter, the point is they were overpowered and as such they were put in there place."
4/30/2008,"well, i'm not saying that they weren't overpowered. having flown with rysa, and seen his nightmare, it was just sick.but they could still be countered. it just comes down to player skills. everything does. the nano-bs stuff was just easier for people to learn to use properly.but the istab change that came with rev 1 was broken. i still fail to understand why they made that change in the first place.and yes, there was a rig which gave a mwd bonus. it was eventually removed and replace with auxillary thrusters, for those who had them.i flew the nano-phoon once or twice. i didn't like it that much. sure, you can do some decent dps(by no means awesome dps, my deimos can do the same, though it doesn't reach the same speed, it's a lot more agile.but the nano-phoon did about the same dps as 1-1<U+FFFD> t1 cruisers. so seriously, id didn't do tonnes of dps. my rokh does tonnes of dps, but it doesn't go fast.so the point is that the nano-phoon/domi did too manyt hings at once. if you wanna fit your lows with nano, fine, you will just suck at everything else. and that wasn't the case with them pre-nerf."

4/30/2008,"how much dps did the phoon do? my thorax does between 400 and 500, gank/plate fitted. that is pretty much how the phoon works too."
4/30/2008,funny you should mention that.
4/30/2008,"how much dps did the phoon do? my thorax does between 400 and 500, gank/plate fitted. that is pretty much how the phoon works too.off base calculations. this is of course using eft (an older version, unfortunatly not the one pre nerf but close to it, torps didn't get a boost yet) so damage will not be accurate due to figureing out dps on eft is imo redundant. also i will call this my frakaphoon, as i have no idea how it works and am going off how i would throw it together if i were to nano one back in these days. also not sure if my nos/neut dps i calculate is correct so if someone would like to correct me, please do.dps using 2 arbalest torps with 5x heavy ogre ii's comes out to 410 dps, no not as much as your thorax, but like i said nos/neuts is dps. not knowing this ship and how it was fitted on this part makes it difficult so i will guess on a fitting for nos/neut in which it works and is fairly cap stable. 4x heavy dim nos 1x heavy unstable = 1080 cap drained every 24/s, or for easy comparison on a repper 540 cap every 12/s, a large and med repper take 560 energy every 12 secs (i say roughly due to skill...which really doesn't help that much). now turning cap dps into dps, this is tricky. for this i added armor rep repaired of a large and med, then divided by 12 (representing 12 seconds). comes out to 93. not perfect nos/neut dps due to this combo not completely sinking with med/large rep (560 doesn't equal 540) and seems like a pathetic number, but there is a huge portion that is missed from this. this is pure dps as cap doesn't have resistence.so you have 410dps unresisted damage(eft is not a good source for gaining dps imo) and 90ish worth of pure dps.now looking at the thorax. 400-500 dps is unresisted so they are about the same unresisted dps but 90ish worth of pure dps is a nice amount when compared to unresisted dps. for this i use a basic omni tank with base resist around 50 (rax doesn't do em so we'll use other resist for such comparison). raw dps of said thorax will be around 200-250. raw dps of said frankenstein phoon i threw together, around 295 dps roughly. yes simular but i'd rather fly this phoon then the die mosts little brother. chance of surviving and killing the target in the phoon 100% as long as you watch local, chance to survive and kill in thorax going against what this phoon can take on odds may very, but obviously not a good idea to pick a fight with a blasterthron, which the phoon could do and win easily.100% is derived from no one entering local. this can kill anything bs and smaller, recons will probably be the only thing that would give you a problem.is my frakaphoon better then a rax, for solo yes, gang no."
4/30/2008,"1. my inty (crow) goes 6393m/s i doubt loosing 4% (255.72m/s) is going to get me killed. i don't aggree with it because it is a nerf to blaster boats moving from target to target and simply nowing how much damage a blaster boat does when it gets into range will do obviously get them primaried for webification. imo asside from gate camping/station camping this would be the end of blasterboats as a raven or a gankgeddon would be more viable to fly in bs, zealot would obsolete diemos in hacs if this was implented. thats just my view though. not to say that it would happen, but i still speculate on it.2. aggreed3. aggreed, amarr are fine, save for the apoc that needs that opt range bonus reduced."
4/30/2008,"i'm mostly just curious about this:a) what do you think about the 10% less cap use / level bonus on amarr ships? balanced? waste of bonus and should be replaced with something different? raise to 15% or 20% or decrease to 5? etc.b) do you think the omen is balanced with other cruisers of its teir / other t1 combat cruisers?c) you mentioned that you think there should be a role for everything. do afterburners have a significant enough role, especially with regards to pvp?thanks(p.s. i actually liked your reworking of webs)"
4/30/2008,"i am sorry, are you going to make an argument as to why that is or are you just going to post some of the things that i have posted out of context? also no, i would not make gang bonuses only distribute via the squad command position and no, not make all afs gang bonus producing ships. but you would have had to read those threads to understand what was going on.and, had you you read the introduction to the thread you quotedwhich was also before any of the amarr changes bar the khanid ones.there is nothing wrong with signature radius webs. if you would like to provide a reason why, i would love to hear it. hell, that thread is still open, you can post in it."
4/30/2008,"i didn't know it was possible to take an entire thread out of context. but basically here's my point, you don't know the first thing about this game or game balance. and despite this you seem to think that anything that comes into your head is a golden idea worthy of immediate implementation. you're the worst kind of idiot, the one who thinks he knows things.and the reason i'm posting here is so that everyone else knows exactly how awful you are."
4/30/2008,"the 10% cap bonus is easily justified on the battleships where the range advantage really means something[because the range advantage is high, and ships are slow]. cruiser sized and below it is not very valuable but you can engineer around that[as can be seen in the case of the harbingers ""mysterious"" extra 1000 armor points]currently the omen is about balanced, and possibly the best dps cruiser due to the nano-craze. despite its low peak dps and terrible ehp its the only cruiser with the ability to really hit fast cruiser sized ships since its the only one that doesn't need a range bonus to be effective against them. this makes it better by default when nothing else is hitting that far. it would not be overpowered with a bit more powergridno, i don't believe they do. which is one of the reasons i proposed changing webs, though abs may need a flat boost as well. abs should be useful in avoiding damage and they currently aren't. this ought to be fixed."
4/30/2008,"so you aren't going to make any argument?you didn't take an entire thread out of context, you took snippets, made it look like the entire thread, and lied about them. i do not think that anything that comes into my head is a golden idea, but i do think the ones i post have merit. your posting here isn't really hurting me as far as i can tell. you've no argument and are just attacking me. i think most of the people who play this game are smart enough to not fall for such cheap tricks."
4/30/2008,"so your point is that the statements were approved of by the goons because they were false and a joke. i'm sorry, but if your alliance openly allows and encourages false public statements about their motives, then you have to accept and live with whatever perceptions are brought about as a result of those statements. once again, if your alliance chooses not to control what information it's members put out, then it is responsible for that information, just as much as if it had directly instructed the statement. from this, the goons have no one to blame but themselves for their public image. if they allow anything to be said and encourage lies, they should not be shocked or surprised to find that they are then judged by those lies. the goons also have no right to later return and pick and choose which statements are true and which are false. the time to stop the lies and put an end to rumor is when they first come to light, not months or years later, as by then the damage has been done. when you've neglected your housekeeping, you can't just sweep everything under the carpet once it become inconvenient. if you've allowed the record to become what it is, without protest, then you have given approval and acceptance of the record as fact.also, why should anyone trust a representative from an organization that encourages and advocates lies? why should anyone vote for a representative who does not care what others think? this is where the central philosophy of the goons disqualifies them as viable representatives, as the ideals directly contradict the duties of the position.in other words, your answer is that the goons do in fact believe it a good thing when their opponents quit the game. thank you for confirming my point. frankly, i find this view in direct contradiction with what is best for the future of the game. i find it disturbing that those who hold such a view want to be on a council designed to improve the game, when their goals for endgame dictate its destruction."
4/30/2008,"you are mistaking understanding of how the game is played and won with a wish to hurt others.only if you believe that we act as a monolithic entity and have no wish to play a fun game. both of these things are not true, we are not monolithic and do like to have fun. if anything waterfowl should have convinced you that we are indeed not monolithic."
4/30/2008,"a goonswarm member running for csm that has almost no pvp experience, let alone experience flying t2 ships.my vote will be going elsewhere."
4/30/2008,"my argument is that you don't have a clue how to balance a game and my supporting evidence is everything you've ever posted. all i'm hoping is that people are smart enough to decide that someone who writes their general treatise of eve online and then includes such gems as an explanation of game theory which is never referenced because it's completely worthless.and as to whether i lied, anyone can go to the links i posted and see for themselves exactly what i paraphrased. if you feel that those posts don't show you as a complete idiot then clearly you wouldn't need to defend them. the fact that you cannot seem to not respond to my posts indicates to me (and to the reader) that you are defensive about your past record on 'balance'."
4/30/2008,"no, i simply give everyone their fair shake, even you.ed: but i will correct misunderstandings of them."
4/30/2008,goumindong doesn't get enough credit for his ideas (probably because they're not always easy to understand). the webifier idea in particular is very good.people doubting is motives are also probably not aware that he's been posting since way before the csm thing was announced.
4/30/2008,"i have no trouble believeing goumindong's motives. it surprised me more, after reading rather a lot of his posts on shc, that he was a member of goonswarm."
4/30/2008,"nah i'm not refering to you, but rather to that guy who thinks goum is running for csm to ruin eve because he's a goon"
4/30/2008,"no, for me it's about your idea of how the game is won being in direct conflict with what is best for the good of the game. you (as an individual or a group) intend to ""win"" the game. ""winning"" for you means that other players quit playing. a reduced playerbase harms the game as a whole. do you see the contradiction, and can you understand why some would be concerned with someone who holds that view having anything to do with the future improvement of the game?as to the other idea you mention, i don't think i actually believe that goons directly intend hurt or harm to other individuals. i think they actually just don't care how what they do impacts others, it's complete lack of concern and total apathy. in some ways, i find this even more disturbing. at the very least, it's not a healthy mindset for a community-based game.you are a group who associates under one banner. anything said or done by a member displaying that banner has the potential to be taken as a statement representing the group. this has nothing to do with how you are organized internally, but rather it's just how things work. the fact that you as a group do nothing to discourage any of these statements indicates to the minds of outsiders that they are in fact approved and endorsed statements. if there is no official word contradicting an individual's statements, then the unofficial word will be taken as official. welcome to life. the fact that you as a group have not felt it necessary to control such statements because, as you put it, you do not care what others think, means that you have no place to now disagree with or dispute the reputation you have allowed to be created for yourselves. but that reputation should not matter, since you don't care what others think.except that now that you and others of your alliance need the favor and support of other players, suddenly you do care what they think. you want them to forget what was said and done before, and believe that your reputation was falsely earned, even though you never bothered to try to disprove it before. do you see why there is a problem here? the only time you care about anyone besides yourself is when you need them. which means that the moment you don't, you're off doing your own thing again.if you don't care what others think, than you won't be representing anyone besides yourself on the csm. if you do care, then you should have done something about your reputation before, when you had nothing to gain from it but the respect of others. as with so many politicians, the goons' careless past has come back to haunt them, now that they have goals and aspirations requiring the respect and support of others. it's a little late in the game to be changing uniforms, everyone already knows what side you're playing on."
4/30/2008,"just like economics, belief or disbelief in something doesn't matter. it only matters whats true. you might want someone who deludes themselves as to the nature of eve and how you play and win, but i don't. and i won't be the person to do that.true, when people don't understand the group. if i can't convince you that your perceptions are wrong about the group, then there isn't much i can do on the front and i guess you will just have to believe that we are both monolithic entity as well as one that isn't[given that these are both statements given by people who wear the banner]"
4/30/2008,"then as already asserted, you and i are playing two very different games, as what we have here is a fundamental difference on what the truth actually is. what i see as true is that your idea of truth is not the heart of the game at all, but in actuality the pursuit of your ""truth"" is a method of the game's destruction.consider what the goals of your truth mean if pursued to their ultimate end. one faction wins by forcing everyone else out of the game. that faction, then having no one else to fight, turns on itself, splintering into smaller factions who then fight against each other until there is only one left. the process repeats itself through many iterations until you are left with only two players. once one of those players quits, the other has won. this ""winning"" player is now left alone in an empty world, and nothing else to do, so he too quits. (tangential philosophical question: has this player then won, or has he actually lost, as he has quit?) the game is no longer sustainable and is now over.now, i don't believe for a moment that this outcome is truly possible. but the fact remains that this is your end goal, given your idea of what constitutes winning. what you see as winning would lead to the inevitable destruction of the game. how is that supposed to make you qualified to serve as part of an organization whose goals are the continuation and improvement of the game, an organization whose goals are in direct contradiction to your own? why should anyone believe that you would not abuse such a position to serve your own goals of ""winning""?"
4/30/2008,"reposting my post from this thread.i'm against any 3rd party program that gives a significant advantage to its users compared to those that do not use the program. it basically forces people to use the program if they want to participate in the top levels of the game.i know what happens if noone *****s down on this stuff, in ultima online it was compulsory to use programs that spammed movement requests to the server or make the client tick faster and thus send more movement commands, so your character would always run faster than those without the program. if you wished to participate in pvp, you had to have one of these programs. the staff never undertook action against those using the program, so it got completely out of hand, and now almost every pvper there is using this trash. we don't want those situations to arise in eve, thus for the good of all, the bacon program and similar utilities must be blacklisted.i understand that scrolling through the local channel isn't really a nice mechanic either, but if you want changes to the interface and feedback, then suggest them, so they become available for everyone when they are officialy implemented."
4/30/2008,"there was a thread on this topic to which i responded with my views. in a sense, there are no locks that cannot be picked with regard to encryption of data. hacking tools can search for the encryption key and apply it, thereby giving the user a workaround that would allow the use of bacon once again. so, there is no perfect solution, but there at least *is* a solution that makes it harder for unwanted access to sensitive log files.there are larger issues here, but in my opinion, overall, this bacon issue is a primary example of ""democracy in action"". csm is going to rely heavily on players bringing important issues to our attention, and articulating the justification for the alarm."
4/30/2008,"i responded to this same question posed by an eve-tribune interviewer, my answer below:one thing i should mention is that, at the time i wrote this, i was not aware that bacon makes a warning sound before a person even appears in local. that makes the problem much more imminent, since at that point bacon becomes a gameplay enhancing program not duplicable with the ""non-maximized browser"" technique mentioned in the quote above."
4/30/2008,"in principle, i disagree with this statement wholeheartedly. the term ""significant advantage"" is vague and unspecific. eve players need to be free to use programs that enhance the enjoyment of the game, and even provide a tactical advantage.the line should be drawn when 3rd psrty software manipulates the data stream, accessing data that is not intended for the players' use or interferes with the ""normal"" operations of the game."
4/30/2008,"there's 2 kinds of programs:1. things which automates certain things, depending on in game events2. things which provide you information, based on other meansbacon falls in under the first category. and i agree, it shouldn't be allowed.but the secondary kind of third party application isn't problematic. you can easily argue that it can give a significant advantage to some people. but you have to be smart in order to use the information properly.i'm sorry, but the smartest person will always have an advantage. and i think that eve should take darwin's ideas about the survival of the fittest, to an even higher degree."
4/30/2008,"xeno at eve-tribune asked a similar question with responses from many candidates.my position on bacon is pretty clear:i do not support the specific implementation of the bacon functionality, that gives individual/groups of players an advantage in use of the game-client for playing eve. (another case in point: beetracker)i fully support tool development initiatives that push ccp to address shortcomings in eve's user interface (ie. sound notifications),a tool as powerful as bacon should be in the game-client or not available. all players or no players. particularly considering <20% of players read the forums, so would not be aware of it's existence.the question of relevance of notification of people in local is up for debate; and it the larger debate of ""showing people in local."""
4/30/2008,"i can't link to the post any more, it's gone... bacon had 1 thing over the rest of the monitoring programs, it was made available to everyone... the private monitoring programs are a bigger problem...will any of you try to get ccp to admit how long they have known about the monitoring programs and why they only made the commitment to put a stop to them when the public was made aware that they existed?/me removes tin foil hat now"
4/30/2008,"what are all the candidates opinions on these parts of the game?i believe all three in there current form are helping to kill eve, in todays game we are starting to see fleets with more cap ships than any other type of ship, and along with cyno jammers in the near future big alliances that can field 150 cap ships anytime of day, how can any other alliance hope of being able to take down cyno jammed systems?and why is it that people who spam more pos's get sov of that system, why not introduce a new type of pos or structure, which claims sov in the system it is anchored, now only one of these pos's can be put in any one system at a time, so if alliance a holds sov in a system, alliance b only has to kill one pos and replace it with there sov gaining pos to gain sov over the system. this would decrease pos spam but there would be still roles for the old pos's such as mining and forward bases for ships to base from when assaulting systems.also with the introduction of jump bridges, it makes moving around 0.0 nearly risk free, 0.0 with all the above mechanics affecting it is become so easy to control for any competent alliance, and only encourages the need to form the biggest blob possible to get results. small scale pvp is dying and large scale pvp is just a giant lagfest with luck deciding thewinner most times, isnt time for these issues to be looked at and changed before its to late.what do the candidates think?"
4/30/2008,"i think jade's take and ideas on the whole subject, is completely right. we need a more dynamic eve, in terms of pvp. cyno jammers isn't helping this."
4/30/2008,"i havnt had time to read all of jades thoughts as of yet, i do agree that cyno jammers are realy affecting pvp at this time, so many people are uses masses of cap ships but only when hid behind the jammers, being any non-cap fleet that enters the system is at a massive disadvantage usualy resulting in no engagements due to the massive odds stacked against them and having limted resources to fight back."
4/30/2008,"these issues are a central matter in my csm manifesto 5h4dy, i agree with you, the current issues in 0.0 warfare going wrong come down directly to sovereignty from pos/cyno jammers/jump bridges and the impact they have on actual play. 1. sovereignty does need to change from being generated from the pos structure. we need a better mechanic that doesnt force all sides to assemble at a pre-arranged time where its all about the uber blob  we need these battles to have initiative and uncertainty and far my dynamism incorporated in the conflict.ccp's prototype ""gate control"" for sovereignty proposal though rough and needful for more functional detail is 1000x better than the current pos/sovereignty mechanic in my opinion.2. i agree completely about jump bridges too, they make 0.0 logistics much too easy for sovereignty 3 holders (and since sovereignty 3 is way too easy to get in and of itself  and ludicrously difficult to contest after the event) this is a real issue. before jump bridges it was possible to interdict a 0.0 empire by hitting their logistics and transport assets, now its just become a matter of watching invulnerable ships warping between pos shields. other issue of course is the ubiquitous jump bridge hot drop wherein the defender gets to blob at a central location and near instantly appear at any other bridge in reaction to invasion/raids. again its a blob-creator, it makes it too easy to focus too many ships in too few engagements and yes, its hurting the game. largescale nano-use in 0.0 is a direct consequence of this. jump bridge spam will become less of an issue if we get a proper sovereignty mechanic though. if it actually takes effort to generate and maintain sovereignty 3 (as in you can keep it by patrolling and fighting in your core node systems) then its less of a problem. where its really abusive at the moment is in dozens of afk pos only systems in the full knowledge that attacks physically cannot threaten the status quo in a significantly-urgent timescale.3. cyno-jammers are terrible. way too easy to put up, mindless in operation, impossible to scale for balance (might well be possible for 150 tech2 battleships to bring down but is that really what ccp want as the entry bar for territorial warfare in 0.0?). they also make the destruction of capital ships much rarer than it should be. promoting environments where only one side have cap ships in the initial engagements leads to more polarized (we massively outblob or we dont fight gameplay decisions). without the jammers people would be committed greater numbers of cap ships to more uncertain fights and incidence of capital ship loss would increase. this would go some way to addressing the problem of steadily increasing capital arms race in 0.0  from a game health perspective we need to be advocating changes that actually get those uber empires to commit their cap ships to open space battles with a significant risk of loss to achieve objectives. ***but yes, lavistas right, its pretty much my ideal campaign issue this and plays directly into my manifesto, please do have a read and let me know what you think.csm manifesto 2008"
4/30/2008,"in general, killing a well-equipped cyno jammer pos is too difficult, and i honestly have absolutely no taste for pos demoltion or most large-scale fleet operations at all (don't let the corp ticker fool you). i posted some ideas for how to make attacking a little easier here, some ideas i have pasted in this thread below.most of my brainstorming has been related to keeping the current pos-based sovereignty system, but making it more palatable overall. i like the idea of ditching pos entirely when it comes to sovereignty, but i'm not feeling it 100% with the whole gate control system, though it'd be an improvement.but even if sovereignty was not determined by starbase counts, cyno jammer pos would still be too difficult to attack."
4/30/2008,"i should have run on a single issue campaign myself over this, but too late now :psince i already gave jade a hard time over it, to be fair to everyone, i have a solution to said problem of cyno jammers and pos which is detailed here, and i'd be interested in knowing what other candidates felt about it."
4/30/2008,"i've been thinking about a solution to the cynosural field generator problem. one of thesolutions i thought of would be to add a fuel requirement for it (something moderate, not too large, not too small), as well as reducing its armor hit-points to something more manageable, such as 1million rather than 15million. another idea would be to require sovereignty 4 before being able to anchor it. yes, this would wreck havoc in some systems, but things need a little shaking up imo. and that is just my opinion, don't be hating"
4/30/2008,"personally i'd like to see ideas more along the lines of what ccp has already suggested: shifting the territory control mechanism to the stargates.in fact i'd go so far as to say: forget the artificial mechanic of sovereignty through pos deployment. instead let players capture stargates, gaining more and more advantages as their stargate network within a constellation/region grows, leading to a de facto sovereignty rather than one imposed by an arbitrary measure like pos deployment.individual system sovereignty based on pos deployment will always inevitably lead to massive single battles to determine control. but spreading that conflict across all the stargates in a region, and granting benefits based on the sum of stargates that you control leads to a decentralized ongoing conflict. more small fights, all the time, across a whole constellation/region.cynojammers could still exist, but they wouldn't be so overpowering because territory control wouldn't hinge on the ability to deploy capital ships, although capital ships would still be powerful weapons and excellent mobile bases that aid in dominating a system.with a stargate network of a certain size, jump bridge technology could be shifted to the gates themselves - if you control enough stargates in a region you gain the ability to travel quickly from one controlled stargate to another - unless the destination system is cynojammed.information warfare can also become part of the benefit of a stargate network - allowing controlling alliances to see who has been using their stargates, or sounding alarms when enemies jump through them.all that's left is to come up with the method for gaining control of stargates."
4/30/2008,"i see a disturbing pvp meentality amongst the candidates. so as a player who prefers, what i find to be, the more relaxing life of the solo mission runner, do you consider pve a vaiable portion of the gmae or do you wish to see all players forced into pvp regardless of their preferences?"
4/30/2008,"i don't think that the people who draw their enjoyment from pvp and 0.0 politics necessarily believe that pve is worthless or would ever really wish to see players forced into 0.0-style pvp. i appreciate the current situation, in fact, for a number of reasons:- i've owned my own missioning characters in the past, and i've appreciated the chance to do something different from time to time. i also agree that it's more relaxing than running a 150-man fleet, that's something nobody will deny. ;)- alliance logistics are founded on 0.0 freightering, and i think it'd take a very nuanced suggestion indeed to extend nonconsensual pvp to empire without putting that at risk. while i've seen no such nuanced suggestion, i think the more important point is that the sanctity of ""secure space"" is something that even 0.0 alliances rely upon, and removing that would make logistics really horrible for groups like graypert.- to some limited extent, every player that leaves the safety of a station is already ""forced into pvp"", in that it's possible for them to die no matter where they go. i think that's about as far as it needs to go."
4/30/2008,"while goumindong is a truly horrible candidate from goonswarm, daveydweeb is only a moderately bad one. vote for daveydweeb i guess."
4/30/2008,hell yes.
4/30/2008,"since the csm application process said that you can even create a brand new character in order to run for csm, i seriously doubt ccp would ever do that (expose any alts you might have), and i doubt they would ever certify that all ""alt"" characters belong to the same real person.on the flipside, they will be publishing your real name, picture and so on and so forth.sounds weird ? maybe it is. but that's how things are.feel free to not vote for candidates that refuse to post all alts, feel free to believe all alts a person has are the ones he listed, feel free to do anything like that... but never expect ccp to tell you ""character xxx is owned by abc, and so are characters yyy, zzz, etc"""
4/30/2008,"lies, i have met lilan khan before! also, you forgot dianabolic."
4/30/2008,"i think its relavant. it goes towards a candidate's trustworthyness of a candidate. i too have no wish to unknowingly vote for some well known scammer's alt character. if someone is willing to scam friends, noobs or whoever, out of thier assets.. even if it is a ""part of the game"", i would not trust them to do anything they promise to do in rl either. this includes any platforms or issues they are promising to support/push as part of thier job as csms. that said, i doubt ccp would do this, especially for those who choose not to.however, i think an acceptable compromise might be for csm candidates to voluntarily divulge the information and ask ccp to confirm thier authenticity. this way, you can choose not to, but if you do, we know that you're not bsing the voters. bsing and scamming may be part of the game, but if this csm thing is really an out of game process, then that argument is moot too."
4/30/2008,would you care to elaborate as to why they're irrelevant?
4/30/2008,"i too was wondering exactly about this.no offence to ss, i know you are a good guy. it's exactly relevant. with the rumors that you are a bobbit, people wants to know.i would expect no less myself, if i had a character in a large alliance."
4/30/2008,"you either have an account that allows 4 characters, or 2 accounts of which one doesnt have all slots used:-)huh, thats really cool .. compared to you my alts have really clean records.respect for this outing mate. all the best for your campaign.i am a defender of private rights in rl, a fighter for freedom and anti-cesonsorshipits hard for me to abadon my principles.however, anyone who wants to ensure non of my hauler or cynoalts has scammed themis asked to contact me directly in game to learn about my alts.this is imo a reasonable compromise which of course bears the risk that this person could go to forum next day and just publish that data w/o my permission. but at least by doing soi learn something of the character of a person ;)honorps: i hereby confess to be a hetero paganist with buddhistic influence"
4/30/2008,"no, ccp will not be releasing any further information about the candidates beyond what has been released to this date."
4/30/2008,i don't have any alts (noobie ^^)
4/30/2008,"edited for legibility and clarityok, i'm going to try fit it into one post, wish me luck .. a bit simplified however ..imo the information is irrelevant becauseccp have performed due diligence""ccp have already done due diligence in checking rl identity, passport and location data, and ensured candidates have a clean record to run."" as per jades statement.it won't improve the csmreleasing alts will not improve any voters ability to a good choice as to any candidates ability to perform the duties as csm. a good choice imo is one determined by a candidates ability to:- understand the mechanics of the eve-online universe- understand the underlying vision for the eve-online universe- understand the aspirations and concerns of the player base- understand how the mechanics of the eve universe can be balanced/exploited- filter and identify important issues or developments from 1000's of ideas- objectively describe the pros and cons of issues raised by the player base- constructively debate the issues within the csm- communicate ccp's response to the player base- identify from experience ways to improve the csm mechanisms for future candidates.the information available to assess candidates under the current csm rules is:- reveal the persons rl name. hi i'm shayne smart.- the name of the candidate character. hi i'm serenity steele, alt of shayne smart.given the requests are now - show alternative character names = all alternative characters names of shayne smart- show across all accounts = all accounts that are registered to the credit card, address, email address of shayne smart- enable candidates to post their alts and have ccp verify.these requests can:- at best, give voters a false sense of security: since candidate accounts paid for by gtc, accounts under a different name will not show. since candidates are capable of changing their subscription details in a matter of minutes, thereby making it effectively voluntary anyway. optional posting and verification by ccp can be gamed in exactly the same way.- at worst, cloud a voters ability to make a good choice. by irrelevant entertainment. council members who have been elected will need all their experience to so by showing their actions, answers to these posts and first hand communication in-game to really show the best they can do. there is already a social control in place revealign peoples rl names that means they have a rl impact on their jobs/life/future if they are deliberately malicious. there is a committee control in place (9 csm members and ccp's ultimate say) to reduce influence of any deliberately malicious people. that leaves potential of a lot of prejudice, entertaintment and tin foil hattery; the last 2 are fun for sure, however irrelevant to getting eve a good csm."
4/30/2008,"serenity, i do not disagree with you.but you know, just as well as i, that people do care about ingame politics in regards to the election.some people don't want to vote for goons, some don't want to vote for bob.so while i agree with what you are saying, those things are not really what people are looking for. people just have prejudice towards certain alliances."
4/30/2008,"ben is my pvp main, and amuenet is a support character of mine, also in axe.my other four characters are my mission runner and three market checkers/t1 hauler alts/cyno alts. their identities are known in select circles but i'd prefer not to reveal them publically at this stage, if nothing else just so i can still have time to myself in-game once the campaign is over./ben"
4/30/2008,"thanks, i forgot to mention the word prejudice. edited it in"
4/30/2008,"leandro salazar and tinian singh are my main characters, both combat pilots, one for mainly battleships and pve, the other for t2 frigs and cruisers and pvp.gabriel salazar is also mine, but hes only a ceo char keeping my old corp alive.the other three are market, industry and research alts in n00bcorps and their names are none of anyones business."

4/30/2008,"i wouldn't vote for anyone on the candidate list that hasn't even bothered to enter a proper motivation there, and those that haven't been on the forums for weeks, if at all.even the candidates that some express doubts towards put some effort in their campaign, and at least they have standpoints and participate in discussion. that can't be said of over half the candidates in the list."
4/30/2008,"personally i would not vote for any goon. whatever their true motivations might be, i am fairly sure they don't have anything to do with the good of eve. quite the opposite if you ask me."
4/30/2008,if you have serious issues with play time then how on earth do you expect to commit the time neccesary in order to be a valid csm canidate?
4/30/2008,i would not vote for:-any goons-members of any large alliance-pure pvp players-roleplayers (not a definite no but unlikely unless they recognise not everyone wants to roleplay)-anyone with little or no campaign information
4/30/2008,"wow, that is a bold statement. kudos for actually posting that.but i do wonder, where does that leave you in terms of possible candidates? i mean, even i could be in a major alliance(i'm not btw), but that doesn't mean i'm a bad person, nor represent my alliance."
4/30/2008,"well, small alliances are fine as are small corps, npc corps, etc.i just wouldn't vote for any bob/ra/goon/northern alliance/any other large alliance as, even if they say they won't, they will have their own interests, which is something that, in my opinion, people shouldn't have if they want to be on the csm."
4/30/2008,"i wouldn't vote for someone whose names i can't spell, and i wouldn't for for someone who thinks the tempest is fine as it is (because it isn't)."
4/30/2008,"ditto... actually, i am looking forward to seeing the face of ""the real"" jade constantine... whose alliance is kos to my corp. seriousy, though... you can search for all comments posted by any of us. any candidate who resorted to name calling and personal attacks on the forums has the potential to make our days together extremely long indeed."
4/30/2008,"fixing the lofty scam is one of the core issues of my campaign.why? because this is an mmo, and in an mmo you should be able to team up with others without such an extreme risk of them destroying your assets. it bothers me a lot that i cannot go help noobs, because most of the time, the people asking for help just want to gank your ship.possible fix would be a 30 second delay after a war target enters gang before neutrals become a viable war target, unless they activate modules, so they have time to leave the gang."
4/30/2008,"it is a long time since i used this tactic (against farmers), and i do not believe that members of the gang gets a warning message if they are in the gang. iirc only the person that does inviting (not the self invite) those to the gang gets the warning message.though i think it is a step in the right direction when it comes to this tactic."
4/30/2008,"its easy to fixif the wardeced member joins make a popup stating it and if you decline either cant join or you are dropped from the gang, no agression takes place"
4/30/2008,"simple solution, however, this would have to be limited to only work in highsec, or it will be a pain in the butt for real pvp in 0.0, where you often have gangs where different players are in different wars etc :)"
4/30/2008,"simplest solution is to just allow unlimited pew pew between gang members. no more false sense of security, no more accidents with concord in gangs in empire.and maybe a way to paste your location into chats so people can warp to it without being in your gang."
4/30/2008,wrong.people in your gang that are not actively at war cannot shoot until (key word: until) they have been shot.so if your war targets are paying attention it does absolutely no good to you.
4/30/2008,easy solution. if you don't trust them then you form the gang and invite them. then they can't invite their wardecced friend.
4/30/2008,"please no more popups!!!!i know you are all aspiring beaurocrats but theres already too many popups in the game. people turn them off because popups get you killed more than anything else. and it's really annoying after clearing cache to have to turn them all off again.if you want to do anything to this feature, then change the whole way that agression and wardecs work in highsec. you all state you don't want to change anything, but it's hardly the only feature about agression and wardecs that doesn't work. another one would be repping someone in a wardec which does not flag up as an act of agression (in terms of concording) but rather just gives the other side an oppurtunity to shoot you. also, the flagging of agression doesn't always show up clearly.simple solution would be shooting someone in a wardec does not cause gang aggression.please all your applicants remove popups don't tell ccp we want more!"
4/30/2008,wrong. go read the step by step instructions again and you might see what you missed.
4/30/2008,"this is an mmo and as such has a right to be different from other mmo's. are you also suggesting that corp members should not be able to shoot each other freely? part of the wonder of eve is having to work out for yourself who you can trust and indeed always having the option of betraying this trust. while the lofty scam is a questionable mechanic, one that i have no problem with but would have no real issue with should it be removed, it is your attitude in general that concerns me. i am not sure you are even playing the right mmo, and much less sure that you are in a position to represent it. or have i misunderstood?"
4/30/2008,"okay, the obvious ""fix"" is adding a little check box to the options screen that says ""automatically leave fleet if anyone is at war with it."" (and having the client configured to auto leave fleet if anybody from a corporation/alliance at war joins).mission-runners and people just looking for company and cooperation running hisec missions wouldn't have to be paranoid about gang invites and joining up with others. pvp'ers and war-fighters could just leave it unchecked and not have their gameplay hindered.***thats the ""fix"". the deeper issue is whether we actually want that fix because eve is supposed to be a brutal and dark game of betrayal and intrigue and trust and reputation. its a trick that plays on credibility and scams people into doing something dangerous with people they don't really know. maybe this is actually a lesson that eve should be teaching? i mean eve market's itself on being a grim environment - and we all know enough in reality that we probably shouldn't be walking down dark alleys on the bad side of town with people we don't know who want to show us ""something special."" on balance though i'm persuaded that the nature of this ""scam"" - waiting until the mark is in warp before inviting a war-flagged patsy into gang does deserve some counter-measure because there always should be an option of escape. + eve is a social game as well, and i think a scam like this can damage that if nobody can ever trust anybody to team up with and do missions. i remember my own first few weeks in eve and meeting random people while out shooting serpentis in fountain region and ganging up with strangers to enjoy the game with. it felt good, felt social, helped demonstrate that not everyone in eve is a murderous bad-guy out to get you. so on balance and on the grounds that i wouldn't like to see all ad-hoc gang invites from ""friendly"" mission running contacts being viewed with cyncism and distrust, i'd be in-favour of the ""fix"" above and sorting out this problem. if the scammers could talk the victim into unchecking the ""auto leave war-flagged gang"" option ... lol tbh, in that case i'd have much less sympathy."
4/30/2008,"hmm ok, let me out that idea in the form of the op so that you understand it.scammer asks for help completing a mission.invites mark to gang (where the mark gets the warning if there is anyone currently in the gang that has an active war dec.).mark in warp inbound, scammer invites a war target to gang.everyone in the gang gets a warning (visual or that annoying popup)the mark then has a choice ofstay in the gangleave the gang asapmark now a viable war target for nearby at-war gankersmark's pve fitted ship destroyed quicklyexpensive faction modules looted and soldand the question of the op is:at the first question i say that i dont want to change it (my own personal opinion). and i desided to awnser the second one regardless of my personal view, with an idea that may or may not work.i am still wrong or is it you that is wrong that i am wrong?"
4/30/2008,i have to agree with jade. i also think that the fix proposed is a pretty damn good one.the lofty scam has been around a while now and must surely be a reason for some trial players or new players going. there are possibly other ways to deal with it that may be less popular and alter the game more drastically. the easiest route is sometimes the best and this is a good one.this also keeps the harsh mistress of eve happy.vote for me herecandidate thread herewebsite here
4/30/2008,"fixes.1)a. have a war flag on a gang so that it is either war flagged or not. b. if the first player invited or the initiator is at war then the gang is war flagged c. only players not at war can be invited to a non war gang.2) change the flagging rights so that gang members dont get flagged just for being in a gang. ( after all the corp at war does not get flagged to the gang member so its a bit one sided atm ) gang members should only pick up war flags for aiding a warring party.3) add a function to ""broadcast location"" to a non ganged member so they can warp to you. multiplayer missions without gangs.4) add a function to ""broadcast s.o.s. message"" all players in local can lock on and warp to.there you go 4 solutions to the ""lofty"" problem.\discuss"
4/30/2008,"gidday. my name is ben derindar and i'm inviting you to vote for me in the inaugural csm election of 2008.a short(-ish) introduction follows, reproduced from my campaign website.who am i?ben derindar is my pvp main; i am a member of the axiom empire [axe] alliance, a bunch of guys who roam around 0.0 operating on nbsi policy. i've played eve for four years and pvped on and off for most of that time, mostly in 0.0 but the odd empire war too. i make my isk primarily by ratting if i'm in 0.0, or by missioning if i'm in empire.irl my name is brendan reid; i am a 29-year-old web developer from christchurch, new zealand.why vote for me?i'm running for csm because i like to help people, both in eve and in rl, and i see the csm as another opportunity to ""do my bit"" in an environment that i enjoy. in eve i regularly help out newbies when i'm on my npc corp alts, and over 10% of my entire eve-o posting history is in the new citizens q&a section. in the past i have drawn eve maps for people, and prior to the bookmark nerf i created my own ""bennehinsta""sets and gave them away to friends and allies.meanwhile my rl employment history reveals 8 years in radio announcing and 3 in teaching, so i have plenty of experience as a communicator within group environments. i have also won ccp's trust in this capacity in the past; in 2006 i was offered a forum moderator's position within isd, but due to rl commitments that arose unexpectedly at the same time, i had to turn the offer down.what are my issues?essentially they will be your issues, hence my slogan: it doesn't matter what i think, it matters what you think. that's not to say that i don't have issues of my own - certainly i will pick up on discussion of those subjects more easily than others - but my aim is to be as open-minded as i can. i am as much of a carebear as i am a pvper, and i certainly don't want to force things one way or the other.the benifesto offers some more reading on this subject, but in summary i am personally more interested in the issues of communication between ccp and the playerbase, lag in general, pvp mechanics, low-sec mechanics and the rmt menace.feel free to ask any questions about my campaign here. thanks in advance. /ben"
4/30/2008,are you actually allowed to say this?
4/30/2008,"yes, but only because i declined it. i have also checked with ccp as to whether or not it would affect my csm campaign, and i am assured it does not, for the same reason./ben"
4/30/2008,"ben, the problem i have with you is the same problem i have with a number of candidates. there are those of you who seem to think that not having an opinion, or perhaps more correctly not sharing your opinion, is a good thing.what would you say to those of us who believe that a candidate's individual opinions give valuable and necessary insight into their thought process? as a csm representative, you will be required to make choices and decisions on various issues and then vote according to your decision. the players deserve some indication on which way you will lean when faced with these situations, which will be a regular part of your duties as a representative. not stating an opinion makes it appear as though you either have something to hide, or you are completely uninformed about the current issues in game, or you are just plain indecisive. none of these are very attractive characteristics for a representative."
4/30/2008,"i have to agree wholeheartedly with this sentiment. and i don't mean to come down too hard on ben specifically, as this is something i see in many other candidates as well - but since it was raised in this thread maybe ben can respond.the problem with this ""i won't push an agenda"" tack is that not only that we do not truly know where those candidates stand because they are concealing it, but there's also little reason being put forth why they could do the job better than any other reasonably intelligent person.if a candidate is claiming to be an everyman with no agenda, why do they deserve to be flown to iceland to weigh in on big decisions more so than any other eve player? shouldn't our csm reps be people that rise above the pack?"
4/30/2008,"i do have opinions on a number of subjects, and i'm quite happy to share them when prompted. my campaign website has plenty of information, particularly the benifesto page. in recent days/weeks i have also posted my take on several issues such as bacon/local etc on these forums, and will continue to do so, where and when i can.i just prefer not to be so proactive with them to the point where people become concerned that i would use my position to push my own opinions at the expense of theirs, because i don't believe that's what the csm is for. for example, what happens when an issue is heavily discussed over a period of time, and a school of thought emerges that is contrary to my own?the job of the csm as a group is to represent the will of the people. as a prospective part of that group, i need to be flexible in my way of thinking; to be open to other ideas. and yes, i am negotiable on most things; my position should only last until i am convinced of a better one./ben"
4/30/2008,"general question to other voters out there - are you discussing your choice of csm candidate with other players and campaigning for them? are discussions going on within your corp about who to vote for? what's the vibe out there about this whole thing?just trying to get a feel for what the interest level in this is outside the forums and how people are discussing the candidates.(i assume this kind of question is okay for this forum, as it pertains to the csm election - please remove it if not)"
4/30/2008,not yet but i'll be sure to make my choices known on our site once i've gotten the full scope of the candidates down.
4/30/2008,i still have to find that one candidate that i really like above all the others
4/30/2008,"the more i read, the more i'm losing faith in the csm. not because of the candidates, there are definitely good ones, there's definitely bad ones too (the ones that i haven't seen really making much of an effort at all). i'm losing faith because it's the crappy ones who are going to get the support. this game has become infested with little kids who are too lazy to understand that this isn't wow, there's risk involved in this game and you have to actually invest time in it.if the devs didn't mean for it to be, why does everything in this game take so long to do? put up a pos, take sov of a system, train (properly) to fly a ship, i could keep going, but we all know (anyone's who's played for a while) that things take more time in this game than in others. i know that if i'm not going to play for more than an hour, i'm just gonna sit in the station and chat, or do some simple things.okay, that was a bit of a derail, back to my original point. the people who are so active in responding and campaigning for themselves make a lot of good points and demonstrate that they *gasp* understand how the game works for the most part, and how it's meant to be played. gee, that's sure horrible, i know i want mr. three-weeks-old-and-doesn't-understand-that-if-someone-is-blinking-red-you-can-shoot-him to be on the csm at yet, for all their great posts, they make one bad one, or say one thing you don't like, and all of a sudden, ""welp, can't vote for him, i like his 123 things he said i agree with, but that one there i don't, so screw em."" this has been more and more the mindset of people on these forums, which is probably why the devs don't like to come round these parts too much anymore, despite all they've done fixing things, and boosting and adding things, they nerfed your one thing, or your one ship, and even if it was a bad nerf, taken too far, you ignore anything the devs have done in the last few months, and you put their heads on a pike for that one single thing.also, judging someone based off what they are, rather than what they say. biggest thing i've seen with that, obviously, people not voting for any of the goons. i'm glad you people can't see beyond the ticker and actually read what they are typing. just look at goum's posting history, he's always trying to improve things thru thought out, well constructed posts with points of what's wrong, why it's wrong, what to do to fix it, and why that would be the right fix, and if applicable, what else it would effect. yet, people just say, oh, goon.../ignore. it's pretty much being racist. you're trying to say that there's 5000 goons, and every last one of them is the same? anyone who thinks that, is an idiot, not because you're not a goon, but because your intelligence is on par with a monkey, go fling poo elsewhere. same thing goes with the ""carebear"" candidates. don't we need a diverse bunch? i'd rather have someone who does missions explaining why the mission runners are having a problem with x, rather than commander 0.0 leading the capital fleets against poses trying to explain it, and vise versa. judge people on their knowledge of the game, that's what they are going to do, is to bring their expertise in the game and take the opinions of the masses, and explain why, or why not, it's broke, and ways to fix it.but, because of people being completely ignorant of the purpose of the csm, ignorant of why each person would be good for the csm, and ignorant of what the game is meant to be. i see this project failing because people will vote against anyone they don't agree with, and go with the people that haven't done any campaigning, maybe for fear of getting any of the cliques of this game to rise against them for ridiculously **** poor reasonswell, that turned into a bit of a rant, but it's just ****ing me off how stupid people are getting."
4/30/2008,"no prob slick, different viewpoints are good - i'm just trying to get a feel on how different voters are seeing this, thanks for the input."
4/30/2008,"like akita t, i have still not found a candidate to get behind i have been both impressed and unimpressed i read the rant posted by slickdrac and tend to agree that it was initially wrong of me to start out by eliminating all goons but when we look at 60+ candidates we need to winnow away some to start with just for the sheer numbers, eliminating some due to their associations is a viable method of this so perhaps instead of eliminating goons because they are goons, i should only eliminate the goons that seem to act like goonsi read another thread that asked about alts, some freely admitted to their alts, others bristled at this request my first impression was they had something to hide i have not really changed that opinion yet, but in a game that prides itself on any excuse to take revenge on some unsuspecting player gets top marks, keeping oneself safe to play may not be a bad idea but again, this goes to association, just because a candidate has no association with disreputable people, does not mean candidate alt is not disreputable person #1.i asked a few questions on threads the candidates started they dont get answered or replied to even if it was that idea sucks and here is why its better then nothingi started my own thread on this the csm forum and got 2 replies that amounted to 4 lines and little if any informationi look and see 19 [csm candidate] threads here perhaps this means the rest are not worthy of considerationperhaps i should do like talkuth rel and formulate a generic post stick it in each candidate thread, just to see if i can get a reply that way but then i can not expect interplay between candidates beyond perhaps goumindong and jade constantine who have been doing a good number on each otheronce i have decided whom i will support, then i will decide if i will or will not campaign for them i will make my choice known to my corp as i expect they will follow my choice."
4/30/2008,"people are going to lump the candidate in with his alliance naturally. goum has the deck stacked against him for that singular reason. i agree with you in that line of thinking that it is unfortunate that is a line of thinking, however, it is one i can understand."
4/30/2008,"while reading this thread on the lofty scam it started me wondering what the candidates are letting themselves in for.how useful the csm is or becomes remains to be seen but there's going to be precentage of the player base that now believe that they have a direct conduit to the devs.so, lets take the ever increasing typical eve-o post where something ""bad"" has happened and they're going to go to the forums and vent goddamit! how are these people allowed to get away with this! i pay money for this game! why should i be penalised for not having the time to play eve? you get the picture.now instead of the forums they have a csm to vent at - and they'll listen because we voted for them goddamit! the cry goes up in local ""just you wait, i'm writing to the csm about you..."" and they hit send on a badly formated rant (mlmp )so, csm member logs in, notes flashing evemail icon, sighs and starts going through all the mails in the hope that one of those mails is giving the coordinates to a recently scanned dysp moon or a multi billion isk merc contract.two minuites into being online and a convo box pops up with someone else complaining about something they perceive you can influence. your corp is wondering why you don't undock anymore and you're wondering why you actually logged in tonight.ok, i'm painting a pretty crappy picture but you only need to look at eve-o sometimes to see it's not that far fetched and anyone who's run a large corp or alliance has experienced this to some degree already. you may of course disagree with me but spending time reading what people have to say, vote for the one i feel best represents where i'd like to see the game going and then finding 3 months later they left the csm or stopped playing eve altogether wouldn't put me in the best of moods.i actually admire the candidates for putting themselves up for this. it's not something i have the inclination to do and none of the above was meant as critism but while people are asking what they can expect from a csm member maybe each member should start asking themselves what they're prepared to put up with from the playerbase. it is a game after all."
4/30/2008,"i actually admire the candidates for putting themselves up for this.thank you for your support! i am fully aware of the commitment that being a csm member (if voted in) will entail. i am happy for my in-game playing of eve to take a backseat for a few months, as csm duties would take the highest priority on my time. take care,bruce hansen"
4/30/2008,"i wonder that tooits like austrian and the euif the eu does something good austrian politicians claim it for themselfif itsnot that good, the big bad eu byrocracy did it i hope the csm isnt something for ccp to hide behind it"
4/30/2008,"the trick, and the serious responsibility of the csm, regardless of who gets elected, is to make it an effective body that works *with* ccp to deliver results for the players. this isn't to say the csm shouldn't stridently debate some ccp decisions or hold back from serious criticism of the status quo, but as the first iteration of csms, they (we, if i'm lucky) will be responsible for carving out how the csm will work, how it will relate to ccp and what it will mean to the players. by going first, you have a responsibility of setting a precedent and, to my mind, that makes it very importnant that those members elected to the csm get their execution of thier roles right."
4/30/2008,"been there already and went through it all already, so i know what to expect.as forum admin and admin of an uo freeserver, it doesn't matter what you do, there's always going to be whining and complaining and people that believe you're the one that's supposed to magically solve all their personal problems with other users, even though i was the one that's devoting loads of time to the community for no compensation at all. every morning, the inbox was bursting. in both cases i kept going on for years until the community no longer needed my services.despite all the hate and slack, i also recieved a lot of gratitude for my efforts, and that's what it's all about.it's a part of being in a position where others are dependant on you or because you have something that's in demand. i'm in the same situation as programmer, people contact me to help them with all kinds of problems, and a multitude of project managers want me on their team, but i have to make hard choices who to help and who to decline. annoying for them, but i'm no good to anyone if i take on too much work. similarly, i have to filter the issues presented to me, and turn down people are making unrealistic demands of me. it's part of the job."
4/30/2008,"you raise a valid point; there is a risk for the csm to be drowned in communication. i'm anticipating a level similar to running an alliance of 80 separate corps .for the forum comms side of things , having a separate csm forum for focused discussion will help enormously. i'd also like to see the introduction of a rating system on individual forum posts - so good ideas are clearly flagged and selected (voted if you like) for by the readers.that won't help convo/evemail deluge, but it will help identify the key points being made on each side of the issues."
4/30/2008,"as for eve mail, maybe i'm making a selfish suggestion but i really want a higher character limit.i already get a lot of mails and it's usually mail1a, mail1b, mail1c and reply1a, reply1b, reply1c, etc, and copypasting it all into notepad first and back into eve once the reply is finished."
4/30/2008,"excluding moons, manufacturing and trading, most players i notice tend to make their isk from mining, ratting or running missions.players either make their isk in high sec or 0.0. making isk in low sec is mostly avoided because 0.0 ratting is safer from hostile players than lvl4/5 missions in lowsec for example. this is because its easy to warp out/log/whatever the second someone enters local.making lvl4's in lowsec safer is a nerf to the pirates. pirates have a hard enough time finding targets already, so this cannot happen. this leaves one option. making 0.0 ratting more dangerous than lowsec. i know csm's are not in charge of game design issues, but if you want to represent people, then they need to have a view on the above when you sit in front of some dev who asks you what you would think are good ideas.what is your views on improving the low sec/0.0 risk vs reward balance? do you beleive that it is correct that 0.0 npcing should be safer for isk making than lowsec lvl4/5's?"
4/30/2008,"you cannot safe the universe in one go. one has to prioritize.it occurs to me this topic is not the worst pain in the players arsehowever it think low sec l4 missions are not as unpopular as you seem to think.i personally do it all the time, and i do enjoy the cat'n mouse with the pirates.but then again, just like yourself, i am only one individual and other see it differently.so, should we ever come to the conclusion that it is desireable to make 0.0 ratting moredifficult then i would propose to make the rats harder to kill, or include more of the webbing and scramming kind to a group.however, i do not think that we should nerf something just because it is aparrantly an relatively easy way to earn cash.if we make 0.0 unattractive, if we nerf ratting in 0.0 it has consequencies:- exodus stalling, less raeson to go to 0.0 (great for the pure pvpers so they stay amongs themselfes? wrong, even them need a infrastructure, support, supply.. and rats)- pos and outposts built as hubs for ratters become obsolete, refining outposts especially.- one reason to contest otherwise worthless space (like providence) falls away- your own alliance financial concept seem to rely to a large deal on renting out spacewhat would happen to that concept if all those renters dont find it attractive anymorebecause the risk has increased , and it is not as porfitable anymore as it has been?- i do agree, we should not make missions in low sec easier, pirates also need to have a chance, but mission runners who run those missions are simply different people, or same people in a different mood that yesterday when they wanted to rat. consider, taht people who rat and people who run a low sec mission do it because it is what generates teh most fun, or as in my case - what real life dictates.if i had as much time as i wanted, i would do the missions all day _because_ theyre more challengin than killing a sansha in a belt off from the travel routes.however, if i am same time on ""daddy""-shift then i have to be able to just interrupwhatever i do on a moments notice, thats very bad for missions with a bonus deadlineor spawns coming back after dt and so on..... so i go and rat.i dont feel its a balancing issue, its just different people, or people who want to changeteh routine.frankly i dont see a urgent need to change anything here, well unless of course a representative average of the playerbase prioritize this matter higher."
4/30/2008,"you have to identify the actual problems first.highsec is more or less fine the way it is, maybe l4s in highsec are a tad bit too lucrative.as such, i would simply propose skewing the isk/lp rewards way down for (l4) highsec ""kill"" missions, down to the magnitude of courier missions, and skewing them way up for lowsec (even one order of magnitude higher, if it must be).this way l4s in highsec are still marginally profitable (bounties, salvage, loot), yet those in lowsec are very profitable even if you completely forego looting/salvaging (or, heck, better said, you'd be a lot better off skipping that altogether and just speed-running missions in lowsec instead).another issue with lowsec is that, although you theoretically can engage in ""defence"" measures against player pirates, unless those pirates are already under -5.0 (and a lot aren't) you risk slowly becoming an outlaw yourself.as such, the next proposal would be to disable security status loss (and npc gun-turret aggro too) when you attack a negative (even -0.01) security status target in lowsec.this way, you encourage a more proactive defence against most would-be pirates, in case you actually want to police the area at all.the lp gains scaling should also affect 0.0 mission-runner revenue (for those located in npc-controlled 0.0), and since those areas are usually less secure (everybody has rights to dock and use the facilities), it's not a big problem.as for ""true"", deep 0.0, given the buffs to lowsec, i'd say all comes slowly to some small kind of equilibrium... wouldn't know how to make ""deep 0.0 ratting"" more dangerous for the life of me anyway.ok, so we have missions and ratting somewhat covered, that leaves mining.simply put, the mining system needs a thorough and complete overhaul.for starters, the ore distribution and the mineral composition of ores, everything needs to be seriously revamped.you can either make it so that all ores contain some traces of all ""cheaper"" minerals in them alongside the ""better"" minerals (so, for instance, if you mine arkonor, you don't get just some mega/zyd and traces of other minerals, but you actually get copious amounts of lowends too)... or you can make it so that each asteroid has a different ""yield multiplier"" (lower in 1.0, highest in deep 0.0), and mining a high-yield-multiplier asteroid gets you a lot more m^3/cycle compared to mining a low-yield-multiplier asteroid.either way, the overall mineral distribution needs to be a lot more balanced than it is right now... but not quite balanced according to needs (hisec should still have an overabundance of lowends, deep 0.0 should still have an overabundance of highends... but nowhere near the current discrepancy).as for the drone regions, they should start getting their version of ""hauler spawns"", and the drone alloys need to be re-balanced yet again a little bit.with these changes, most of the risk-vs-reward ratios start resembling what they should look like."
4/30/2008,"as you all know, a huge number of criteria affect low sec and 0.0. let's list just some of them.1: security rating.2: aggro permissions and gang aggro permissions - piracy and anti-piracy.3: ore value and distribution.4: sovereignty and pos warfare.don't you think it crazy that to shoot a pirate or someone with negative sec rating that you affect your own? or that you can get concorded? it's total madness and needs to be resolved.perhaps a total revamp of security status is the key here? maybe link it to faction warfare that is coming up? do bad things in amarr space and your sec rating (faction rating) is only affected there with the amarr cops on your tail and an all points bulletin issued for your head? or pod. with amarr aligned pilots being allowed to shoot first, ask questions later. in 0.0 maybe the sec rating is not affected at all so you can be ebil or leave as is? an interesting discussion point.and what about the crazy ore distribution? i like what akita t says:sovereignty and pos warfare seriously needs work. but we are all missing a vital element here that could skew some suggestions made and may require a change of view.ccp have stated that the pos warfare situation has ""several iterations"" to go through at fanfest 2007 (oveur), that means there are plans to revise this and to be able to discuss fully we do need to know what ideas are already on the table.however i do think that some of jades ideas are good. i would like to allow smaller alliances and corps a slice of the action. so mini pos sovereignty as mentioned by some bright soul (forgive me i can't find your post right now - i will edit it in later) could be a way forward for that. if indeed there is demand that this is an issue serious enough to warrant action."
4/30/2008,"would you (intended as the whole category of people that campaign this kind of change, not you in particular) stop trying to balance this around the players that can and will run missions 12 hour day, using 2 or 3 high quality agents and probably multiple accounts to do the mission in premium time? for every 1 player that do that there are 100 more normal persons that do 2-3 in a day between other things (or because of rl constraints). if you nerf the income they get you simply will push them in a more marginal position and convince them that is time to stop the subscription."
4/30/2008,"21:00 is 23:00 to me, i have to skip that.05:00 is 07:00 to me, during that time i usually skip my breakfast cut my skin during shaving, stumble over a cat that wants to be feeded with mamooth flesh and hope my car will remember the way to the office..."
4/30/2008,"same for me. but if theres a demand for it, ill push it 1 hour backwards."
4/30/2008,"i guess i'll can't show up, too. first of all, the earlier times are the times, my kids awake and it's breakfast time (kids are most important for me, i hope you can agree with that).next step is the ""long"" weekend here in ge (1st may). i already planned out this w-end on family joint adventures. i will not skip that. none the less i'll do my very best to be there on short term."

4/30/2008,"i know, and i'm sorry for it. i was made aware by other parts of the community, that there was plans for something bigger, as such my initial plans for these events were halted.it wasn't until a few days ago, that i realized it was never gonna happen, so i sponsored that teamspeak server, and just threw some dates up, in order to get some discussion going.we had like 5 people on just now. it was an interesting discussion, but it could be so awesome with more people."
4/30/2008,my personal hope is that more people turn up for the next ones and will try and be on for the us time as well as the eu time.
4/30/2008,yep times today were not good (primarily because i am a liverpool fan and something important was happening this evening )...but will try and make one of these at some stage.good initiative!
4/30/2008,"i host another one, should anyone ever care.(own machines, no security issue - but myself of course)"
4/30/2008,chars allowed in 1 post? :d
4/30/2008,"rofl.no, it seems like i missed a word. but there is a limited amount of slots on the server"
4/30/2008,"so, your only platform as a candidate is to advocate a system of bribery?first off, that's just wrong. limiting what issues are addressed by the csm according to in-game wealth is in direct conflict with the purpose of the csm in facilitating communication between all players and ccp.secondly, i doubt that this will end up being something which ccp will endorse or even allow, as it would undermine their efforts of improving relations with the customers.the position of csm representative is one of a volunteer. you should not be expecting any kind of compensation for your time and efforts, it should be done because you feel it is important and worthy of your time in and of itself. publicly selling your vote just shows everyone that you will not be a fair representative. you will not judge issues according to what is best for the game, as you will be beholden to those who have paid you off to push their issues and agendas.one positive thing from your post? thanks for telling us of serenity steele's involvement. that's two candidates off my list."
4/30/2008,"the csm is about making the game better, not about making money, your campaign is supposed to be about what you know about this game, how you play it, and why you would be right to understand and represent the communities issues. this is not a political thing.....if it was, you'd fit right in however"
4/30/2008,"hey chris, long time no see.i'm yet to experience a flame fest on these new csm forums."
4/30/2008,"i'm not sure i get the point here. either tech ii bpo's have to go out completely or the should stay as they are. why not look at the middle way?let's take a bpo and compare it to the same invented bpc.the bpo starts life with me and pe at 0, and can then be researched, so that it's efficiency is improved for all time to come. the same invented bpc starts out with me and pe at probably either -1 or -2 depending on the items used in inventing it (if none is used me and pe will be -4). these numbers are (to my knowledge) impossible to change.so, as things are today producing stuff through invention will probably cost at least 30-40% more than producing it through bpo's. on top of this it's more timeconsuming as the producer will need to gather the items needed for invention and some of the invention runs will be failures.so where does csm candidates stand on suggestions like improving the start me and pe on invented bpc's to be 0, just like bpo's?where do you stand on making it possible to do me and pe research of invented bpc's?do you believe at all that its an issue that inventors spend more podtime and isk to get an item, than bpo owners who simply got an bpo in a lottery once upon a time?personally, i think that a good csm candidate is one who can actually find a balanced solution to a problem, rather than simply saying ""it's fine as it is"" or ""it needs to go""."
4/30/2008,"again, what are you trying to solve?it just seems to me like you request a change, just for the sake of change.as it is now, invention can make much more isk than owning a t2 bpo. t2 bpo's are virtually worthless, if you look at the return-rates.if you actually make invention bpc's me0, pe0, the only difference between t2 bpo's are the invention chance and datacore cost.it could be very interesting to be able to research bpc's to me0 though."
4/30/2008,"i do not like the idea of eliminating tech ii bpos currently in existence. people got those fair and square (except for you-know-who) and it's not right in my view to take it away even though of course for selfish reasons i'd prefer they were not out there. i think players should be able to bank on a certain level of stability, trustworthiness with regard to what they are buying/selling/obtaining."
4/30/2008,"i loved it when ccp introduced the idea of invention. for the most part, i like the blueprint system the way it is, and the bpos in existence should remain in existence. i would like to see invention extended to include the invention of a bpo... with slightly more skills/materials needed to invent a bpo rather than simply a bpc. tech ii bpos ought to be fewer and farther between than tech i... but just make it harder to invent one.my other pet blueprint peeve is not showing decimal amounts of materials needed for production... and for large quantity production, every unit of ferrogel counts."
4/30/2008,"t2 bpos used to be a large problem for making t2 production and wealth essentially a crap shoot. this has been fixed via invention and now all you have to do is buy into the game via invention such there is no ""hump"" that cannot be overcome by an industrialist as there was previously.because there is no hump, despite the original imbalance there isn't much of a reason to change the system. after all, it would be just as if the bpo producers had bought into the invention system earlier[and invention allows much faster production that bpo's do]."
4/30/2008,"luck is always a factor when deciding who gets rich, be if rare drops or tech ii bpos, what i want to see is a microscopical chance to get a bpo from a successful invention run, that way the bpos won't be so rare in the distant future and it'll all be a non issue and people can moan about how tech iii is killing them instead.not less but more tech ii bpos, any candidate behind that sentiment?"
4/30/2008,"how about instead of a ""microscopical"" chance... with higher skill levels, and perhaps more components, one can ""choose"" to attempt to invent a bpo from the tech i bpo... with a similar fractional chance of success.if the invention fails, you get the tech i bpo returned to you, but you only get 5 attempts at invention from a bpo and you can no longer make ""copies"" of it. just a few thoughts."
4/30/2008,"how about instead of a ""microscopical"" chance... with higher skill levels, and perhaps more components, one can ""choose"" to attempt to invent a (t2)bpo from the tech i bpo... with a similar fractional chance of success.isn't this just another form of a tech 2 lottery?from the posting and discussion so far, i am not convinced there is any major issues with t2 bpo. i am maybe swayed that some me/pe changes (eg, letting invented bpc be researched to some degree) could be beneficial. invention is probably going to be the key to t3, so having good bpc could be advantagous....a good time to even out the differences between bpo bpc and invented bpc. of course, some system might be implemented where all t2 bpc are treated the same, and its the skills/decryptors that are used that make the t3 bpc 'better' or 'worse' than each other...these are all just musings, however.take care,bruce hansen"
4/30/2008,"yes it is, i find intermittend reinforcement more interesting than certified grind, i never said i was against the lottery and i don't think anyone would have a thing against more tech ii bpos entering the game now with invention taking the edge off of the holders to begin with.for tech ii to remain viable as a trading commodity at least, in times of higher tech levels i'd like to see it incorporated as a needed part much like tech i is now, for this to not be a horrible bottleneck situation there need to be more tech ii bpos seeded. not taking this route and entering tech iii as a stand-alone with no pre-requisites takes away from the possibly deeper market where manufacturing/trading/hauling tech i & ii to supply tech iii is a possibility, escpecially since no one character can cover all bases on more than a few items."
4/30/2008,"nothing changed to existing bpos.tiny amounts of bpos entering the game again through invention and exploration.will elaborate later, need sleep."
4/30/2008,"hi there i had a few issues and other things i would like your views on.first what do you think the current state of the market is, and where do you see it going?next invention, where do you see this going as far as tech 3 and so on, its goon in sound but will it be enough?next what i call ""kiddie producers"" you know the ones, the ones who sells things below cost because there to young or stupid to really know what there doing. the ones to drive the prices down due to they don't really fully understand the meaning of profit. my question about them is how can we fix the issue with them, i fell with out them the market will be very stable. what are your views on them and how will you or how can they be fixed if there needing to be fixed."
4/30/2008,"the in-game market is an open market. if some wish to sell below production costs, then other producers just have to deal with that. many rl companies use this tactic to drive out competition.the market is very healthy and active, and since invention has become much more stable in pricing. afterall, if a producer puts too high a price on items, inventors will quickly produce this item and undercut. competition drives down the prices to a sustainable level (if it goes below a sustainable profit level, inventors stop making items and prices climb again). this causes a small yo-yo effect in prices, but over time this oscillates around a stable average.invention will be the way to t3, maybe through t2 bpc (invented or runs from bpo's), from all indications i have seen."
4/30/2008,"no i'm not talking about the producers who sell under production cost to drive out competition i understand the logic of that, i'm talking about the kiddie producers who do it because they really do not know what there doing.after all there really isn't a clear cut guide for this for them, they produce an item then sell it at the lowest sell price on the market to move it fast. (good in some ways but bad in other ways) then a week or two later there broke because they had no idea what there build cost was.i guess my real questions is what can be done to help them become better producers so they know the difference between build cost, profit and so on, atm i just see a lot of them no knowing, lost, and over all confused on the subject but yet they keep on because there isn't any clear cut guides for them.if we let even 10% of the kiddie producers know how to really calc there build cost and profits and so on, profits for everyone will go up as there no longer undercutting everyone due to they really don't know what there doing."
4/30/2008,"i guess they learn pretty quick that production may not be for them? or they learn how to start doing it and making a profit, and become better producers for it. i take your point regarding some might not know how to produce...some clearer guides that are easily accessible may be the key here."
4/30/2008,"i try to start threadto let all show mad prose skillz.alas, i must bump."

4/30/2008,"i loved the idea of ""reparations"" if a war is lost.on the topic of the price, why not make it relative? the agressor prices escalate acording to its size versus the size of the defender.this size measurement could be sum of assets, of skill points, or maybe even standing with the local sovereign.sounds reasonable?"
4/30/2008,"this can limit the war system to the rich guys, and size of members can be explited by adding trial alts that just sit there to push up the price of the war, and make it to expensive for the war.edit:how does one define assets of a corp/alliance? by the items in the corp hangers or the assets of all members personal assets? and how will the standings work into it corp or personal ? since corp standings are lower than normal. and some corps dont have standings how does that count into the war fee?"
4/30/2008,"the number can be refined however you could make it work.you could take trial accounts out of the skill points sum (or lower than xmil points for instance).assets gets tricky as if either member or hangars isk net values could make mule accounts a viable escape.for standings, the corp standings. if the people that run the place like the one you wanna punch better, or the other way around, affecting the price of a wardec seems only fair.such a wardec would be confined to a region or to said faction sovereign space perhaps? for full empire fight use concord standing?edit: anyway, not to steal the thunder here. the thread is to find candidates opnions on the wardec system, not mine."
4/30/2008,"my honest opinion is that it will no work much due to the potential for both sides to push the fees up or down on both sides, and make it more off a isk sink to use on a mechanic that as i see it is not working as intended. now numbers on what a lets say a 50 person corp and all of them has around 10-20 mil sp, as for assets lets say 50-60 bill total (both in corp assets and personal assets). how much would that cost? (aggressing corp is half of everything of the target corp)who wants to pay 2-50 mil (or more) for a war that does not happen when the target can disband within the first 24 after the after the dec mail is sent to them, and recreate a new corp and start doing the same thing without any drawbacks."
4/30/2008,"i am entitled to my view, and i will try to explain a bit more. 1. use of third party tools that use log server logs in a way that is not intended is in my view game breaking issue, since it can/will affect some peoples play style, and give a unfair advantage.2. development and release of tools that interact with the log server logs can open up a can of potential border line exploitation, let alone the ways it can be made into a automated system for intel or doing things that does things directly to the client (auto ctrl+q for instance), if that isnt a major issue then what is.3. farmers, macros, isk sellers and isk buyers are and will be an issue for a long time. - go to systems like ingunn where you will find a boat load of macro haulers.- go to systems around aramachi/laah/saila/isenairos/oichiya/motsu and you will find a lot of lag and mission farmers- go look in ice belts in high sec and tell me that the people there with names that looks like they hit their face on the keyboardin short i will stand by that, and that i view it as a issue."
4/30/2008,"isk farmersthey are everywhere, are impossible to kill, and just ruin eve. i report the ones i can, but i never hear if a ban gets issued or anything...would be nice to know if im making a difference.red"
4/30/2008,"this is already the case with certain alliances having dev and gm members. at least with this thing there's a chance of getting people supported by the, on irc and msn, unrepresented masses near an ear of ccp."
4/30/2008,"it's time to say good-bye to ""trinity"" and go to the next installment of eve. with careful thought and planning, the next installment in the background story of eve can also resolve a lot of the pvp issues, sovereignty struggles, and a whole host of other ones if done well. i'm ready for faction warfare, and for factions to begin incursions into neighboring 0.0.so, to be more concise and to the point, the storyline of eve is ready to progress to the next big step."
4/30/2008,"for me, the lead issue is transparency. so much of what goes on in eve is secret. for example, if i file a petition and get a node reset, you might be in that node and you will never know what's gone on unless you know either me or the gm. another example is the fact that most pilots, particularly those who end up in large fleet engagements, complain about lag. we suspect, through the bob scandal (another transparency issue), that there is s3kr3t knowledge passed on to a select few. i believe that this hurts eve. even the appearance of it, the suspicion of it, drives a wedge between the players (customers) and ccp. i want ccp to publish everything they know about lag - what exaccerbates it, are there any client-side tweaks that help, what systems are worse? all of this, plus potentially introducing a more localised traffic advisory system if you were to attmept to jump into a grossly overpopulated system. that's another secret: how many pilots can fit in a given system without crashing the node?so, improving transparency, both of available knowledge and the impact of decisions are my number one concern."
4/30/2008,"the thing that it is the most important for the csm to discuss is, without a doubt, what people call ""capital ships online"".the developers and many not-so-vocal players have expressed distaste over the overabundance of capital ships in eve, and many think that the game would be more fun if they weren't as ubiquitous. at the same time, a very vocal portion of the eve playerbase has spent many billions of isk and several months of skill training to get capital ships of their own, and don't like the idea of having to change since they have invested so much into it and/or they genuinely enjoy the style of gameplay.""capital ships online"" is an issue that simply should not be neglected. the developers want to work with players to reconcile disagreements with what many consider a progression into alpha-classing, and not discussing this topic would be a tremendous waste of a golden opportunity, and is very likely exactly the kind of issue for which the csm was intended."
4/30/2008,"this has never been a reason to not change the game for the better.that being said, we can very much so make changes that make capital ships less valuable while keeping them useful."
4/30/2008,"removing local takes away the chance to communicate- no ransom- no begging for mercy- no warning (""this is a warzone, leave while you can""), no roleplay (thats a major for me)- no friendly or unfriendly interaction with people in the same sector- no cries for help, or offers of companionship from random folks in local- no <insert more reasons here in random order>on the first thought i see a lot of ""no""s there. may those who favor it explain their reasoning here.one could argue if it should be allowed to display standing flags or no, or if we all should go to a constellation wide channel and really remove localbut just removing it w/o showing a good alternative to compensate the ""no""-list aboveseems to be pretty pointless. i am also not convinced of the fact that this would gain the player base support - each of the csms is supposed to represent _all_ player base to his best effort."
4/30/2008,"i totally agree with zoo...for me, the local chan is sth like the social basic principle and basis for everyone to start/get association. i guess there is really no need to work on this issue."
4/30/2008,"i think you got it a bit wrong. it's not a question of completely removing local. local should still be there for social interaction, but not for intel gathering. as such, local should be delayed."
4/30/2008,"my fault... i should not read, write on laptop and listen the statistic lecture"
4/30/2008,"hehe, i make that mistake too often.good thing visual arts class is about to start. then i force myself to turn off the laptop, so that it doesn't get dirty."
4/30/2008,"ok, that reduces my no-list to some extendhowever, may i dare to ask whom a csm should represent more?the pirate who can kill the ratter much easier? or the pirate that wont find targets anymore, because ratters now rat in hordes, or in pvp ready vessels forced by such a change is this matter of major concern to other players who are not in the yarrdepartment?what is the miners & ratters opinion on this? could you live with such a change? what consequencies will it have on alliance holding space, not able to tell who moves around in their turf. intel channels becoming obsolete, unless visual ro scanner contact can be madeon trespassing hordes.it is an iteresting topic indeed, i personally could life with whatever the outcome isbut is that what the majority wants?"
4/30/2008,"in short:i would like it if local chat wasn't as useful as an intel tool in the way it is now, but i haven't seen a replacement for it that i can really feel comfortable with. i'd love to see it gone, but it is hard to predict what effects a new system could have on small gang, fleet, and roaming pvp, as well as blobbing. it's very touchy."
4/30/2008,yep - i said pretty much the same thing on my own [csm] page...
4/30/2008,"i think that for empire space, local should remain. call it a concord service or whatever. that said, i think it should be removed in 0.0 (*cough*, no concord) or at least be at the discretion of the entity who holds sovereignty. what particularly interests me is the impact of having a 'local' on lag in busy systems..."
4/30/2008,eve is expanding in new and exciting ways for manufacturers. the last great leap was the addition of outposts and their upgrades.where do you see the future taking us from here?would planetary bases/colonies be the next step forward?
4/30/2008,"according to my knowledge ccp has speculated about going planetside and even claiming areas on the surface for ressource gathering and warring - already 2 years ago.is it the way forward? it certainly adds to complexity, long term experience, realismbut also to amount of bugs, decentralisation of developer ressources.i personally would like to see some current issues fixed first, started with the performance issues that eve never really got rid of due to the constantly growing number of simultaneusly connected clients and their interactions.then we will have to await the effects of the ""walking on stations"" bit, before going to surfaces can become a topic. simple and precise answer: perhaps, but not yet today"
4/30/2008,"very interesting input here i like many of the ideas. i may add my comment after a bit of pondering. on the question if rolplayer-actions should have an impact on how empires react i wouldrespond with a clear yes of coursehowever, i fear technical limitations may make this a difficult task to accomplish.certainly some kind of logical interaction between the story-""frame"" and huge rp accomplishments happen only very sporadic,never or far too late. news too often contain ""insignificant"" items, with no practical effect on anyone within eve.so peopel stop reading and caring about them..."
4/30/2008,"...making scanner probes visible on the overview. as it stands, you can see them on your scanner - but you cannot add them to active overview settings, meaning you have to sift through moons, belts, wrecks, cans and whatever else is in system before seeing the probe on scan. its kind of annoying really."
4/30/2008,sounds like just a simple bug to me. try bugreporting it (this does work).
4/30/2008,"the goonie is right, its probably a bug. if it is not, i would vote for making it visibleon overview, i cant see any issues there."
