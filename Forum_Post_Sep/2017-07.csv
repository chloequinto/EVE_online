7/1/2017,"hello, hello.for about $25-30 i could target a specific character and cause all of their accounts (under the same linked email address) to become banned. it's incredibly easy to do and has next day results!i purchase isk for your character through a third party website. i can request that the isk be sent to you by the ""give isk"" option. next day, after server resets, you're now banned for one week. you can try to argue your case. telling the security team that you don't have a need to purchase isk. but these cries will fall onto deaf ears.so, after your one week ban is up, i'd wait another two weeks to make another purchase. this time your account will be permanently banned. again, your cries will fall onto deaf ears. now you're just a nasty violater of the eve eula and it won't matter what you have to say, you're guilty. guess you shouldn't have violated the eula!clearly, this is what's happened to my characters and accounts (new char to make this post). i had 80m sp on my only omega account and had been funding my own membership through in game play. never needed a dime from anyone. i'm not here to try to save my permenantly banned account (although, it is still under investigation). i'm sure that's a lost cause. instead, i'm here to vent about my loss, instead of retaliating against others in eve that i've never liked over the past few years.how tempting it is for me to do this to others. out of bitterness. there's only a small fee involved and i could crush several characters and accounts. i mean, after all, ""this is eve"". since i'm no longer a player then i wouldn't be violating eula by purchasing isk for other players. pretty sh*tty right? i think it is.nonetheless, this is a serious defect that could be addressed. that's why i chose to post it here in the forums."
7/2/2017,"what you describe , has been done before . that's why honest players , petition immediately when someone they don't know donates isk to their account . you claim it was done twice to you , but didn't petition until after you were banned . i'm curious , how do you know there's a ""give isk"" function on a third-party isk-selling website , you've never been to ..."
7/3/2017,"1. ""give isk"" option in-game.2. both times i didn't see my account balance until after the bans. i have no reason to watch my wallet since i hate to market-play and also have such minimal purchase needs. generally i high sec care bear till i get the itch to pvp. only then will i start to touch my wallet.pretty sure i got my perma ban before i even had a chance to even see a balance change. only reason i know what happened was bc of a third party eve app that shows me transactions. received the isk transfer while offline. then had the amount removed from my balance followed by a permanent ban.classy."

7/31/2017,"rather than these plastic-y colors on the low shader mode, can we get a more metal look to the ships/structures/etc?i think it can be made by changing the colors rather than depending on reflections (which are on medium/high shader mode) so it wouldn't be more demanding to the hardware, but it would just be more pleasing to the eye.i'm not aware of the technical limitations however, and would like to know if it is possible :d"
