12/1/2009,"i've been having my sin for about 5 months, only use of it is for hotdroping with bombers, and this rarely happens, due to laughtable jump range.bos beed 10ly jump range after skills apply, better resists and cov ops cloaks. i know this was highly disputed since they were introduced, but we've seen by now that ragular cloaks don't cut it. and since they are outperformed in tank and dps by their t1 counterparts, cov ops cloaks will give em more situation to be useful in, instead of making them any kind of solopwnmobile."
12/1/2009,"i unwisely started training for the widow as soon as they were announced. i've used it for its intended purpose a handfull of times, and was disappointed when i did.they need a better jump range and fuel capacity (either increased hold or decreased consumption). not being able to make many region jumps defeats the primary role of these ships. i don't think dread range is unreasonable for a ship whose hull costs as much as some carrier hulls. they need to warp cloaked. being the only ship in a black-ops gang that can't makes using them, even in a recon and bomber gang, a minus in many cases. they either need their hp restored, or they need t2 resists and command-ship-like mass and agility.look at what the ship costs. to justify that cost, the benefit that they provide needs to be a ""must have"". in other words, nobody would even consider taking out a recon and bomber gang without a black-ops. that isn't the case now. not even close."
12/1/2009,"this change does make sense to me, but i don't want to see suicide ganking get nerfed that heavily. i'd only support it if concord spawn timers were lengthened significantly to compensate."
12/1/2009,no one should be getting insurance on getting concord'd or self destructing.it's what makes it possible for most people to suicide gank without any loss or cost short of sec rating.

12/1/2009,great idea.
12/1/2009,"actually ccp already has a system in place to calculate the actual value of goods in eve.they only use the prices of goods when those goods change ownership. low buy orders and high sell orders are ignored because no other player accepts the terms.let's say 4 market orders for trit are placed (each involving an arbitrarily large quantity).a: buy order at 1.00 iskb: buy order at 2.3 iskc: sell order at 2.5 iskd: sell order at 9001 iskonly orders b and c are ever engaged in actual trade. a is unsatisfied since b overrides it, and d is unsatisfied because no one will pay 9001 isk per unit of isk. so only b and c impact the moving average.the only exploit is if a person goes to a station with no orders for that good, post it way too high, then buy it with an alt. however, imagine the quantity of that good changing hands. imagine the concerted effort necessary to inflate the average market price of tritanium. and exploiters have to pay both a tax (1%) and a broker fee (at most 1%).so let's ignore broker and just say 1.5%. to add 1 unit of 1000 isk trit to the moving average costs 15 isk. if 10 billion units of isk change ownership every day at 2.00 isk, it takes 10,000 (10 thousand) 1000 isk transactions to increase the average to 2.997 isk per unit. that is 150 million isk lost to the black hole of market tax and broker fee.the price exploiters post at doesn't matter (the higher they do it at, the fewer transactions are required but the same 1.5% is still lost in taxes/fees).if someone wants to pay the fee to increase the perceived value of tritanium, they are welcome to do it.that exploit is preventable by ignoring extreme outliers. but if someone wants to invest the taxes to increase the price, i say ""let them."""
12/1/2009,yes.
12/1/2009,i agree!

12/1/2009,"hello everyone. hello ccp-team.i'm a player from germany and during the last few days i got an idea regarding the look of eve. here it is:(hopefully my english isn't too bad)why are some spacestations positioned that far from planets even if they got a colonized one nearby? it definitly would look more realistic if they would have a lot lower orbit so that the immense mass of a planet could be seen. in eve universe it seems that spacestaions are a lot bigger than planets and thats definitly not very realistic. be honest, have you ever seen a spacestation bigger than a planet? even deathstar was just as big as a moon.so why not let ships and stations interact in lower orbit of planets? i mean space is gigantic and no place looks like the other. but in the unsiverse of eve...everything looks almost the same and that might be a bit boring. the best example for what i mean and how it could look a bit more realistic is the dominion-wallpapers. the proportions look realistic. with the planet's trabants and all the asteroids in near orbit everything looks interesting and got a lot of variety.general speaking: space is massive. a place filled with huge objects. objects that are a million times bigger and older than humanity. so why not give the player the feeling of beeing tiny in comparison to space. to give you a more detailed picture of what i mean please look at the picture down here. i know its a totally different game but it gives you an idea of what i mean.low orbiting spacestationi try to describe my specific idea with words:lets say you are about to reach a spacestation of a planet with your shuttle. while warping, station and planet are coming close very fast but on first sight you can't see the spacestation youre warping to. the planet grows bigger and bigger and finally covers all of your screen as youre still in warp. just in the last moments before dropping out of warp you see the spacestation coming close very fast. you got to move the camera around to get the size of the planet. just as you drop out of warp, approaching the spacestation, you realize how massivly this planet really is and...in my opinion most important...realize how impressive and dangerous at the same time eve can be for just one human beeing. on the other hand side the game would become more interesting and get a lot of places to visit. i mean travelling makes a big part of the game. so why not filling space with remarkable places?let's think a step further. the planned feature to walk on spacestations. if we take dust 514 as an example. the view out of the control central that we've all seen in the gametrailer. just imagine you stood at the window of a cafeteria chatting with one of your corporation members and got a scenic view like it was in the trailer of dust 514. scenic viewif new players would see that in first place right at the beginning of their career i could imagine they would be very impressed. it also would give players the feeling that the station that they're walking on, has an economic and social connection to the millions of people who live down on the planet. particularly in regard to the planned feature to interact with planets and the connection to dust 514. it would be a more natural feeling of a spacestation.that's just one of my ideas to make eve looking a bit more interesting. it's beautyful as it is right now but i think there could be done a bit more. in my opinion the proportions of the game's ""interior"" would benefit from a bit work on it so that scenes like the one i described could get realized. however things like that can be done i think ccp can do it. of course i know that this idea might be a ""bit"" bigger scaled than other ones but i thought you all should hear it.it's just an idea. so what do you think about it?"
12/1/2009,"you are right, if local chat were removed there would be no need for logonski, becuase nobody in their right mind would ever do anything but dock if they were agressed at a station. without some way of assessing the threat you're facing, one has to assume that the attacker is doing so because they're confident they have more backup close by than you do.because the ""death penalty"" in eve is relatively severe, most tactics revolve around luring an opponent into a fight that's stacked in your favor, and unfortunately folks aren't above meta-gaming (logonski) to do it. the current mechanics allow the target of the meta-gaming tactic to disengage. the proposed mechanics don't.removing local will just make the population in general more risk averse, becuase, again, it will be difficult to impossible to assess the threat you're facing. the net result would be less willingness overall to pvp.i think docking games are lame too, and i'd like to see them go away, but there is a serious hole in this proposal that needs to be addressed."

12/1/2009,"t1 destroyers are already poerfull v frigs, although there are some imbalances between them, i wouldnt mid seeing a small logistics destroyer but really id like to see them balance dictors better"
12/1/2009,"t1 destroyers are woefully underpowered. i have seen many desties soloed by frigs. the destroyer has many of the faults of a cruiser (sig radius, speed) and many of the flaws of frigates (ehp, cpu, pg, capacitor). there are many proposals out there to fit destroyers in general (which i support) however, my op is designed to make a destroyer that is capable of dealing with t2 frigates, as there is no ship that has dedicated role bonuses for this task"
12/1/2009,aml caracal?also arty thrasher and coercer (glass cannon fit 2 te/2 hs) are deadly for any frigates even t2. the thrasher got the potential to one volley ceptors.
12/1/2009,"the aml caracal does have the capacity to kill frigs, and the arty thrasher is a force to be reckoned with, however i think that cruisers should be fit to fight ships of equal size, and that destroyers of all races should be able to scare a frigate pilot to no end"
12/1/2009,"i support the idea, not sure about the statistics though, would need a good look at it to make it a fair ship.but yeah t1 dessys are a poor and useless ship, the only thing they are good at id suiciding hulks..."
12/1/2009,"alright, well i originally posted this under features and ideas, and i thought i should move it here, because of some positive comments.with dominion, and the new fleet system, you can enable loot logging. i love it. also, i've recently noticed that you can see what system a player of your fleet is in, what ship they're in, or if they're docked.so, i was thinking.with the new ability to save ship fits, along with the new fitting window, wouldn't being able to see your fleet members fits be not only interesting but a great added factor in fleet strength and tactics? now, one may ask ""how is this different from linking your fitting in the chat window?"" it's very different, and more convenient. first off, you don't have to save your fits, and you don't have to link them. second, an fc (or others, maybe the fc designates who can see) can easily pull up ships by players names, and quickly see what they have fit.think about it. you could be in my fleet, and be like ""look at jade's fit! lolololololol"" and then kick me out. also, what if you want everyone to fit rr for spider tanking, and someone didn't get the memo? instead of being a super cereal tool and shouting saying ""if you fit a pppproper ship...!,"" you'd be able to look at the fit, and tell the person to get on the ball and fit it.it may seem rather simple and inconsequential, but these small additions will add more to not only preparation of fleets, but overall fleet strength. that, and it will be easier to give people advice, unless you're to serious.one other though i just had...with the system now, you can't see a players ship while they're docked. so, it would probably go hand in hand that you won't be able to see a players fit if they're docked.and here's the original thread, if anyone is curious."
12/1/2009,"to be honest, i kind of like this. teaching carebears cynojammer takedown tactics, proper subcap fleet fits, integration of rr into their gangs, and all that other stuff seems like a great idea to me. more pve content should be so good at giving people a hint of what pvp is like. and op, no. it's 0.0 space for a reason - don't whine that it's full, put together a battleship fleet and start reinforcing poses."
12/1/2009,"this seems to be a good idea, in empire space the ruling power already maintains communications, but in 0.0 it should be the owners responsibility to set up a comms system"
12/1/2009,"i've thought about this very thing. i enjoy the lack of an active local in wh space and it makes sense that uncolonized 0.0 (no sov) shouldn't have standard subspace communications like empire space. i believe the op's requirements for a local chat are a little much but either way, i support it."
12/1/2009,"against my better judgement i like this idea, it makes 'sense' in terms of game mechanics, seems 'logical' in terms of the way systems are being developed by ccp, adds another element to the system takeover ... do you go for the economic center (outpost), the infrastructure center (hub) or communication center first?while this will mean that systems without sov claimed by someone will probably become slightly more dangerous, these systems are few (and with dominion hopefully fewer), but common sense should keep you alive more often than not.although not perfect, maybe the module requirements could be lower??? i like.but i'd be interested to see if anyone comes up with a good 'why not' other than 'why should we'"
12/1/2009,i'm ok with it as long as lowsec and pirate sov 0.0 still have it
12/1/2009,"they should, because lowsec is controlled by empire factions, and pirate sov is still sov"
12/1/2009,"woho! the best solution to this proposal i've seen so far! and yes, nullsec-piratesov should remain the local chat.this opens up for intresting ""monitoring"" systems!"
12/1/2009,"i guess i am for this, just wondering, realistically how much of 0.0 would this leave without local chan. ? would it be significant enough to be worthwhile ?"
12/1/2009,"on a day to day basis this would not be worthwhile, but in terms of conquest of sov space this could add quite a bit. lets face it 99% of what is typed in local in 0.0 is ""gf"" it's not used to communication it's used for intel.with this i would hope that the attackers would be able to put the 'commo hub' in re-enforced mode, and eventually destroy, and thus turn off local in a system or that the defenders could turn off and on (with suitable delays) local.giving you scenarios like this. your attacking an enemies outpost, you know from local that you have superiority in numbers and your happily got it's shields down to 50% .. all of a sudden local disappears, your scouts report that local went out in the enemies adjacent systems and some nervous fella reports cyno's opening on the directional-scanner. are you about to become a grease smudge in space? will they have similar numbers and it could be worth standing your ground .... or is it just all a bluff to test your nerves?intel is an important part of system warefare, i believe this would add significantly to it."
12/1/2009,"well if you like it, and support it, make sure to check that box saying that you give your support, i like seeing big thumbs-ups for things that i support, the more the merrier ^^"
12/1/2009,the op's concept actually is good with having local channel dependent upon an anchored and onlined structure. definitely supported.
12/1/2009,"the idea sounds good but in normal space unlike wormnole space you have static things to warp to i.e. roid belts etc,etc and because of this no need to scan things down.i fear this would leave cov-ops too unbalanced and overpowered as there would be no way to counter having a cloaky gang sit on your station/in your belts.at least in wormholes you can keep an eye out for probes. this would lead to lots of space being left unused,both because of cost and risk.resulting in people going back to empire lvl 4's or blobing all together in dead end constellations with scouts to warn of any hostiles coming.getting rid of local sounds good,but it would mean many other aspects of the game would need to change,for it to work well.not supported as the op doesn't cover the problems that would arise in systems without the 'special structure' due to current game machanincs."
12/1/2009,"as long as it's a cheap and easy upgrade(strategic 1, can be moved in a hauler, minimal upkeep), and it's not required in npc-owned space, i like this idea. i could probably be talked out of it, but my first impression is positive."
12/1/2009,"i think that its a good idea, not sure how easy it would be to code though.another alternative idea (not trying to hijack here) would be to also implement something like, if you jump into low-sec/high-sec/0.0 from a wh, you should not be displayed in local until you are near a stargate/star base, i mean, what is there in space that automatically detects you when you jump in from nowhere?"
12/1/2009,"get eve to 600k subs: no can flip on new playersi'm tired of seeing brand new miners in high sec get can flipped. they don't know any better so they shoot back pretty much every time and pop. this is grieving that hurts new player subs. and the people that are doing this are bored but too scared to go into low/null sec and do any real pvp. this is an activity that makes little to no isk. i would prefer a game mechanic that prevents this from happening to new players, old players are fair game imho.i know there is a rule against doing this in new player systems, but i see it happen at a very high rate in systems surrounding new player systems. these are characters that are just barely getting there feet wet in eve. they are mining today, but the might move on to pvp or other activities later on.some data collection might be in order to see just how common it is.i use 3 accounts, 2 hulks and an orca when i mine, so can flipping is a thing of the past for me, but what about the new guys/gals?with all the work done on the new player experience, its a waste when new people give up at the start because they get the wrong impression of the game.csms, what can be done to stop/prevent or punish these actions so that ccp can achieve its goal of 600k subscriptions?they don't have a voice, so someone needs to ask.there are a lot of solutions that could be implemented here:red colored un-flippable cans from noob ships.un-determined punishment(s)make it cost isk, put the hurt in there wallets.concord-able action.huge hit to sec statushow about a pop up message to new players that explains the rules of engagement, and the dangers of using cans?talk amongst yourselves..."
12/1/2009,"better education of new players might be a good idea - have a pop-up that explains the rules the first time you jet a can, say. but covering newbies in bubble wrap is not the solution - we want them to be playing eve at the end of the day. besides, it'd be exploited instantly - newbie alt, miner main in corp, unflippable hulk pilot. so while i don't really object to your point, your solution is a bad one."
12/1/2009,"this is a good idea, but your ideas to fix it aren't."
12/1/2009,did you even bother to take the time to think about what you where saying before you posted?no seriously... no troll here... just stop... and think about what you saying.what's to stop someone from getting a new account to mine for the duration and then transferring purchases over to a main?no i didn't think so.stop emo-raging and start using your head before you come up with ideas.-10 troll attempt : o pps: the can flipping is not a problem... its a very minor problem... so i fail to see why its so earth shattering. i mean.. you simply ignore... or you set up a trap... get people to help you. if your going to whine and cry and quit... your better off going back to wow at that point. there are far worse things in eve to turn players off... can flipping is very low on that list.
12/1/2009,"this is a very insensitive comment to the problem that was brought up. i don't see any ""emo-whining,"" as you say, and saying that such a thing is occurring puts off the creative thinking to an age-old problem that keeps getting brought up.why would people continuously keep bringing up can flipping? because it is a problem sometimes.ccp says the current game mechanic is intentional -- space debris is anyone's to have. changing the way this works won't happen.but what i think is a good idea is notifying the player the first time they drop a can that it's not permanent storage, and that it's not recommended to use jetcan mining tactics. ever."
12/1/2009,"as have said will gence :how to solve this point ? upgrading defender missiles ? not the best way i think, they are all or nothing : upgrading them will risk make missile boat uselesscreate sort of disruptor agains missile launcher ? it's not the launcher who do the work, it's the missile. rp speaking modify the missile action by disrupting the launcher is strange...what i propose is a new module : missile disruptor (med slot)when actived, this module create a small bubble around your ship. that will make missile explode before touching you. missiles will always damage your ship, but the module will indirectly reduce the damage amount they do. the more the module skill is trained, the more damage are reduce cause missile will explode sooner."
12/1/2009,"or you can look at it this way: the missile and the ship are in constant communication during it's flight, sending and receiving updates to adjust it's flight path, etc (think wire-guided missiles of today). by targeting the ship and activating a launcher disruptor module, you interfere with that communication and thus negatively affect the missile. the launcher disruptor module can have scripts much like the tracking disruptor with each causing a different effect. a tracking script (for lack of a better term) causes the missile to miscalculate it's point of impact thus making the speed of it's target over-exaggerated. whereas you only may be traveling at 200m/s, the tracking script makes the missile think you are traveling 300m/s and it's damage is reduced.an optimal range script (again, for lack of a better term) causes the missile to think you are further away than you really are and causes the missile to deactivate prematurely. that torpedo that should have hit you at 50km will now, with the script active, deactivate at just 30km."
12/1/2009,or you can use ewar and break the lock which invalidates any missiles traveling en-route to you.except space bombs.don't think there's gonna be much support at that rate.not that i have any problem with the idea in the first place of course.
12/1/2009,"wouldn't get used any more than defenders get used now. reason is that you're giving up a mid-slot to defend against weapon system that's out of favor for pvp anyway, when you could fit a damp or jammer instead and get some defense against everyone."

12/1/2009,you're missing the point entirely
12/1/2009,"basically, we all know that in the real world most every battleship or cruiser has, in addition to a bunch of guns for shooting big ships, a bunch of itty-bitty guns that shoot at missiles, aircraft, and small ships that they can't hit with the big cannons. and we also know that a lot of people don't want battleships to become ""solopwnmobiles"". so i think i have a solution.my solution is to add a new class of weapon called ""the point defence turret"". each class of weapons (laser, projectile, hybrid, missile) would have them. as far as graphics go, each 'gun' would appear as a quad-set of gatling lasers/cannons/rails or as a small cluster of rocket pods mounted on a turret. their firing animation would just be a small storm of machinegun/lasers/slugs/missiles shooting at up to 5 random targets within 10km.they would target missiles, drones, and then frigates, in that order of priority (ie each cycle the system would first shoot missiles, then drones, then frigates.) the weapon would do minimal damage (15 or so tops) of the racial racial damage type of the weapon. the fitting cost would be 200pg and 40tf, but destroyers would recieve a 95% reduction in powergrid and 50% reduction in cpu costs. the ammo supply would be 40 rounds max, so as to prevent abuse in the form of a permanant missile shield. capacitor drain would be in the 50gj range, but destroyers would have this cut by 50%. they would require level 5 in their respective small weapon skills to use.the main purpose of this weapon would be to engage drones and missiles, and also to give destroyers a new role of cheap missile/drone defence in large fleets. as it only tracks 5 targets per gun at a time, the computations in the server would be less complex than a smartbomb, so it would not greatly increase lag. plus, who wouldn't like to see their ship shooting a zillion little projectiles at those drones attacking them?"
12/1/2009,without a mention of rate of fire it's a meaningless proposal... seems to me like a waste of a high slot anyway - also a further nerf to jamming. would it be effected by tds? more detail required....
12/1/2009,"they saw that the gila and rattlesnake = fail so they changed it, so i think more ships need changing."
12/1/2009,"huh. or you could just not use those ships in pvp. i mean is it me, or are we over thinking this. where is it written that every ship has to be good at every task?not supported. leave my typhoon alone, thanks."
12/1/2009,but people got the option. i am mostly missile specced and the new typhoon is finally a decent armor tanked missile bs for me. so i will train matari bs just to get the phoon with 5 torps and 3 utility highs.i was concidering it with the 4/4 layout already but the new layout just makes it more sexy. my corp mate on the other hand will pick the phoon with acs because he doesnt have the slightest clue about missiles.i like that kind of flexibility. and yes i also abused the rokh as missile boat. :p
12/1/2009,"eh ? i mean this sincerely, did you not understand the proposal ? he's not suggesting removal of split weapons systems, just that the 2 dmg bonuses that are often applied to them (and are only as effective as 1 bonus on a single weapon boat) are rolled into one leaving another bonus slot free. this would improve the typhoon, why wouldn't you want that ?i'll try to ignore the implication of ur post that the typhoon doesn't have to be good at pvp incase i am misunderstanding you."
12/1/2009,"actually, i was referring to the op's reasoning for the change - that these ships aren't preferred for pvp. if they aren't useful for pvp (i'm not saying i agree, but that's the point he's trying to make) then why do we have to change them to make them useful? why not use a ship that's better at pvp?if you just want to boost split weapon ships, then let's stop obfuscating the purpose of the thread behind a mask of ""make it more viable for pvp"".tbh, i like my cruise missile spewing multi remote repping typhoon with it's massive drone bay. i even gave it a name that suits it's role. it's called multitool (because it was shorter than swiss army knife). with the new slot layout, i'll probably drop one repper and add another cm launcher - but tbh, the rest of the ship doesn't need to be changed. i say that because in order to add what is (in reality) a third bonus, that means something else about the ship has to be nerfed."
12/1/2009,"i really don't think u are getting this at all. he's just saying that on a boat such as the cyclone the bonus would become ""5% bonus to medium projectile turret and launcher rate of fire""this is one of the main reasons ppl don't use the cyclone all that much, 3 unbonused hi slots, when ppl do use it, it's because they have crystals and pills (this is pretty rare) or because it cheap. it's all very easy for you to casually say ...""just use other ships without split weapons"", but especially regarding minmatar boats, that leaves few options. split weapons do indeed suck, just ask a naglfar pilot. i appreciate that in some cases this may make some ships op (cane perhaps) but that could obvoiusly be left as it is. but, for the split weapons ships that do need some dps lovin, this is actually a good idea.edit..""tbh, i like my cruise missile spewing multi remote repping typhoon with it's massive drone bay. i even gave it a name that suits it's role. it's called multitool (because it was shorter than swiss army knife""...and this idea would not alter that in the slightest, no slots would change, the bonuses would just be rolled into one ""5% bonus to large projectile turret, siege and cruise missile launcher firing speed per level"" leaving room for another utilty bonus or tanking etc etc.the typhoon is a marginal case anyway, i would argue that it would be a ship where adding cpu/pg would be a better change considering the 5th launcher point, but it was useful to demonstrate what i meant.to clarify then, i support adding this to ships that need it only."
12/1/2009,"no, i understand what he's saying. my point is, let's call this what it is - a boost to split weapon ships. and then be aware that if they give you this, they'll most likely take something else away to compensate for it.the point is, the ship really does have two bonuses. the rate of fire bonuses don't need to be lumped into a single bonus and add a third on top of it in the form of a tanking bonus because that's going to make the ship op, frankly, unless they nerf something else in conjunction with it.people may not like the two rate of fire bonuses (especially if they don't actually mount both weapon systems - because then it seems like a wasted bonus) but that doesn't mean the ship needs to be changed."
12/1/2009,"eve is made for pvp!supported ofc. boost mai typhoon so i can kill other tier 1 in 1vs1 >.<if you look at it, typhoon only got 1 bonus. cus the 5% damage/rof(?) bonus is split system, so atleast add 1 more bonus to typhoon like 5% armor each lvl (<3)"
12/1/2009,"there are exactly two ships that this would apply to after the sansha and gurista ships got changed - the typhoon and the naglfar. the nag needs this desperately, given how thoroughly it got screwed in dominion - 5% rof and 5% dps on both weapon systems might almost be enough to make it usable again. the typhoon probably doesn't, but i'd be fine with it getting it anyways, as long as the second bonus wasn't especially good - 5% speed, maybe, but not 5% damage. so yeah, i'm fine with it. it's only really one bonus now, them getting a second is cool by me."
12/1/2009,"nope - there are already enough reasons to use the ships you assume are suffering you're trying to solve a problem that doesn't exist. it's not like the rupture or 'phoon were left on the pvp shelf anyway...have you even noticed that 90% of amarr ships only have 1 real bonus? the 10% cap use bonus just removes the pain of the chosen offencive configuration... should this change? no - players choose what they train for. it's the same for dual offensive ships, they have inherent advantages (no cap use - always doing at least some damage (missiles) but doing some high dps damage (turrets) if the situation is right) so leave them be."
12/1/2009,"cap usage is a penalty which balances out the great range, tracking (at optimal), and reload speed of lasers. saying that -10% cap use per level isn't a real bonus is like saying the damage bonuses on minmatar ships (which exist to counteract the normally poor dps of projectiles) aren't real bonuses.supported"
12/1/2009,"the example of exotic dancers was just a simple one , further down the line and more importantly there are other inconsitencies.such as the mammoth:given data:mass: 12,500.00 tonnesvolume (displacement): 255000m3 can be approximated to l =150m x b = 50m x d= 34mnet tonnage: 5625 tonnes (cargo capacity)equivalent hold size; 25m x 25m x 9m.compaire this to a cargo ship on earth.knock nevis (jahre viking):volume: l=458.45m x b=68.8m x d=29.8m = 939,932.528 m3net tonnage: 214,793.00 tonneszirk"
12/1/2009,"ah! so this is a stalth ""boost the cargo capacity of haulers"" whine.first and foremost: the total volume of a seagoing vessel is not equal to it's displacement. the displacement is actually a factor of the ship's mass. to whit:so trying to equate the idea of displacement to a starship is silly.second point, eve ships aren't rated in the amount of tonnage they can carry, but in the total volume they can move. that mass number is, as you pointed out in your first post, occasioanlly silly, but ultimately useless, in terms of cargo.you can see this yourself with this simple demonstration.repackage a covetor, stuff it into a mastadon, and then jump into a class 1 wh. assemble the covetor at a friendly sma, and try and jump back out. you'll get a nice message about the ship being too heavy. i admit, it's a glitch in the mecahnics, but it proves the point tha tcargo mass isn't really that important in eve.final point. even assuming ships of exactly equal interior volume (and that's the key, since a ocean going vessel can load stuff up on the deck and cart it around, thus adding to it's tonnage carrying without adding to the interior volume of the ship), i would expect a space ship to carry less enclosed cargo room. why? more equipment. you have items that a starship needs that an earthly vessel doesn't, such as life support and air processing systems, to name a couple if you want to compare these ships to anything, you should compare them either to submarines (not a really good comparison, tbh) or to the space shuttle, which has many of the same issues."
12/1/2009,"if there was any change to volumes needed, it'd be to make mineral compression disappear, by scaling down the volumes(or quantities) of low-end minerals. tritanium ingots should be the most compressed way to haul the stuff, not seemingly the least. but exotic dancers? there's about a billion things more important than that to worry about. besides, i always took the livestock masses and volumes to be a joke on ccp's part. there's no need to change this."
12/1/2009,"""you like big butts and you can not lie..."" 1m3 is 2m x 1m x 0.5m - that's a lot of space standing... i know eve players are fat but dancers more than 1m wide and 50cm deep? let's keep them with 1m3 so when i put 100 in the cargo hold i can imagen them all bumping and rubbing together when i turn the ship...either way you're quite wrong about the volume but you may have a point on the weight - 60 or 65kg may more accurate but who cares?..."
12/1/2009,"something along these lines seems sensible to me. defenders shouldn't be good, but they should be at least marginally usable."
12/1/2009,"i'm all for t2 tier-3 bs hulls but to be honest i'm not sure if a bs sized hac on steroids is what they should be. i like the flagship idea i saw in another thread about t2 bs, have the option for warfare links and corresponding bonuses with the ability to field a hefty tank and of course still be able to put out respectable dps. possibly specific bonuses designed to buff fleets beyond the warfare links (no idea what, just a thought). otherwise, i support the idea of more t2 bs.on a note about their usability, sure they won't be cheap but if they are effective and are worth it for those that can fly them who cares how much they cost? i am by no means mr. moneybags but i can afford to use my nightmare in pvp without much worry because it is effective for what i use it for.either way i would like to go ahead name the t2 abaddon before anyone else (assuming no one has beaten me to it yet), either the paradigm or the paragon. btw, i believe gargoyle was appropriate for your example ship"

12/1/2009,a bump disguised as me supporting my own topic
12/1/2009,"afaik, all deleted items are not actually deleted straight way. they are sent to an item ""graveyard"" of sorts, for about a month. so i don't think it would be too hard to implement.still, while i have not had the problem, i can see how it helps."
12/1/2009,"cloaking iv (6) requires 271,530 skill points.electronics v (1) requires 256,000.electronics iv vs v is about 210,000 sp.but that just lets you fit a covert ops cloak. to the proper ship to fit it to requires covert ops (electronics upgrades v, 512k sp). and all covert ops ships require a racial ship skill at v (for frigates it is another 512k sp).even without factoring electronics iv (about 48k?), i am still seeing 10 ranks worth of level v. or about 2.56 million sp. but that is just prereqs (doesn't count covert ops i). not the missile skills to get to torpedoes and bomb launchers (or the additional fitting skills to be able to cram that stuff in). not requiring electronics v saves about 210,000 sp (or less than 10%).now i understand not wanting more stealth bombers drifting through 0.0, but this change isn't going to cause them to sprout out of nowhere either."
12/1/2009,"missile velocity is ok with me for the most part. my biggest beef with rockets is the painfully low explosion velocity and dps. would like to see both upped at least to the point where fitting rockets to to the rocket boats gives you better performance than fitting turrets. additionally, since we're there, i think hams could use a slight damage boost to make them more viable compared to their guided heavy missile cousins. less than double dps for less than 1/3 the range and not getting the precision skill bonus is painful."
12/1/2009,"i was wondering if you could check this post here , as it has many of the points i would like to see changed with missiles. on an unrelated note, what is your opinion of destroyers (ie, should they be rebalanced, should there be more variety, can we haz another t2?? )"
12/1/2009,"had more than a few people mail me that i was their top match or close, surprised i didnt make the list. just goes to show how popular the site became i guess! all in all, i'd call it a much needed win for the whole election process."
12/1/2009,"i completely agree with you, and have been trying to point this out during the last two campaigns. here are some of my thoughts on the possible future of csm:i think dierdra did a great job with the vote match, but mainly because it is a step in the right direction. the focus is too much on the issues and not enough on personality and social skills. i believe that those skills are a true key to the successful interaction between players- csm - ccp.that is another reason why i also believe that csm candidates should be allowed to take longer terms or more terms ""in office"". we should try to develop a sort of ""csm candidate standard"" based on player and ccp feedback, and in time a group of ""professional csm officials"" will emerge.i believe once such a system will be firmly established a natural split between left and right, liberal and conservative views will occur. so when it comes to elections players will choose the most qualified candidates, based on skills, and they will choose their issues based on candidate's left or right views. of course in the world like eve purely left or right views are rare, as most candidates will want big changes in some areas (liberal) and stability in other areas (conservative). ultimately such devisions are not meant to artificially separate the candidates into parties but are rather aimed at focusing the development (legislative) process in one area. its seems that ccp has used specific player input on several occasions, relating to improvements or fixes on existing game mechanics. on the other hand, when it comes to bigger expansions they generally prefer that players do not go too deep into game design, as to leave their devs room to move. from that perspective creating a kind player political system would allow ccp to better gauge the majority vote of the players and it will give the players a stronger influence over ccp's priority list. often the big questions boil down to this: do we focus more on improving the existing or on expanding the new?"
12/1/2009,"interesting reading and many thanks to dierdra for putting in the effort (imo more effort than some of the candidates seemed to put into their public campaigns, though i guess if you have a large alliance behind you you don't need to scrabble around for votes like the rest of us )i can pretty much pinpoint where i ""screwed up"" on the questions and lowered my match scores. i should have just answered a couple of the questions that i didn't have a strong opinion of just to get a better match, though it wouldn't actually have reflected my position any better anyway, i feel it was a useful tool and hope it gets taken forward and developed for the csm 5 campaign"
12/1/2009,"i dont disagree that is extremely important that a csm member is driven, willing to put in the time and able to make proper proposals and work diplomatically with the council and ccp. however, as i said before, you cannot measure any of this.this website isnt about being the only tool for a user to decide who to vote for. it is simply a way to cut down the huge group of candidates into a smaller group of candidates that match your vision for eve. which of those candidates you choose is up to you, this is clearly advertised on the website as it encourages people to look into their shortlist in detail!so yeah, this focuses on issues and not vague notions of social skills and executive abilities because a candidates position on issues can be measured. do not try and make this website into something it isnt."

12/2/2009,"it's been about a year since the last time ccp put any new alliance logos into the game. if memory serves, it was the fall/winter 2008 expansion that saw the last addition of alliance logos. here we are, apocrypha and dominion both released and we have not seen the additon of new alliance logos.there have been many threads about this going back over the last year or so, but, here are two recent examples:/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadid=1224306/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadid=1223346ccp has been asked countless times about this. i made a thread about 6 months ago about this and the response from ccp was something along the lines of ""we're re-vamping the system"". there was some story in there about the person who was supposed to handle it having changed jobs and the person that's supposed to take it over is on vacation and will look at it when they get back. but, still, we have nothing.i, on the behalf of the countless alliances out there waiting for their logos to be implemented, am formally requesting that the csm not only look into this, but directly ask ccp what is being done about this.i know this will seem a minor thing to many people out there, but, as has been proven over and over in mmos, players like leaving their mark on the world. even if it's as simple as people seeing a unique logo when they look at the alliance info, it's a mark. it's not a difficult process, and ccp could very easily allow alliances to put their logo into the game and then have the player-base police it (i'm certain that it would not take long for someone to complain about the large phallus logo that some alliances will put in).i recently played aion and they have the legion logo submission process built into the game, and it's then automatically updated with the next server downtime. with how much more advanced eve is in comparison, i don't expect that it would be much more than a couple of hours of coding and another hour of testing to get this ready to go.so, csm, i hope that you can resolve this where ccp has seemingly ignored it."

12/2/2009,"view my latest post to see the updated stats, not the op"
12/2/2009,"ok, i was going to bump the thread about not making dust 514 a console exclusive again, but then i basically accepted that this far into its development cycle, ccp isn't going to change their minds about such a fundamental decision. so instead i'm just going to propose that dust 514 be kept a completely seperate game from eve.while the idea of dust 514 interacting with eve was initially intriguing, making it a console exclusive ruins it. while it's obvious why ccp is making it on consoles (getting a slice of the huge and immensely profitable console market), it's also the single most effective way there is of ticking off eve's massive and dedicated player base. tying the fate of the deepest, longest-running, most community-intensive and most outright hardcore mmorpg there is to a shooter community is dangerous enough, but a console shooter community? what were they thinking (apart from dollar signs)?!since eve players are, to the last man, pc gamers (not necessarily exclusively pc gamers, i'm a console gamer myself, but you have to at least be a pc gamer to play) you'd think this would make dust a no-brainer pc title. unfortunately, no brains seem to have been used here. if dust is going to have a significant effect on the eve universe, then the kind of people we want playing it are the kind of people who play eve, i.e existing eve players, not ritalin-popping 14-year old xbox players who scream racist obscenities into their headset mike and ragequit right at the pivotal point of a critical operation or start teamkilling for the lulz. pardon the stereotype, but it's a stereotype for a reason (i.e because it's true). pvp eve players either take the game (reasonably) seriously or get themselves spread all across space and there's no way we can expect this from console gamers who we won't even be able to communicate with!so by all means make dust 514 a console exclusive, but for god's sake, lose the eve connection. make it set in the eve universe if you want, but don't make us reliant on console gamers for important matters.snobby? pc elitist? face facts. we are elite. eve is serious business compared to every other mmo out there and we don't want it damaged in any way."

12/2/2009,"what reason is there to self-destruct outside of combat?why insurance when out of combat?i'd think one of the main reasons for sd is to prevent the opponent getting any loot.the other probably to deny the killmail. personally, i wouldn't mind a killmail where it states that sef-destruct was initiated and completed.i see no reason why an sd should give loot. it's not a pinata, you're not guaranteed to get something."

12/2/2009,"although i've already been beaten to this by others reubtting this point before me, i'll put my money in anyway.you're ""wrong. period."" because you're making the fundamental mistake of thinking of the caldari as the ""kinetic race"". caldari and not the ""kinetic race"". they're the ""missile race."" the same way that amarr are the ""laser race"", minmatar are the ""projectile race"" and gallente are the ""drone/blaster race"". yes, when there's a weapon which is used by all 4 races it's acceptable to flavour damage bonuses to race- i am referring specifically to bombs here. but limiting caldari damage bonuses to kinetic missile damage only is the same as amarr ships only getting a cap use bonus to one type of their laser crystals, minmatar only getting a damage bonus to one kind of ammo, or gallente only getting a damage bonus to their thermal gallente drones.and incidentally, why aren't the vengeance, malediction and heretic restricted to only getting a damage bonus to em rockets? (although i do find it amusing that the eris only gets a bonus to thermal missile damage, but the eris has a screwy weapons system anyway.)of course, you're not debating this point. you've decided your position and will defend it to the death, no matter how obviously, blatantly, provably wrong it is. i think we need to call people like you ""imbalance denialists""."
12/2/2009,"even though the faction ships have been adjusted, the vindicator is still lacking. at its current state is by at least double in cost and double in training time to be too close to what you would get in a megathron navy issue.i propose increasing the 25% damage bonus to large hybrid turrets and the 125m3 drone bay to:37.5% to large hybrid turret damage and 150m3 drone bay.this will make it the close in your face melting ship it is supposed to be. it also makes it worth training a second race battleship skill to level 5."

12/2/2009,they expressed interest after they closed the feedback. just because its done does not mean that its balanced. i guess because they are done with motherships then they are balanced? of course not.
12/2/2009,well motherships got reverted. and i think the vindicator wasnt touched as the discussion started to close to the end of the cycle. i would just say wait for dominion 1.1 and see what you get. though for the first 1-2 weeks they will be busy with new bugs introduced in dominion. i have opened 3 bugreports in the first night :s

12/2/2009,"well, ccp could always add jetcan and aggression mechanics to the tutorials. teach them what canflipping is, and the consequences of shooting back or taking from the can. give the newbies the knowledge to defend themselves, not some dumb mechanic that is not only exploitable, but it takes away from what eve is: a game of consequences."
12/2/2009,"here's what i have a problem with. that my friend is a blanket statement. i can flip all the time yet pvp in lowsec and 0.0 about everyday. but enough of that, back to the matter at hand. i'm not really sure how i feel about what you are asking. on one hand i feel there should be a a system in place to prevent this from happening on the other i feel it should remain the same. here's why: many people don't know this but you can't flip cans in the newbie starting systems. also, when you go to take out of a flipped can, a little pop up comes up and tells you, plain as day, that you can be attacked by proceeding. now you can't say i and only people like me are able to flip cans because they don't know any better, i've killed many a afk 8 month old player while doing this. it's one hell of a lesson to learn, and could cost you hours of work that soon into the game, but it's a lesson that needs to be learned. it's horrible, and they might rage-quit, but did we want that kind of person to playing anyways? are we just going for quantity now, not quality? i love eve because of stuff like can-flipping and i believe even if there is 1/10th of new players that see that and say ""wow! you really can do anything in this game!"" it's not so bad. so i suppose i can't support this, eve has gotten the amount of players it has with how it's working so far and if changing the rules to not allow this means letting 100,000 new, yet emo-quiting players, then keep it the way it is if thats the only thing that's stopping them from enjoying this wonderful game.tl:dr version- not supporting, if it ain't broke, don't fix it."
12/2/2009,so you want them to be can flipped later on and lose a hulk instead of early and lose a retriever? yeah im sure that will raise the subs!
12/2/2009,"yes. that there, that is what makes eve great. impervious people in a little bubble of invulnerability, printing isk.we need more of this. something like that new shocking undock message ""there's one guy out there that can shoot at you in the whole of eve, do you think you should undock or sit here until the nasty timer has gone away?""i think they should have a message pop ""somebody has tried to steal your stuff, before it leaves your can, would you like to withdraw from space pvp and keep your stuff? yes / no""yes, this is really what eve needs more than anything.and you know what, eve will get it to."
12/2/2009,"i'm ambivalent. as a miner, can flippers are not my friend. however, this is eve. eve's lessons are the school of pain compliance. it hurts a little now but it's for your own good.on the one hand it is a game with a ludicrous learning curve. i was blind when i first came in. you -see- the interface, you can do all the things in there, but you have no vague clue what it means or why you're doing it. in that context can flipping a new subbie is very unkind. they barely saw all the dialogs before they hear loud noises and all of as sudden their pod is blinking amidst the rubble of their once shiny space ship. you could ask the can flipper: do you -really- need to do this? what went wrong in your life that ruining someone else's game became a fun thing to do? especially someone who really has no clue yet what it's all about. i'm not saying they should get away with everything, but ninja please, cut them some slack already.on the other hand, this is eve. the can flipper is a first, valuable lesson of the rules that apply in the universe. bad things happen to good people. the kind of personality that will whine about losing their 30k isk ship is going to be a problem in their future corp. it's a harsh place, we need resilient personalities. my first hour experience in eve was being podded by a gate camper. if losing a ship is too much of a burden to bear, eve is not the right place to be. it smarts, certainly, more so when it was an expensive ship. but it is a reality of the game, that's how it works. if a new player can't accept that, eve was not their best choice of mmog.still, seeing as how can flipping can occur when one is really new and green as grass, some kind of warning might be offered. someone might be totally ok with the harshness of the game once they understand some of the basic rules, being stomped on the second hour in just isn't going to be fun. a new player is also not going to call on friends for help. he doesn't know anyone yet.i believe can flippers have cost ccp a significant amount of business already. new players are asked to accept that they can be lured into a trap, an accepted game mechanic, and to be shot at by experts against whom they have no shadow of a hope of defending themselves. lots of people just won't take it and quit before they get a real feel for the game.tl;dr: i don't like can flippers, the mechanic should stay in the game, the really new player should be informed, in consummate fashion, that this is -not- myfriendlypony land. the spaghetti -will- hit the fan.ab"
12/2/2009,that would be fine.but there's already a warning that pops up...
12/2/2009,"there's a warning that pops up for the flipp-or, but not the flipp-ee.trash in space can be taken by anyone, and yes you might become aggro'ed for it, but it is taking something you don't own.the problem is that the jetcan miner who was taught this method that isn't supported by eve doesn't understand how jetcans work.i disagree with the idea of giving the miner a chance to withdraw. i think that by putting that jetcan out there, they're already subscribing to the risks of theft.i think the learning curve is ridiculous, and having to learn these little lessons will become aggravating to new players, if not already. i think the only good solution here is to make a warning splash popup that says something like the following:"
12/2/2009,"are you talking about the null sec where people are scared of the afk cloakers? also, what is real pvp? i though pvp was when you interacted with another player in some way that removes things from his/her possession? be it isk, minerals, market share, his/her ship. you know, his/her stuff. and not always with their consent.i have always been of the mind set of ""learning by doing"". the new people will learn not to shot by doing it the first time they get can flipped. learn at the start of your eve life when you are in a frig then later when you are in a bigger and more expensive ship.lets leave it the way it is. it's called ""tough love"", treating another person harshly or sternly with the intent to help them in the long run."
12/2/2009,"eve has enough subscribers. ccp doesn't need to dummy-down the game to get more. i got here just fine with the way things are, anyway. why would i want newbies to think that they're protected everywhere they go? the whole point of eve is that there are no rules... only laws. laws can be broken without being banned from the game. why teach newbies otherwise?"
12/2/2009,"its a harsh old universe out there, full of pitfalls for the unwary. if you 'fix' can flipping for new players, when are they going to learn, and what will you fix next. if being killed by a flipper turns them off eve then its not the game for them."
12/2/2009,"before this degenerates into a flame war...oh, too late :|anyway, can flip restrictions are already enforced in starting systems, doesn't fix the problem but helps in the little way ccp wants it to."

12/2/2009,"with the advent of the fleet finder, i was wondering if we could step it up a notch. what i am proposing is a real-time graphical fleet representation tool for the fc.here is how i think it should work:-the fc can pull up a map that shows all of his fleet members positions in space, their current hp, their ship type and any hostile forces in visual range-the map would look like a simplified version of the system map, and if fleetmates are in adjacent systems, the map would connect the systems at the gates-if fleet mates are not in adjacent systems, the map will show a dotted line connecting the two outgates of the system, according to the autopilot-fleet members and hostile forces show up as colored icons-perhaps it would even be possible to give someone in the alliance or corp a role that allows them to see all fleets that are deployed and their relative positions"
12/2/2009,positions of fleet members in system map just got removed as they never really worked.hostily position should not be on the map at all. thats why you got scouts.
12/2/2009,"good grief, why are we being forced to bump a topic which alreqdy has this much support again?"
12/2/2009,"discrodia please allow me to throw my 0.02 isk into this idea with some of my ideas and some numbers. first the current mechanic uses ""defender missiles"" these missiles are no more than ammo to fit in any existing launcher that automatically track and chase down incomming missiles. the damage that these defender missiles is 70hp's of explosive damage and travel 7500 m/sec (base before skills and mods) lets look at the targets of the point defense weapons. rockets: 70hp @ 2250 m/secstandard missiles: 70hp @ 3750 m/secheavy missile: 70hp @ 3750 m/secheavy assault: 70hp @ 2250 m/seccruise missile: 70hp @3750 m/secstandard torps: 280hp @ 1500 m/seccitadel torp: 1920hp @ 1100 m/seccitadel cruise: 1920hp @ 3500 m/seclight/heavy/cruise f.o.f missile: 70hp @ 3750 m/secnow the proposed weapon needs to be able to track a target flying right at it. i would recommend either 3 sizes of weapons (small, medium or large) or ammo/crystal in the same sizes for existing guns. obviously using existing guns and a special ammo would be mirroring what is already in place. assuming this using high rate of fire high tracking weapons, ex pulse lasers, autocannon projectile, either blaster or gatteling rail gun for hybrid. using small turrets should be best to track the fast moving rockets, standard missiles. these should have no more range than 10km and should take only one solid hit (maybe two) per missile taken down. using medium turrets should one hit heavy or cruise missiles and need multiple hits to take down standard torps with about a 15-20km rangeusing large turrets should be able to take out a standard torp, and take at least 3 shots to hit the citadel torps/cruise missiles. to help with balance the large turrets should not be able to track anything faster than a missile traveling at 1150 m/sec.also the medium turrets should not be able to effectivly take down standard torps or capital missiles. this would lead to small turrets being used for most of the work. with their limited range and only being able to take out maybe 2-3 missiles per turret would still offer a good deal of protection. example of ammo for a small turretdefender small projectile ammo:35 kinetic 35 explosive range bonus 50% charge size small tracking speed multiplier: 1.50usable only in small auto-cannon projectile weaponsas far as the rest of the ammo it would follow the same line and just scaled up for the increase in size of the targets. if you want to take out drones or frigs, use standard small turrets, or your own drones if able imo. i hope this helps a little."
12/2/2009,"minmatar split-weapon ships start out with 2 strikes against them- firstly that you need to use bcus as well as gyros to get full damage bonuses, secondly that the second bonus, which only affects half your weapons, takes the place of a real second bonus such as those gained by other ships. technically the typhoon only has one bonus, which is already ""5% per level to large projectile and missile rate of fire"". this makes it a blatantly inferior ship to its closest equivalent, the armageddon, which gets bonuses to both cap use and rof (the scorpion and dominix are different ships altogether).i'm with the op. split bonuses that do the same thing, only in a more inefficient manner, make no sense. it's just bad ship design."
12/2/2009,supported!
12/2/2009,would be nice. i understand lore reasons why the minmatar have split weapon systems but i don't understand why the bonuses can't be merged. where's the harm in that?
12/2/2009,"i'd prefer gyros to give a 8.5% boost to missile damage. it's a small change but makes up for the weakness in split weapons systems without having to rebalance the minmatar ships, whilst not challanging bcu's.i'm supporting the proposal because i think something should be done."
12/2/2009,"the volume given for an exotic dancer (singular, a db error making them plural) is for more than the 'body' that is being transported. that volume also takes into consideration the requirements of life support and little else (think: sleeper coffin or suspended animation vat)."
12/2/2009,"hey, look i like a good backside, but huge is not my thing. however, my meaning is there are lots of small things that many people would consider insignificant or irrelevant, all i am suggesting is a one person (intern even) to take on the role of the boring bit of sensible database housekeeping. small revisions, nothing big but just such that little things start to make sense. lets face it, if they cannot get something that trivial right what does that imply for the rest of the data all our beloved items are founded on.that i would accept as a measure for the volume required to transport one dancer, stasis chamber plus luggage. less volume could also be assumed, if one was to just dump them in the hold with no amenities, assuming a dancer is approx 1.7m x 0.3m x 0.4m - 25% (shape factor) = 0.153m3.however this was just an example, an obvious one i though we could all relate to in some way as being nonsense data for for the item entry.to say that the weight of the cargo is irrelevant is well... wrong. as you add payload (mass or weight) to the ship you will directly affect the global mass of the ship itself and thus the performance of the ship both in maneuverability and acceleration.zirk"
12/2/2009,"yes, this is completely far fetched, and probably too early to even propose, but what the hell: i think wormhole dwellers should eventually be given the option to spend fuel on perhaps an outpost that accompanies a pos. within this outpost, players could ""dock"" in their pods, and exit their pods to a meager space outpost. perhaps the luxury of these outposts could vary with price and fuel expenditure. needless to say, unknowing whether or not the technology would even allow this, i think it would be... sweet."

12/2/2009,"has anyone noticed that the ""inbox"" tab and the ""all mails"" tab are exactly the same?when you click on your inbox, there is no way to separate out your personal mails from your alliance and corporation mails. the only real way to differentiate the mails is to look on that column on the right side of the mailbox.this seems a bit counterintuitive. i petition that the inbox be allocated solely for personal mails received and that alliance mails and corporation mails not be shown in this menu. that's what the ""all mails"" tab is for.i notice that every mail that come into your mail system is automatically tagged with an inbox label. it would be great if your alliance and corporation mails did not have this inbox label associated with them. that way, you don't have to manually deselect the inbox label from all of your alliance and corporation mails."
12/2/2009,"go to the corp label -> mark all mails -> right click -> remove label -> ""inbox""same for alliance and mailinglists. and suddenly the inbox is more readable."
12/2/2009,"i knew this was going to come up and it is a very valid fix for the problem except for one thing. every single mail that comes into your mail system is marked with an ""inbox"" label. this label forces every mail that comes in to be dumped into the ""inbox"" label.for an example, you can go through your corp mail and select all of them and deselect the ""inbox"" label from all of them. this is all well and good, except when you receive a new corp mail. this new corp mail gets dumped into the ""inbox"" label. this forces you to go back into the corp label and select the new mail, and then deselect the ""inbox"" label from the new corp mail.here's the thing, why not have all of the alliance mails be only labeled with the ""alliance"" label and all of the corp mails only get labeled with the ""corp"" label. this way the applicable mails go exactly where they are meant to go and the personal mails don't get mixed up, forcing people to micro-manage their mail."

12/2/2009,make the new lack of borders around buttons optional.this new design with the narrow gradients and the lack of visual distinction between elements is causing unneeded eye strain.please allow me to turn the borders back on as eve is currently making my eyes go all funny.... i can't play for any more then 20mins at a time like this.
12/2/2009,"except that defenders can be launched from rocket launchers, which have a much higher rof than cruise launchers. also, since most people group missiles nowadays, and defenders deal more damage than a single missile's hp, a single defender kills 1 cruise missile plus a percentage of the next. so, no, you don't need nearly as many missile launchers to counter a missile boat.a lot of work would have to go into making defenders both useful and not overpowered."
12/2/2009,"those resists are the same as those on the vulture and you don't hear people complaining about that. we can always tweak the rest of the shield numbers if they're too overpowered anyway, i never did have a great head for stats. it's just an example.well i was just bothered that there wasn't a t2 bs-hulled main battle ship. neither the marauder nor the blackops ships are really made for battle- the marauders are optimized for pve, while blackops are... well, the name says it all. neither can be unqualifiedly stated to be simply better than a t1 bs in battle, which makes them, as t2 bss, an outright bad choice because of their absurd cost. yes, a hac costs more than 10 times the price of its equivalent t1 cruiser hull, so why do we see so many of them? because they're better. i just want to see a better battleship. i was just surprised that gargoyle hadn't already been taken. i like the name 'paragon'. anyone have any suggestions for the hyperion and maelstrom-based ships? gallente ship names are fairly random, but there seem to be quite a few based in latin/greek, so how about 'carnifex'? ('executioner'.) yes, i know we have a ship called executioner, but it's in latin so it's ok, right? for the maelstrom, i'd suggest the name 'stalker'."
12/2/2009,"herschel,sorry to see you were overlooked once again. i hardly see anyone else on these political forums at the same time as active and energetic and yet continuously clear and coherent as you are. if your views weren't so far from mine, i'd definitely have voted for you and i might just do so the next time, just to see some justice in these elections and you on the council."
12/2/2009,"<----i want to thank everyone who helped with advertising and namedropping, i've received dozens of mails and numerous convos from random guys i never heard of before, telling me that they voted for me because someone that did knew me pointed them in my direction.i have quite a list of items ready but keep in mind that i am here for all of you - that means if you have an idea or know someone that does, poke me and i will do my best. i can't do it on my own though, and i want to make use of your collective knowledge in making this a better game.consider this a victory for everyone who likes to see pretty 'splosions in the sky.- sok."

12/2/2009,thanks to all of you for your votes and more then a few interesting chats and ideas (keep them coming)
12/2/2009,"asolutely, this site is a great tool, helping the voters to sift through the candidates. i am merely pointing out that your effort to create such a tool should encourage other such efforts aimed at improving the whole process. my hat is off to you sir. however one could also argue that even though sorting candidates by issues is more logical and straight forward, focusing only on that aspect actually obscures the real purpose of the csm which is to influence ccp's decisions. correct me if i am wrong here, ( i am really guessing here, based on observations alone) but it seems that simply heaving strong opinion, on any number of issues, does not automatically win ccp's attention. i suspect that the more coherent csm is as a group the greater the chance of their success with ccp. therefore, ability to see the big picture, and all those negotiations skills are crucial at every stage of this process.of course so far csm in my opinion has been surprisingly effective, but i imagine, that their voice will get much stronger if more people vote, and we have more skilled candidates.i sincerely hope that the pre-election evaluation process, to which you have contributed greatly, will expand in the future to include those ""vague"" skills as well. in my experience, defining the ""vague stuff"" is as important if not more important, because in the end it leads to much greater transparency. the more clarity the whole csm concept has the more voters and so on...my comment was not intended as a criticism of any kind, i am simply trying to contribute, based on my understanding."
12/2/2009,"well, you came close. hopefully they will need an alternate again on this cms. too bad there were so many 'tards who based their decisions on a ticker rather then research."
12/2/2009,thanks to all who supported me. i came in as first alternate so it's a pretty fair bet that i will get to do some work at least in this csm and i'll certainly be running again for csm 5.i'm certainly very encouraged that i polled so high without any official alliance support.
12/2/2009,"so, about time, isn't it?oh wait, ccp is busy trying to deal with the flood of issues..."

12/3/2009,"as a caldari pilot heavily invested into covert/black ops and such, i cannot stress how important it is to have the right tools. the black ops battleship concept is fabulous. the implementation is epic fail!just in general, there is no doubt that any t2 ship should have superior stats than its t1 base. having sub-par hp is inexcusable. give them at least the same structure and armor as t1, if not more. give them t2 resists. i don't expect them to go toe-to-toe with a golem or rohk. that is not their role. but they are battleships for crying out loud, not battle-cruisers.the role is called black ops. they are supposed to drop ships in behind enemy lines, follow, wreak havoc, then get everyone the hell out. why do they not have covert cloak when every other ship in that role does? another fail. make it happen.jump gate range is too short. 1 or 2 jumps for range is totally fail. may as well just use the darn gates. oh, wait. no covert ops cloak. fail!price tag = cha-ching! $$$$$$$$$$$. are you kidding? no one flies these, not because they are hard to produce, very rare, or even difficult to find. but because they suck. with so little demand for them, why are they still so expensive? manufacturers should be giving these away by now! slash prices to increase purchase incentive. more folks will buy them and perhaps find more inventive ways to use them.fail x4 = epic fail. these issues can be fixed easily. so lets make it happen."
12/3/2009,yes please. eve is practically renowned for eyestrain. end that.
12/3/2009,i would say some minor changes at least no need to overhaul the whole freaking thing. also letting us choose our font perhaps?
12/3/2009,"it wasn't widely supported - the ab role bonus in place of a 4th bonus (ie. it wasn't a role bonus, they put it at a 4th bonus) was pants on head ******ed."
12/3/2009,"af dont need much, but they need a buff. for the price of a af hull you can buy and fit a few cruisers that are in almost all ways better than a af.a hac does almost bs sized dmg and tank in a much smaller package for nearly the same price, this should be the case with af, give them a slight dmg and bonus fix and they will be back in line with t2."
12/3/2009,"i didn't mean the ab bonus specifically, although at least that gave afs a better defined role in heavy tackle. i just meant any boost to them at all so that i'm not paying 25mil to do something i could do in better in a cruiser for maybe 5mil after insurance."
12/3/2009,"notes@ the wiki pagerof penalty is fine as isbonuses changing - no! a small pg buff all around - yeshp buff - yesdessies aren't meant for knife fighting, really, they're meant to swat frigs from afar. as far as that goes, they're fine, though cat could use its bonus changed to optimal and coercer could use a 20% cap use reduction instead of 10%. hp: give them roughly the hp of a tier 3 cruiser (1.9k armour and hull, but not shield). built-in hull resists would also be interesting. this would also make them a little better at knife fighting. not sure if this should propagate to dictors or not (probably not)also, give them another slot: low for minnie/cald, med for amarr/gall.main problem with dessies is they don't have the survivability to hang with snipe hacs/bs/etc. as far as the frig killing goes, they die, but one zealot takes a fancy to you and welp."
12/3/2009,"yes please for the reduced sig, boosted pg, extra lows for cormorants, and increased hp. however i am begging you to change the cormorant to a missile boat and the catalyst to a drone boat, or at least introduce a new t1 destie that can do that."
12/3/2009,"i support better destroyers, or another t1 hull."
12/3/2009,poor destroyers are so neglected.a sig radius decrease would be welcome too.
12/3/2009,not all ships need to be for pvp. my cormorant makes an excellent salvager.4 x tractor beam4 x salvagersalvage tackle x 3currently ab with mwd to come.it has its use ... just not in combat.
12/3/2009,"bumping again, caldari navy hookbill now has 3 launchers which is all i ever wanted for christmas, problem is rockets still suck!"
12/3/2009,"rockets need a fix, they are 'sposed to be anti frig missiles but they fail for this. af are fun to fly but you only are gonna pick a missile one up if you are gonna kill something much bigger in a fleet."
12/3/2009,any measure to throw sand in the cogs of isk sellers and improving account security can count on my support.i'll raise this for csm meeting 2.wiki issue here.
12/3/2009,"excellent and detailed suggestion, t'amber! since you are an alternate and not allowed to raise issues, i wish to raise it for you. i have credited you fully in the wiki document ccp will see. i wish i could give more than one thumb-up for this but i can't!wiki document here"
12/3/2009,"i like this idea. eve has needed something like this, at least an in-game calender for the corp for a long time."
12/3/2009,"i searched and could not find a csm post on this topici would like to propose for further discussion the battle recorder. i forward ninjaholic's thread in features thread as it contains all the information needed.battle recordera summary:a battle recorder that retains info on ship actions, modules etc, that does not record audio and video itself, but reproduces it within an eve client or similar program (if eve client itself can not be rigged (pun) to do this. )i request the csm and all interested in such a recorder to throw their support behind this, and please encourage ccp to place this firmly on their develpment future"
12/3/2009,"this is a good idea and if it could be done without massive server overloading it would be a very useful tool, for newscasts or for movie making. the ability to view a battle from any view and full camera movements would be uber.being able to share your flightdata with others and sync their data with yours for a more complete picture would be sweet! thanks to csm4 for supporting this idea and for taking it to ccp.-t'amber"

12/3/2009,"1) corps should be able to grant medals to players outside the corp. the reason for this is that alliances can then give medals to their members, without having to recreate the same thing over and over in all member corps. ceos could also award people with medals for services rendered without requiring them to join the corp. already brought this up last year and ccp said they would fix hopefully within the year, well the year is almost over and i don't see it happening any time soon. do it now, especially when we get spacebook it would be nice to see the medals there! with the two-way contact lists we get in the future, medal-griefing (which ccp used as excuse not to implement this soon) can be prevented by only making medals grantable to people that acknowledge you as friend.2) medal text should be changable for a fee. right now the only option is to make a new one, and have the borked medal clutter the medal list for all eternity.3) medals should be deletable (to prevent clutter) and revokable. dishonorable discharge? hand in your medals!4) minor bug and reported, but ccp said working as intended: when a player deletes a medal from his list, it won't disappear and actually clutter the array for all eternity. in addition the medal can't be granted again. fix this."

12/3/2009,"i already brought this up with the current csm board but i'll post it here for some thumbs.currently individual players can sort their assets by many criteria, though it could certainly be better.unfortunately corporations, which can very well have considerably more material than individual pilots, cannot sort their deliveries or other corporate assets in any way.i would like that this functionality be brought to corporation assets; at the very least sort by region/constelation/system. running around picking up market goods is a complete pain in the ass with the deliveries tab as it is now."
12/3/2009,"badly needed, ever so much!"
12/3/2009,if there is any change it could be fixed so t2 ships didnt pay out less than their t1 ver.
12/3/2009,"your wish is granted; all t2 ships pay out considerably more than the t1 version, generally about 50-100% more iirc. note: you will have to actually insure them to get the full payout."
12/3/2009,"i've always found it amusing that the game has a race that is corporate run (caldari) and a race that is heavily involved in the entertainment industry (gallente), but in-game marketing/advertising is extremely subdued, if non-existent. not even a ticker in stations. if for no other reason than rp, there should be ads in the game.where would advertisements be?the easiest solution is to have it interspersed with some form of in-game news... in the game. let's be blunt, as nice as it is to have the occasional news story from isd, they are simply too few and far between for a game with as much going on at any given time as eve. even if it was nothing more than system generated announcements... ""[ascn] titan destroyed in c9n-cc"" or ""goons, pl, it battle in 3-in0v, 631 ships destroyed"" showing up in a ticker for everyone in-game would improve the general recognition across the player base of what is going on in eve.those are just the events that should probably be broadcast across the game. it would be nice to have local news announcements as well, the smaller the scale of the event, the more localized the news announcement would be. obviously announcing locally every time a ship dies in a fleet battle would be silly, so there would have to be some delay to some announcements so the system can have time to gain perspective on the event.that knowledge would serve several purposes. it would increase player interaction (see pvp) as such events would attract people to the location of something that is happening. it would potentially help retain new players as they generally don't have the foggiest clue of what is happening in the game until someone tells them - and eve is heavily focused on being involved in something with other players.who would advertise and why?low involvement in eve events, corporations, organizations, and player-made services points to the fact that knowledge of such things comes by word-of-mouth. many things that are ""advertised"" in the forums are often only found by serious forum-ers or mentioned during in/out-game conversations. there are so many things players have come up with that are missed by the vast majority of the players.one of the most glaring examples of this is the csm. several people in my corp hadn't even heard of csm when i mentioned that it was the last day for voting. if there was actual advertising in-game, and by extension csm advertising, i would be willing to bet voter turn-out would be higher simply by the increased awareness.the corporation finder that was added a while back was sort of a half-hearted advertising addition. if corporations/alliances could promote in a visible way in the game, finding a good fit in a good corporation/alliance would be easier.my experience has been that i find out about most in-game events after they happen when word-of-mouth gets around. allowing people to advertise their event (tournament, lottery, stock ipo, whatever) would significantly improve involvement in these events.advertising scale and costjust like rl, the wider the audience, the more expensive the ad is. additionally, things like the average system population would also be a good modifier for ad cost. color coding the ads based on local/constellation/regional/eve would also serve to give perspective on the ads as well.what about unwanted advertising/spam?obviously, there would need to be some way of flagging ads as inappropriate. additionally, the ability to customize advertising (blocking ads by standing, and/or block lists) would be important.one huge thing though is that ads would cost isk, to get a mildly broad audience would require a more substantial amount of isk. the larger the amount of isk, the easier to track it back to its source. gold/isk spam would likely lead to ccp being able to track down who is doing it far better than they can with the current local spam in jita (for instance)."
12/3/2009,"allow a corp/alliance to ""advertise"" a news announcement. basically trumpeting something they did or had happen to them to a wider audience than the news announcement would have normally gone to.it might be nice to have a news announcement (probably local) for completing a story line mission - rp value at least, i mean they are supposed to be important missions.for militias, a constellation or regional announcement that a claim bunker is being flipped might be a good news announcement.for 0.0 the same could be true but for sov - i.e. the claim unit is being attacked would be worthy of regional news i would think. blockade units going up would probably be constellation news worthy?also, if ccp ever decides to fix ""local"" which everyone hates in one way or another to something new that everyone will hate in one way or another, the news ticker could be potentially be part of such a change. simply announcing that a noticeable number of people have entered the system (the local population doubles in a short period of time - or something like that).an example of where this would be a major change is jita. jita should be like times square, not this silly (free) local spam. if people had to pay for jita ads, there would be a lot less ""rattlesnake for 500m (1 unit tritanium)"" spam. not to mention the gold/isk spam that can often completely clog local."
12/3/2009,get rid of the dumb timer between scans atleast make it .1sec
12/3/2009,"what about a cache? you update the cache every 1 second, but let people spam a local cache as often as they like.server lag is reduced since you do not update every time you hit the button, but it lets you scan practically constantly to help you narrow down the ""last known location"" faster.some people will bemoan the fact that with a cache, you might locate someone, but in actual fact they left 0.99s ago. considering that they could leave the location within the few seconds that it takes you to warp there, an extra second is not a huge difference."
12/3/2009,"yes it is!fw is for people who want to pvp. whcih is great but missioning as it was, allowed many people to earn over 100 mill an hour. nowhere else is this possible. i couldnt make this much isk in o.o and the difficulty is much higher out there.having pickable agents is a very bad idea and this seems like a good response from ccp."
12/3/2009,"this is a public announcement:there is no nerf.just request, accept, quit, request, accept, quit, request, accept, quit, request, accept, quit... you only get standings loss when you decline missions,you may now resume your farming activities."
12/3/2009,side note: ccp is aware of the bug and will fix it. ;)
12/3/2009,"i do not support the proposal put forth here, for one single reason: consistency.fw missions are still missions, and should follow all the same rules and restrictions as other missions.that means no cherry-picking of missions without penalty."
12/3/2009,"lol ... it's not a bug is it, they are just stupid and didn't change it."
12/3/2009,"not supported. the bottom line is that the ability to select which missions you will take, without penalty, is part of the pay out problem. both the reward and the salad bar are interconnected, you can't simply hold one constant and change the other. right now fw missions allow for a isk/hour rate that seems out of balance, when compared to just about every other in game isk generation operation. in as much as that is true, fw missions need rebalancing, and that effort should include all aspects of running those missions."
12/3/2009,"love it, it allows for alliance/corp fleets to know what people can do with out providing easy intel to enemies. (i say easy intel cause theres always char sheets, and if the alliance/corp is very diligent they could create a database on every enemy's capabilities, not feasible though)"
12/3/2009,"should have been that way to begin with, at least at the corp level."
12/3/2009,"supported. i would like to have my certificates posted for my alliance, but would rather keep that information away from anyone else."

12/3/2009,"nice calculation you've got there... but your forgetting one oh so important fact. if this is introduced it will cut down the price for these gasses immensely as the market is not static.also you're mining in a very hostile environment with only the scanner as your eyes, i wouldn't want to do that afk for one, risk vs reward comes to mind.to op:this has been needed for a looooong time as the situation is comparable to the old way of mining in battleships way back. either a gas strip miner or a specialized ship with compression abilities would be good."

12/3/2009,i agree with veshta that there are many things wrong with fw. ankh has raised this particular issue in the past and i agree that the spawning system is borked and ccp should fix it as they promised to csm2 (this issue was scheduled to be fixed right after apocrypha).for the sake of continuity i'll raise this issue for csm meeting 2.wiki document here.
12/3/2009,"plex spawning is not so big issue at all.there was at least 10 bugs related to fw and ccp managed to fix only one in dominion. most of those bugs are somehow exploitable and people use those bugs to benefit everyday. it is hard to say if they use it on purpose or is it just accident but i've seen many who do it on purpose.but abusing bugs is not the biggest problem. problem is that original planning of fw has so quite amazing things that are 'working as intended'. previous members of csm has not taken those things up at all.fw needs lot of rethinking to make it work like players want, we need at least better reason than rp to take systems so we get real fighting for systems, now pvp in fw is just for fun and die for nothing."
12/3/2009,"nothing like running a major for 10 minutes, warping out to help a friend next system over, to come back and seeing the plex has dissapeared. only recently have i learned this is a bug, or exploit, depending on who and how it is used. somehow warping out of a plex while within range of it while it is counting down causes it to bug and continue to count down but not giving any points, plus not respawning until the next dt.issues like these are all over. this stuff is getting on my nerves. how may hours have i wasted orbiting buttons or fighting wts to get a ****ing bugged plex. days spent running plexes only to see your work undone one morning after dt by the opposite side running a few 40k stabbed frigates to despawn plexes and decontest systems, having no more plexes to run where you want them, notwithstanding the fact that work that takes dozens of man hours can be undone by alt-tabbing a new trial account every 15 minutes to move on to the next plex.then there was this isk printing machine called fw that we all abused to no end to farm. their ""fix"" doesnt fix **** and only frustrates more people by having them press an extra button, essentially increasing mission browsing time by 50%. every alt in eve can join fw and farm these missions now. it takes no team effort, just mindless farming.if ccp doesn't do anything about fw soon i may as well consider moving on for greener pastures where there are actually objectives and meaning to what you do. in fw space you are treated as a second class customer, where your game is not important enough to warrant a week long of dev work to fix a dozen bugs that have been documented and implement something into the game that players have proposed everywhere over and over again to make thing more enjoyable.bugs, npc imbalance, dt spawn mechanics, use of alts or gimmicks to run plexes, fw mission farming to generate hundreds of billions of isk for night effort, which destroys pvp because suddenly everyone can farm for carriers and has no time for fights, and who is to blame them? there is no reward for fighting besides the adrenaline rush and kms, no objective besides a couple of words on the left top screen. why spend 20 minutes fighting npcs in a major when you could be making 100mil isk in the meantime running missions. sometimes with no risk as all you need is a cloaky stealth bomber.do something about this before it is too late and we leave lowsec for good."
12/3/2009,fully supported. this is just one of the many problems in fw that could use some serious attention on the part of ccp.
12/3/2009,"like evevoice can be enabled without turning on all the extra sounds.so ""audio alerts"" should be able to be enabled without any other sounds.an extra bonus would be the ability to assign audio alerts to a specific channel on a soundcard.this would allow users to of headphones route it to their speakers instead.at the very least give it a separate volume slider so that all other sounds can be turned down to 0."

12/3/2009,"the npcs in fw need a defined role. regardless of what role you envision for them, they fail to fulfill it.1) npcs of different factions add very different difficulty levels to complexes.edit: as i was told, this is already being addressed - sorry for not being up to date there :-) the 2nd point remains.2) npcs care too much about standingsthe fw complex npcs will not shoot you if you have high standings with their faction, even if you are in a hostile militia. in the actual primary hostile militia, this is somewhat balanced by gaining standings fast for capturing complex, and thus losing enemy faction standing fast, so you can not do this for long. but if you are in the ""off militia"" (e.g. caldari for minmatar, amarr for gallente, etc.), you do not gain or lose standings for plexing.this leads to the situation where the most effective offensive plexing is done by a rookie alt with sufficient standings in the ""off militia"", as they can run offensive plexes without npc interference, i.e. a t1 frigate is enough for even unrestricted complexes; and as the ""off"" militia do not get any standings from plexing, so do not lose that ability.i do not think that this is the way fw should be played, so this game mechanic has to change.proposed solution: have fw complex npcs shoot members of hostile militias regardless of their standings. alternatively, to diminish the ability of third parties to interfere, have fw complex npcs shoot everyone who is not part of their associated militia or the allied militia. (if you need an rp justification: hell, you are trespassing on a very important military installation, even if you're blue, gtfo! and yes, i'm in one of those 3rd parties, so i'll hate that change, but it's a lot better than the current situation.)"
12/3/2009,first part has already been raised by erik finnegan in csm3 and will be fixed.second part i agree with but i do think that allies should be able to capture eachother's plexes without being shot at by npcs.
12/3/2009,"i must have missed that, sorry. for the curious, here is the link i found:"
12/3/2009,strongly supported. the current situation is just ridiculous.
12/3/2009,"aaaaah so that's why i saw damar hanging out with amarr plexers didn't know this was even possible, supported"
12/3/2009,"standings has been issue since begining of fw.been used before to cap.fight in plexs by many. me included.does need to be adressed.now tha tdamar/perv alts doing it on industrial scale in minnmatar/amarr space, look forward to lack of any meaning full plex warfare as is situation in gal/cal.this is one reason why mr. damar was unsuitable as a csm canidate."
12/3/2009,"strongly supported without further need to justify why. not just broken. it's insane. and is currently exploited on an industrial level by said characters, this will break the -so far- fair and working amarr-minmatar factional warfare.act fast please."

12/3/2009,working as intended. (c) ankhesentapemkah
12/3/2009,"fully supported.and i know why this thread is here. it is because it is what we do in matar space right now.however, according to ccp and ex-csm members (of zod's party) it is working as intended. we asked ccp two months ago if this is exploit or bug and would they mind if we used it against matar. answer was outright ""no, go ahead"".now, let me state clearly. this tactic is incredibly lame, broken and stupid. and in fact i feel dirty for doing it.because we did not get our candidate into csm who would have wanted to fix the issues. we dont belive ankh's party would since she was happy to use this tactic.we are simply going to make this issue so big and broken that ccp has to take action and correct the fw bugs, this included which gallente still uses against us, along with bug that causes friendly npc to open fire on friendly militia, also used by gallente. thank you.damar rocarionbrigadier general"
12/3/2009,"forgot to check the support box, oh well. doing it now.agreed, this is stupid mechanic and should be fixed.i'd like to point out that ankhesentapemkah or eric didn't want to address this issue while ankhesentapemkah was using it to capture caldari plexes during her time in the gallente militia, double standards ftw i guess."
12/3/2009,"tbh, this:.... that sounds a little bit like you are whining andimho ... makes you a hypocrite.now we all understand that that is broken but neither the amarr and the matari were using it (yet - that level) so although this was broken you could have said that both sides were on an unspoken mutual agreement to not abuse this and ""try"" to play the game as intend.now because it is broken for ""your"" war you have to spoil it for the others, who are trying to play the game as intended and out of their own will are not abusing the system?i do appreciate your support, but tbh, i would feel more ""supported"" if you would stop doing that."
12/3/2009,because we did not get our candidate into csm as i said this is why you lost csm. people know what you are.
12/3/2009,"the question whether a game mechanic is ""good"" or ""bad"" does not depend on whether it is ""unbalancing enough"", but on whether it encourages the kind of game play you want to have encouraged.this game mechanic encourages the game play where you create an alt, get him high standings, and then run offensive plexes in very cheap ships, primarily avoiding pvp (as it's a very low-sp alt).that does not seem like the kind of game play i want to encourage in fw.hence, this should be changed."
12/3/2009,stupidly broken mechanic is stupidly broken.
12/3/2009,"agreed, this needs to be fixed and with priority.."
12/3/2009,"that's the same response i got when i reported it as a potential problem, so don't twist it on me, i also reported it, right from the start, and got the same stupid reply by ccp as you did. ""yeah this is working as intended, go use it!""but we all know that the only reason you use this bug is because your untrained alts can't deal with the strong minmatar npcs, like they could with the gallente npcs, and this is just a lame excuse. npcs which you didn't consider a problem. you always whined about me using it, and now you use it yourself. you are a hypocrite and you ruin the spirit of fw, just like you did with your army of untrained alts and exploits to make timers count down magically on the gallente/caldari front.go ahead and abuse this. the sooner ccp will take away the broken plexing system completely, and reset the systems to their original state.oh yes one more thing. why is this issue a problem for you? there is noone using this against you, and if there was, you can just capture everything back with your alts and timer exploits. so the real reason is that you just want to screw up everyone else's joy in fw, just like you guys always did. selfish, hypocritical, and against the best interests of eve. i'm glad you never made it to csm, as you are totally unsuitable.i'd like to point out that that was the only valid way and affordable for a solo player to deal with the caldari npcs as well as the alts and exploits used, which mr. damar thinks are perfectly balanced and working as intended."
12/3/2009,"so, why didnt you had any interest to fix it during your term in csm and quite contrary, constantly bragged about using the standings to capture plexes to me when we chased you away from plexes? this is a legitimate question and i'm sure you would like to answer to all those concerned about faction war. in fact, you said to me and pervs ""working as intended"" many times. so, now that we decided to do the same to show what is wrong in fw, it is bug/exploit in your opinion? strange logic i must say.damar rocarionbrigadier general"
12/3/2009,"but didn't think it needed to be fixed? you could have done something good for fw for once. after all, you do take credit for fixing lag issues, having something to do with lolbalanced fw missions etc etc, surely you could have had this one fixed too? i guess you were too busy taking the caldari plexes. who is this mysterious we you speak of? we do this because ccp doesn't react to a few individuals taking advantage of this, we shall see if they care when a few more do it.and how are you not a hypocrite? i remember you bragging in local about this working as intended and so on. (well, you didn't deny being a hypocrite...)yes we will, just like you. the only way? how does this justify you using it? how about making some friends? i heard it can help you a long way."
12/3/2009,"actually that makes you a hypocrite as well.if you used this, you were ruining the spirit just like he is now.if you have found out about this and reported it, that's good, but if you continued to use this, no matter if you want to ""proof a point"" or get an unfair advantage you're not better as any other common exploiter.and i say exploiter as you see this as broken mechanism that needs to be fixed. thus you are ""exploiting"" a broken mechanism according to your own standards.i hope this was meant to be ironic, because before damar started ""playing the loophole"" amarr and minmatar were so far happy with their ""meaningless occupancy"". it was all driven my ""incharacterly driven pride"" and fun in having pvp.just because caldari and gallente got a broken toy and dont like to play with it they dont have to ruin it for the amarr and minmatar who were at least so creative to play with it even though it is broken. if you (in a general sense and only loosely aimed at ankhesentapemkah and damar) got a problem with the state of fw adress it to ccp.just ruining the game for other is not ""proving a point"".it's just griefing.so we got two hypocrites pointing fingers at each other pointing out that ""the other"" is a hypocrite.this would almost be funny if you two wouldnt be ruining the game for others."
12/3/2009,"this tactic is most efficient way to conquer all system.this system shows what happen if you remove npc from plexes or make them inefficient (like amarr npc is now), our alts does not have to care about those at all.this method also proves that plex spawning is not an issue if you attack on whole area, not only in 1 or 2 systems.here was only couple things what this can show, but we all can learn from it if we want.fact is that this is legit method at this moment, and every one knew it exists, if minmatar was not prepared for it they can only look at mirror.and i find it funny how minmatar is crying about it while they had use some of the methods in caldari space on some scale all the time.but maybe all lame things are just ok if others does not use them against you.we did not invent any of these methods, we just put them all together and made lamest machine in fw history.and last i want to thank ankh for making fw missions easiest way to grind alts for this operation and earn some nice amounts of lp. what is ironic is that these lame traitor alts has millions of minmatar lp to use"
12/3/2009,"surprise, i did ask ccp to fix this, just like i asked them to fix the cloaking exploit and the timer exploit, and the whole plexing mechanics which basically encourages people (like me) to avoid pvp while they run plexes. i used this tactic to become luminaire general and hoped this would wake up ccp and get them to fix it.i told them that the current plexing mechanics of fw make it more profitable to use recycled unskilled alts which avoid pvp, than to use established characters who fight over plexes.why i bragged to you about it? cause you were bragging about your own alts and exploits, and because you were always smacktalking and insulting me, rather than hearing me out and working with me to fix the issues that troubled fw.do you think i was in fw just for my own fun? not really. it was homework which ccp gave to me as part of the csm. when i was in csm1, empyrean age was just released, and ccp asked me to write a document about factional warfare. i had tested fw on sisi before launch and saw it was released in a pretty incomplete state, so i thought, ""hey, i can make a difference for these players if i specialize here, none of the other csm seem to care"". i didn't have the knowledge of the game that the 0.0 players had, and i just thought this was the best way to contribute to the community as i could. so i signed up with amarr, my favorite faction (surprise!), learned the ins and outs, became the first divine commodore, and wrote a long document about the flaws of fw.the standings issue was noticed somewhere in june 2008, got together with some amarr players which i plexed with at that time, and one of them reported it. we got the reply that it was working as intended, as it was a necessary evil which allowed allied militia members to be in the plexes if they met standing requirements. i thought this was pretty stupid and mentioned it to ccp on the 22nd june 2008. they would look into it but didn't, just like the other, more important issues, were never fixed.ccp introduced a new round of fixes at the end of july, so i re-joined as gallente, abused the standings to get max rank, and wrote my second rather critical report. the only time i joined for personal reasons was in december, as i was hoping to get a medal for capturing the most sites. this was the time where you encountered me, and we got to hate eachother. ccp organized that event later on, and i rejoined the gallente to motivate them to plex for once. never really cared about plexing and the system capturing business myself, but since ccp had an event, i thought i should be there to see how it went and provide feedback. the average gallente turned out to be an ungrateful d!ck and had no interest in the event, so i quit again.it was here that i realized there was fishy stuff going on with the plex timers and how you guys were using alts and gaming the system. also became painfully aware of the lag issues plaguing fw, which i only remotely heard about and never thought much about. used my influence in the csm to get ccp to fix the lag and fw mechanics problems (did this through ccp directly as the csm voted down a lot of fw issues, including the lag one, as they didn't deem them important!), and wrote a new document about the problems with the fw plex mechanics, as well as the npc imbalance issues.when the gallente finally started caring about the plexes, i joined eleutherian guard, but we were put off by the overpowered caldari npcs, your use of alts, and all the exploits with the timers. i finally managed to reproduce the timer exploit and reported this to ccp. seeing no point in playing fw in this state, i quit."
12/3/2009,"could i ask all of you to move the discussion about caldari vs. gallente, the accusations of hypcrisy, and other such stuff to a different thread?this issue deserves more than another derailed thread of personal dislikes."
12/3/2009,"this. we all know the pervs and damar are just a bunch of smacktalking griefers, they don't care about this issue, they just want to ruin the game. they're the goons of fw."
12/3/2009,finally! some recognition!actually i personally do care and i dont see any other way to get this to ccp's attention beside 'ruining' fw
12/3/2009,supported.while its still broken i might as well use it. broken plexing mechanics are truly the death of fw.toss some lp for taking plexes while you're at it!
12/3/2009,"you guys already ruined it on the gallente/caldari front, so the reason for ruining the fun for the rest of the players is?"
12/3/2009,"mining currently faces a series of issues,besides the awkward covetor skill requirements,the biggest issue is the lack of interaction.all the player has to do is lock and fire up the lasers the rest you know.the truth is that it is boring.i propose that mining is reworked to become more interactive,engaging and interesting.making it require the player to do more things while mining will be a direct blow to macro miners thus increasing the income of real miners like myself.many suggestions have been made such as laser frequencies and multi ore asteroids and many others that would help with the issues described above.i hope that you agree with me and that the newly elected csm will bring up this issue to ccp.thank you very much for reading."
12/3/2009,have you tried mining with battleship? i mined long time with maelstrom before i got skills for hulk. that takes reflexes to mine with battleship with 8xmining lasers but it gives good yield and only hulk or covetor can compete with it in yield. i mined to cans and used industrial ship with cargo expanders and cargorigs to empty those cans.i got my cash for maelstrom when i mined long time with scythe.try gas mining in wormhole space. theres some true excitement. you need probe launcher and probes for that.
12/3/2009,"i'm going to say no to this. i just don't like the idea of making it interactive. i have a mining alt and i use it either when i'm reading, studying for a class, or ratting/mission running on my main. basically i'm not going to like anything that changes it so that i can't mine in eve and do other things at the same time."
12/3/2009,ccp have implemented this to a small extend in dominion but i would like to see the stations even closer to the moons/planets.
12/3/2009,i would agree
12/3/2009,"i agree. when i warp to a planet, i want to feel like i warped to a planet, not a really large moon with rings."
12/3/2009,supported.
12/3/2009,"some space stations in eve are not that much smaller than the moons they orbit. i believe the caldari food processing plant station (not a specific place, i'm referring to the 3d model of that name) measures 95km+ long according to the data in the object preview window, and it certainly seems that long next to a ship. in fact, i recall something in the lore that says the positioning of stations has to be carefully planned and monitored because their enormous mass can have noticeable effects on the orbit of moons (same goes for titans).so while the stations are in fact gigantic, i agree that placing them closer to their celestial ""anchors"" would help create the dramatic effect the op talks about and that would be cool. supported.just keep in mind, being closer to planetary bodies will inevitably mean a lot more warping through planetary bodies: an experience that is as immersion-breaking as grand views of said planets is immersion-building."
12/3/2009,"i'd much rather have the distance from the station to the planet be greater to reduce the possibility that you constantly warp through the planet to get anywhere. i understand the lolrp of warping through solid objects, but i don't want to be constantly reminded that planets are just a flat planar sprite with a pretty texture mapped to it."
12/3/2009,"i've always thought the lore conveniently ignores this in-game phenomenon altogether because it's not really how the devs imagine the tech in the eve universe working. people have come up with excuses for why you are seen warping through solid objects in the game, but i've never seen it mentioned in the chronicles or other canon. can anybody link to some if it exists?"
12/3/2009,"make that 17.199 km 3 for cheap optimizers, but whose counting, right?although i'm a miner i find myself not supporting most of ops ideas. a good idea would be to reduce the ore reclamation from rat loot. there must be other types of rewards that can be used as a substitute. can't be all that hard.one thing i do agree with is that the miner's profession deserves some love and respect. it takes time and money to get into a hulk and then you sit in a ship that you either tank and reduce the effectiveness of its primary mission, or you fit it to be the best miner it can be and then you're flying a ship with the resilience of a wet paper bag. the people with guns on their ships then feel good about themselves for having destroyed yet another ship that has no defenses, that's just how they roll. also, most importantly, you -cannot- get a better miner than a hulk. there are more combat ships than you can reasonably name a purpose for, with more on the way all the time, there will positively be no-better-miner-under-any-circumstance. come on, live a little.ab"
12/3/2009,"1. lol. no. eve is a sandbox, remember? 2. no. eve is a sandbox, remember?3. its called an orca. 4. fit a tank, and watch local.5. never encountered it. fit an afterburner.6. no. the quantity you get from mission loot is insignificant."
12/3/2009,"there are some really stupid arguments coming from both sides here.for those saying that ""fit an afterburner"" is an answer - try fitting one on a hulk.anyway, not supported."
12/3/2009,"because it takes 1/100th the amount of human input and attention that missioning does, and missioning doesn't require that much to begin with.if i can sit in a retriever and mine into a can while reading a book, and only have to look up once every 6 minutes to move my ore into the can, i don't deserve to make as much. fine by me, but then remove zydrine and morphite, and probably megacyte as well from any t1 production costs other than maybe cap ships or such. making it so an attempted self-sufficient miner/industrialist has to go into low or nullsec just to produce an em-damage missile or a kestrel or a punisher is stupid. if you want rare ores to be exclusive, then make them exclusively rare as required materials in production, as oposed to extremely common, but in small quantities.also, i forgot to quote your post, but in regards to your ""hulk-ganking"" issue. deal with reduced mining output and fit a big tank. you think hulk ganking is common? see how long an untanked badger lasts in space in jita with 400-600m worth of goods in it. you aren't safe mining, hisec or not, so fit a tank and those suiciders are going to find an easier target, one where they can guarantee a kill instead of hoping."

(because they are credit to team! instead of just drooling around lobbing grenades everywhere)this would also create some sort of competitive gameplay, as large eve corps would obviously want good soldiers - while smaller would do with whiny little 14-year olds.in addition, better players would get to play against better players, making less of the ""pr0 dominating complete nubtard"" -syndrome that most fpss use."

12/3/2009,"so then we'll mark you down as supporting this, since important is a subjective measure, and can be safely ignored.as for me, i'm fine with dust being connected directly to eve. make them influence one another. give us the ability to be used as fire support in orbit around planets - is that new pvp potential i smell? let them be able to issu out contracts for space superiority operations around worlds they're fighting on.in short, interlace them so closely together that to the gamers they truly became one integrated unit, not two separate entities joined by a lolsov calculation."

12/3/2009,"i know, its called ""common sense"". do you really believe that the majority of eve players, or a significant fraction, don't also own a console?i applaud your managing to provide examples. i don't see any. i don't have to provide reasons since i'm not the one advocating a change. my reasons are the same as ccp's: it expands the eve universe to the currently untapped console market, potentially generating more subscriptions from console gamers who might have otherwise never even considered subscribing to eve online..........no, stereotypes are not often true. by your logic, you must believe all asians are math prodigies, all african americans are predisposed to violence, and hispanics are unintelligent.stereotyping groups based on popular opinions is foolish. and no proof whatsoever that it will happen beyond his own sweeping, negative generalizations about console gamers. i fail to see how anyone's experience as a capsuleer could be negatively impacted by the addition of mercenary infantry. they aren't getting the full game.and they won't be playing eve online... hearsay. and do you think that saying that lends your argument any more weight, or makes it any less stupid?"
12/3/2009,"i've always imagined that with the implementation of dust we will see control of sov changing from some random station or flag in space to control of the actual planets and the population on those planets.of course to take over a planet it would take thousands, probably even millions, of soldiers. i always imagined that players in dust would just be some of those soldiers, even if they were elite soldiers they wouldn't really have much of an effect in a battle where one side already had a major advantage. although they could turn the tide in a battle where both sides were evenly matched.anyway that was just my thought. and in that case it doesn't matter if they are 14 year olds screaming obscenities since all i have to look at is the results. and if they suddenly raged and started killing people on their team than the thousands of npc soldiers from both sides would end up trying to kill them. although that would be interesting to see if an alliance could get some spies in that would switch sides at crucial moments in those evenly matched battles."
12/3/2009,aye.
12/3/2009,i support this topic and raise it for csm meeting 2.wiki document here
12/3/2009,"uhm... this has been remedied, at least as the patch notes say.faction booster charges can be sold on the market."
12/3/2009,"yes but there are a lot of other mods that can't :)i'm not sure if adding *all* items to market would be an improvement. ammo & charges, yes, but *all* faction/deadspace/officer mods? no. i would rather see them improve on the contract system for that."
12/3/2009,i would like to point out the fact that the csm made this change possible! and then what happens? one patch later the devs change it back! thats just down right insulting!what power does the csm have if its changes don't stick! the csm is useless if this change stays!
12/3/2009,no need for words.
12/3/2009,"i wanted to raise suicide ganking again, as almost all csms in the vote match agreed to remove insurance from gankers and a lot of csm found this a hot issue. however, i couldn't find a thread that isn't a total one-sided whine.suicide ganking has already been brought up by ankhesentapemkah twice in the past. first because it was too easy to pull off (resulting in a quicker concord response time) and had too little consequence (sec hit was increased and based on system security), and the second time because players were boarding ships in space which allowed them to continue ganking when at bad sec status. ccp said that they wanted more permanent consequences for suicide ganking (being kicked from npc corps, having a criminal record, etc), and i think that the current fixes have been pretty band-aid. however the issue is a complex one and should be looked at from all sides.in the interest of the eve community i'd like to see a discussion on this topic. do you believe suicide ganking is a problem or too easy? or is it almost completely preventable if the player isn't stupid enough to put too much value in weak ships and doesn't use autopilot?do you think suicide ganking is done for profit, or just to cause grief? what is your opinion on suicide ganking used as means for either?what role does insurance play? even if insurance is removed, there is always the option to use (recycled) alts in destroyers to continue ganking. what do you think of this?please discuss and please keep it civil. i will raise this issue the next meeting but the discussion will be monitored after that and relayed to ccp."
12/3/2009,"it is almost completely preventable and players who take precautions to avoid becoming a victim of it should be rewarded for the additional effort and/or ""ingenuity"". nerfing suicide ganking too much (read: making it so uneconomical as to be pointless or extremely rare) would really take away an important element of the ""nowhere is truly safe"" maxim of eve. i've been suicide ganked and lost an epic load of isk to the practice once mostly because i was stupid. i take steps to never repeat the mistake. if nobody was there to gank me that time, i'd still be making the same dumb mistake. hold on to every wisp of the game's cutthroat atmosphere. in rp terms, you can chalk it up to pod pilots gone mad with power/immortality who fly in the face of concord and the wardec mechanic to pirate in hi-sec. it's a strange, tragic, and yet to be reconciled side effect of creating a race of immortals and then trying to tie a leash around their collective necks whilst still in the nursery."
12/3/2009,"well i think that anyone can be reasonable about the insurance payout. if i drove my car through someones house with the intent to kill him, would by insurance company pay for that damage? there are a lot of insurance companies that list what they do not pay for. i think this is the answer for whether or not it could be brought under control, should be, or should not. it's a matter of economics. if you can suicide gank a freighter with say 300m isk of stuff, and you use several battleships that get concorded in the process equaling 300m, and you lose around 50m isk after payouts, then there is still a profit. that alone is cause for it, and in that aspect there is too much on the side of the ganker. but whenever i think of changes in a game like this, i must think of enhancement. while changes to insurance might relegate suicide ganking to a more strategic or tactical goal (killing an enemy corps one freighter, or stealing their bpos, or their ammo), overall changes to insurance to affect everybody could make the game more interesting as well.while we reasonably presume that it's odd to pay out insurance for ships lost in commission of criminal acts, changes to insurance should not be just to ""screw the pirates!!"". perhaps insurance adjustment rates based on the pilot as well? lose more ships, pay more insurance - until perhaps such point is reached that you are no longer insurable! this would certainly light a fire under pilots both old and new to be more careful, be it missions or pvp. it adds to the ""risk/reward/consequence"" aspect of this game as well. fly well, and you pay less insurance for better ships. fly poorly and you pay more for less. insurance would only be affected for actual loss of ships that were insured to begin with, so those who want to get 20 cheap t1 ships blasted out from under them every day will not become un-insurable. as for being avoidable, this suicide ganking, i see that the people who make their game doing it will harp constantly that it's avoidable. yes, afk pilots slowboating with an expensive load of loot may deserve it, but i have seen cases of people getting popped the moment they undocked. this was not from war targets or in low sec. throw in some lag and there is no defense at all.and one more thing. many who enjoy the status of poor security ratings boast about it and denigrate all those other players who are still in high security space or base there. since the criminals cannot fly a ship in high sec, they have no reason to be there. why then, would the gates even allow them to jump? barring them from high sec, that they despise so much, would be like a badge of honor, no?"
12/3/2009,"bottom line is: there is not a single ship that can't outlast a suicide gank when fitted properly. suicide ganking has already been nerfed to a point that things are unrealistic from a rp point-of-view and things are way too lets-babysit-the-carebears-so-they-stop-whining from a mechanics point-of-view. concord response times are almost instant, even in 0.5."
12/3/2009,"much though i find the practice loathsome it is one of the things that make eve the get-dragged-behind-the-car-over-a-gravel-road experience.there are extremely reasonable and lucid arguments to be made to ban this practice or the next to take some of the bite out of the game. but you know something? i don't want that. eve was built to be a morally ambiguous place where the game mechanic allows for horrible things to happen to nice people for no sensible reason. much like that other crazy place, the one they call real life. have you heard about it? the graphics and sound are fabulous but the respawn rate sucks.if the bad behavior is reduced to a -semblance- of bad behavior, ie: somebody shows you a scowl and wags their finger instead of really walking up to you and shooting you in the face, then it's eve no longer. then we're on the long, tragic road to world of warcraft land, where you can be as dumb as you want to be, there's no real consequence for stupidity. that's not what i came to eve for. i came to eve because i read the story of the person who got screwed out of a titan and the game designers said: ""yeah, if you don't pay attention, that can happen. deal with it.""since suicide ganking in concord space is criminal behavior, there should be an appropriate penalty for choosing to do so, though not disproportionally so. the cost should not all be for the person being ganked. the ganker should by all means pay the price of their choice. they're big on that, they want to have the choice. ok, fine, now ante up. removing insurance seems like a very sensible step ""oh, you -wanted- to drive your car into the wall and now you want -us- to pay for it? well, i'm afraid i might have some bad news for you..."". however, the risk of it should not be taken away or be reduced to meaninglessness.obviously, when the player moves to 0.4 and lower security space, everything that happens, happens.i am very much inclined towards preserving the original intent behind the design. eve was intended to be a dark, morally ambivalent place that felt raw. it should remain that way. all the sensible and well-thought out arguments of why the game should be tweaked ""just a little bit, you know. for the newbies"" to me screams soccer mom in an suv. for the love of the god of your choice, don't do that to me. sure, it means the suicide ganker is going to be a featured appearance. so be it. deal with it.ab"
12/3/2009,"suicide ganking should not be removed from the game - i think it plays a valuable role in keeping the hard edge that eve online is (in)famous for, and trying to remove it from the game is a mistake.that said, i also think that people should have to think long and hard before they pull the trigger on that gank. the people who are doing it as pirates are looking for an economic reward in return for the activities. the ones doing it for the lulz are the ones that need to be reigned in, imo.the fine line that needs to be walked is the one that discourages the second group while maintaining the economic incentives for the first."
12/3/2009,"suicide ganking is a problem? someone suicide ganks are most prevelent in freighters, but really, flying a freighter with tens of billions of isk unguarded in even high sec is dumb. 1. would you walk down the street in the bad part of town carrying million of dollars in cash even if there is a police station there?2. whens the last time you saw someone get suicide ganked in their faction ship? almost never.ive been a target of suicide ganks a few time and i dont even care, they just end up losing isk and standings and then fail.suicide ganking should remain a part of this game, if you put 12b isk in a shuttle and even get locked your an idiot."
12/3/2009,"i'd be satisfied with nothing more than the insurance being removed. it won't stop suicide ganking, it will merely slow it down. if you haul pricey cargo that can cover a lost ship (destroyers are dirt cheap after all) you can still expect that someone might try frying you.barring that, closer examination of recycled alts (which was called an exploit long ago when people were making suicide alts for smartbombing mackinaws resulting in them receiving a hp boost). most gankers are just recycled alts because it's easy and effortless but for a bit of skilling.one caveat would be that insurance would still pay out if concord barbeques someone that's in your gang (happens to rr ships now and then when they hit the wrong button). suicide gankers are typically not in a gang with their targets..."
12/3/2009,"if you want to make insurance more realistic, then by all means go ahead. ""realistic"" insurance companies would not pay out for suicide ganking losses, sure, but then they wouldn't pay or for nearly any losses that occur in eve. it would be simpler to just remove insurance altogether. alternatively, you could support my insurance reform proposal.empire must have some risk, if only to prevent it being over-run by hauler macros. the player who is not afk, who is skillful, who properly fits an appropriate ship to move his cargo, who avoids the obvious routes to major hubs should have a significant advantage of the player who does not. remember that suicide ganking is not an accident, it is deliberately designed in to the game. if it has become more prevalent because of player actions, then so be it.if you want to remove the risk from suicide ganking, fair enough. what are you going to replace it with? a greatly improved war-dec system would be a good start, but that still leaves the issue of alts in npc corps."
12/3/2009,"removal of insurance, no, only basic insurance, maybe.it will increase the 'cargo value' threshold for pro gankers a bit, while not being a major disadvantage for newbie mistakes.however a total reform of the insurance system would be a better thing."
12/3/2009,"why not tie the price of an insurance policy to two things: (1) the character's security rating and (2) the number of outstanding policies the character already has. characters with security ratings below 0.0 would start to see marginal and then significant increases in the cost of insurance as their rating fell -- to the point of uselessness around -2.5. moreover, holding more than two or three policies at once would increase the price in a similar way.would this not work for more ""realistic"" insurance reform, and if not, why?"
12/3/2009,this would effect alot more people than highsec gankers to be fair.i personally pirate in low sec which is not a game breaking problem at all i would hate to be punished even further for my gameplay style! (i am already outlawed from high security space).or i could just corp insure my ships as my corp does not have a security rating.so there is already a loophole in your proposal
12/3/2009,"during my time -10 i gave suicide ganking mackinaws a try with a buddy with us both in thoraxs. i can safely say the effort it takes to get it together isn't much but its a drag having to haul ships/mods to low sec.on top of that you have to find a target that not only is worth blowing up, but you can actually kill. it doesn't take much to make yourself look not worth the effort. for example we came across a few, and i repeat only a few mackinaws that were fit with medium shield extenders and hardeners, that put us off a lot. but faction shield boosters was one of our favourite targets as people fit their macks with faction boosters and then have cap rechargers in the mids so literally have very little ehp. was like christmas came early (one mackinaw we caught had a shield booster worth around 120 mill plus, talk about overkill for a high sec belt?)tbh you can remove the insurance, but the people who will suffer are the new players to the game who get themselves concordokken'd by accident, and the not so new players who make a little mistake.my opinion? let suicide gankers do their thing, its the only way people will learn that its safer space not safe space and it also rewards the players with a clue, who actually tank their barges and don't fly billions of isk around in a tech one untanked hauler tl;dr: leave suicide ganking alone, let the idiots suffer and allow the pilots who are smarter be rewarded, suicide gankers + clever carebears alike."
12/3/2009,i basically agree with this. i do think there should be no insurance payout if killed by concord or in the case of self-destructs.
12/3/2009,"i agree don't nerf i'd say if you must modify the insurence payments just do it in 1.0 or make it percentage based. concorded in 1.0 no payout, concorded in .9 50% concorded in .8 or below full. this will just make 1 and .9 safer, but not safe.also increasing response times based on sec would also help prevent it in super high sec. both of these making it a bit of a hunting game for the suiciders waiting for the pray to enter a less high sec system."
12/3/2009,insurance should be null and void whenever you self destruct or get concorded... end of discussion.suicide ganking is possible because you can grab yourself a battleship... fit it up... and end up breaking even or making a damn profit.... i find it hard to believe there would be much incentive for alts to grab ships knowing they get nothing back for said action. if anything it would be just a bit obvious to the game admins what was going on.self destruct is something that people use to deny killmails... but lately people use it to make money as well... if you want that insurance money so damn bad... go get shot down in low sec or something. at least make it worth while to the pvp'ers that way.suicide ganking shouldn't be outlawed... but the insurance payout at a minimum should be zero.beyond that... i don't have a problem with it... other than the unbalanced risk to reward ratio listed above.
12/3/2009,remove insurance !rollback the old (slower) concord-response time !otherwise its fine as it is.
12/3/2009,remove insurance for getting concorded and for self destructing
12/3/2009,i quoted people that already stated what i wanted to say.
12/3/2009,"removing insurance would almost single-handedly remove suiciding of large ships (freighters and the like), while barely impacting small-scale grief ganks (happened to me on a few occasions).to perhaps meet in the middle, and to avoid completely removing multi-battleship suicides, perhaps a chance-based system can be put into effect:insurance companies of present day are terribly terribly well known for trying to get out of paying their customers whenever they can, after all, they are a for-profit entity. we could try and vaguely simulate that realism into eve in the form of a percentage-based chance for insurance payouts to occur if undertaken in the process of criminal acts (perhaps while you have an aggression timer on you that isn't vs. an npc entity, like guristas or blood raiders). 75% would be a good chance to get your insurance, while at the same time, making it less likely to commit these acts on a large-scale for fear of not getting the payout if the margin for profit was already close, or if the random-number gods frown on you.as one of the first posters in this thread pointed out, if you're going to spend 300m in bss, to kill a freighter carying 300m in goods, and after normal payout you'd get back 250m. you might now only expect to get back about 187m of that, as some of the bs insurances aren't paid.....and you have to modify that a bit either way depending on luck or unluck. considering that objects have a 50% chance to survive a wreck, you're only banking on 150m worth of goods surviving through that freighter-gank, which also might be a little higher or lower, depending on rng.makes suicide-ganking more calculated, harder to do on a large-scale or very often, while not severely penalizing people who gank weak ships with lots of goods (weak ships take less to kill, which means cheaper gank ships, and thus increase your likelihood of a profit margin)."
12/3/2009,"yea but the full cammo just looks ugly, in this thread are some photo-shopped partial cammos that look very nice:"
12/3/2009,"i was just wondering if it was possible to add the possibility to make a public fleet finder advert ... i just thought the point of the fleet finder was to find a fleet and if you aren't in a large corp or alliance your not going to find anyone. also would make things easier for finding people to do missions with.that's just my opinion.thanks, sled"
12/3/2009,"i was thinking of the same, however, i can easily see this being abused/used for scamming in some way - waaay too easily :/"
12/3/2009,"as a pvper, pirate, and supporter of high-sec ""griefers"", i support this, but only because it will make it easier to find and victimize those who live in high-sec believing themselves safe from all the pirates."
12/3/2009,a lot of people don't like this.ctrl + tab can be pressed blind.ctrl + f9 is a harder key to find.ctrl + tab is locked so that these keys can't be switched.i want ctrl + tab to hide the ui like it has for years.please allow me to reassign ctrl + f9 to ctrl + tab as it has always been.
12/3/2009,ctrl+tab hides/shows windows which is almost the same thing.an no offence but f9 is right next to f8 and before the map key (f10)
12/3/2009,id like a regiontab for sellorders so i dont get the wrong region message all the time if i want to change prices on sell orders :)it would make trading life in eve a lot better :)
12/3/2009,it definitely would ... less time lost = more isk :p
12/3/2009,"don't worry about code, thats what programmers are paid for, besides wormholes already have it no biggie really."
12/3/2009,"i was considerig an !active! module fitted in low slots powergrid 10-12 cpu 15-18 capacitor consume 40/sec which inject propulsion and power to the ship engines giving a 35-40% to the afterburner top speed. it also amplify the mass of the ship reducing the manovrability. another module fitted in the low ( med ) slots could be a engine booster which use batteries ( charges ) to boost the ships speed. the value of the boost is depeding by the powe of the charges but it could be around the 40 and the 60%. a charge recharge interval of 20-40 secs once active the ship will recive a power explosion to the engine reaching istantly the top speed of the ship + the charge bonus, decreasing after 1 sec. power grid 6-8 cpu 17-20. as microwarpdrives do this module reduce the capacitor by 20%. and a stealth distortion module plugget in the hight slots which reduce the signature radius of a ship by 3-5% those modules are usefull for interceptors and assault ships to enter in a short combat range between 2 big bs fleets and engage hoping they don't have webbers. ( hooo i'm sorry for your tracking speed! )"
12/3/2009,"so you came up with:a) a low slot afterburner that ups your powergrid when it's turned on? um. you realize powergrid has no effect on actually using your modules right?b) a mwd that uses charges(?) that only lasts for one second that takes 30 (average) seconds to cooldown?c) a module equivalent to the pirate implant setswhatever you're smoking, i suggest you check the expiration date and then let this thread die."
12/3/2009,"oh wow, what an appalling idea.i disagree.obviously not. ccp is a company, and we are their customers. they aren't under any obligation to alter the product to fit our arbitrary demands.ccp isn't required obey csm. you've got it backwards.you make it sound like we're funding a charity, or are investors. we aren't. we're customers. there is a definite difference.not to those of us who have a realistic understanding of how a business works.no.no, per abovewhy should ccp submit to such blithering idiocy as putting themselves under this obligation. no other company on earth is obligated to cater to the customer's whim like this.no. just... no. this is quite possibly one of the more insane suggestions i've seen here."
12/3/2009,"let me lock rockets, missiles and torps and shoot them with my weapons, drones. id be happy."
12/3/2009,"i'm curious why there's this sudden rush of people posting ideas about countering missiles, either by boosting defender missiles or by adding entirely new modules specifically to counter missiles. if you want to start giving missiles the drawbacks that turreted weapons have, then you'd have to remove the unique drawbacks that missiles have.missile boats generally have slightly lower dps than their turret counterparts, in exchange for reasonable high volley and some good reliability. when you shoot your missile at a target of the proper size within your range, you have a reasonable expectation that it will deal at least some damage. to counter this are the fact that you have travel time, which factors in any time you have a gap in firing. every time you reload, get jammed, switch targets, etc., you have to wait at least a few seconds after turning on your weapons before any damage is applied.also, aside from switching to precision missiles, or hitting you with a web, there is absolutely nothing a missile boat can do to make his missiles hit you harder. missiles don't have tracking computers or tracking enhancers. many missile boats generally have a small or absent drone bay to boot. these things all combine to give missiles a different flavor than turrets. it confuses me that people seem to want to remove that flavor."
12/3/2009,agree with above. no support
12/3/2009,"if this is needed, why not just make an 'anti-missile' script for the existing tracking disruptor?"
12/3/2009,"there already is a medslot module to reduce missile damage,it is called afterburner"
12/3/2009,tray lisans makes a good point. perhaps a chance base system where 2 thing can happen.1. your module is successfull and diverts the missile or2. it backfires and the missile hits you harder and faster than normal.this would help to balence out the drawbacks inherent in missilesbut imo missiles are fine the way they work now

12/3/2009,so what were asking is just to give ms a hp boost and jumprange can we please get a replyor if ccp does not intend to do anything with motherships i think they should just look at removeing them from game and compensating people with appropriate isk (in the region of 16-17 bill this would cover pos fuels sov 4 systems capital comp bpc use and this is the price for what ms avg go for on forums!)this thread should be made sticky and this seriousley needs some pr from ccp dev team and spent time onand no changeing them into a new class of ship *edit*or are gms/devs hopeing people will just shutup

12/3/2009,"sorry im very angry and so are alot of other people i talked to.its about droping thermal dynamics down from lvl 5 engry emission's to lvl 4. i just wasted 17day for a crappy skill and so did a ton of people before me. i did it right before the patch for the patch which makes me more ****ed. why don't you just drop titan to 5 days and give everyone one when they start. instead you should fix, that it takes less time to to fly a tech three command ship which is better then any command ship out there. and same for logistics tech three are better. and what good is a blackops ship anymore? waste of time and isk go get a few carriar's instead. infact most people can fly a carriar sooner!thats 17 days i could of used on gay guns to tech ii since there not like missles are, too get tech ii's. another faili play eve because it took time to achive things. and not everyone could be good at everything way to lower the bar. your going to see about a 90% increase in the number of people over heating there mods since dominion. every pilot and his mother will be able to do it. most people didn't train it before because it took to long. so it gave an edge to those that did.last thing is, having a skill que should be learned or earned. i remember waking up in the middle of the night to change skill's and missing a month i payed for, because i got rapidly deployed (miltary). so i think for the first two weeks they should have to live without it to get a taste of what we older players have had too endured.a postivehey the ship descriptions in the patch notes. ie what there to be used/role for when talking about factional ships. should be added to everyship in eve in there description.p.s. aready ****ed from falcon nerf. blackbird is just as good and cheaper by a long shot. if you want to make eve unige make each ship have a bonus for the more you fly it, or kills you get in it. improve something about the ship. hell that would get people to grind and play longer to max out a ship. it would make specializing and flying a ship better. have a mod that converts two slots mids-into one high. or the other way.you stripped eve of its charater's indvidulity when you started all pilots at sratch i know the reason i picked my pilot was my starting skills. not my race or look. i don't like them, you made it easy to fix skills. so now, the reason that i picked my charater dosen't matter. i share no common ground with pilots who now pick my same blood line anymore. since anyone can be anything.ccp needs to stop worring about a profit and more about its player's and game. if someone ever gets maxed skills let me know and i will quit. eve will be another wow (which i never have played because it has an end lvl 70 game over. i hear they moved it to 80 now) i liked it because you could become a badass in a niche and beat an older pilot. or counter his ship. if everyone one can do everything or its easyer. then i want all qweens on my chess board. t3's for high and cap's for low. no need to fly anyother ship you'll get pwned."
12/3/2009,"i can sympathize with your post. i trained archaeology and hacking back in 2006 when i was a noob and the skill prerequisite was science level 5. ccp dropped it to 3. i was slightly annoyed the first time i read that in a devblog.on the other hand new players need a chance to keep up with 2,4,6 year old vets. i remember that the initial skill-points you got on character creation got bosted from (500k ? in 2005) to 800k. that's a good thing. i heard from 2003 vets, that tech 1 battleships used to be very expensive in relative terms back then. there were less opportunities to make money and those ships were the biggest stuff you could get. nowadays battleships are common and quite cheap.i certainly would want my ""noob"" corp members to have a chance to close the gap in some skills, provided of course that they specialize. nothing is more annoying when you ask a ""noob"" to fit a mwd and he can't use one. but of course you're right, that vets should always stay ahead of the younger characters. (on that note: it's also annoying to have trained torpedoes when they used to be long-range, just before they got switched to very short range. having trained cruise missiles for stealth bombers right before stealth bombers got changed to torpedo launching platforms. ...)one thing i totally disagree with you, because i see it from a different angle.i chose my character because of his race's backstory and blood-line description. i'm almost a role-player. i think that having to chose a race just because it will allow you to be the best trader / miner / fighter was the worst thing that ccp had done to the whole rp community. so i'm very glad that this was dropped."
12/3/2009,my thoughts exactly.
12/3/2009,"congrats, delegate."
12/3/2009,"i wish to thank all who voted for me. i am quite sure i got more votes than some people thought but was not quite enough.nonetheless, i will continue bringing up issues which i consider to be wrong in faction war. with this in mind, caldari militia has already initiated an operation* which will probably soon get attention in various forums.damar rocarionbrigadier general* plan b. plan a was to get elected to csm so i could address this issue directly with ccp."
12/3/2009,"you fail and you will always fail.as for your plan b, probably a lot of alts with a lot of standing in a crossed militia capturing sites unhindered, yes?using an army unskilled alts to defend plexes with overpowered npcs doing all the ""pvp"" for them, and abusing timer bugs to claim them while you're absent, is more of a problem in my opinion. like i predicted, you have problems running the rather strong npcs in minmatar plexes, which you cannot run with an alt in a t1 frigate like the weak gallente npcs, thus you have to use standings to circumvent them. meanwhile you continue whining about me doing the same with the caldari npcs, which are much more of a problem than the minnies.ccp is already aware of the issues, erik and me already made them painfully aware of the problems. you're not needed. if you think differently and do want to bring up a csm issue, you can bring it up through me or z0d, who will represent fw in this csm and has already raised his first fw issue yesterday."
12/3/2009,"but what if someone doesn't agree with the way you do things?also..lets point and laugh at people that didn't get voted in...wait, let's not."
12/3/2009,"that is fine. but there are several reasons why someone may disagree. and one of the reasons is that the person that disagrees has a personal agenda, and is not interested in making eve better for all players, but only for his own specific niche group or playstyle.and that's why i'm glad damar didn't get elected. fortunately the voters realized this as well."
12/3/2009,you managed to do nothing about these issues and erik managed to nothing so why would zod do it any better?
12/3/2009,"oh well, maybe next time, right..?"
12/3/2009,"correction: ccp doesn't give a sh!t about factional warfare, and we're the only ones providing continuity throughout the csm to keep the pressure on ccp to do otherwise. that is how we got the fw lag problems addressed too. i started that issue, erik finished that issue."
12/3/2009,"that is why there is always plan b, make them care you were not able to do that so someone have to do it."
12/3/2009,"there isn't anything you can do which i haven't tried or set in motion already.feel free to try though, but remember that it took ccp 4 months to fix the cloaked plexing after apocrypha despite me sending numerous mails and even made phonecalls about it. despite me reproducing the timer exploit in their office, they still haven't fixed that either. even if you were to capture all minmatar space through whatever exploit, they're not going to care just as they don't care about the exploits you used to capture all gallente space.we all know that fw is full of bugs and the game mechanics are so fundamentally flawed that the entire thing should be sent back to the drawing board. ccp wants do dedicate an expansion to fixing it. but the problem is to get them to give it any priority, as there is always more important stuff to squash into an expansion.the most you're going to get at this point is some band-aid fixes, which will be the npc balance, and the plex spawning mechanics we brought up. we might even see some exploits fixed. but that doesn't fix the fundamental problems with fw, at all. you know how clueless they can be, just look at the entire fw mission debacle.one more thing, ccp doesn't give a rats behind about the system occupancy systems. why? cause 95% of the players don't care about it. you can care, i can care, but the fact is, that almost noone else in fw cares about those plexes or the occupancy it reads in a small corner of the screen. as seen during fanfest, only 5 or so people in the whole room indicated they care about it, with the other hundreds raising their hand that they just want some pvp. ccp laughs at us behind our back that we are so stupid to go through all this trouble over these systems and thinks that we are crazy. they thought that the plexes would facilitate pvp, and didn't expect them to be run the way we do them, just for the sake of getting systems, not pewpew."
12/3/2009,"i find the na na na da you didn't win rather poor and do not condone it in the slightest. in fact even i find it petty and in bad taste. damar did nothing wrong in his running for csm, i did think he was too much of a divisive figure to run for csm under a fw ticket (abit like myself, i know lots of people hate me.. i cry sometimes when i go to bed) however i wish him luck. (i'm sure he dont need it)all this exploit crap is just that.. crap. anyone can do it, its out there everyone knows.. so everyone likely does it.no other peron running for csm has a 4 page threadnaught.. so congrats at least you have got people interested.i would love to know what plan b is... knowning pervs its going to be a doozy!"
12/3/2009,"i couldn't wait to get to work and want to raise these issues to the agenda for meeting 2, which date we will have to decide on in meeting 1 this weekend.for those that don't know about the formalities, you have to write a summary about your issue at the wiki, link to the thread, post in the thread and link back, and then post it in the agenda thread of the appropriate meeting. since we didn't have a meeting thread yet i made one, but normally elvenlord will have to do the work (if he decides to keep the chairman position that is).20th december meeting.alliance logos, csm intervention requestedblack ops improvements, part 2bring logistics warp speed in-line with t2 shipsfw complex spawning issues part 2destroyer improvements thread | wikiingame events menu thread | wikilock characters to prevent theft thread | wikiput more faction items on market thread | wikisuicide ganking discussion thread | wiki"

12/3/2009,i'll start working on a few things myself =p
12/3/2009,"don't get me wrong here, as the initiative is very much appreciated but is there not an extensive list of proposals that already have support in the assembly hall section?should not these ""most supported"" proposals be the first to be tackled?(and yes i do realise that you have some of those in your list allready)cheers,"

12/3/2009,"congrats aleks, i was so pleased to see your vote count so high and now that ""csm"" under your name. now stop grinning and get to work lol!"
12/3/2009,"m8 i think t1 frigates (such as the incursus) need to be significantly boosted, while t2 powerhouses (such as the ares) need to be hit with the nerf-bat. what are your thoughts on this?"

12/3/2009,"congrats, you got one my votes, glad to see so many other people decided likewise"
12/3/2009,congratulations alekseyev. i sense the price of a noir. contract just went up. you trustworthy bastard you.
12/3/2009,"congrats, you got one of my votes. even though we sit on opposite sides of the fence in terms of alliance politics, i thought your ideas were thoughtful and extremely practical. i wish you every success as csm chairman. your music aint bad either!"

12/3/2009,"definately more work put into this than most candidates campaigns :)good work deirdra vaal! some improvements i would suggest:a) add more questions and issues covering other topics not already included to cover agendas not represented with your current topics b) add the ability for candidates to assign points to general topics to represent the candidates priorities and display in a bar graph. possibly with a dialog box under each topic with a maximum character amount.c) be able to log in with the new browser and automatically retreive basic character info (i'm sure you have this planned already)d) gather some basic details from users of the website for post election statistics (how long they have played, are they in an alliance, what their professions ingame are etc.)although i couldn't use your website as it didn't represent my agenda i appreciate the effort you have put in and can't wait to see what you come up with next time!-t'amber"
12/4/2009,looking forward towards the minutes
12/4/2009,ya maybe we'll just go with 5 mill m3 max for 10 bsesor maybe just 5....no thats a little too low....maybe 8?
12/4/2009,i like the idea!
12/4/2009,"definitely.that feature is pretty standard for the arena type fps games. no additional server strain as it can be done entirely client side. the entire scene can be (re)constructed with the data sent from/to the server, so only this needs to be recorded to a file. the biggest effort would be the creation of a player for those files. add controls for advanced camera movement + scripting, as well as the ability to render frames to file... that would be moviemakers dream :)"
12/4/2009,"definitely like the idea. less overhead than fraps or other screen-capture tools. theoretically, it should be relatively easy to implement too."
12/4/2009,suppoerted only if it doesn't add to lag.
12/4/2009,i can't see ccp doing much about this one... however i completely support it.
12/4/2009,i support this fully!
12/4/2009,couldn't have said it better myself
12/4/2009,"lazy dev's, fully supported"
12/4/2009,.
12/4/2009,"due to the amount and availability of methane on eve ships, the current color of the afterburner is appropriate. yet, i agree with the concept of better visual distinction between modules."
12/4/2009,sure why not
12/4/2009,it's happened to me a few times that i've grabbed a mwd/ab in a hurry and wondered why i suddenly had less/more pg until i realised what i'd done.
12/4/2009,guess there are zero market runners in assembly hall.
12/4/2009,"well, of course. they're all watching the market!"
12/4/2009,an overhaul is direly needed..
12/4/2009,"i am writing this in the name of all faction warfare players. please take your time to read me out, post your thoughts and support this measure.i have been in faction warfare for about six months now. i enjoy the pvp, the roams, the gate camps, the hotdrops, the immersion of it.over time, i have come to loathe some aspects of it however. massive amounts of bugs that have never been fixed, crappy plex mechanics, lack of rewards and objectives, lag, runaway exploitation of bugs and features, massive isk farming, etc...i have decided to write this thread demanding ccp to look at faction warfare and do something about it. it is about time they hear us out and implement the measures we have been asking for more than a year.they have no qualms working with 0.0 players, because honestly that is probably where they all play eve. they have no problems with working with players to make their game better either, even if sometimes they waste all the collaboration for unknown reasons and create large amounts of grief towards the community. that problem notwithstanding, they still work to make lag better, improve sov mechanics, etc, to improve 0.0 gameplay: it is their vision of endgame in eve.we in faction warfare are in it for a variety of reasons. maybe we like the fast paced pvp, the lack of dull pos warfare, the powerlessness of living in 0.0 space as a renter or member of a large alliance where you make no decisions and have to do whatever you are told. maybe you decided you were tired of doing the same mindless highsec level 4 mission running, mining or playing the markets for some adrenaline in the bubble, dd and bomb free pvp environment of fw.i joined fw because i saw it as a doorway to pvp. didn't make me isk but it was fun. if it wasn't for the incredible adrenaline and fast pace of lowsec roams i would have probably left eve already.i will be borrowing some of the points from here: csm proposalthere are a number of issues we have been asking for some time to be looked at and fixed:there is no greater objective in fw. it doesn't matter that all systems have been captured by the caldari, there is no effect besides some lolrp. nobody gains anything from capping systems.there is no reward for capturing plexes. i get more standings increase form farming missions (and isk, lots of it). i lose standings with opposite faction however.there is no reward for pvp, the amount of lp you get from kills is ridiculous. you get more from doing lvl1 missions. the lp reward has to be increased ten fold to have any meaning. at implementation of this feature, people were afraid of exploiting this mechanic... it would have been easy to prevent that, but we would have seen far greater exploiting somewhere else, however, devs thought up an idea for 5 minutes and implemented a flawed mechanic.fw mission are an isk printing machine. everyone in eve has an alt in a militia to help farm lp for the exclusive store items. this was supposed to invigorate fw but it had the opposite effect. people stopped pvping and went farming instead. we have made a total of hundreds of billions of isk doing this, myself included. almost no risk at all. and then they came with their fix that didn't fix anything and now people continue to farm lp. moreover, missions for some factions are easier to do than others. plexes are severely bugged and unbalanced. they can be solo run with frigates, exploited to be unable to respawn after finishing, etc. it's a mess.now, i have my own ideas on what to do, how things should be done. i would like everyone to provide their input however. argue your points so we can provide a guide map so ccp can do something about this game that we play.i will be proving a personal vision soon.for now, just support the following:ccp must address faction warfare. we as your customers deserve attention. fix it now!"
12/4/2009,"this is the last expansion (or is it the one before?), why would they fix the last expansion when a new one could be relesaed full of eye candy."
12/4/2009,"increase the lp from kills 5 or 10 times. nerfing the missions is fine, i've had enough of seeing ***** manticores running around low sec doing missions and cloaking up when someone enters system, but there needs to be some way to get fw lp without losing more ships than you gain.and for god's sake, make system occupancy mean something, so we can actually convince people to plex. plex mechanics are borked, but not so much that people won't use them as long as they're given incentives."
12/4/2009,another look at fw would be nice.
12/4/2009,"here is what i think would do some good for faction warfare:the npcs in plexes and missions are significantly different in the way they operate. gallente npcs use blasters and sensor dampeners and can be kited. caldari npcs have all sorts of missiles and torpedoes that can hit you to 100km and the best ewar of all, the ecm. i am not sure about the minmatar npcs but i know they use target painters. i know the amar use neut/nos and are close range fit, can be kited also. it would be good to have the npc ships looking different but all using all ewar types and all weapon types, to make things more equal and plexes/missions not so easily farmed, requiring team work to run them. missions need to made harder to do. don't allow them to be declined/quit to let you choose where you want them. make sure you take no standing hit if the mission expires however (12hours or so). this will discourage farming and promote teamwork with roving gangs which is good for pvp. also make sure missions work as plexes in system occupancy. if you finish missions, you get lp and you help with capturing a system.plexes offer no reward for running them. you get lame faction standing increases every time you get promoted and that's it. allow for increments of 1000lp per plex captured per pilot inside. 1000lp for minors, 2000lp for mediums and 3000lp for majors. you may argue that people might exploit this: these plexes have timers, you can't farm them and the opposite side can come and fight you and your alts in stabbed executioners. and in contrast to missions, it is a lot less reward per time spent. i take about 5 minutes to run a lvl4 mission now once in system and i get 15-30k lp. its 10 minutes for a minor and even more for the others.it would be required that the plex spawn mechanics be fixed, so that plexes continuously respawn after being run. and just as importantly, fix the bugs regarding plexes, like the one that prevents the plex form respawning until downtime if it is bugged when someone warps out while in range, which keeps counting down and does not affect occupancy.militia members who willingly shoot fellow militia members must get severe sec status loss and faction loss. if you repeatedly engage people you will be dropped out after a few acts of aggression, while if you somehow mess up your overview, you can recuperate from your mistake.since a lot of corps like to come into fw, dec a member corp and grief them while militia fleet members can't help them, make it so if any corporation decs a fw corp, it is effectively wardecing that faction. all the corps in that militia will be able to kill you w/o penalty, and the highsec police will shoot at you. you want to get easy targets in lowsec, be prepared to pay for the consequences."
12/4/2009,agreeing as hard as i can with neogabriel's topic and all who agree with him....as. hard. as. i. can.
12/4/2009,"fully supportedthere are a ton of bugs related to fw (""auto-countdown on plexes"", npc standings, etc.). beyond that, there are a ton of design problems with it, too (efficient complexe farming discourages pvp etc.).i would go as far as to say that ccp should just re-think the whole fw approach.but the most fundamental change fw needs, imho, is morale support.in any conflict, the party that is losing (for whatever reasons) is losing morale. once morale is lost, resistance is broken. conflicts ""failure cascade"" like this. fw needs a mechanic to counter this trend. one mechanic that was in the original design, but somehow got lost, was the idea that systems are (much!) easier to capture the fewer you have, and more difficult to capture the more you have.the ""losing side"" then can get some quick success stories, which builds morale. the ""better side"" still will hold larger parts of the territory.this is a fundamental problem because only this way, fw can survive the bugs it has. there will always be bugs. but without this, once one side has had an advantage for a sufficient amount of time, the other side will crumble, and you will not get a rebalance at all."
12/4/2009,i couldn't agreee more.
12/4/2009,"the only thing i would say, is that adding more people inside a plex needs to not simple give each person the full lp. that will simply reward blobs and alt-runners (you know who you are). a better idea is either the total lp is split between players based on how much relative time each has spent inside the plex (showing up for 1 minute gets you less then staying in it the whole time) and/or the each person beyond a single player in the plex when it is captured adds 50% of the lp to the pool that the previous person did, and the pool is then split evenly. that math goes like this:x=single player lp rewardy= total lp reward (starts at single player reward)for each player after the first in the plex when it captures:x=x/2y=y+xa simple ""stacking penalty"" for the lp reward, round up to the next whole lp always for simplicitythat might be a bit harsh, and possibly cause it's own problems.bolded some items for emphasis.i'm tired of feeling like fw has a rad ""under construction"" gif straight out of geocities on it."
12/4/2009,"what if....maybe....stick with me here.1 fw character per account. weed out the free alts.if you want to glitch out the system with your 1000 alts, you should have to at least pay for them."
12/4/2009,fully agree the plexes are just to easy for caldari.make the npc guarding it the same or then just with same ewar ships.it has to be done something if not you will lose alot of guys that want to do something in the game and are role playing guys trying to make something in fw.
12/4/2009,"definantly something ccp need to look into, i empathize with the fact that they set up the ground work for faction wars and had other things they wanted to put priority on, i understand this, you only have so many staff and so many work hours in the day.however respectfully, i think if you have the chance now as dominion has been released, perhaps faction wars could be developed more? making it into something really special, like all us pvp corporations and role players would love to see it become, instead of a glorified war dec.dont misunderstand me, i love fw, i would also however ,love to see it evolve and change, and become more dynamic and tactical. <3 fw"
12/4/2009,"i would like to say, fw needs alot of work, thier is alot of good ideals,and i cant wait to see how ccp responds to it."
12/4/2009,"while i doubt ccp will care enough to stop messing around with 0.0 mechanics, i do hope they take a look at the fw statistics and...maybe realize something is wrong."
12/4/2009,"strongly concur with this sentiment, i think spies have done major damage to fw. as someone said the other day in chat, the caldari have more spies in the gallente militia than fighters in theirs! i'd think a militia would be suspicious after a person joins/leaves/rejoins more than once a month. also there should be some sort of mechanic to 'out' known spies and be able to take action against them without security loss. once a spy is burned, it's only logical that there would be consequences."
12/4/2009,fix fw!
12/4/2009,fix it please. i won't be holding my breath though.

12/4/2009,"supported, was thinking the same thing mainly in regards to the csm which ccp didn't do a great job of providing direct access links to voting/etc.i'd also hope that an ingame advertisement method would reduce the clutter of spam cans planted all over the place outside stations/jumpgates. maybe ads could work like buy orders having a range of solarsystem 3jumps/etc, with escalating costs, where it would be shown ticker/whatever instation and players could adjust or hide it so as not to interfere with gameplay. also ads might only be posted by player corporation members to hinder isk spammers, or make it so only non trial accounts can post them."

12/4/2009,"one idea for the procurer:give it one turret for it's one high slot, and give it the bonus of +125% per level to gas harvester yield. therefore, at maximum, it gives the equivalent of 7.25 lasers, making it very strong compared to normal ships but not massive in the total intake. battleships would have a much higher armor and shields, but lower yield and cargo bay, so this would be the trade-off.given that, i can see this in the game. conditionally, i can support this topic, as this would give it a boost without making it unreasonable."

12/4/2009,i support this initiative.utilising this flawed mechanic is not really so different from using any of the other flawed fw mechanics. that doesn't mean we shouldn't at least try to get them fixed.at least it's not time zone related.
12/4/2009,supporting this.
12/4/2009,"i think its quite important to fix this right now because the alternative is having the result of the amarrian/minmatar front decided by cheesy near-exploits that will cheapen and diminish the results for all involved players. i cannot believe that a majority of the 24th crusade players would want to ""win"" the occupancy battles in their theatre through the efforts of a standings-loophole like this. it makes a mockery of corporations like 1pg and pie and others who have by and large been fighting an honest war so far. it is ridiculous that caldari faction characters can contest minmatar complexes without standings penalty to the minmatar. just as it would be ridiculous for minmatar players to content caldari complexes without standings penalty in the enemy faction.this kind of ""gaming"" of the complex and occupancy system turns faction warfare into a farcical embarrassment for ccp and it needs to be quickly patched before the result of faction warfare and rp consequences from the conflict is decided by nothing more than shortsighted weakness in the core design. something needs doing and it needs doing now."
12/4/2009,"it will be up to amarr to give the finishing blow anyway. caldari cannot shoot the bunker so amarr can simply refuse to take the system. we simply want to bring attention to this bug to ccp. only one amarr pilot was actually even informed about it in advance so this is not a joint op or anything, purely a caldari operation.as said, once ccp declares this an exploit/bug, we stop. it is what we want to happpen.damar rocarionbrigadier general"
12/4/2009,"ironically, damar and ankh seem to have the same wish for fw:-to eliminate the various bugs and exploits in order to make fw a more enjoyable experience for everyone involved.problem is, because they're going about it through such wildly different methods they end up butting heads so much that any attempt by the other to help balance out the mechanics gets lost in the personal arguements both by these two and their various supporters.let's just try to focus the arguements on the actual problems rather than the people, maybe we'll actually be able to achieve some improvements that way.oh, and supported."

12/4/2009,"on behalf of mothership owners and pilots.following the disasterous rollback of proposed changes to the mothership class whilst giving the titan its ehp boost and instajib dd of death, titans can now roam nullsec and lowsec and basically instajib a mothership at will, even with the best deadspace buffer tank only 3 titans are needed to kill a 25bn ship including fittings, unlike carriers which can at least be insured motherships no longer fit into the catagory of ""supercapital"" since they can be so easily be killed and have no defence against titans.as with titans motherships force their pilots to commit to either floating in safespots or being locked up in pos's, both of which require additional resource constraints on the owners, since the omni-present risk of a hictor/titan hotdrop (and already titan pilots have been using their griefing tool de jour of rorquals et al) means ms pilots are skulking about nervous and wary of being preyed on.this is grossly inbalanced in favour of titans, since the ms serves no effective purpose in its current stats for any given combat situation pilots should be given a open option by ccp for gm's to allow them to be docked for the duration of this nerf, until they are suitably rebalanced to be combat effective again.it is grossly unfair of ccp to expect players to continue to pay a monthly subscription fee to simply keep a ship that serves no current purpose or to cover the cost/time sink of running a pos simply to protect a ship that they have made so vunerable due to their hurried and ill-thought out unbalanced changes to supercapitals.therefore i petition that all mothership pilots who wish to, be allowed to request a gm to dock their mothership in a station so they can leave them safely mothballed and free up their pilots to use more useful ships on behalf of their fleet.this is not a long term request that motherships be dockable, only a temporary measure that will allow motherships to be stored out of harms way while the development team produce and implement a solution that revalidates the mothership to supercapital status.while i appreciate some people think ""oh just sell them"", that is not a solution, many people who own ms appreciate the difficulty in building and buying these assets and wish to keep them long-term until the issue is addressed, but due to their inability be an effective fleet participant under the new sc changes they should have the option of long-term storage without related expense of tying up an alt account/pos to do so simply because they are getting no benefit for that subscription whilst they cannot be fielded for any useful purpose.so to clarify the petition request:this will not be a forced dock option.it will be similar to what happened during the speed patch nerf, where all snake sets were removed so people had the option to sell them or keep them.what we are asking for is that ccp enables a policy that allows gm's, at a players own request a one-time option via petition to dock their ms in a station, they can then choose to leave the ship in station and remove their character.anyone who subsequently undocks their ms will be deemed to have accepted usage of their ms under the current stats and would not be able to redock to prevent any abuse of the system.this is a fair solution i feel to the problem ccp created, since those who wish to sell their ms can do so, those that wish to continue to use their ms can do so, and those who feel the risk/reward of using the ship has been rendered them useless can have them long-term stored until ccp rebalances them."

12/4/2009,"my request is not to make ms invunerable to titans, this is not a request for a xyz changes - but to give ms pilots affected by the lack of ms changes and effective nerf choice in what they do in the interim.because they rebalanced titans and did nothing to ms we all accept in a 60 page threadnaught that ms were effectively nerfed, and the risk to using them far outweighs any benefit they offer a fleet compared to fielding carriers, therefore for those that don't want to sell them (assuming you could even get buyers) there should be a one time option to petition a gm to dock them while ccp sorts this mess out.all i am asking is i and other ms pilots are given a choice to leave our ms hangered without the expense while ccp rebalances them, sell them or use them."

12/4/2009,"uh, cutting dust 514 off from eve is basically gutting the most unique and fascinating part of the game. it's pretty much the entire game's selling point. you may as well be asking blizzard to turn wow into a single-player game: sure, it could be done, but why?as for complaining about it being console-only: consoles aren't that expensive these days. anyone with a job could save up for one in a reasonable time frame, and certainly by dust's release. also, despite what most whiners here on the forum like to proclaim, consoles can play more than one game... there are quite a few games i would say would be worth buying an xbox 360 or playstation 3 for.releasing for console-only is ccp's prerogative. it would be hard to argue that it is a mistake from a business standpoint. i think the success of games like halo 3 and call of duty: modern warfare 2 show the console market is quite large (i'd speculate larger than the pc gamer market, but i don't have any data to back that up). also, while ccp would certainly like current eve players to become dust players as well, there's no reason to assume they're dependent on us for dust's success. in many ways, dust's success will be independent of eve, despite its integral tie-ins."

12/4/2009,"i will always second this, as far as newbie mistakes go - a lesson learned is always free :)loss of a ship while commiting a crime in high sec areas should invalidate any insurance."
12/4/2009,"how often do these really occur?what kind of mistake could that be? only those where the player immediately realizes that what he did was stupid, a spur-of-the-moment action.where's the problem? you've get a warning, you ignore it, you pay for your mistake. there's nothing hidden or subtle about it, no way to accidently stumble across it."
12/4/2009,i'm perfectly ok with having more realistic insurance... as long as the change comes with more realistic police.remove insurance for concord losses? fine. but that must be balanced by significantly debuffing concord.
12/4/2009,"1) first off, no where is safe in eve, touching this would be like removing a foundation stone. that said, there's usually certain threshold where a game mechanic can become an issue to the majority of players. prior to the recent buffs against suicide ganking, you could say almost everyone was doing it. nowadays, the gankers are little bit more selective in choosing a juicy target and with that, there was a noticeable drop in suicide ganking frequency. to me, the current balance looks allright .... or at least until the screams start again onto the second part. full laden freighters/industrial time to warp is more than what it would take the gankers to reduce it to ashes. so imo, there's really little difference between autopilot/manual piloting in regards to gankers making a kill. the phrase ""completely preventable"" only applies to discerning pilot who takes care not to exceed the threshold cargo value that makes suicide ganking for profit worthwhile. 2) i don't think there's any clear line to distinguish between for profit and griefing. a human can usually tell, but within the confines of the gamecode, they're all the same. one solution would be to attach a scale marker to each ship that would modify the suicide ganking penalties, meaning ganking certain ships would be much more costlier. run the scale higher for ships such as hulks etc. to match the current threshold for freighter would be a start to discourage griefing.3) insurance is irrelevant imo. sure it plays a part, but not as a whole. metaphorically speaking, trying to cure the symptoms rather than the actual cause (which may be miles in the opposite direction). if you fail to grasp this, refer to to the first sentence in 1)."
12/4/2009,"all i can say is rofl and...only one thing is wrong in suicide ganking, and that's the excessive use of smartbombs on exhumers, and that's because of ****** miners who wont train hitpoint skills or fit tank mods. so there's nothing wrong in that either, because when it comes to pvp ships, you can't have it all, max dps (read max rocks per second) and huge tank for your safety. tho as a sidestep i agree mining wont profit much from my experience. like 15k-20k ehp hulk you need waaayyy more than just 1 smartbombing bs and you can still mine quite fast. and random smartbombing keeps people wake up.removing insurance from suicide ganking only removes random attacks from people who dont have the unlimited isk supply, like anyone in fw does. personally i've made billions from suiciding but i've only carefully selected the targets and ffs if i see some careless hauler worth killing, i promise i'll shoot him if i get reasonable profit. it's no problem to catch haulers even when they are not using autopilot.security status, you should consider this as a value, even it can be grinded back up quite fast, i personally give it quite a big value, what is worth killing not ruining your sec.it's quite about 18 seconds in 0.5 you got after aggression. which is quite enough to **** pretty much anything."
12/4/2009,don't you dare to take away my fun and income.
12/4/2009,"even having done (and enjoyed) suicide ganking myself, this is the approach i support. i believe suicide ganking is a valid activity, but that doesn't meant it shouldn't be risky. removing insurance payouts in the way described would make people think twice and hopefully plan ganks with profit in mind rather than griefing. if noobs make mistakes, well...by the time they are flying something expensive enough to matter, they should be smart enough about the game to avoid such mistakes. also...what will get you killed by concord might be emphasized more in the tutorials and wiki if it doesn't get such treatment already."
12/4/2009,what about them? they'll learn. nobody bails out a newbie the first time they forget to upgrade or buy a new clone.
12/4/2009,insurance is not needed anymore in any case.ships will get much cheaper if we can get away of this isk faucet.
12/4/2009,"let's make something crystal clear: insurance is absolutely necessary, in one form or another. it needs to be ingame, i am not against adjusting current system, but if must stay, because if it is removed, a huge portion of lower income pvpers will be severely hurt, the people that spend half the time care baring(making isk in mostly safe way), and then sometimes get together and go for a roam and have fun, meaning a lot of casual players."
12/4/2009,"qft. hisec dwellers use the real life comparison of insurance companies not paying out bank robbers' cars then conveniently dispose of the rl analogies when it comes there own practices. if we are going down that ""realism"" route (which in eve is usually bad) then we can point out that using ur company leased ford mondeo in a vigliante attack on local criminals would also not be covered by any sane insurance company.point : remove insurance for suiciding, then remove it for missions too.i also agree that eve needs to remain dangerous, the constant level of danger, even if in hisec it is relatively low, gives this game it's atmosphere, pls don't take that away.edit. also, ships can be fitted with modules other than cargo expanders, ya know, mods that will prevent suiciding at a cost... when did eve start rewarding greed/laziness. these mods are there for a reason"
12/4/2009,"works for me, a concorde that doesnt always get its man and not considered a exploit if u do, but this needs to be damn difficult - may i suggest the higer the sec the % of insurance payout is decreased if losing ur ship to concorde and a debuffing of concorde in areas below 1.0.either way concorde definately needs looking at as well as insurance"
12/4/2009,"absolutely. rather than just insta omg wtfpwndead and then all is forgiven after 15 mins, how much better would it be to have a slightly less omnipotent concord, leading to high speed chases to the nearest lo-sec gate, with concord holding a grudge for rather longer (till the following downtime, say), so that suicide ganking becomes the preserve of the highly skilled bandit, executing a well-planned in a carefully fitted ship.to my mind this is infinitely better than the current spawn farming style of ganking in every way."
12/4/2009,"it's foolishly simple to evade factions that ""give chase."" in fw, malitias have often gone into opposing trading hubs with a competent fc and have managed to get kills there while evading the faction police.i like the thought, however thinking that it'll make suicides harder is false. you can't remove insta-warp-pwn and also have them give chase or you'll have free reign.oh and also i support removing all insurance."
12/4/2009,"how about remove insurance for concord response and self destruct, and in exchange remove the evading concord exploit and increase the response time of concord to a believable level.ie, so it's no longer considered an exploit to evade concord pwnage.(sry, slowpoke)"
12/4/2009,"just to be clear from the start, i never suicide ganked anything my opinion goes like this: you bassicly want to make suicide ganking harder to do by removing insurance?your main argument being, but the police destroyed them ... what about that raven you lost to guristas and that you were repaid ? didnt you look for it a little? ... why would the insurance work then ?bassicly, and ccp know it , insurance was put in place to help the newer player cope with the harshness of eve.the problem atm isnt suicide ganker, the problem is player moving around with billions in cargo, and thinking that no one will shoot at them ...so the suicide ganking is possible because a profit can be made of it, insurance just reduce the amount of isk required in a cargo in order to do it ... but realise they are trading sec status for a profit, and anything is legitimate in eve as long as your intent is to make profit!!! and at the core of thing, every ship lost in eve is a insurance fraud .. because the risk of dying to concord while doing a suicide gank is bassicly the same as the risk of jumping in ec-p8r in your shiny navy raven... so why should insurance pay for either of them .... ?so if you really want to base your argument on insurance, fine ... as long as your recommandation is to remove all insurance(no concord thingy base system)tl:dr dont touch insurance, unless you intend to remove insuran from eve for all ship and all pilot for any reason ... else ... its fine as it is move along bear"
12/4/2009,"suicide ganking is part of the game and should be kept in it. removing or reducing payment if destroyed by concord (rather than just any criminal act), would only make it so the cargo that gets suicided to is worth a little more than what it currently is. with the arty buff its quite easy to suicide so perhaps a risk/reward research and adjustment is not a bad idea."
12/4/2009,why don't you just admit that you don't like the fact you don't get all your isk back when you sucide gank?i don't care if you claim you don't... because that's what this is really about when it gets right down to it.fitting up that battleship and not getting your monies worth... yep... makes sense.
12/4/2009,"so it sounds like a lot of the suicide ganking is happening against indys and freighters carrying a load of expensive loot. gankers know this cause they can use a passive targeter module and then do a cargo scan on the hauler, not much the indy/freighter pilot can do about that.so as my part of my suggestion on how to reduce the suicide ganker problem i would like to propose a new module.cargo scan shieldingwould of course require a new skill to learn to use this module. with equal ranks in scan shielding skill on the hauler vs say.. scan resolution (random picked skill from the targeting tree that sounds like it would be used for something like this) skill on the potential ganker they could make it something other then an instant ""oh.. this guy is carrying five pith a small shield boosters!"""

12/4/2009,"hi all.been doing some thinking about some things that eve could be better with. one thing i thought of, was how annoying it was that i had to add all my contacts from one character, to my alt's contacts list.i'd like to propose an option in the contacts tab (or where ever it may best fit) to export contacts, so they can be easily imported to alts, and perhaps passed along to other players. i imagine it would be extremely handy for those of us that use alts (whether it be on the same account, or multiple accounts.)"
12/4/2009,"you cannot moon mine there. why?you cannot fire a dd device there. why?you need charters to run a pos there. why?why put out invisible barriers to another part of low sec? 0.4 isn't that different from 0.3 space and some 0.4 systems are more dangerous than 0.3 (etc etc). unless you add faction police/concord to 0.4 space, there is no real reason to keep it more restricted than other low security systems.who agrees?"
12/4/2009,"agreed on that score.read: amamake, one of the most dangerous systems outside of 0.0 in eve, and it's 0.4remove barriers that make 0.4 a complete no-man's-land with no ability for development... but oh, maintain the 'no dd' limit. no dd in lowsec, if you please."

12/4/2009,"i'm aware that the way eve is built right now, it couldn't really handle the system tracking single shots hitting people who get in the way (oops), but it would be , in my not humble at all opinion, a nice future addition to the game when the server and clients are fast enough (and we all have multi gigabyte connections) that shots and missiles could hit rocks, stations, your own corpies, neutrals whoever while having a fight. it would possibly make for interesting games at stargates, asteroid belts etc, and would add an fun new factor to fighting in blobs with a chance of said blobbers pwning some of their own mates while trying to pew (especially the over-eager ambitious guys at the back of the blob trying to shoot through to the enemy)."

12/4/2009,"i propose that when an alliance has sovereignty over a certain 0.0 solar system, that the alliance would be able to rename said solar system. there would need to be a profanity filter, and the solar system should revert to having a letter/number designation upon loss of sovereignty. i just think that it would add a bit of dimension, as opposed to having letter/number designations. it is a little bit more territorial to say that you have ownership form such and such a place to such and such a place. no one would know what you were talking about if you said, ""we own bnd-16 and 8mg-j6 and everything in betweem""."
12/4/2009,"i like this idea! it would make smaller groups feel like they really own this space, and it's theres to name and stuff. maybe make sov 2 a requirements so that the alliance has to hold it for at least a week to be able to rename."
12/4/2009,"i imagine renaming systems is something that will take some database voodoo, so it's something ccp probably wouldn't want to happen often. not sure how it could be limited with the new sov mechanics (maybe require at least one lvl 5 upgrade in the system to rename it?)"
12/4/2009,"while i think that 0.0 system names are random chars/numbers because the poor bastard ordered to come up with names ran out of ideas, i don't like the proposal. changing system names would only create confusion for pilots trying to get orientation and many other problems.i'd much prefer to see a ccp sanctioned submission and voting of names for important 0.0 systems, which then get implemented in a more definitive way."
12/4/2009,who would change the names on all of my bookmarks? crazy talk.
12/4/2009,"i agree, it would be a database issue. but the simplest way to fix that would be to simply have the new name implemented during downtime, the first 15 minutes of which is devoted to databasing."
12/4/2009,"i like this idea. and the new sov mechanics support it. like sov 2 or 3 is a couple weeks, so that would prevent it from changing often. and like the person above said, during downtime will help the database problem.as for the disorienting players, i find the random numbers and letters much more disorienting. also it will give more to rpers. and the bookmark system location names would change. which change the high-lighting. i don't know why you retyped the name of every system in your bookmarks... your crazy. (they're still the same system underneath the name is just different)(also i believe the op is only talking about 0.0 solar systems only, as in not constellations, regions. though constellations would be cool)"
12/4/2009,"this has come up before, and i'll respond to this proposal the same i responded to the last one.until there's a way for the naming system to reject names like ""l1ck my ballz"" and ""happy homo's house of head"" then no.not just no, but hell no."

12/4/2009,"i do not support your suggestions nor your claim that csm is a worthless entity. in a mandatory ""implement the most popular ideas"" situation, influential groups could put forward stupid or self-serving ideas and get them on the development roster simply through having sufficient numbers to vote it to the top. besides that, ideas often require discussion to work out the details and identify alternative compromises that are doable when the original idea cannot be implemented. anyone who's ever been involved in software development (or any other kind of project with collaborative outputs) knows that. in my opinion, playing devil's advocate on behalf of the player is the primary role of csm and they are doing that (csm3 notwithstanding, perhaps), despite your claims to the contrary.ccp is a private company with their own business goals and vision. we pay for the privilege of using their intellectual property. if we decide we don't like that ip or ccp's business practices, we can simply stop using it. in a million billion years, i would never support any kind of ridiculous notion that consumers of an entertainment service should have carte blanche powers over the company that invented, invests in, develops, and owns that service. hooray for market forces and consumer power and all that, but if every single indignant whiner about ccp and how it conducts game development were to stop subscribing right this minute, the player base would still be vibrant and viable. the disappearance of a highly vocal minority of dissatisfied customers would likely not even be noticed.nice presentation, but no support. i hope that csm4 becomes the poster child for how the csm can act effectively on behalf of the players--which isn't all about getting changes pushed through, by the way."

12/5/2009,supporting the sentiment that faction warfare should be looked at--or even re-envisioned.
12/5/2009,"supported. the fw mechanics need a serious overhaul. devs need to take a look, see what works, see whats broken (but repairable), see whats broken (but can be replaced with something better that does the intended job) and see whats broken (and should be scrapped completely)the very first attitude that needs to be scrapped is the attitude that fw is a stepping stone to the ""end game"" of 0.0. after all, how many current fw corps have come from 0.0 into fw?eve is whatever you make of it, whether your endgame is grinding out l4's while shaving seconds off your completion time by fitting the latest pimp combination of ship and modules, claiming your own slice of 0.0, squeezing every ounce of efficiency out of your mining operations, wormholes, factional warfare... etc... point is, any content could be seen as being end game content to someone. so, it's time to consider all content as being equally worthy of development rather than having the attitude that because 0.0 is currently seen as the only end game that it's the part that deserves the most attention all the time to the detriment of other parts of the game, not just fw."
12/5/2009,i only ever dabbled in faction warfare with an alt but undock games and other empire mechanics made it lame as hell. i encourage you to test the waters of 0.0 under the new dominion mechanics
12/5/2009,"sounds good to me. i like the idea of buffing faction warfare, i was in it for about 3 months after it came out, dropped because my friends were heading off to 0.0, decided to go with them.there are a few things however that are as they are now for good reasons. killing players for the lp for example.it can't be increased ten fold because of the risk of players killing off their own alts, losing nothing. it can't be increased ten fold, however it can still be looked at.one thing i didn't see in your post (i only skimmed it however) was the lag, i have heard numerous times and experienced it and seen it personally. lag also needs to be fixed."
12/5/2009,"well, lagwise, fw is paradise now. i remember the first blob fight i was in fw i had my rr-domi warp to centerpiece only to watch my ship desynch and ping-pong through the grid for 2 minutes and only getting back when i re-logged and warped into the remains of a large fleet fest littered with wrecks and fortunately my side held the field. i can only imagine what cap fights in 0.0 were like.they managed to fix desync issues so lag only really happens in lowsec when there are massive numbers of people in system like 100+ fighting on grid, but you can manage it disabling brackets, drones, explosions, etc.thank you all for the input everyone has been giving. keep it coming guys!"
12/5/2009,support a fw overhaul. this could be a major piece of eve if it was redesigned. lots of people are just waiting for a good fw model to be implemented.
12/5/2009,"some lp for kills would be great. ""would be"" because, i do not get them* (at least usually- some times it works), and as i heard not only i. but i do not cry: even if i receive the lp, the amount is ridiculous! and all we got for conquer all gallente systems is medal- yes it is cool, but... it is only medal.and doing something with wardecs is a must, in my opinion.*- petition did not help."
12/5/2009,"some of us have, and 0.0 now days is all about who has the larger blob,or the more naps. you should know, you had to convince half of new eden to finally strike down bob. new sov mechanics will hardly do anything about this, its just less pos shooting."

12/5/2009,thanks for the encouragement. however the idea of fw is prety close to exactly the game i would like to play. unfortunately the implementation is not really. i'd much rather play the game in the way that interests me than play the game in the way that interests you.
12/5/2009,"for the most part the lag is much better. kudos to ccp for that. however, fw does need some tender love and revamping. in its current state, fw is incomplete at best. it is more of a half implemented idea. let's fix it.-v for vorru"

12/5/2009,"that is not such a bad idea. similarly.. you could have a gas strip miner that is 1.5 x the rate of a gas harvester ii. so it makes a hulk = 4.5 x ghii's .. similar to 5 x ghii, and maybe add some bonuses to get it to 5.5 ghii's. then you give the procurer a larger boost so that its single gas ""strip miner"" is equal to around 6 ghii'snot a massive increase on what there is now (6/5 = +20%), but gives the procurer an additional role other than merc mining."

12/5/2009,mining crystals change color of mining laser beamfor consideration
12/5/2009,"first of all, i would like to start this on a very positive note, i would like to thank ccp for all the changes brought on in dominion and i would like to say i am very happy with the result of the graphics upgrade, and many other things as well, but this is not what this post is about.here is a proposal to update the current bookmark system, there has been some talk around this issue, here are some key things that stand out in my opinion:1. making bookmarks able to be flagged for fleet,corp,alliance 2. changing bookmark folders to databases which you can send to or receive coordinates from friendly pilots (through fleet or corp, etc...) without having create an item in your cargo, jet it, have the other pick it up and load it. this game is how many millenia into the future with multi million isk ships and we cant bluetooth a set of coordinates to each other?now here is my suggestion, even if ccp can't upgrade the bookmark system on the next release, could we at very least take a huge step into improving it by calling it something other than ""bookmarks""?i believe for rp and just for general game experience it would be better to call them ""coordinates"" or something of the genre which sounds so much cooler then bookmarks... i encourage everyone to post ideas for the new naming convention as i think just renaming bookmarks to something else would be something very easy for ccp to pull off and it would improve the gaming experience greatly for players like me all around the universe.now i do vote for the csm with all three of my accounts, and i do believe this is a valid issue with a very realistic request for change, i would greatly appreciate if the fine gentlemen of the csm could support my proposal in order to have it brought to ccp's attention.thank you very much for your time and consideration, i do welcome any feedback you may have.comari vokha - wormhole getaways"
12/5/2009,"i can drag and drop a ship fitting into corp chat, have someone click on the link, review the fitting and then save it to their library of fittings.bookmarks should be similarly easy to share, in chat, in mail etc. click .. see notes, option to add to people and places.corp and alliance bm's should be maintained as a separate tab by a director (or similar). you can drop from the corp list to your own list if you want (make a personal copy) but you cant add, delete or modify them unless you are a director.corps may assign the ability to add.modify/delete corp bm's to some members - typically those with good astrometric skills etc. anyone else would just have to send links in mail."
12/5/2009,"definently, the system needs an overhaul. as a wormhole dweller i do this bms manipulations everyday and i can confirm thats its nightmare"
12/5/2009,"the way bookmarks work now is archaic and annoying. would like to see a total overhaul, and agree that calling them something besides bookmarks makes sense."
12/5/2009,"bookmarks are important enough to have a separate user interface tool.i suggest changing the 'people & places' u.i. tool for use as a 'places' tool only where bookmarks will receive all the love they need. perhaps the new 'places' tool could be integrated with moondoggie. better moondoggie bookmark management might be needed.the other 'people & places' components, such as 'buddies', 'blocked', 'agents', and 'corp members' could be moved into the new evemail tool. those relocated components would function as in-box view filters appearing in the left column of the evemail tool. characters, whether npc or actual, will, from then on, be forced to use the evemail tool. i'll look forward to hitting the npc agents with the cspa charge."
12/5/2009,yes!
12/5/2009,completely supported
12/5/2009,"definitely supported. the only issue that might arise is that if a station is in low planet orbit (say ~500 km), an inty could quickly mwd to the the actual planet, which might create some interesting scenarios/glitches...edit:also, as previously mentioned, that would increase the number of times you go through a planet, which regardless of rp lore, looks stupid. maybe have the ship fly tangent to the planet/moons's surface and follow the orbit (at warp speed) to the station? (imagine a 'j' shaped trajectory...)double edit:come to think of it, that might pose a problem when align to warp from a planet...."
12/5/2009,"i absolutely agree on this, this would be very helpful.heck, you can even just take the new mail interface?that'd do, lol.."
12/5/2009,forgot self supporting here :)
12/5/2009,is bumping allowed here?
12/5/2009,"yeah, halo 3, call of duty..... totally dead right now."
12/5/2009,"cod games were fun the first few days, (edit) and the multiplayer was meh for a few days more :p yet ive played eve since 2005and who the hell owns a tv in 2009? seriously?"
12/5/2009,and electricity! i'll have to start using electricity now? neva!
12/5/2009,"well, since i have an hdmi input on the back of my flat panel monitor, i don't need a tv to play my xbox 360.you do have a monitor, amirite?i'm just saying...edit to reduce snarkiness:the point, and the reason ccp is engaging in this exercise, is because they're expecting to get new subscriptions. frankly, while i am sure they would love to have every single player of eve online sign right on up for dust too, they're probably smart enough to realize that they're marketing to two very different segments of the game playing marketplace.eve online is geared to a particular segment of the market - that being the late 20's+ person who likes a wide open game with lots of opportunities and doesn't coddle them (too much). dust (like most fps) is going to be geared towards the twitchy trigger finger crowd who are, at least in my experience, in the 14 - 20ish range.admittedly, there is some overlap - i, for example, loved halo, cod, and medal of honor (to name a few). so i will probably pick up dust, if it looks remotely interesting and has a single player mode that i can try. but your false dichotomy of dust or eve really doesn't seem very logical, tbh."
12/5/2009,"rather than cutting it off, let us orbital bombard the little sods to hell and back :dwith mind bullets!and xl artillery :d"
12/5/2009,"pretty much this. and some basic statistics to back up uronksur since tbh nobody else has, i have four rl mates who play eve and all of them have consoles (multiple). allowing for the fact that my ancient original ps up in the attic doesn't count, that's 80% on admittedly a very small sample. i also have a crapton of other mates who don't play pc games at all, but have multiple consoles.it's all about marketing to a different sector. should it be disconnected? in many ways it will be. but i really do like the concept of elite corps of mercenaries that can be hired by capsuleers to deal with certain tasks. taking stations, taking planets, etc. it would be cool tbh.what if they ruin your efforts to take space? well, should have got better mercs tbh. same if your capfleet won't undock/log on in a time of crisis. same if a corp theif steals all your stuff. same result, same failure on your part to sufficiently vet people you trust with an important piece in your eve jigsaw.tldr, not supported, bring it on!"
12/5/2009,"finally, someone speaking common sense. this comment is spot on. it really frustrates me when people fail to understand simple market factors such as demographic, multiple audience and profit. ccp is a company not a charity and they're trying to expand revenue - who can blame them for that?"
12/5/2009,"sadly i was just trying really hard to appear like a regular forum trollim not opposed to consoles much, but ihave no idea why people prefer consoles to computers (esp. in this day and age?)and second, while i would probably at some point be able to play dust, i dont think it will be popular unless its heavily intertwined with eve, its politics, and thus be a unique franchisesee, most things dwindle and go into oblivion like those flies that dies within 24 hoursand thus dust needs something that will keep people feeling special about what they do, and why they should progress farwell, in eve this is at the cost of others (usually) and thats how its gonna be in dust as wellbut how important will it be for eve players, that dust is alive? and how much less control will we have?btw. i have not yet looked at any writings about dust that goes into details about this, but i will have a look"
12/5/2009,"bear in mind, that if you're thinking this is only designed to appeal to eve players, that would be entirely self-defeating. i mean, if i were to go and fire up my console to play dust, i can't be also playing eve on the pc (not without a lot of :effort: anyway). this is about growth, not giving existing customers more choice."
12/5/2009,dust connected to eve is ok it will be a flop anyway.if you will have to decide what game you buy soem that all people know and want to play with you or some random planet shooter?ofc the first. most of the console owners never even heard of eve and even if they did clans or large communities will not switch toa newcomer console game.ccp doesnt simply have that kind of marketing power in us and asia to afford that. if they would eve would have wow sized subscription.the entire dust will end on pc anyway with 40% discount. anyone remember the time eve voice was payed and only 200 people bought it ?
12/5/2009,some random planet shooters -halogears of warcall of dutyi love how people just randomly spew garbage.and before you decide to flame me... answer me this...those first titles when they came out... where did they come from?nowhere...they where random shooters just like the rest...they become popular because people tried it out and liked it...anyone here who thinks they know better needs to remember that you don't... you can't predict what will happen... you know eve... we don't even know over half of what dust 514 will be like.so please... stop spazzing out will yah?
12/5/2009,"so, what, suddenly we have to blob everywhere just in case we find a carrier? i thought ""teh peopel"" didn't like the idea of blobs and were all crying out about the decline of small gang pvp?personally, i vote for the ""if you're pointed, you can't self destruct"" option. i think there's nothing better than a slow painful death to remind people not to be so stupid solo'ing in a carrier next time, or bashing a pos with next to no support.also, it's not just about the killmail for the gankers. it's about the lossmail. people deny it happened and there's no proof. take it like a man and learn from it instead of being a *****."
12/5/2009,show your support! this change is a slap in the face to the community and to the devs who fixed the naglfar just months ago!
12/5/2009,"just used my suicide gank alt with my bro both of us in ravens with smartbombs.landed on 6 mackinaws. my first cycle of smarties got the macks, his first cycle of smarties got the pods.all mackinaws had at least 3 empty mid slots.personally i don't think its the mechanics that are broken..."
12/5/2009,i love suicide gankingaloha ackbar!
12/5/2009,don't afk autopilot and fit a shield buffer to your haulers. problem solved.
12/5/2009,"i have a suicide ganking alt, and atm i'm quite happy, insurance being removed is ridiculous, just incase you make a nooby mistake and shoot someone on accident (we've all turned the warning off and shot someone on accident before)atm i make profit by buying ship, insuring, undocking, and blowing it up.i dont think the issue is with suicide ganking. but base prices and hence insurance values need to be adjusted so you dont make profit by losing insured ships.-rock"
12/5/2009,"general thoughts on topic;1)i agree suicide ganking has a place in game, therefore i have no issues with pilots doing ithowever a couple of points which i believe need further discussion;a) i believe steadfastly that losing a ship to concorde should invalidate the insuranceto compensate for this and bring balance, i would like to see the nerf bat hit concorde pretty hard, i would enjoy seeing the chases of old by concorde, i dont want to see the yulai incident returned but make it so concorde use the same damn fittings as everyone else (none of these godlike powers they seem to show like insta lock and insta armour/shield melt weapon)b) or as ive already mentioned reduce the insurance payout relative to the system sec level ie 50% payout for 1.0 sec, 60% payout for 0.8 etc etc2) suiciding ships for a prize worthwhile should occur but it requires to be difficult and costly - insta -10 for the pilot, no insurance payout but with concorde nerfed it should be possible with planning, prep and daring to take the prize and leg it with concorde burning after you and to be able to get away with minimal losses,will make for a interesting empire anyway lolor keep it as it is, the stupid will always be stupid - hauling high value items afk in crappy haulers ect but it would be nice to see more realistic police force without the power of god and obvious technology thousands of yrs ahead of the current tech used by pilots and the races.issue of suicide ganking etc includes 2 major points that walk hand in hand - insurance and concorde both need to be looked at and and brought in line closer to realism as possible"
12/5/2009,"the day you can no longer cuicide gankk for profit or for grief is the days eve becomes wow.it does not matter what you do in eve is for proffit or for your own personal amusement, because it all contributes to end user satisfaction of the game. ie sucsesseful gankk = happy gankker, unhappy victim or failed gankk = unhappy gankker and happy pilot that got away.please understand that the system that allows to gankk also allows more freedom. limiting gankk is limiting other aspekts of freedom in eve. so its not plain and simpple issua as to remove suiciding as it is to implimenting a ways to bring nonconsensual interaction for players before restricting something that is only way for killing othervice 100% untouchable npc corp huggers.before you cant propose beter alternative for cuisiding, removing it compleetly is out of question.its little same thing with local chat being allseeing inttel tool, its must be reworkked and removed but before it is we need to get something that replases it as a inttel tool (other than spamming scan every 5 seconds) to be atleat viable inteligence tool.in nut shell...you dont need to explaing your actions in eve, thats what makes this game grate!also mandatory: empire space is safer, not safe."
12/5/2009,"almost all penalties for crimes in eve come down to a monetary penalty (you lose your ship). if you can perfectly predict that loss, and that loss is low, almost any crime will become profitable.suicide ganking for profit is the problem. i believe suicide ganks are meant to settle scores, or really show you are prepared to lose something to try and kill someone. the faster response times of concord have made that harder. suicide ganking should never be a generally viable business model. it is just not believable.currently suicide ganking is very viable due to the insanely low cost of losing an insured ship. if bankrobbers only had to pay $100 for every bank robbery attempt, you can bet many people would be robbing banks. fix insurance, not with respect to suicide ganks, but in general."
12/5/2009,"nothing says that a changed concord has to be as ineffectual as faction police. and extended aggro means that you only get 1 attempt per day, not one every 16 minutes."
12/5/2009,snowballs! is the server room of eve online going to get filled up with snow again with the result of snowball launchers?i for one hope so! support if you would like snowballs to make another glorious appearance! p.s sorry if a thread like this popped up already but i couldn't find it
12/5/2009,supporting my own proposal
12/5/2009,"during the campaigning period for csm 4 one of the issues that was brought up was to do with the marketplace. dierdra vaal's votematch site featured a question about whether modifying prices of your orders should have to be more than 2% of the unit price. this was a terrible idea and anyone who voted yes to it is dumb, however the actual problem should be fixed.the problem is that bulk buying and selling is more of a job than it needs to be - particularly in remote markets far away from your normal base of operations because the current system encourages competitors to list their offers at a trivially better price. certainly for high volume items with a decent profit margin such as commonly used ships and mods, working the market often involves multiple modifications a day just to keep your orders competitive.my suggestion is to bundle together buy or sell orders that are very similar and treat them as a single order on the market. to do this, the market takes all orders of the same type (same item, same location and within a given percentage of the order price) and creates one listing on the market. this listing has the total number of items from all the amalgamated orders and the average price (a simple median average between the highest and lowest in the range). any new sell orders that are within the given percentage of an existing order price (say 2 or 3%) will be rolled into this general order and the order price will be normalised at that average price. purchases from this order would be filled from the smallest sell order that will meet the buy requirement - so if three people a, b and c are selling 200, 500 and 1000 items of a type respectively and i want to buy 400 of those things then i'll take most of b's stock; if i wanted 1100 then i'd clear out c and take 100 from a.with buy orders things get a little more complicated because there is also a range on them and a minimum buy amount. this is solved by only combining orders with the same range selection. it's important that buyers are able to choose the station they want to buy from so this has to remain open. buy orders with a minimum buy amount are also amalgamated and the lowest minimum is displayed to the buyer. in this case, the order would be filled by the smallest volume order that has a minimum quantity of less than the amount being sold and which requires the volume for sale.assume person a wants 200 of an item and has a minimum quantity of 50person b wants 500 and has a minimum quantity of 100person c wants 1000 and has a minimum quantity of 50.if i sell 70 units then a will buy them all, if i sell 400 then b will get them, if i'm selling 1100 then c takes 1000 and a buys my remainder. this means that high volume buyers and sellers are matched up without disadvantaging smaller orders.under this system, if someone wants to undercut or overbid then they have to offer a substantive discount and not a meaningless decimal difference. prices will still fluctuate, this doesn't remove the competitiveness from the market or reduce the choices that players make in buying or selling their stuff, it just makes the 0.01 game redundant.discuss and suggest improvements below."
12/5/2009,"sounds like what you will get is people undercutting bellow the bundling percentage until there is very little profit hurting the smaller producers, and would only add a new headache: calculating what that undercutting price will be.and then, selling the smallest orders first could mean trouble for the large producers, as new orders are introduced very quickly in markets like jita and they often need to check and undercut at a high rate to keep selling their stock while a small producer generally dumps his load and never checks again till a few days. not really supporting this but how about sales according to market power?ie, producers a, b and c hold 20, 30, and 50 percent of the total amount of an item on the market respectively. if buyer x buys 10 said items, then he will get 2 from a, 3 from b, and 5 from c."
12/5/2009,"so to undo the slap in the face to naglfar and phoenix pilots please change the citadel torpedo operation skill into ""citadel missle operation"" which will cover both citadel torpedos and citadel cruise missles! ccp just took all naglfails and phoenixs out of capital fights for a month as their pilots now have to train the near useless skill of cruise missles v. not to mention the new change vastly increases the training desparity for the naglfar and now puts the phoenix in the same boat as more sp for less bang than their coutnerparts."
12/5/2009,what limdood said.
12/5/2009,"mechanics could be set that the person is not liable for shots that hit others... although that could open up the griefing possibility of two griefmates positioning themselves at opposite sides of the victim's ship and firing at each other, and hitting the victim... but the wall of drakes seem like a cool idea a compromise could be that the ship's computers see that something is the way of the target, and simply not shoot if its neutral/not part of the target's corp/fleet/etc; that way you get the benefit of strategic positioning of ships, and none of the griefing possiblities..."
12/5/2009,"because that is what a sandbox game needs more, situations where you don't even have the ability to activate your guns. not to mention the use of neutrals as bodyarmor against hostile fire. and how would missiles work? self-destruct or hit the neutral? if they hit people will grief, if they self-destruct turret ships can shoot freely while neuts can block incoming missiles. maybe even change missiles to instant hit like guns, so we can actually ruin other tactical aspects of the game in an attempt to achieve another. the whole idea is full of problems, the idea isn't really needed and what is worst it is a huge resource hog. huge waste of effort and resources for some tactical benefit and a huge set of problems.not supported."
12/5/2009,"the first part convinced me to vote in favour, another tactic we can use. and it's realistic to boot.and i think missiles could possibly be the only exception to this as these things can change direction after being fired. they might just bump of a neutral and realign themselves instead of self destructing."
12/5/2009,im sick of it- i went to hi sec and everywhere i looked ppl where playing the game and having fun. obviously 11% is not enough. if we want more carebears forced into player corps the tax should be 90% at least.heres a bunch of reasons why it should be made 90%.1. because they make more isk then i do.2. they refuse to come into lowsec/null so that i may shoot them3. rabble rabble rabble!4. there arent enough 1 man corps in the game already.im sure you have your own reasons why the tax should be raised- please post them here along with your support.
12/5/2009,"ok, granted, the op is a troll... but the sentiment: npc corp taxes far too low is very true.npc taxes should be a slow progression from zero (for the first week) to something extreme like 85% after a year. joining a player corp reverses that timer at the same rate so people can't just jump back and forth once a week.first week: 0second week: 7%first month: 11%second month: 22%third month: 33%ect ect. npc corps are meant to be transitionary posts, not lifestyles."
12/5/2009,"nice troll. how about posting with your 0.0 main, so we can come and shoot you a bit? or are you one of those ""i dock up when they roam through our system"" guys?"
12/5/2009,"how about we just raise the noob corp (yes, they're noob corps... no matter what the ""npc corp"" members want to call them) tax to 40% and call it good? if not, then i support an ascension of the tax over a year to some obscene amount, but if you leave the noob corp your tax will start at 35% or something and start climbing from there again... it won't start back at the bottom.basically, those who have been in their noob corps for years have told me that they don't join pc corps because they don't like dealing with politics and wardecs and whatever else. they should have to pay for the right to not be wardecced, and 11% of the 5-10mil an hour they make with level 4 missions is just not enough. most pc corps have taxes higher than that, so how is that supposed to get them to join one?"
12/5/2009,"frankly i don't think we have quite enough downtime in this game. the hours and occasionally days of it, server crashes with 1-hour re-boot times, i find it all terribly exciting, there's definitely some award-wining potential there"
12/5/2009,"no to mention log-in cues. they need to be much much longer.in all seriousness, what other web-based product out there puts you through the ringer (in this fashion) on as regular a basis? theres no excuse for this, but im sure we'll hear plenty, else the topic will be simply removed"
12/5/2009,"i understood it, and oh boy, i did read it. i spent quite a while reading it as it took me quite some time to fully accept that your proposal really was as inane as it seemed. your idea is idiotic, and makes an assumption that is contradicted by all the subscription demographics surveys."
12/5/2009,"...i give up, if you guys arent going to read what i said and just make up your own stuff then theres nothing i can do, fair comment about the 'old' statement but if you bothered to read 'old and dry' you would understand that my suggestion is to 'change' the homepage, i never at any point said ccp arent attracting customers i just said based on the 'old and dry' home page / forums it most likely 'looks' like it is attracting 'old' people,..but apparently from my op you thought i said ccp arent attracting anymore customers, i also said 'i am thinking it is for old men' based on the design but somehow you read ""is for old men, even though i immediately said 'which it isnt',..feel free to make up stuff, i dont mind thats what free will is all about"
12/5/2009,"we did, and frankly, its frivolous and based on a perception of eve online's demographics that i refuted.you could always show us how we misinterpreted what you said. but i suppose its easier to pretend to be some sort of martyr and whine about how mistreated you are. based on the concern that the player base was old, and stagnating when this is not the case. clearly the home page is either quite popular, or has no effect whatsoever on subscription numbers and demographics.and i showed how this was completely wrong.clearly it isn't perceived as designed for old men, since the average age of a eve subscriber is 27. we didn't. you just had the misfortune of people in possession of logic and google seeing your thread."
12/5/2009,"nice spin, so your first post is random stuff that i never said where you are adding stats, funny since i said 'attract more people' but you dont understand what that means,..now you contradict yourself by quoting stuff, disagreeing with what i say yet fail to quote the additional parts, in the end you have just agreed with me and added some random thing about stats and google,..obviously you are unable to admit your mistake and now derailing to google, because a mainstream generic search engine really has anything todo with what i said,.. if you dont agree, dont then, no need to make up stuff that have nothing todo with what i have said,..you bore me, so i will let you make something else up and have the last say,.."
12/5/2009,"no, my first post was perfectly relevant. your entire premise was that eve online looked like it was designed for, and had the possibility to ""attract more old men"", which was factually incorrect, as i showed.yes, because you thought eve was going to appeal to old men, which a simply search on google for ""eve player demographics"" refutes. a search engine helps you find things... like statistics that refute your idiotic premise.i'm not making anything up. its not my fault your suggestion was based on such a stupid premise.ah. the ""i am a martyr"" appeal for sympathy."
12/5/2009,"i am web designer and i must say the website is ok... it cannot be simpler or nicer.. simply due to huge amount of information. for site with this amount of info, it's structure is nice, easy to find what i'm looking for and graphics is not that bad...for new design browse to dominion site.. where you lack any info :)"

12/5/2009,"contact me in game, ill help you to find c2/c3"
12/5/2009,no.
12/5/2009,given that 95% of the rubbish that clutters up this game is irrelevant i'd say your idea is not completely terrible. maybe just use the forum as a trap. anyone who posts there would get taken behind the barn and the problem would solve itself.
12/5/2009,"lol! i can see both sides, i mean it is a bit pointless, but then we did it too and got some old members and friends calling in on the thread and saying ""hi"", which was nice.it's difficult to know what caod is for though to be honest. if you get rid of nice threads like these (they tend to be nice normally, i didn't see too many people calling us out on our terrible alliance history ) then caod will pretty much be 50% lies and 50% propaganda.i don't know, maybe it belongs alongside the recruitment stuff? anyway not supported for now, convince me otherwise and i might change my mind."
12/5/2009,"except that, as it's your space, you've onlined a gssc or whatever the op wants to call it, so you do in fact still know what you used to know before, i.e. that the cloakys are there - somewhere. only if you don't bother to fit this upgrade will you not see local, according to this proposal. or, it would be an opportunity to go and take that space, and set up your own communications structure. and as an aside, god forbid anyone should have to use scouts, omg, that's like, hard mode or something.good idea, op, it's the best i've seen on this topic in my view.edited for failquoting and fail-to-tick-support."
12/5/2009,a rather good idea if i may say so
12/5/2009,"i agree with this assessment. at first glance it looks like a good idea. probably needs some tweaking in the area of balance, it makes logical sense with the way things are being implemented in nullsec atm.supported."
12/5/2009,"i don't think this is a particularly good idea. now, dont call me an expert or anything, but basically nobody will spend their rp's on datacores for a year, building up the rp's for a blueprint, then get the bpo, never need datacores again, and omg there goes another piece of the market (datacores to zero, t2 prices crash after rocketing whilst everyone hoards their datacores).also, what rps are you proposing you would need? items generally need more than one type of datacore, often not provided by other agents of the same corporation. are you suggesting the rp's should be combinable across all corps / factions into a single ""buy-your-shiny-things-here"" galaxy-wide rp store?tbh, after typing all that i now feel like i've been trolled by a grumpy inventor with the wrong decryptor."
12/5/2009,"this. this is what makes eve what it is after all, it *is* a cold dark harsh place, and knowledge is what helps you survive.you can get tablets ... ;-)"
12/5/2009,"almost every patch since i joined eve was accompanied by issues that appeared rather easy to be spotted and fixed, yet they still made it into the version deployed on the production system (tq).examples include the jump gate bug (people getting stuck after using a star gate), not being able to patch, or clients refusing to continue after the splash screen.(examples from the time before i joined include the infamous boot.ini disaster)idea: introduce a (e.g.) 2 week delay for releases to mature on sisi before moving them to tq.i always thought the test system (sisi) is not really used that much and that a lot of potential is being wasted there. now i know that sisi is already used for some tests (eg. large scale fleet battles) but it still seems like changes are made till the last day before actually deploying on tq.the thing i'm talking about is making a proper release and deploying it to sisi and then doing bug-fixes only on that branch for some time (e.g. 2 weeks) before deploying that branch to tq. no more functional or non-functional changes, no matter how small.i understand the choices for release dates (especially for dominion) but there is really no need to try to cram as much features into each release and ending up with ditching some of them again (meaning: set an internal release date two weeks before the ""official"" release and cut the feature list accordingly).i think the majority of the player base will prefer a smooth release they could test extensibly over a release with more features but also more problems.i also know this will not and cannot eliminate all bugs or problems. but the difference can (and should be) that people can actually test and complain about issues without having their normal gameplay on the production system compromised.but this takes time! not everyone is interested in doing this. not everyone has time to do this within a few days before the actual deployment to tq and not everyone knows about / can access sisi - we are not your testers, but some of us would really like to help!having a generous amout of time to test on sisi and enough announcements to reach most of the player base (e.g. motd) could eliminate a lot of the superficial issues taking the form of threadnaughts we're seeing for every release.there is really no need for users reporting ""i cannot patch"" / ""i cannot start"" / ""i cannot jump"" issues and i will be the first to live 2 weeks on sisi if i knew i'd be beta-testing the upcoming release and not just some snapshot.but right now it feels like testing some intermediate release that will undergo a lot of changes before getting deployed, meaning testing something that is not going to tq anyway.ban doga"
12/5/2009,"this sounds like ""i want to help! but i don't want to make the minimal effort. so completely change the way you patch the main server in order to facilitate my unreasonable wants.""no thanks. there will inevitably be bugs in every patch. i think ccp is already more then diligent in having sisi, and opening it to anyone who wants in."
12/5/2009,"could you explain the ""unreasonable wants"" part?i'm not sure what it refers to.edit:or to phrase it differently:""what would have been worse for you if ccp had deployeddominion 1.0 on november 17th (sisi)dominion 1.0.1 on november 18th (sisi) dominion 1.0.2 on november 27th (sisi) dominion 1.0.2 on december 1st (tq)?"""

12/5/2009,this.can it be that hard to fix? what about implementing curved warp paths? problem solved right there with no drawbacks to speak of. i also like the idea of using celestial objects to hide from scan.

12/5/2009,"i just get very simple idea how to do it.... :)as programmer i would do it like this:if planet closer than 350km than set orbit at 350kmelse fly free :)why 350km?? as found in wikipedia:the thermosphere is biggest of all the layers of the earth's atmosphere directly above the mesosphere and directly below the exosphere. within this layer, ultraviolet radiation causes ionization. the international space station has a stable orbit within the upper part of the thermosphere, between 320 and 380 kilometers. auroras also occur in the thermosphere."

12/6/2009,"ok, i am a hardcore pc gamer, one that can play crysis on ultra high. the simple lack of anti aliasing or shadows that are soft seems absurd to me. i love the game in general, and i could play it as is with no problem for a year, except for this... it absolutely drives me crazy. what type of company makes a game without anti-aliasing or soft shadows? it completely ruins the planets they have made, not to mention the ships. and it certainly isn't because one has a crappy computer, they could just turn it off. is it because ccp is lazy?example for how the planets are affected are the temperate planets... ones with water and such. the continents and such seem to be set as their own physical body, and there are a bunch of jaggies around them. i have tried to use work arounds and to no avail. the jaggies are also right below the atmosphere, the planets surface. the ships are just horrid as they have multiple levels and bumps it seems, and the engines used to hack the game to make the aa better only make it slightly better, and you can still see the bumps."
12/6/2009,or you are just too lazy to search?you want aa+hdr on nvidia card in eve premium... look here!
12/6/2009,yes but this is flawed. why doesn't a game that costs 120 a year have it?
12/6/2009,iirc the problem was that the nvidia driver normally doesnt allow hdr and aa at the same time. which seems to work on ati cards. (cant check that as i dont own ati cards since years)
12/6/2009,which is why we need aa.
12/6/2009,finding graphics card setting that work with eve is like pulling teeth!
12/6/2009,"exactly- which still brings the point why ccp hasn't added aa - all modern pc games have it, to prevent jaggies. and the point of soft shadows is because the shadows have jaggies as well."
12/6/2009,please for the love of god bring us ships that don't look like infinite staircases and shadows that don't look 8-bit.
12/6/2009,i approve of said message.
12/6/2009,"i have to agree.after looking into this problem for a while, the best i have been able to do is make the game look nice but it dosent have anywhere near full aa. also for me the shadows arent the nicest things i have ever seen.i run an nvidia 8800gtx - so along with other nvidia users have had to f**k around trying to find hot fixes / work arounds.... with no 100% luck.your best bet mate is to search google, as ive had more luck with the latest nvidia drivers (195. somthing i believe) together with the nvidia control pannel. edit - of course try playing around with the lastest drivers and nhancer version 2.5.7 - that should improive things.so yea defo supported!"
12/6/2009,also motion blur and depth of field plz - make eve look like the newer trailers
12/6/2009,"one person posts a fix that works for 15 people and you call the problem solved? as it happens, that doesn't work for all nvidia cards, nor is the so-called fix applicable for every driver version. you'll note i'm sure that different people had to use different compatibility settings, and not all are provided by default in nhancer. this is not trivial. getting aa & hdr working together at all is extremely difficult for some cards & drivers which is why valve spent time developing their own custom shaders to get around the problem, and why they have aa & hdr available on their games & anything source-based.on the topic: supported. i couldn't care less about hdr, but it seems incredible that after years of graphics development, eve still doesn't have any aa support or testing built in. forcing it through the driver/nhancer can be quite complex and just shouldn't have to be done. is this a professional game or not? more to the point, eve can no longer really call itself a niche game for a few thousand technically-capable players. mainstream games do this sort of thing in their sleep - it's called being user-friendly."
12/6/2009,"for the love of god, give us antializing! and soft shadows! it ruins half the artwork that our dear art team spends so much time doing. yes, that solution of forcing aa does partially work for me, but only partially, and only on one of my 2 pc's.it is damn important."

12/6/2009,"when i first witnessed an incarnation of this, an amarrian capturing minmatar complexes without being shot at by the npcs, i bug reported it (#60498, 2008.07.26 16:27:37). the reply then was:this is indeed the case there. a minmatar (just to cycle factions around a bit, all sides have used this at some point or another) capturing amarr plexes will get minmatar standings, thus lose amarr standings, so this will solve itself over time - actually, rather quickly.this ""new incarnation"" is different, though, as the ""allied faction"" does not get any standings. so the caldari fw pilots with high minmatar standings do not get any amarr standings for capturing minmatar complexes, which in turn means they do not lose minmatar standings, so this does not solve itself as the other bug does.hence, i have bug reported this ""new incarnation"" of the problem (#88013, 2009.12.02 19:35:40), noting that the original design of this problem ""balancing itself out"" does not work here.no reply on that bug report so far."

12/6/2009,"this is not really much different from the speedtanking issue we had to deal with since the nano changeswhether a frig sits in the plex not getting shot at all or orbits the timer with ab while being shot by 30 npcs not taking any dmg is really not much of a differenceand yet the same minmatar that heavily abused speedtanking in the past (and still do!) are now outraged because of this standing issueso who is being a hypocrite here?fixing only one of this issues will only benefit one side while screwing over the other onealso since the plex mechanics in fw seem to heavily reuse existing eve mechanics i doubt that fixing this would be easy, probably involves rewriting a lot of code and decoupling fw mechanics from non fw onesmaybe there should really be some kind of fw round table where all 4 militias sit together and formalize one csm issue covering all problems and then get the members off all 4 militas to vote for it aswellas long as the issues remain small and too one sided you won't get enough supporters"
12/6/2009,"damar you are exploiting (small ""e"") a ridiculous loophole in the fw system to remove the enjoyment of thousands of players. the war that has been fairly decently fought by those players will be brought to a conclusion in weeks now by what will be commonly recognized by as cheating the system. while ccp gm's and developers have thus far failed to see the implications of this loophole i do not think it gives you free reign to act like this and destroy the integrity of the faction warfare conflict like a spoilt child raging against a lack of parental attention.if the war ends like this the amarrian rp community will never recover from the taint. any 24th crusade corporation publicising victory posts will be viewed as sharing your exploiting of the game system and all that will be left will be the same kind of bitterness that stalked and ruined the black rise zone.to your motivation. i cannot agree. i don't like log-in traps. it doesn't mean that i logout my entirely alliance at gates and perform such traps 24/7 to make my point.you are ruining faction warfare for thousands of players right now. either admit you are doing it for the agenda of ""griefing"" (which lets face it is certainly an eve tradition) or stop doing it. unless the tlf players can summon up a goon-style threadnaught on general forum of 200+ pages in the next few days to complain about this situation then i cannot see ccp being able or willing or act fast enough to prevent the end of this warzone through this tactic."
12/6/2009,yes it is very disappointing to see pie making rp propaganda mileage out these system captures achieved purely through the caldari plexing technique. i admit i expected more from them on an ooc level.well ultimately if they use the advantage to win the war they are complicit. in pie's place i'd have simply wardecced these caldari for ruining the spirit of the war for everyone involved but then thats me ... and i'm pretty wardec happy at the best of times.
12/6/2009,"i can not blame pie for making rp out of it. i would love to make rp out of it, too (the minmatar are supposed to be the underdogs, and hell, my alliance has been saying we'll be losing the war fast if it's started, so it actually fits into my rp background) - but it's just not possible to go ""uh, well, the caldari have brought a large group of barely trained pilots that are not being shot at by our fleet if they are capturing the complex, and we failed to set up regular 12'o'clock fleets, and i'm not helping because the republic doesn't want my alliance to help, ..."" - the bugginess of the mechanics makes icerizing the whole thing absolutely impossible for me.on the other hand, i am not worried about losing systems. that just means there are more options to capture them back.what i am worried about is that the minmatar militia will lose active pilots interested in plexing because ""losing"" is demoralizing, thus breaking the nice balance we had between the amarr and minmatar militias for a very long time. the lack of balancing factors in fw just means that the normal failure cascades in large groups have very permanent effects."
12/6/2009,"yes, the amarr could refuse to take the sys... wait, was that 3 minmatar systems being taken in quick succession by use of this bug?with respect, players, no matter what side they're on, will not care how a system goes vulnerable, all they'll care about is that it's in a position to be taken. those 3 systems prove that.have to admit, it's certainly going to be interesting seeing ccp's response to this as there's no way they can claim that this is working as intended.destroying the warzone that was best balanced, however was probably not the best way to do this. had you done it from the gallente side to do in a few weeks what honest plexers have been trying to do for months, then you'd have made a bigger point.so, what do you think. don't look at it from the point of view of a leading caldari plexer, but from a purely neutral point of view :- with the use of this tactic, could you reset the battlelines in the gallente-caldari war within a few weeks? could you undo what dozens of players on the caldari side had put several months of constant effort into achieving?"
12/6/2009,i have to ask... why? why on earth should you be able to seize an enemy faction's military outpost without anyone trying to shoot you?

12/6/2009,"now after the sov revamp, a full fw revamp would be nice.i think it can be made into something usable, but to make it into something really good, you need to remove the division between plexing and pvping, so you don't have two different (and almost disjunct) crowds for those.but that would require a rather drastic change to plexing all in all. and i have no idea what kind of change.fixing the bugs and making it balanced (even for vastly different militia sizes and participation) is quite straightforward and doable, so doing that first would be a great."
12/6/2009,"aha, so this is all about your own self-interest after all.you have to put some more effort in ""defending"" (as in use 10 untrained afk alts to sit at the buttons) the caldari systems now because there suddenly are more than 2 people that can deal with overpowered caldari npcs. so off you go, grief the minmatar until they start posting whinethreads, so you have your way and you can keep on defending caldari space with your 10 untrained alts."
12/6/2009,"this is the first i'm hearing of this, and yes, it does greatly diminish the victories. let's hope ccp acts quickly, on all the fw issues. though i'm not holding my breath.as to the rp side, i don't think it can be expected that we ignore the systems going vulnerable, and seeing what the caldari have done in such a short time when she and the rest of the 24ic plexers have been busting their humps for just about a year and a half has really put mitara into a depressed state"
12/6/2009,it should be addressed along with the bug fix for the dodgy timers that keep going even when the plex is empty.
12/6/2009,agreed whole heartedly. how that particular bug has survived in the wild for at least 8 months when it is know and reported i'll never know.please consider supporting this thread as well:
12/6/2009,"to be honest the bugged timers are worse than the standings issue.the real, and most simple, solution to both of these, and pure speed tanking, is the requirement that all the navy must be destroyed before the plex can be captured."
12/6/2009,"what makes the standings issue more of a problem is that the plex bugging can be petitioned; the standings abuse can't. so the former can not be abused on a large scale such as it is currently done with the standings.but yes, there are so many idiotic bugs it's not funny anymore."
12/6/2009,"if i learn one thing from this it's that i can't stand plexers and their pathetic, game ruining pendantry and one-upmanship, whether they are gallente or caldari. please just sod off all of you and take ur silly meta-dramas elsewhere, i for one am sick to death of all of you.edit, tbh let's just get this over with, all matari should just completely ignore all plexes. let the caldari take them all and get ccp to do something about it so we don't have to listen to them and the gallente plexers *****ing on about a mechanic that means nothing to most ppl in fw over and over and over ..."
12/6/2009,"in truth, no. i don't believe that. as long as this, or any other, loophole exists then there are people on all sides who would gladly exploit it. no side is whiter than white when it comes to that.i can only speak for myself when i say that i've never deliberately triggered off any of the assorted exploit/bugs. there was one time when i was forced to warp out under heavy npc fire when taking a plex solo, repaired my ship and returned to the plex to find that the plex timer was still running. no idea how it happened and no idea of how to reproduce it in sufficient detail for a bug report. i'm told that it's been bug reported several times in the past however by people on all sides.as to the plex i was in, i got back within range of the timer and finished off the rats to successfully take the plex legally.someone did say above that plexes should require you to kill all the hostile rats to close them. on that i'd have to agree, however there should be rats spawned from both sides to make it just as hard to take a defensive plex as it is to take an offensive plex.the requirement to kill the rats would solve the standings issue as the person running the plex would be aggressed to the rat faction, it would solve the t1 speedtanking frigate issue as they would not have the dps to take on a plex solo and it would solve the bugged timers problem as finishing the plex would no longer require you to orbit a button, just wipe out all the npc rats of the opposing faction before the other side can wipe out the rats of your faction.of course, it'd damage your standings towards the opposing faction, but then there should be consequences to getting into fw. after all, with the level 1 agent changes from dominion it's now impossible to permanently lock yourself out of any faction's space."
12/6/2009,"just didd some testing on tq.nyx w/ full slave sett, t2 trimarked and dedspace fitted and with dmg control + armor link and shield link.then fired a avatar doomsday. this put the nyx with 20% armor left!23:47:42 combat xxx (judgement) hits you for 746 464 damageif you dont have a slave sett you wil die in one dddont have a trimark and dmg controll fitted you wil die in one dd"

12/6/2009,"i can think of many ways this can be abused, but.. since i'm biased and a mothership pilot myself, i'll just thumbs up on it anyway.45d+ on my next skill, unless anything changes i have no reason to log him in. if i could dock i could at least jumpclone to my old +5 clone and cut down the training somewhat. either that or let me pop out in a carrier now and then, anything.he's just paid to be laughed in the face as it is."
12/6/2009,"aeon with triple trimark, hg slaves, akemon's 8%, x-type/a-type, gang bonus etc etc yada yada, only thing missing to max it out was damnation-bonuses: one dd took out full shield + closer to 30% of my armor. that's an omnitank around 91% average resists.i could imagine an extreme scenario where that would tank three fully skilled titans, but then you're so deep in structure that you die if you fart in your seat, not to mention you spent about as much money on lowslots and implants as you did on your hull. disregarding mid/highs/dronebay etc.more likely most moms die to 1-2, in some cases 3, and extreme cases 4. i think most of us know how common it was to park 3-4 titans to aoe-dd people on jump-in when defending systems, nothing really stops them from instagibbing a mothership before it can even slowboat inside a shield on a jb pos. it'll be even easier in lowsec where it's quite common to share lowsec systems for pos'.quite amusing to the say the very least, havn't seen such poor ship balance since no-stackingnerf damage mod days."
12/6/2009,"i was literally 4 hours from putting a nyx in the cooker when you guys reversed course. i know a few guys who aren't so lucky. it is pretty hilarious that the reasoning given for rolling them back was that you guys didn't like their ""role"" and so you moved them back to the role of useless isk sink.think of the children."

12/6/2009,there is a topic for shared corp bookmarks hereimprovements to the bookmark system are overdue...
12/6/2009,"lots of really good ideas floating around regarding the bookmark system. i completely agree that bm's should easily be dragged & dropped, whether it's a chat window or e-mail. i am unsure of all the suggestions made but here are some others to consider.1. allow users to copy bm's from the bm window onto the combat view, displaying an icon with it's text label (maybe even the ability to turn off text labels). imagine access to a handful of bm's immediately without the need to scroll through the bm window or to even need it opened taking screen real estate. it would also be nice if the user can place these bm icons in any place within the combat view, maybe even set the icon size and/or even copying of bm folders. kind of like what users do everyday when they create shortcuts on their desktops.2. when editing the label of a bm eve does not prevent you from using other windows.3. give users the ability to assign colors to bm's, nothing crazy just a small palette of colors. naturally if the bm can not be used it still remains gray.hopefully ccp can take some time to start hammering out some of these critical game/ui changes. nice thing about these kinds of changes, everyone benefits."
12/6/2009,"as mentioned by almost everyone of you, warping through objects just looks silly right now. i agree. but i think to avoid that planets are revealed as flat circles with a texture, there could be created an effect like ""fading out"" the sourrounding as you warp through a planet. just for a second. it could look like the planet itself would create a shadow in warp. just because of it's mass. it also would sound even relatively feasible to me."

12/6/2009,"i agree with you that there is a problem here for dominion, so i am throwing in my support for a fix to docking games.on the other hand, i am not sure that an extended aggression timer is the solution.in normal space, why not let people dock up to escape pirates, combat etc. if you do not have a gcc then run for a safe zone. pirates just need to tackle better to prevent you from doing so.as for player sov space, think of it this way (for the dominion patch). you are fighting on their home turf, so they get the home ground advantage of local repairs. it just means that you need a bigger force to over come them.the ""infinite"" repairs is an issue. i see no reason that a person can't dock, repair, and region the fight, it's the fact that they can do it indefinitely which is the problem.consider these 2 tweaks to the system.1 - repairs are not instant. armour & structure take time to repair, and shields and capacitors need time to recharge. in a station, you pay, and it may take 5-10 minutes (depending on damage) for the repairs to complete. players should get the option to cancel repairs at any time, if they are in a rush, but this leaves them with some damage, and a loss of any isk they forked out.the rate of repair is should be equivalent to about 2-3 times the largest remote repair module.what this also provides is time for you, the aggressor. while they dock and repair, you get time to repair as well. their repair (station based) is going to be faster than yours (ship based) but not immediate. just make sure that you bring several logistics ships with you in a conquering fleet.2 - repairs are limited.give the station a limited capacity to repair, just like manufacturing. you need to wait for a slot in the repair bay. starbases in normal space have a huge limit, (to keep mission grinders happy) but player controlled stations and outposts have very few repair slots. (which could be another part of the long term sov upgrade... adding more facilities such as improved repair bays) stations should also have an equivalent to a ""capacitor"". in normal, day to day operations, this will remain stable at close to 100% as they would have a cap recharge rate to remain stable even with half of the repair bays in use. in a large defensive campaign, however, when you have ships of all sizes docking up, all repair bays are in use and there is a queue forming...the cap will drop and eventually run out. then repairs stop until the station can replenish its battery banks.what this provides.it does not set out to solve docking games at a normal station. if a pirate goes after someone and they do not have a gcc timer, then they should be able to dock and reach safety. i do not see a problem with this at all. if you are hunting someone and they dock up.. then wait, get a better tackler, or choose a different target.what it does provide is a limitation on player held regions of space. if your cap fleet arrives to take on their cap fleet, then you can take them down. they have the home ground advantage, but its not infinite and immediate. you just need to make sure you have an overwhelming force.issues?this could be extended to all parts of the game, not just player controlled space, but would impact on mission runners trying to repair and head back to a mission. imo ... tough. eve is not safe.. so learn to minimise damage and warp out before its too late."

12/6/2009,"some of you need to realize that your small gang isn't supposed to pwn everything. no, blobbing isn't the answer. but neither is it to nerf everything to hell because your small gang can't kill it in under 2 minutes. jeez, what next, nerf titans' tank so that a trio of hacs can take it down in 2 minutes?if it self-destructed then you caused damage. be happy and move on. stop asking ccp to nerf everything you and your buddies cant kill.nuff said."
12/6/2009,"there is one more way, a small workaround, and that is to apply the same rule as with npcs that was done.if a person self destructs in combat a killmail is generated and the person with highest damage gets it. note: it has already been done and i guess it shouldn't be too hard for ccp to implement."
12/6/2009,whinemoar? sorry you can't just gank everything you want and make profit.
12/6/2009,"exactly. see a target that your ""gang"" can't handle? try leaving it alone. pack animals in nature seem to have a good handle on knowing what to attack and what to leave alone. pirates in eve are supposed to be like a pack of carnivores, try acting the part for once.the self-destruct mechanism, when viewed with the above in mind, is a defense mechanism, basically telling you that you picked a target too big for you to handle. when such a mistake happens, learn from it instead of coming here crying about it.guess what? small-gang warfare is a thing of the past. ""small"" gangs of 10 seem to be the absolute minimum these days...for fw. i don't even want to know what the minimum size is out in 0.0.and before you say it...no, the self-destruct mechanism is not a major factor in that development.and the op shouldn't? seriously, this non-issue argument is brought up over and over again, solely for the sake of e-peen waggling, and eve doesn't need more of that. no matter how much logic or ""common sense"" is behind any arguments put forward in favour of this, it's clear as day that they're all used to hide the obvious selfish fact, you want your kills easier and your killmails fatter.not supported.edit: cleanup."

12/6/2009,"i think even the suiciders are not finding much reason that any insurance company should always pay out for ships lost in commission of a crime. and that could go to noobs too, but noobs get a free rookie ship anyway and it would teach them a lesson (such as ""this is not wow and there is no ""dueling"").no insurance on missions too? why not? i never think of things as ""screw the gankers! give me a leg up!!!"" i think changes to the game have to affect everybody in the same vector. if suicide ganking is to be reduced via removal of payouts for being concorded, then there has to be some balance to that point that losing a ship voluntarily means you will not collect. the same could, and this must be admitted, apply to lowsec. it's logical, actually, for any insurance company. back when i was a marine mechanic on the florida coast, many of the large yachts had to leave the caribbean before the first day of hurricane season or their insurance policies were canceled (this kept me busy because they had to be checked out before going to sea and heading north). therefore, why it seems very fair to revoke insurance payouts for those who decide to commit crimes, and fair for those who put their ships into combat in missions and fw to not have a payout or pay a higher premium, it would also be fair to revoke payouts for anyone who takes their ship into low security or 0.0 space too. i don't think i personally like it, but it seems fair. and lets face it, most of the pvpers who would be affected by this are either gankers, or working for corporations that have plenty of isk and resources so they will not be crying as big a river as they say they would. basically, insurance is for accidents and losses incurred through a set of circumstances in a given contract. most medical plans don't cover scuba accidents, for example, but you can get scuba insurance that could cover the cost of airlift and baro if you get bent and that's like 100-150 a year. missions, faction war, ganking in hi-sec, and going into lowsec: these are what no insurance company in its right mind would cover a ship for. and a side bar about this ""realism"" thing. it people don't want any sense of realism where it's logical, such as comparing how a real insurance company won't pay out for cases where the owner is stupid, then stop it with the ""eve is hard. get over it or hello kitty online is that way"". what's it going to be, then? if voluntarily undocking and getting popped is ""your fault"", then suiciding a ship and not getting payout is whose fault? many who tout this ""anti realism"" stance while using game mechanics for a low-cost effort are fooling themselves and this is indicated in their attitude that suggest it was the fault of their target for, well, not being like them. thus if the ""eve is hard"" thing is to be worn on the sleeves of those who want to rub the noses of other players into it, then they should all petition for removal of clones. no more clones, that's it. then and only then can someone playing a game chalk up any accomplishments over which they can, in the real world, boost their real life ego."
12/6/2009,"removing insurance will just have more people spending more time mining or missioning or whatever else they do to make isk. short of removing high-sec, they'll find a way to do it in relative safety. the only real effect i see of that is a greater divide between rich and poor - the rich fly the fancy ships, the poor stick with cheaper ships or pvp less. given that by definition not everyone in eve is a pvp genius, on average the rich will come out on top, because as much as eve purists like to tout that sp and isk don't matter as much as your brain & experience, they are only half-right, particularly since some experience can be handed/written down.it won't even have the effect some would like of making the game more expensive because the market just doesn't work like that any more. ironically all those people who will be on average making isk more will be influencing the market to provide even more supply because they too want some money, at the same time as demand drops due to lower/cheaper pvp activity. you'd probably find a shift away from isk-based economies to mineral-based ones as people try and mine their way to victory instead of buying it (i.e. build and produce your own ships & modules with minimal isk-related costs).lets' also not forget that money injection is a good and necessary part of any functioning economy with an increasing population to counter the typical 'successful mmo' deflation.could the game/community cope if insurance was removed? almost certainly. would it be a good thing to do? short term, probably not. long-term is for those with crystal balls. i'd call it 50-50 between the community getting harder and harsher and sticking through it, and some reduced to poverty after repeated wars thinking 'screw this, why am i paying a monthly fee for this masochism?'.the game's got to be fun, after all, and if there's one thing that is based entirely on individual perspective, it's fun.about time someone said that. ****es me off when posters expect everyone else to be their identical twin. the entire point of an mmo is that we interact in a varied way, so why the hell we should all play the game the same way is completely beyond me.edit: i think at the core of this is the problem that there are two sides in a realism debate - at one extreme people who want absolute no-clones harsh world total realism, and at the other people who want a fun game that they enjoy, and lets' face it, if reality were fun we'd not be gaming."
12/6/2009,"i like where the resulting discussion from this post is going, but frankly, i think it's a pipedream. no matter how you implement 'police' in a game, it'll either be ridiculously easy to evade them, or come across as random and unfair. lets' face it, the eve community is pretty bright, and ccp just don't have the resources to out-think every devious pirate in the game. the moment one way of evading the cops is discovered, everyone will use it. ccp will change things, people will cry rivers about how the game is getting easier (because they can no longer exploit some dumb ai), until they find a new way, and we'll go into the same cycles we're having currently with suicide ganking (like this thread).people hate to lose, especially to seemingly random game mechanics, and that's what concord would have to be to have even a cat in hell's chance of being 'realistic' and yet capable. if on average in, say, 75% of encounters with concord, the pirates are caught and destroyed, then intellectually speaking, it's not a bad deal, but for the players involved it'll just appear random and annoying. you can't out-think or out-run random consequences.how exactly would you implement police to 'give a chance' in a way that guarantees that even smart players can lose sometimes? as i love turning the whole stupid 'risk vs reward' meme on its head, if there's no risk for smart players in this new concord, there should be no reward, so how can it be made risky?bear in mind this has to work even if the player decides to log off or safespot or dock after committing the crime - any guaranteed no consequence route after a crime can and will be (ab)used. i've thought about it and i can't see a way of doing it that won't just be bloody irritating (the best one so far is keeping the same mechanics but changing either the response time dynamically or whether they turn up at all e.g. 10% of the time they just don't come). it doesn't strike me as trivial to implement anything more 'fun', and i'd beg the question as to whether the problem deserves that much time and effort devoted to it."

12/6/2009,"yes yes i know the horse is already 6-feet under.but i got to thinking. wouldn't it be great if you could give bounties that only gave isk to your corpmates? alliance mates? why not? and while we're at it, let's just make it standings based.currently, the bounty system is open for everyone, meaning it's easy for the one with the bounty on his head to get a friend/alt to kill him and send the isk over to the pirate.if the bounty system was standings based, this issue would become almost non-existent. i'm not saying to get rid of public bounties, as this has some e-peen merits.it'll work like this:1. global bounties remain as they are. everyone can see them and everyone can claim them. in the character show info screen, you will see as usual the bounty available. this would now be the total bounty. hover over that number, and you will see the public bounty isk offered, and the standings bounty isk offered2. the bounty office now has the following tabs:*public bounties - same as the current most wanted tab.*standings bounties - bounties which your standings allow you to claim.*place bounty - this is the beef of my proposed system. fortunately not much will need to change. everything stays the same up till the part where you searched the character. currently you have a window to put your isk in, and just a place bounty button. in addition to this, the new system will have 2 radio buttons from which you choose the type of the bounty. public / standings. to keep it simple, all bounties which are labeled as standings automatically make the bounty available to anyone above neutral standings. public bounties would still require the same negative sec status to place, but that would not be needed for the standings based type of bounty.i think this system would work best, and would make the feature be used for its intended purposes more. for example, if there's an outlaw wreaking havoc in providence, cva could offer standings based bounties if they want to get rid of him really bad.it might be a good idea to have an option to place seperate bounties for your alliance or corporation, as it would make it less likely for the bounty holder to get a friend from the inside to kill him. but it would also make the system more complicated which just isn't needed.i couldn't find this type of idea posted, so there it is."
12/6/2009,i approve of this message.
12/6/2009,supported
12/6/2009,"really, cause i'm pretty sure that currently, no af in the game should die to it.neither should any other ship for that matter.just warp off.its not like the ret pilot can stop you."
12/6/2009,"note that my suggestion doesn't simply fill smaller orders first, it fills the smalest order that can handle the volume first. this is important as it tends to match high volume sellers to high volume buyers rather than simply filling up the small guys and leaving the people with larger volumes in the cold.the issue with prices creeping down happens already and the market fixes itself routinely if prices start to favour one side or the other too much. if there's no volume at lower prices then buyers will offer more and drive the price up again. my suggestion doesn't alter that."
12/6/2009,"edit: support tick applied.the actual problem seems to me that nobody wants to see his/her orders being queued up. the .01 isk game only serves to get your orders up front again. the 2% of the unit price rule could help in that market participants would reach the threshold faster, where it's painful to further raise or lower the price.your proposal does the same but has the additional effect of masking the queue. even further there would be several simultaneous queues depending on the volume of the order. that's a nice touch. but what happens with the many 1-2 item orders? i guess there would be only 1 queue inside those lumped orders. if they are served on a first come, first served basis, then your proposal might work.the only question that i feel would need to be answered is: would it be better to 1) show the orders which are lumped together as one order with the sum of all the orders at that price.or2) show all individual orders, allowing me to determine whether i have 1 competitor selling 100 items or 100 competitors selling 1 item each. this would be the better solution imho.i could see this working out. (but nobody should expect higher profit margins through this measure. this simply eliminates the .01 isk game by raising the amount by which you have to raise or lower your price to get to the top of the queue again. and you won't be able to ""snipe"" in with a new order either.)"
12/6/2009,"i'd rather see a combination of two approaches.1. if two buy or sell orders are at the same price, a market transaction will apply to both of them based upon the %s. for example, person a is selling 40 units at a certain price, and person b is selling 60 units at the same price. if someone buys 10 units, they get 4 from a and 6 from b.2. the .01 isk game is a little ridiculous, and i wouldn't mind seeing it changed to a drop of % of prices, but only if combined with idea # 1. if you can only drop or raise an order by a minimum of .1% (not 1-2%, thats too high), but you do have the option of selling at the exact same price and getting a percentage of the market action, it would change market strategy."
12/6/2009,do not support!
12/6/2009,"it doesn't really because you'd just do it as two operations, raise your price by 2% then drop it after the 5 minute timer by 2.001% to get the 0.01 isk reduction you were after in the first place. that's why the limit on modifications was a dumb idea."
12/6/2009,"in general a good idea, aggregating several orders within a given isk range into a single order.another thing that would put an end to 0.01 annoyances would be the transaction tax. just make the seller pay the tax again every time they adjust the order or if they adjust it more than once in a 24 hour period."
12/6/2009,"navythron has seven turrets, vindicator has 8. that's a 42.9% damage bonus, if you compare it to the same baseline as the navythron. the drone bay isn't perfect, but none is - if you want light drones, stick them in. it's supposed to be good, not perfect."
12/6/2009,"navythron also has an 8th high slot, an 8th lowslot, more drones, half the cost, etc. etc.your argument is a non starter."
12/6/2009,"yes and no. every other pirate ship has one thing that it does extremely well in addition to put out good dps- with the bhaalgorn you have neuts, with the nightmare you have an insane tank, with the mach you have amazing speed and agility. with the vindicator, i think it still does need a bit of love in some way or another to put it on par. yes, it has the highest damage capacity of any pirate ship- but to me the difference of 200 or so dps between a vindicator and a navy mega isn't worth double the price tag. i'd love to see it get a bigger damage bonus so it can put out 2k dps with good skills and still have an ok buffer tank- but regardless of what buff it gets, i think the vindi does need some loving to put it on-par with the other pirate battleships."
12/6/2009,"i'm proposing that taking a fw plex while taking advantage of npc's not shooting a pilot in the odd faction* is classified as an exploit until it gets fixed. *ie, a matari militia pilot with good or no caldari standings taking caldari fw plexes for the gallente. don't let some jerks ruin whats left of fw.edit: and yes i am complaining due to it happening to the matari now, essentially because i didn't know it existed before. and no, i wouldn't use it against the amarr. its lame."
12/6/2009,"ccp refuses to name the magic timer countdown an exploit too, despite me whining to devs for months and months and people that abuse it systematically being reported over and over.in my opinion, tear down the system capturing aspect of fw and send it back to the drawing board. its full of bugs and fundamental game design flaws.the standings issue is lame as hell and i asked to ccp to get it fixed in july 2008, they would ""look into it like they promised to ""look into"" basically all fw issues i raised. thing is, that the standing thing doesn't provide that much of an advantage. yes, you can capture plexes solo and unhindered, but that's what the caldari and minmatar could do with t1 frigate alts anyway, nothing new there."
12/6/2009,i have been saying for years that ccp need to put a watermark or something on bpo's so we can tell them apart from bpc's.does anyone agree and if so can we get this implemented imo it would not b a big deal to do it and would save alot of frustration for us.
12/6/2009,"this has been asked for before, and according to ccp it would, in fact, be a big deal."
12/6/2009,"perhaps then, it is time for big deals. this blueprint bpo/bpc issue is annoying me for years now. skip the next expansion then and redesign this blueprint stuff, honestly!"
12/6/2009,"the underlying mechanic of claimed complexity can't be so difficult to implement as some of the stuff that they've had in the game for years and never fixed to work right (no ability to sort corporate assets, ect)... blueprint original and copy definitely need some method of visual distinction between them."
12/6/2009,"so, we all love the new eve-mail system and so on. but there's still one very very annoying problem with it. all mails sent go directly to your inbox and even though you can set labels, you have to set them for each mail and each time a new one comes in, you have to set labels for that mail aswell.so, solution is, let us separate received mails, please :)"
12/6/2009,let us set up some rules for teh emails
12/6/2009,i obviously support this :)
12/6/2009,this just one of the many features that could have been gained with pop3 or imap instead of proprietary evemail.gmail already has filters.
12/6/2009,"you can set the labels to multiple evemail by highlighting multiple ones. then you remove the ""inbox"" label. bit more cludgie.. but better then 1 at a time"
12/6/2009,"yes, but any new mail that comes in is still gonna go to your inbox, so, it takes a bit of the annoyingness, yes, but it doesn't solve the problem :)"
12/6/2009,"while i am aware that this is hardly a new topic, i have a dream that one day, ccp will realize that missiles need a boost to be more pvp friendly. to that end, i propose the following changes:1)boost missile velocity by +75-200%, while reducing flight time so that range is unchanged2)eliminate the guided vs unguided missiles distinction so that signature radius reduction applies to all missile types3)specific missile changes>>rockets: +100% damage increase, minimum explosion velocity: 1000 m/s>>light missiles: minimum explosion velocity: 800 m/s>>hams: +25% damage increase, minimum explosion velocity: 600 m/s>>heavy missiles: minimum explosion velocity: 400 m/s>>torpedoes: minimum explosion velocity: 200 m/s>>cruise missiles: +25% damage increase, minimum explosion velocity: 300 m/s"
12/6/2009,"first, i began to felicitate you for your effort in trying tofind a way to make the naglfar a competitive dread.however i do not agree with your solution. the new missile skill make trainning for matar more long but i don't think the problem is in the learning time. i think ccp need to adjust the bonus naglfar before anythings else. it's not 20-25 days that make the naglfar not worth it in the moment. it's his lack of efficiency compare to the others dreads."
12/6/2009,"its not 20-25 days anymore, it's now nearly 40days longer training than the moros and revalation and 20-25 days longer than the phoenix. what can ccp do to make up for that kind of training desparity??????"
12/6/2009,"this is a serious issue that has run rampant lately. the activities of creating and disbanding alliances really need that confirmation windows. every aspect of the game, except alliance management has confirmations. i can't spend 1 isk on anything without a confirmation popping up, which can be shut off yes i realize but there isn't one at all for alliance stuff.i am not talking about timers or votes or anything else previously proposed, just a window that says, ""are you sure you want to do this? y/n""i accidentally created an alliance because there was no confirmation, a pure waste of a billion isk for nothing all because of a lack of confirmation."
12/6/2009,better vote here
12/6/2009,"nope, this isn't the same thing. this is a simple confirmation ""would you like to do this? y/n"", not some mechanic to make it harder to do it. mynxees idea is a good one also, but it's not the same thing.edit: seems i already supported that thread anyway....but if that isn't implemented, i'd like this treated separately."
12/6/2009,as part of the warning consistancy and in addition to the main alliance thread i support this.
12/6/2009,supported.
12/6/2009,"yeah, this could be handy."
12/6/2009,"disagree - i like there being some kind of progression that isn't just concord/gate guns/nothing. 0.4's status as semi-lowsec is good for that, imo."
12/6/2009,"they eliminated most of the really abusive fleet interactions when they brought in fw. if you go around joining random fleets, i'm not going to feel a huge amount of pity if you walk into a scam. and without that concern, this seems reasonable, as long as we can sort it."
12/6/2009,how about we just eliminate locked keybinds entirely?
12/6/2009,sounds good to me.
12/6/2009,"since csm members come from a diverse background and time on eve, to better be able to test and evaluate issues brought forward it would be of great assistance if they had access to all aspects of eve for testing.in that vain i propose to have csm members and alternates have their skills on sisi set to level 5 so they can better test the issues set before them."
12/6/2009,"in that aspect, to help us see issues and problems that need to be addressed, arranging sisi demonstrations by eve players could also help us better see any issue and bring them forward to ccp after seeing them first hand.z0d"
12/6/2009,should add support for the idea
12/6/2009,i concur
12/6/2009,it makes sense to me.
12/6/2009,naturally then you will not see the issues brougth for by having low skills. you can always ask to get a specific set of skills increased fo some specific testing and if some dev has the time and you give a good reason you will get them.
12/6/2009,supported.
12/6/2009,"what exactly could you test, that had actual value to any issue? not any ship balance or weapons issue, since those are either obvious to any observer when presented with the data or require actual knowledge of how it all comes together on tq to understand. if there is something that doesn't work or need improvement, surely the descriptions of those affected are enough for you to see the issue or if they aren't you can ask for clarification on the problem. so could one of you describe situations where this would actually contribute something meaninful to the process? if you don't know the game and have low sp, why did you even try to get to the csm? i'm not trying to claim you need to be a vet to apply, but the few valuable things such a person could provide to any discussion is the low sp newbie perspective. the actual people who do it on a regular basis on tq know it better though and sisi testing isn't going to change that."
12/6/2009,i don't see why this would be a bad thing.-t'amber
12/6/2009,"counter-argument: when it comes to things like ship balance, using a 'perfect vs' skillset to test with could be just as misleading as not having the skills to fly the ship at all."
12/6/2009,"i dislike the idea of creating a privileged class of players, even on the test server. if messing around with skills is necessary for testing, it's necessary for all players, not just csms. now that said, i think it probably is a good idea, but it shouldn't be a csm-only thing. remember, the plan of giving it to everyone was rejected by a past csm, not by ccp."
12/6/2009,if that goes trough anyone should be able to alter skill levels on sisi. it's really hard to get all people with necessary skills to sisi at same time to test thing or another.edit. also faction/deadspace items should be available on test server. ofc it ruins ffa but who cares? ;p
12/6/2009,idea: introduce reverse auctions as a new contract type.from
12/6/2009,"already in game.item exchange auctions (want to buy), but are generally only used to grossly undervalue the item sought so are generally universally ignored."
12/6/2009,"actually, they're not.the word you're looking for here is ""tender""basically, it's like putting out a buy order, and then having players undercut eachother until the deadline is reached.i'm not sure it'd really work, but it sounds like an interesting idea in concept."
12/6/2009,"per this thread on the general discussions page, it is apparent that ccp overlooked at least some of the non-default newbie and temporary/fallback npc corps regarding the new 11% tax instituted in dominion. it is fair and reasonable that the tax should be extended to all npc corps as there are apparently old characters who remain members of corps like ishukone who are not currently affected by the tax. furthermore, since players in the newbie corps and temporary npc corps (i.e. garoun investment bank, aliastra, etc.) are now paying something for the war-dec immunity those corps enjoy, i propose ccp allow players to join any npc corp of their choice. let a personal standing of +5.0 with a corp be the cutoff to enable joining. rpers would benefit from this as well. this is a small and unimportant change in the broad picture, but it shouldn't require much effort to implement, will fix an error, and will give a small community of interested players more options in the sandbox. if you can't articulate why this would be a bad idea, please support!"
12/6/2009,self-supported.
12/6/2009,"actually this has come up in f&i plenty of times. after lengthy discussions, some of which centered on how it's pretty much impossible to implement at the moment (server update cycle & internet ping for starters are about an order of magnitude too slow), several things came up - it makes formations and fleet combat vastly more complex and tactical, because you can no longer shoot through your friends; it makes missiles more complex in terms of their fuel & range because they have to alter course around obstacles; it offers cover in the form of stations and asteroids.the whole concord thing is a major thorn, but when presented with one unrealistic scenario, it's easy to add more to solve such things, such as unintended fire in high-sec merely dissipates due to super-clever tech that only concord have, that they installed in high-sec.summary: fun concept, pointless to discuss now, as the technology needed is probably thirty years away. so what the hell, i'll support, but it's going nowhere"
12/6/2009,"overseer effects got severely nerfed with dominion. with the loot table being completely random, many times they are the only source of income from a complex, especially a 10/10."
12/6/2009,they just want you to spend money on upgrades before you get good stuff again. or maybe you just get more of the bad stuff. who knows.
12/6/2009,"most corps i know have 10% tax. and given ccp said the average tax over all player corps set the value for the npc corps, it seems 10% is very common."
12/6/2009,"you know what? you're absolutely right. let's force the npc corps to pay 100% taxes.of course they might want a few things in return. like instant concord responses. and giving concord the ability to pod people with gcc's, but hey, they're paying for it now, right? so it's fine.or you could stop *****ing about the people in the npc's corps and go look for someone to shoot in say low sec? i hear there's actual people there and stuff, and guess what, it doesn't matter what corp they're in - you can shoot them anyway."
12/6/2009,de'veldrin. i think he tried that lowsec thingie. wasnt really successful it seems.
12/6/2009,"if you're gonna resort to personal attacks, mr. carebear, at least cite a place that has my entire record. eve-kill seems to have missed quite a few of my favorite fights.concord responds instantly in 1.0, but that doesn't matter... if you're going to talk about ""paying for things"" in an rp sense of the phrase, you have to realize that your corp taxes don't go to concord... they go to the corp you're in. and even if they did go to concord, how could anybody expect a police force to respond instantly? their response time is already at least twice as fast as normal game mechanics would allow.and why would law enforcement pod somebody after blowing up their ship? that's like the police shooting a criminal after they've already wrestled him down, disarmed him, and put him in a position where he is not possibly a threat to anybody. besides, if their sec status is below -0.5, it's much more fun to pod them myself... why would i want concord doing it?"
12/6/2009,"yeah that freighter definitely gave you a fight. that pve fit fleet pest mostlikely aswell, especially 3 on 1. 4v1 on a ferox is also a good fight. so we are left with that 2 bc vs 3 bc + 1 frig. you got one fight and 3 ganks. proud of it?we are proud of you.(and i leave it to you to find my pvp alt.)"

12/7/2009,"with the release of apocrypha we've seen corporations who took upon colonizing w-space, and found out how important bookmark usage to navigation is. for most of those corps the daily routine is a scan of their home system, bookmarking sites and wormhole exits and then share the bookmarks with the rest of the corporation through the usage of a hangar in a pos.however, this approach is highly inefficient as copying of bookmarks becomes tedious (move the bookmark to your ship's cargo hold, transfer it to people and places, then make a copy from your bookmarks back to the corp hangar) and the information presented on the bookmarks themselves while in a container or hangar is practically non-existent, even if you check the info of a bookmark leading corps to devise naming schemes for their bookmarks that relay the information lacking by the game to the corpmates.a suggestion there would be a new bookmark handling mechanism for shared corporation use, similar to the saved corp ship fittings one.- a corp role for ""corp bookmarks"" access is created with view/modify permissions- the ""shared corp bookmarks"" (scb) tool would work pretty much like the people and places (p&p) one.- scb should support folders and subfolders for organization purposes- scb entries should indicate time of the bookmark's creation as well as the system they've been created in (much like the p&p tool does) and finally the first creator of the bookmark.- when adding a bookmark, a user should have the option to add a description for the bookmark (much like what happens with every other user transaction), which would be visible if a person hovers the mouse over the bookmark in scb or p&p.- right clicking on a bookmark in scb should have an additional ""copy to"" function which would open a tree of the user's p&p bookmark folders to copy to, much like the tree of available chat channels when a person right click on a player and invites them to one. a destination should also be ""ship cargo hold"" if the user is not in a pod.- the same functionality should be implemented on bookmarks found in a user's p&p, such as copy to -> corp bookmarks -> all bookmarks or copy to -> corp bookmarks -> user defined folder- dragging a bookmark into a chat channel should create a link to the bookmark. pilots who click on it get an information window with the bookmark's details (name, coordinates, date added, system, description, first creator). right clicking on the link, should pop the usual functions along with the copy to one.suggestions found on various sources:(idea by den mcconan)- ability to ""align to"" a bookmark location(ideas by kirith kodachi)- make ""add bookmark"" able to be bound to a keyboard shortcut for precise bookmarking during mid-warp.- allow pilots to show bookmarks in the present grid, both in the bracket and in the overview.(idea by wonko)- allow squad/wing/fleet commanders to warp fleet at any distance between 0 and 100km from a bookmark, rather than just 0.this bookmark management idea ties in perfectly with the game lore as well, since bookmarks are nothing more than an encapsulated set of information including vector coordinates and textual descriptions are entities that can be transmitted through communication channels and there is no real need for them to be exchanged as physical items. in fact, (and this being an educated guess here) if bookmark management and sharing got totally disengaged from bookmarks being treated as inventory items it could help with the stress the database undergoes when bookmark instances are created as items (need for speed initiative anyone?).(also discussed in the features and ideas discussion forum)"

12/7/2009,"moard dps.100 dps more on paperthen the same class amarr bs with 3x lower range is pathetic.do not touch fallof and optimal and possibile onlsy slightly buff tracking. if you are able to tackle target properly and manevrou so you apply maximum damage good for you . if you cant then its your problem.another solution would be to do not touch dps but significally buff tracking so you could actually move while shooting. but i prefer more dps verision.also , self repair bonus on brutix is broken. armor repairs + mwd + blasters = dead cap.obesides it makes it better shield buffer than armor buffer if you wanna keep fearfull dps.it should either have bonus for armor hp or speed/agility."
12/7/2009,signed!i've been flying blaster ships since 03 and they are in serious need of some help. really like gabriels ideas
12/7/2009,"hyperion needs a slight buff as well.why: it's a active tanking bs that is suppose to have fat tank and fearsome dps with blasters.why it does not work:you cannot fit neutron blasters with reppers, withought exceeding powergrid, and you also need a speedmod and a heavy cap booster. you cannot have any damgemods, withought that resulting in you having pitiful tank.you cannot buffertank it properly either because you have only 6 low slots. in pve it isn't quite as bad, but still does not live up to it's name. solution:8 low slots and 3 mid slots for decent tank and dps but lack of tacle/e-war/ eccm/ other supplimentary mid-slot modules. a little more powergrid to allow proper fitting of the sayd ship. blaster buff as sayd above. in the difference of the op i would prefer a tracking increase, so you can speedtank ammar ships at close range, but either way would be satisfactory. i agree that britux has a stupid bonus, it does not have the slots for a proper active tank in the difference of myrmidon, rof bonus would make it fearsome, agility would be out of place imao, 10% bonus per level to armor amount owuld fit the best imao."
12/7/2009,"see this graph, it shows the required tracking to hit an orbiting object based on the range it orbits.as you can see, the closer it gets, the tracking does not increase linear, but exponentially. thus a blaster has 5x less tracking than a pulse laser, currently, dealing less dps at optimal."
12/7/2009,"very intreguing feature. fraps adds lag to a degree which comprimises pvp performance on many people's machines. if this can be done in-client without a similar drawback, i think the benefits to the player base (especially us ceo types) and ccp's marketing efforts would be worthwhile."
12/7/2009,soooodo itsigned tbh
12/7/2009,thank you to all who have thrown your support into this! let's get ccp on it!
12/7/2009,i support this!
12/7/2009,"already the case, when you get a new medal it is set to 'hidden' at first and the recipient needs to set them to active. if he decides to trash the 'idiot of the week' medal, then the corp that offered it just wasted 10 mil for nothing.i agree its a low priority issue, however the bugs and limitations are very annoying for the roleplayers and medalwh...s like me."
12/7/2009,"all points supported. would be very useful given the types of medals we award within our corp. more than once, i've wanted to award a medal to a friend outside the corp for exemplary support and would really like to be able to do that."
12/7/2009,"please remove restrictions for who medals may be presented to.if i wish to present one to a gm, then i ought to be able to do so.time flux detectedyou are going too fast! wait five minutes and try again."
12/7/2009,"now, i have been searching the eve-online knowledge base, and evelopedia. and for the life of me, i cannot find a list of exactly what ccp considers ""exploits"" the closest i got was a small paragraph informing players to report exploit users with petititions when they see them. well. this is not really feasible when players don't actually know what is or isn't an exploit.classic example? i had someone on the forums tell me jetcan mining was an exploit. obviously, somewhere a huge list needs to be made that highlights what is an exploit, describe said exploit, and tell us what aren't exploits. this way we don't do something we think is pretty smart and find when we log on the day after to find out what we did was actually an exploit. and obviously so that we can hunt down exploit abusers better.now, if there already is a list of exploits. and i just haven't looked hard enough, it needs to be easier to find."
12/7/2009,"not just yes, but hell yes. there's too many parts of this game that are still unfixed and merely patched with someone declaring it an exploit for that list of declarations not to be publicized."
12/7/2009,yes.
12/7/2009,"op: ""i don't know how to hack into a server farm and steal sensitive data so you should tell me how to do that so i can make sure i never do it.""that's what you just said. the phrasing was different, and the purpose (probably) isn't malicious, but essentially that's what you asked for.there's a reason ccp doesn't publish details on game exploits. it's more or less the same reason you don't post your bank account number on a public forum.but what the hell, i'll support the proposal just for the chuckles if it actually gets implemented."
12/7/2009,"i can see ccp not wanting a list since it gives people directions on what to do. i think it will be up to ccp to decide on their risk management with this one, but i support the idea of having one so players don't get screwed over by not knowing."
12/7/2009,"doesn't read that way to me - it reads 'please tell us what is viewed as unacceptable, so that when we see it, we can report it or point out what is clearly an exploit, instead of hoping the gms can figure it out' and also 'when some idiot claims something is an exploit, we can point to the list and say ""does it even remotely look like any of those?""'.there's a big difference between a list of how-to's and a list of what was already in the past listed as an exploit as evidence of 'these are the things that if caught will get you banned'. it's why in real life we have laws, police, and why ignorance of the law is no excuse - you can find out the law, with clarity. this is not the case with exploits - you have to guess, petition, re-petition, and hope someone at ccp is awake.nobody asked for details - guidelines wouldn't hurt. part of me says that such things are common sense, but that's in such short supply these days..."
12/7/2009,"we already have a guideline - if it violates a game mechanic to provide an advantage to a small subset of users, it's an exploit.but i'm willing to give this whole list them thing a chance. just don't be surprised when half the player base goes ""huh. so that's how you do that"" and promptly goes off and does it. we're all human, and humans are an inherently selfish animal.hmm. i think my cynicism might be showing today."
12/7/2009,"not only this, but the inverse would also be a problem: ""well, it's not on the exploit list, so it's obviously not an exploit!"""
12/7/2009,"wikisee ""exploit"". even if ccp posts a list, i'm fairly confident they will still get petitions every day from people who ""couldn't warp"" because another player warp scrambled them or ""couldn't lock"" because another person put ewar on them.an exploit is about intent. you can't list intent. if something is listed in the forums or wiki and no one from ccp says ""exploit"" in those locations, i would think it is safe to say it isn't an exploit."
12/7/2009,"that wiki article above me pretty succinctly covered what an exploit is. i see no reason to post the list, as while you may have the best intentions at heart, most players will not and will use those to their advantage.sorry, but while i can see the utility of such a list, i can also see distinct reasons why they would not list them, and think they're on the right path. i do not support this measure."
12/7/2009,"for those of us who hate slavery can we have the option of, i don't know, maybe freeing the slaveswe come across in game?? letting them die in space/selling them on/leaving them to gather dust in a hanger is just wrong. hell, as in ancient rome players could pay an ""admin fee"" to the state to buy the poor misfortunate's freedom. cue station sound effect cheer!apologies if this has been raised already..."
12/7/2009,thumb's on the left.
12/7/2009,"just about everything you fw players desire, has already been asked for in one way or another.now ccp must commit themselves. topic strongly supported!"
12/7/2009,"currently, there is no reason for this one to get into fw, even though this one was created specifically for that purpose. with the way thigns currently stand, i may as well go pirate to get some pvp training."
12/7/2009,"when it came up at fanfest the blank looks from the game design team suggest they really don't have fw in their field of view.it was hyped then dropped. the attitude seems to be ""0.0 is end-game, we don't want to improve fw, it has zero priority""fw is a fine part of the game which is very fun. who cares about ""end-game"".fw requires finishing. it has not been revisited properly since release, just put on the backlog and forgotten.we complained a lot. the volume of complaints got too much for ccp.they added lp for pvp kills and made a devblog, this was very successful at shutting us up.when the feature arrived it turned out to be completely ineffectual, it's only real accomplishment was reducing the level of complaints."
12/7/2009,"fully supported. ccp needs to give fw some serious attention, right after fixing all the bugs that dom introduced. ;)"
12/7/2009,i approve
12/7/2009,"fully supported.mission farming should be stopped nowand please, design some improvements for fw !"
12/7/2009,i support !
12/7/2009,please ccp fix fw !!!!!!
12/7/2009,"my views are well known.supportedmake killing npc for offensive plexing a must to stamp out speed, timer warp off and standing caping loop holes.if neutrals want to stay out side the militias let them pick a side by loosing faction standing for ships and pods they destroy, as every member in the militias do."
12/7/2009,fix fw!
12/7/2009,yes
12/7/2009,love the war.
12/7/2009,"by the way... before anybody says again: fw don't matter and ""working as intended""...i would like to change the fw occupancy thing to something similar to zerosec. to allow us militia to claim the systems by the same mechanism as in zerosec. this will also allow pirates to claim systems.with all consequences. means an automatic nrds policy that means no enemy fw militia is allowed to dock anymore in claimed systems and so on. and with the navy/republic fleet npc of cause attacking all enemies, means with a nbsi policy. blue is friendly militia.this would make way more balanced and we would not need our ""own"" part of code but share the ****up and fate with the zerosecs. still it is a) great basis for roleplay b) good preparation for zerosec, much better than nowi say: give the whole thing in our hands. when we fail, we know it's our fault."
12/7/2009,i somehat agree with alicia's idea. it would be nice to have some sort of mechanics following nullsec's new dominion stuff.i still like plexes though because it allows for an unique tactical situtation where you cannot outclass the enemy's ship class. it would be nice to incorporate a sort of plex with the dominion stuff.
12/7/2009,"agreed.while faction warfare still offers good fights, from solo to middle sized gangs, some of its mechanics are broken beyond belief.faction warfare missions are still, even after dominion patch, so unbalanced that its impossible to imagine why it was not addressed. these missions must be tweaked as soon as possible by increasing the risk significantly, reducing the rewards or maybe both. they could cut the lp price to half and they would still be worth doing. secondly, giving more rewards for plexing and pvp. just increasing the amount of lps from kills would be good start, but i would also love to see more meaning behind the system occupancy and militia ranks."
12/7/2009,j<U+FFFD> vinsamlega!
12/7/2009,"not only should many things be fixed in fw, but also the pirate factions should be added. originally this was the plan from what i was told, but for what ever reason it's never happened."
12/7/2009,"fw is a classic ccp broken promise. broken mechanics and a promise to finish them in quantum rise which never happened. the mechanics need readdressing and fixing from the plex's to the kills lp to the mission farming. it's silly and should have been fixed after release in empyrean age 1.1, not several years later. hell, at this rate it will probably be in the walking in stations 1.1 patch"
12/7/2009,"fw has developed two distinct mindsets...the pve/rp side and the pvp side. success in one does not necessarily affect the other. all one has to do is look at the cal/gal ""front"". the cal mil maintains ""occupancy"" on all available gal systems, yet is without question ""losing"" the pvp side of fw. the trick, imho, is to get the two to merge while still maintaining the open-ended nature of fw."
12/7/2009,please we want improvements in all fw areas :)
12/7/2009,"replying from another thread, as this one is more appropriate:the whole bunker concept is broken. once a system goes vulnerable, the task of actually defending it is neigh impossible - not only do you need to fight a big fleet battle where the other side can throw in everything they have, you also have to get people to plex in other systems, hoping that one of those plexes spawns in the vulnerable system so you can make it less vulnerable again... only to get it once again vulnerable should another plex spawn there and you see it too late.just remove bunkers completely. make it so that a system has a vp scale that you change with plexing. at some point, it ""switches over"" - no need for dt wait, it just switches over, and is called occupied by the other side, plexes turn into plexes of the other side, but it's ""highly contested"". you now have to defensively plex in it to secure it more. such a moving scale would be much better in reflecting actual activity in the areas."
12/7/2009,"i don't agree with you there kady. bunker fights are great. but it usually ends before the defending side can mount a resistance. happened to amarr before, is happening to us now. its been buffed before, just not enough i think."
12/7/2009,"unrestricted plexes should be that, and not ""i managed to sneak two frigs in to take aggro and cap it while the defenders didn't know it was there"" :-|"
12/7/2009,probably due to the fact there is no notification that a system has gone vulnerable. only way to know is to be there when it goes vulnerable.
12/7/2009,"when fw came out, it was presented as ccp's gift to roleplayers.what we are faced with now, however, is a set of problems so immersion-destroying they make the game world completely unbelievable. by way of illustration, here is what my character would be having to say to her government around about now:((see next post))"
12/7/2009,"""dear san matar shakor,for the last 4 years i have laboured loyally on behalf of both our nation and our people. as their freely chosen leader, you have my unquestioning support.or you did. having reviewed the facts of our current conflict with the amarr and caldari, i feel there is something i must say.have you had a ****ing lobotomy?seriously, how herbivorously stupid do you have to be to come to a set of decisions like the following:1. there is an alliance that has pledged loyalty to the republic, has served it for over four years and spent all that time waiting and preparing for exactly this war and you will not let it fight unless it cripples itself by atomising down to its constituent corporations. we became an alliance because we are stronger and more effective that way, not just because we fancied an extra bill.""but alliances aren't trustworthy!"" i hear you cry. that would be why most of us are floating around with ratings like my own - the minmatar republic apparently considers me 98% trustworthy. it lets me anchor starbases in its high security space. most of its corporations waive tax on my behalf and let me use their medical facilities to create jumpclones. but gods forbid i should fight on its behalf, that would give me too many opportunities to...what exactly? get our arses conquered? you are already doing just fine on that front!2. i'm not sure how it works in professional military circles, but i honestly think our military installations might be more effective if they didn't surrender to the first person to make them dizzy.this ties into my next point, which is:3. you should probably only surrender if the enemy is actually there. after they've left, you can consider yourself to have been let off.4. the enemy will likely be defeated much faster if you shoot at them. i have found this to be a very effective tactic on numerous campaigns and if you try it, i assure you, you will be very impressed with its efficacy.5. on a related note, the converse is also true. it may sound wildly implausible, but making the enemy work hard in order to beat you should be a priority for any nation which stands to have its people shipped off in freighters for indoctrination into slavery.in particular, it will make it much harder for the amarr and caldari militias to capture our installations, and much easier for your own forces to defend them if you didn't mandate that all new installations must be set up right after lunch.in closing, i would like to sum up with a message to our fleet command.what the **** is wrong with you?"""
12/7/2009,"some good points, well made."
12/7/2009,support.
12/7/2009,supporting!
12/7/2009,"supported. thanks for the lagfix earlier ccp, now fix the mechanics! we in fw can be stage 2 of the new player experience!help us help the newbs!"
12/7/2009,support.
12/7/2009,"factional warfare is really in a catastrophical state right now - and since it has actual impact on the game, it needs to be fixed.kudos to those people who're still putting up with it, but i don't see why playing a game should be a chore due to horrible game mechanics."
12/7/2009,"supported , fw in this state is ridiculous"
12/7/2009,suported
12/7/2009,"very much supported.i see no reason why it should not be compulsory to wipe out defending forces in order to cap an enemy plex.it also seems ridiculous that a militia is kos to a navy in high sec, and yet ignored in low sec. unless ccp wants to introduce plot to split up the two alliances between the high sec factions then allied militia should be just that, and should be capable of capturing systems for their allies. all that would need to happen is a tweak to have systems on the matari front switch between the empire and the republic. systems on the other front would change between federation and state, regardless of who takes them."
12/7/2009,"this one does not see faction warfare in eve. factions are not warring on each other. or, rather, all factions seem to have agreed to a truce, since navy ships sit in complexes. and yes, the caldari titan sits on top of caldari prime, that's an uneasy truce here.pod-pilots may hunt each other and shoot each other, some rp it, some do not. either way, it has nothing to do with factions. factions fail to react to pod-pilots' actions.the only way npcs react to capsuleers seems to be isk, lp, or dps thrown at them -- that is, a fresh bucket of sand is either being put next to you, or emptied upon your castle (in most cases, players have learned to build castles which are resistant to falling sand). sometimes, they react with in-game content, but that happens way too rarely.if, by design, capsuleers are supposed to be able to make a difference, and some do try, npcs must react to players fighting in their war. in fw, that may mean thata) npcs participate in actual fighting on both attacking and defending sides,b) npcs may or may not assist players' efforts,c) npcs themselves set up operations in warzones, which players may or may not assist,d) etc.again, currently npcs are not struggling with each other, they just sit there shooting certain groups of players.yes, that would require a lot of work from ccp and gms. but that is what i see needs to be done to make fw have some meaning.for now, i would suggest immediate cease-fire until better (so to speak) days.edit. supported, of course."
12/7/2009,"i know it's pointless, but i support this completely."
12/7/2009,"i would like to fix broken things to, especially since they are fixable and improvable things to fix/improve."
12/7/2009,"supported. fw is broken, fix it please."
12/7/2009,"ditch the spam, improve the flow of information.i would also suggest that sov play a role in providing better intel on non-alliance/blue people entering a system."
12/7/2009,"1. it seems to me that the initial seeding of fw plexes is part of the same downtime process that seeds wormholes, exploration plexes and all other temporary sites. so changing this behaviour might be difficult or even impossible.2. if you understand the game mechanics of fw plex respawning, you can actively plex an area 23/7. so it comes down to who has the most active presence, not the initial seed.not supported."
12/7/2009,"the post-dt problem is caused by a special script that moves fw plexes. the op has a link to ccp's description of it.this is true as long as there is not just a handful of systems within hostile territory. once that happens, plexes captured in those systems have a high chance to ""spawn"" in ""wrong"" systems and be undiscoverable, only to be moved back to where they can be discovered during dt. if you can't capture them right post dt, you will not find those plexes anymore during the whole day, unless they ""accidentally"" spawn in one of the ""good"" systems again."

12/7/2009,"signed, signed, and.. oh.. signed again! see?ben johnsonben johnsonben johnsoni've been waiting for this for a long time now!"
12/7/2009,to let people know. i have put it on the agenda.
12/7/2009,"this bug and all bugs in fw should be properly fixed, so me and the whole 1st praetorian guard supports this call for change.meanwhile abusing this loop/bug/exploit in extreme to get the attention of ccp and so spoiling the game fun of many, does not get our support. we have always been against any use of loops/bugs/exploits and will not actively support a campaign based on it.for this reason the 1st praetorian guard has pulled back from any offensive plexing a few days ago and now made it a corporate wide decision. we will not shoot any bunker, we will not capture any minmatar complex and will not put any roleplay based on this campaign on igs until the situation has normalized. yes, the situation before the 1st of december was not perfect but it had many moments of fun as a game. those moment of fun are now gone and i don't know who i have to thank most, ccp or damar or ......and ccp, get your act together. if you launch a game feature then you don't have an obligation to developed it further on but you do have an obligation to fix bugs and exploits."
12/7/2009,i have the greatest respect for 1pg for that. that can not have been an easy decision.
12/7/2009,"support this change. essentially attacking a military installation without repercussions cause your ""buddies"" doesn't make any sense in any setting, game or otherwise."
12/7/2009,"yep, it's rather daft."
12/7/2009,mad props to gangleri and 1pg for taking such a stand on this issue.
12/7/2009,i have to give you respect for this gangleri. appreciated.
12/7/2009,much respect bro.
12/7/2009,"*applause for ankhesentapemkah and gangleri*back to the drawing board. even giving lp for the plexes will not work. defensive plexing can and will still be done with alts and plexing in general has little to do with pvp. the system needs to be reworked completely, and be more pvp-centric instead of encouraging all this filthy metagaming.edit: support thread"
12/7/2009,"i wholeheartedly support this topic, and think both the rats and these standing mechanics should be fixed.however, i have no illusion that ccp cares about, or even knows of, the near exploit tactics used to capture these systems which completely remove the pvp from factional warfare. as shown in the list of issues ankh listed.minnie/amarr, enjoy the exploits and army of alts we've been dealing with for a long time now."
12/7/2009,"i cannot add much more than gangleri has already set out.the decision by gangleri and the command staff of 1pg was actually quite easy to make.the news of systems falling makes us all feel very hollow at the moment after the many enjoyable and engaging battles we have had to date in fw. there is simply no nobility in what is currently happening. the use of the exploit is not welcome. amarr victor, but at what cost..?"
12/7/2009,"i find your reply rather funny, considering we got the idea from ankh and val. we just made their methods public knowledge. edit: something"
12/7/2009,"a great man once said ""i would rather lose this stupid war than lose our standards"" just before he steered the focus of our corp outside the whole fw arena and let me bring it into cva.nothing has changed, i will condem the recent exploitation of the system to capture solar systems and echo gangleri's words that ccp need to get their act together on this one."
12/7/2009,"i joined fw rather late in the game, to non-existent plexes during my tz and alt corps (lol throne guards) that warp away the second my lone frigate enters the plex with uber rats spawned on their side. if they started it, you guys sure perfected it on a mass industrial scale, as i saw far more noob alts plexing on the caldari side than the gallente in my roams in us tz fw space. when i was finally figuring out fw mechanics, ankh herself switched to the caldari side, was previously on the amarr side, so i am rather amused at this whole ""ankh and her gallente doing these plex exploits"" theme. agreed though that the standing mechanic in plexes is lame, whoever uses it.regardless, i don't want to hijack this thread with another gal/cal fw plex ****ing in the wind, especially since most of the proposals i've seen from you on the forums i've agreed with.lets let the amarr and minmatar have their glorious exploit ridden ****ing in the wind contests now. or, just have them blame the caldari works too ;)"
12/7/2009,for over a year now i have seen the amarr call out for changes to fw and these calls falling on deaf ears.i find it sad that only now when these bugs and loop holes are bringing down minmatar systems that the crys now get louder.i rejoice that finially these voices will be loud enough that they may be heard and changes could be made.while some ends do not justify the means it is a means that will now echo what needs to be done and should have been done from the start.i will support this as long as ccp draws the most experianced members of faction wars and are bought together to fix what needs to be fixing.i pray that faction wars the unwanted child of eve will now be givin the love it craves.
12/7/2009,i hadnt realized i was the most important person to you guys in fw.that creating one alt would lead you to abandon your so dearly held principals and noble purposes.after all this was as damar said '// a desperate measure on your parts....you absolutely had to do it .... as someone told me once... these are just excuses
12/7/2009,"it;s quiet statements such as this that are the most significant not least because they do not seek the limelight, just what is right. thx 1pg, you stand head and shoulders above your peers . o7"
12/7/2009,"translation.. we know we can't do it any other way so we have to use exploits that everyone knows is an exploit and everyone thinks is lame. howevr because ccp says it's ok simple because they don't care about fw, we will do it. we will then come on the forums and support a proposed change because we know by the time ccp gets around to changing it we will already have taken all the system using it. this means we get another medal and can brag on the board saying how great we are.. meanwhile we can turn around as say.. hey we really supported the change....."
12/7/2009,"the way things are, occupany means nothing.......except to rpers.this is where i then give my thanks to 1pg for showing their non-support of this immersion-breaking mechanic.how are we supposed to rp this?""the amarr-minmatar front was in a deep stalemate until an armada of un-armed caldari ships, who happened to bribe all our officials into setting the systems to vulnerable, decended upon our systems.""yet there's going to be ig repercussions for this. the amarr will get a big pat on the back and the empress will say they're amazing and amarrians will feel great that they were able to piggy-back their way to victory thanks to an exploit.people who have put over a year of work into maintaining minmatar occupancy are being slapped across the face by damar & co. this mechanic was rarely, if ever used on the minmatar-amarr front. for the most part, we have maintained some honor for eachother.while fw is fubar, this is unacceptable.i have already spoken with damar, and he tried to justify himself in every whichway possible. justification is easy. i stole candy from a baby because i was hungry.if you choose to be an asswipe, you're not the first. you think this will make ccp change, it won't. fw is a small base of their players when juxtaposed to empire care-bears and 0.0 hermits. we are not even on their radar. there are amarrians who still don't even know that it's thanks to you they've capped over 5 systems in the past 24 hrs. they don't stop to wonder why all of a sudden our systems have been heavily contested in a matter of hours, but blow up the bunkers cuz they think it's fw. (i should take this time to mention there needs to be a global notification to the home militia when their systems go vulnerable).anyways, just wanted to let you know you've illegitimized this games rp and future pf for me. thanks for acheiving a whole lot in terms of ruining my personal game experience."
12/7/2009,"fw has many oddities, bugs and poor game mechanics. the longer the game draws on (especially for those in fw a long time) they become more noticeable and more irritating.the minmatar had the advantage of the speed tanking bug, while the amarr had the advantage with the post-dt bug, while both could (and did) make use of the timer-bug.since these strategies were effectively dictated by game mechanics they could not be countered through in-game means. many players on both sides felt aggravated by these bugs, and felt justified in making use of them because they felt 'the other side both' gained an unfair advantage through use of these bugs.the 'standings' bug we are talking about here has existed since the beginning of fw. it is now a problem because of the industrial scale on which it is used. a scale with upset that delicate balance in the amarr/minmatar conflict. *that* is the problem. if an army of speed tanking alts had come out and started to capture amarr plexes by the hundreds, i have no doubt the problem would be just as large. such strategies are not simply not counterable within normal gameplay.fw has many large and interrelated problems, and i would like to see them solved, but i honestly think that as long as ccp sees us getting by with all these problems, they won't be motivated to change a thing.perhaps it is time for this war to end. perhaps stagnation will motivate ccp to undertake action. however, perhaps it will convince ccp to just abandon fw altogether and fw will end up as a kind of red-vs-blue with faction flavor and lp farming. that's a risk of the current strategy, but just plodding on isn't going to change anything.having faction warfare being 'won' simply isn't good pr to convince newer players to join it, and those player experiences are what ccp cares about deeply. us 'addicted' old vets will likely stay on anyway to ccp.i would vastly prefer a reset with new and more interesting mechanics rather than plodding on for years with tiny fixes to flawed warfare concepts. it's been fun, but its time for a good overhaul.ic for me it is simple, i follow orders, and unless my orders tell me to stop fighting i can't. only reasonable way i have of not participating is not logging in or leaving my corp.people are angry, people are frustrated, people are disappointed. let us not forget that dubious game mechanics are to blame for most of this, and not the people making use of them. i can no more be angry at damar for using this (ccp approved) bug than angry at sf for selectively war-deccing militia corps or matari plexers speed tanking amarr plexes. i'm angry at ccp for allowing such mechanics in the first place and not doing anything about them for such a long time.i'm happy ccp solved the desync problems, but other than that i've not seen any significant positive changes to fw."
12/7/2009,"eran, i have not been able to properly rp many things in fw. how can i rp the order to find and 'capture' still cloaked friendly plexes in so called pile-up systems that are still uncontested? ""yes, go out and find and uncloak or secret defensive installations in systems that are not under attack'. even the message from the navy (and lack of standings) says me that this defense was unneccessary, but from a in-game standpoint, it certainly was.""yes sir, the mighty amarr empire has fallen to a swarm of unarmed vigils in the hands of junior pod pilots"" that's just as bad, however, but it is the reality.""commander merdaneth, your presence is required right after prayer time, if you are not there, you will never be able to assist us in capturing systems bunkers or fight decisive battles"" i mean, wtf! they are slapped in the face by ccp. damar is merely one bringing the bad news. it is difficult to wage a war dominated by faulty game mechanics in such a way that the warring parties need a kind of ""gentleman's agreement"" not to fully make use of the strategies available to them.damar is angry at ccp for their lack of attention to fw, for their insistence clear gameplay gaffes are really 'working as intended', he, more than anything, wants to fight this fw war, although mechanics make it something of a farce.would you think ccp would fix the one-click-alliance-disband button, if there wouldn't have been any scandals and uproar involving it?i don't believe damar will achieve to get ccp to fix things on a short notice. maybe he'll (and we through our anger and frustration at what his happening) will achieve ccp to hear the issues on the table. maybe not, and in that case it will have been a bitter pill to swallow."

12/7/2009,"if caldari alts should be allowed to capture minmatar plexes without minmatar npcs shooting at them, then i should be able to gank badgers in jita without concord shooting at me.supporting op, plexing is completley broken with this 'feature' included."

12/7/2009,bugs in game our never very good ..however let face it the mins have been using bugs from day1 of fw. timer bug most often used. the mins still have numbers over the amarr + other corp support.you can still plex and run them out like any other player. for now get on with it.you have also use player with good amarr standing in plex . but have been chased off. you have the chance to fleet up and take us out at bunkers as well. but as ever u dont. cry mr a river some where else
12/7/2009,"at least you have done something in gallente :)this would be nice, but only after complete rehaul. but i wonder what would be roleplaying explanation :>"
12/7/2009,"pervs, damar and emperor throne guards has never used any exploits.using alt to defend is not an exploit.using standing advantage may be lame but it is not an exploit. this standing thing is used on minmatar front in many different forms, especially by minmatar friends.you have to realize that those alts do not find plexes automatically, those must be controlled by player still. so capturing 6 systems in one day do need lot of effort and gametime from many players. so you can counter this by plexing defence plexes more than we do attack plexes or you can kill us all again and again. problem is that no one cares to do boring part of fw. you want that you can keep systems sitting in station and undocking only when you get kills. that is not possible now on minmatar front, you have to do work, a lot of work and that is what caldari does, nonstop plexing.systems are not flipping because there is some 'bug', they are flipping because caldari is attacking."
12/7/2009,"""neutral"" like your neutral alt whom remote reps you in every engagement? i'm sorry but you are one of the last people whom need to be speaking out against exploits."
12/7/2009,"i know it's lame, but i am finding this situation awkwardly funny.a few guys with an army of alt-tab alts was able to quickly overturn the course of the war by using in-game mechanics. no exploiting, just playing the game by the rules ccp made.how's that for ""gallente suxorz they lose all teh plex"". and how bm said, its not like they are using bots, they have to control those alts. if there were enough people to counter their plexing after dt i'm sure you would be ok, right? maybe minmatar are just lazy and don't like to plex because they don't have people dedicated enough to plexing, right?deja'vu. this is the epitome of what is wrong with fw. we are waiting for ccp's response. maybe someone should post a bug report on the issues forum titled ""faction warfare is not working halp!11!""."
12/7/2009,"just fix it, metagaming nosense"
12/7/2009,"hypocrisy is strong in any discussion about bugs.i have seen amarrians use the standing bug before (but as amarrians, not as caldari, else i would have created such a thread before). i have seen amarrians use the timer bug.i have seen minmatar use the timer bug. i'm pretty sure there are minmatar who have used the standing bug.and even our friend from pervs is right: just because you have a dozen alts running around your space in t1 fitted frigates for close to 9 hours a day does not mean all is lost. what makes it a lost cause is that plexing is such a damn boring thing against alts because it does not bring any useful fights. so those who do not have the ""alt army"" lose patience much, much faster.not to mention that using (perceived) bugs in the system demotivates people even more than they already are.""clever use of game mechanics"", i think it's called.does not make the standings issue any less of a ridiculous game mechanic. so please fix."
12/7/2009,"i repeat:make capturing a plex require destruction of all the navy in the plex.in one swoop - no speed tanking, no standings loophole, no timer bug."
12/7/2009,"well, i have to admit i never really liked you guys but i have to give you hats off and props to this. it's too bad other corps whom are in the lime light with-in the amarr militia don't also stand up refuse to be part of this non sense.corps that have openly supported these actions by joining in or rping about the shallow victory's will always be remembered as just that. shallow and weak.at least you guys have a bit of honor it appears, so hats off."
12/7/2009,fix it b4 amarr/matari fw is ruined
12/7/2009,"did ccp fix that? they did not fix it when it happened to bob, they did not fix it when it happened to cva. the only difference with cva was ccp stood up and righted the wrong. on the flip side bob lost their alliance yet it was not fixed even a year later as it did happen to cva.what you guys are doing imo is pretty much the same to fw as one man disbanding 0.0 alliance. you are ****ing in the work of what hundreds of players have done since fw started.as part of a rp corp you are even more guilty and at least 1pg made a stand and decided not to partake in this nonsense. it's sad to see your corp with the history it's had take part in something so selfish and childish."
12/7/2009,"gangleri, the stand by you and 1pg is highly admirable.use/abuse of broken mechanics shouldn't be the determining factor in the factional warfare theatres. it is unfortunate that ccp has chosen to downplay or ignore the problems for so long, and while i have no expectation that they will act soon i am more than glad to add what support i can to the effort to get the developers to give factional warfare a higher priority in their backlog."

12/7/2009,"oh come on now jade.on an rp level, what are we meant to do when a system becomes vulnerable?ignore it? we would be failing in our in character duty if we did so, and you would be the first to make capital out of it.ooc most of us think that the current mechanic sucks. but then we also think that the mechanic that allows the minmatars to take a single vigil into an amarrian plex and capture it without sustaining a single point of damage sucks. and we think that the mechanic that causes the timer to keep running even when nobody is there sucks too.i mean, what's the point of changing things so that someone will get shot at by npcs in the future if they still don't have to be there to be shot at?remember - in character statements and actions do not neccessarily reflect out of character views and opinions."
12/7/2009,"follow the example of 1pg and cva in this very thread?no i wouldn't and if you think i would then it shows how little you really understand the motivations of your fellow eve players at the end of the day. its a pathetic cheesy exploit that has already ruined the integrity of faction warfare and will destroy the amarrian/minmatar front and the enjoyment of many many players. you had an opportunity to take a principled stance but decided instead to ic showboat your ""success"" on the back of the most tawdry gaming of broken mechanics imaginable.yes there are many problems with fw mechanics in general, but the system and integrity of the fw battle on your front did not collapse until you decided to cooperate with the caldari exploiters and ruin the experience for all concerned.yes i am sure that if you hadn't done it other people would have collaborated with these ""spoilers"" but the fact remains you were faced with an ethical choice and you choose wrongly.at the end of the day i think you will come to see this and regret your actions."
12/7/2009,and my point is that who's to say that exactly the same thing wouldn't have happened had fw not had this standings issues? because it would still have been possible to not even be in the plex and have the timer continue to run.and the latter has been a known bug for a very long time.
12/7/2009,"as far as i am aware that bug has been classified as an exploit by gm's and you can ""counter it"" by petitioning those using it. and both sides can have a gentleman's agreement not to cheat. similar to the agreement i think you had until a week ago."
12/7/2009,supported.though it might already be too late to undo the damage done.
12/7/2009,"i always thought that gentlemen's agreements were a bit ""sandboxy"" for you? what was it you once said? oh yes:"
12/7/2009,"and here was me thinking that the jade/rodj love spat was all ic. seriously, chill fellas. we're all on the same side on this one.simplest solution: make destroying all navy in the plex a prerequisite for plex capture. goodbye speed tanking, goodbye standings loopholes.intermediary solution: ccp declares the standings loophole an exploit. same as abusing the timer bug already is."
12/7/2009,perfect!
12/7/2009,that would certainly be a good solution.
12/7/2009,"i think 1pg have set a pretty good example as to what a corp such as yours should be doing in this situation. maybe you should look back to a few weeks ago when your fellow cva friends fell victim to a game exploit which caused their entire alliance to collapse, undoing the work that had gone into it from many years.while i will admit, i did get a good laugh at it as did most of us, but even within the minmatar militia we thought the way it was done was wrong and i'm pretty sure it was a general belief that we supported righting the wrong by ccp.many people despite their disagreements or even hate for cva came out and supported them because what was done was wrong. more so the ability to do what was done happened due to faulty game mechanics. this is much the same case. you are supporting the undermining of countless people's work just to gain a little bit of satisfaction with a forum post in igs. is your honor and your corp's reputation really only worth a few chest thumping posts in the igs forums? when cva was disbanded many people put aside their rp to show support which likely helped push ccp in the direction of righting the wrong and not just letting them fall to the same fate as bob did. your corp could also put your rp to the side and stop supporting these ill gotten fake gains. what you are doing is wrong and what you are doing will forever stain your corp reputation."
12/7/2009,"there's a slight difference between this and the cva disolution, in that the former is a result of flawed mechanics that have been known about for some time and some of our opponents have apparently themselves used in the past, whilst the later was the result of out of game hacking activities.if it's any consolation, look at where the recently fallen systems are on the map."
12/7/2009,"there is no difference. there is only a question of right or wrong. you know what you are doing is wrong, regardless of what you wish to call it."
12/7/2009,"yes, 1pg were dignified enough to do exactly that.sorry but you seem to be implying that your rping actually controls your actions, you make it sound like some debilitating disease ffs. ""well we could have chosen not to shoot those bunkers, but as you know, we suffer from ""role playing syndrome"" and as such are completely unable to control any actions of our in game character""you sound about as credible as a npc republic fleet officer explaining why he was unable to shoot at a caldari plexer. shpooting the bunkers was one thing, i could almost understand a couple of them getting shot from excitement/misundersatnding, but you shot all of them and them you all crowed about it (ic ofc) on the igs.how convenient to have the plausible denial of ooc statements saying you don't support this tactic but still get to indulge yourself in ""yay we won lulz"" comment on igs. if rping really does control you to this extent, i suggest you visit a head doctor or perhaps an exorcist (in game of course)"
12/7/2009,"that's sort of what rping is - having your character do the things that your character would do. and yes, my character does have different views on things to the real-life me. you may be surprised to hear that i don't support slavery in rl.but really, i fail to see what pie's in-game response to the issue has to do with the actual problem(s) that this topic is about.you'll notice that i actually agree that the current mechanic is a problem that needs to be addressed.you'll even notice a thumbs up from me in this thread."
12/7/2009,"then that sir makes you a hypocrite. you are saying you will gladly take the benefits of using this game breaking exploit, but will publicly claim it should be changed, so no one else can take advantage of it. in others words, it's cool for you guys to use, but ccp should defiantly fix this, so it can't be used against you. meanwhile you know they likely won't fix it before you guys are done using it. this all works out very well for you."
12/7/2009,supported.
12/7/2009,supported. although not really any hope this will be fixed as these problems have been known a long time. my bet is on fw being mostly lp farming ground in a few months time anyway. the whole system is rotten to the core.
12/7/2009,"people, please. i know frustration and anger levels are high, but this is not a 'who is to blame thread' neither a 'lets condemn some people' thread, let us not turn it into one.there are issues with fw mechanics, all people agree that they need to be solved, and be solved soon rather than late. that we don't agree on is what to do in the interim. but that is not the issue under debate here. also, i believe the issue of what to do in the interim is interlinked with many other fw issues.please start another thread or get people together in-game to discuss a solution for the meantime, but placing blame in this thread certainly isn't going to solve the problem."
12/7/2009,"oh gimme a break...""i really don't want the caldari to ruin the amarr/minnie battlefront, but omg there's nothing i can do to stop my character capitalizing on caldari abuse of broken mechanics and then crowing about it on igs ... he's out of control !!11!""isn't it time you realized that even from an rp perspective, this situation is massively broken and you should take a step back from it ?"
12/7/2009,"the blame game also achieves very little - it's like arguing over the result of a rigged match... duh, it was rigged! the outcome is irrelevant, because you can never know what would have actually happened in 'fair/balanced' circumstances. it renders the actual effort of those not using inappropriate tactics/bugs/exploits/call-it-what-you-will also irrelevant because you're no longer comparing apples and apples. arguably the current 'victories', for any side, are null & void.nobody seems to be arguing that the current situation is correct - therefore the situation needs addressing. the only reasonable way to do that is to fix the problems & start again. compare it to the moon-goo exploit - ccp didn't say 'well, we've discovered the problem now and fixed it, but the ill gotten gains are ok' - they removed the ill gotten gains (they pretty much couldn't fix the economic impacts, but lets not wander off-topic..). ccp can find reason to fix the problems and reset occupancy, along with preferably giving occupancy meaning and all the other requests for fw's improvements. that's what we should be asking for, not getting distracted by blaming each other."
12/7/2009,"sorry but trying to claim you are still against this is like seeing the opposition football team all held at gun point but then still deciding to shoot at goal, while saying you disapprove - you can't have both.if you want ppl to actually believe that you are actually opposed to this mechanic then you should stop engaging in it. it's pretty damned clear cut"
12/7/2009,"extra bunker hp can't hurt, either"
12/7/2009,"i replied in the other thread, which is about fw as a whole."
12/7/2009,"rodj or anyone else from pie can't really make a statement similar to the one made made by 1pg for a very simple reason:we do not offensive plex except on rare occassions. our primary task has been to hold the line as best we could. a vast majority of our time is spent clearing the debris after the vigil's/rifters of doom has passed through friendly space ic there is no way to speak out against reclaiming of systems without instantly commiting treason/heresy, or that is to say i can not think of any way to spin it.-----it is a crummy mechanic that's for sure, but look at the bright side .. blood finally started to boil .. we as players need to be feverish and drooling like rabid dogs to make ccp take notice. fw has been puttering along with all the game breaking features because we have lacked the the massive outcry necessary .. we plexers/rp'ers have been ridiculed in every thread raising the issues going back over eighteen months.ps: timer abuse is not an exploit as far as i am aware, properly merely frowned upon.ccp has a very poor track-record when it comes to making that declaration and seem to only make it when they have the bug/mechanic nailed and merely waiting for the code to compile.this is the only list i know of with actual notifications .. hardly extensive."
12/7/2009,"it is considered an exploit and petitionable. i have asked explicitly that question via petition, got a ""yes, it's an exploit"" back, and have petitioned a few pilots for it."
12/7/2009,"supported. fw has a number of flawed game mechanics as others have mentioned, the implications of this particular one i feel will result in the failure of this piece of content.time to take a serious look at faction war again ccp, and to take onboard suggestions from the players who actually enjoy playing the fw game as it is intended."

12/7/2009,they really should be able to survive 3 dd's at least. idk what kind of buff that translates to or what your eventual plans for the ship are but it wouldnt hurt to give them a hp buff now to at least that level.

12/7/2009,"the titan weapons were designed to barbeque ms's says so in the description of the mods.whats the point in giving ms hp boosts , that would increase there invulnerability to all weapons systems without reason.if dd's are op then its the alpha of the dd that needs reducing not the hp tanks of moms.having moms with 5x there current hp while there still able to deal there huge damage againts smaller targets ( pre fighter-bomber armaments ) would make them 5x the omgwtfbbqsolopenmobiles they are today and is unjustifiable.so you mom is no longer invulnerable , welcome to the cold harsh world of eve.personally i dont see the issue.2 x titan is like 140b worth of ships to kill one ship worth 20b !the titans are completelly stuck where they are for 10 minutes, long enough for any fleet to drop in reinforcements and try to take them out.the problem here is pilots flying ships they cant afford to lose.your not gonna get dropped by titans everytime you take one out and anytime you do the attacking titan fleet is exposing far more valuable ships than you have just had bbq'd."
12/7/2009,"indeed, although im pro a halving of the rof of the titan dds in tandem with a halving (or such as 75%) of the current damageyou rarely get to see a lone titan in a decisive capital fight, or am i overestimating titan usage?"

12/7/2009,reduces dd alpha rather than mom hp buff. i can't imagine the extra amount of pain a empire mom will be if buffed.
12/7/2009,throw the hp buff on them right now and then play around with balancing or what ever but get that hp boost on now....like within 5 days.

12/7/2009,"the strong point of the mothership always used to be lots of drones and the immunity of electronic warfare, including the ability to not be scrammed by non-dictor class ships.however as it stands now the mothership is even worse off, to destroy one tackling is no longer needed all you need to do is press the win button.replacing one mothership for a fleet of say 10-15 carriers would be better because they end up costing them same but can't be destroyed in a single whim.therefore the hp buff should be implemented as soon as possible to even out this flaw even if it doesn't still have a defined role now still."
12/7/2009,sok you obviously haven't been listening to me whine in corp/vent i am soo ****ed off training for this damn ship now its just no fun any more.constantly having to respec long ass skills just to make the ship reasonable on those odd occasions you need it (less now with dominion??)there are other parts of my game i want to train geez ccp pleas end this torture

12/7/2009,one of the things thats constantly annoyed me since the d-scan change has been the lack of visual indication as to when you can scan again./signed
12/7/2009,i like the idea. so simple.
12/7/2009,+1those error messages are really annoying.
12/7/2009,supported if probes are added to overview so they can be filtered on the scanner results.
12/7/2009,this.
12/7/2009,"why not just get rid of the need to spam that idiot button?make the basic directional scanner a passive system that's 'always on' (even if you're not paying attention to it). it's not particularly accurate nor immediate, identifying a 'ship' with very little additional information depending on range/sig of the contact (with smaller contacts getting much closer before showing up at all).given enough time it'll give a rough direction/distance to the contact (massive deviation in the range of an au or more at the limits of the sensor sweep).if the pilot wants more information they can either a: use a probe or b: use their 'active sensor' which just like a submarine sends out a high-energy pulse and reads the return echo. it gives much more detail, but also lets the other ship know what and where the 'pinging' ship is (within a large deviation at range, not enough for an immediate warp-to). this pulse, however, can be used by other ships to augment their passive sensor sweeps.ccp should use the analogies of modern anti-submarine warfare when it comes to scanning for ships. it's simple and straightforward. keep quiet and you're not 'blind' as you are now, but you can't see well. make some noise and you can see better but can also be found more easily."

12/7/2009,"yes, please change it to something better. dark green & black cameo would even be better than the current ugly green. edit: i agree with the others, this probably won't make ccp change their minds there is always hope."
12/7/2009,"before i start, it seems quite a few people don't know of the change that has happened since apocrypha, so have a twisted opinion on this. since apocrypha the mechanic changed. the ship you shoot no longer stays in space for 15 minutes if you have aggressed them. they only stay in space for 15 minutes if they shoot back.this means they can jump into a camp and log. and if they survive 1 minute and 30 seconds their ship just disappears. they don't warp off and allow you to scan them down anymore, they just disappear from space.now you are up to date on the situation please read the below.currently low sec camps (and quite possibly any type of small camp) with a couple of people no longer work against anything that can tank that small gang for a minute and half. this means you have to get together a big gang and basically blob. this is surely against ccp's aims?this is because there is no longer an aggression timer on a ship that has been shot. f.e. a rokh jumps into me and my friend in a phobos and claymore. we get two decent bumps on him and we're taking his shields down relatively well. we get him to half shields and he's still miles off the gate. suddenly he just disappears... no emergency warp or anything, just disappears from space like he cloaked but instantly. we realise he logged from local and there's not a thing we can do about it. but we wait for him to come back. once again we tackle him off gate and once again he logs and disappears.this really needs sorting. please don't let characters disappear due to logoff if they are pointed, if they have more stabs than points then obviously they can warp, but not if caught by a hic's infapoint. this still means you have to get a lock before the ship emergency warps but this is still easily possible if that ship choses to log.as for the point of knowing whether a ship logs or is disconnected.. isn't there a petition for ship reimbursement particularly designed for that scenario where they can claim their ships back with sufficient evidence it was a server problem? how about we go back to using it.please sort this as its ruining a lot of peoples low sec gameplay i know, especially for the smaller corps that can't get big enough numbers to instapop such ships.important. if you reply and agree please tick the support checkbox when you do so, this is how these posts are officially tracked. please also get your friends to support thisthankyoumike"

12/7/2009,dont support ... get better but dont change eve to fullfill your insufficient skills
12/7/2009,"how does that relate to insufficient skills in any sense?literally: theres no skill you can train to point people who logoff.non literally: you can't bump these people to stop them logging, you cant point them to stop them logging, you can't do anything but add more dps to kill them within a minute and half. which on a passive recharge rokh or any other extended / plated ship for that matter is quite hard to do within the time limit with a small gate camp. then they simply just disappear.i don't see any logic in what you just said at all other than you love logging off yourself to save your ships."
12/7/2009,i support this as it is spammed in o.o aswell. d-scan means nothing if they just log off when you get there and as a solo pilot you dont have the dps to kill something in that time.
12/7/2009,so what ... turning off the log off button till every noob had a chance to shoot? so we all stay online 23/7take it like a man if you are not good enough to take a ship down in time
12/7/2009,"where does it say in my proposal anything about removing the log off button?that would be the most ridiculous suggestion ever.of course people can still log off. but once they have logged off, their ships are not invulnerable to electronic warfare so they can still be killed. so people can't purposely log off on a gate to save their ship been killed."
12/7/2009,fit some ****ing probelauncher on your ship ffs !
12/7/2009,"so let me get this straight if i log off after being attacked i can evade death sweet will try this asap <3 thanks for the advice,.."
12/7/2009,"doesn't work anymore boppi. try it.they dont warp off anymore. there is no longer 15 minutes to scan them down upon shooting them, only if they agress. so if they shoot back then log you have 15 mins to scan them. if they just log while you have a point on them they just dissapear from space in 1 minute and 30 seconds. no scanning down or anything. now you see them now you don't style.not a lot of people know this mechanic had changed but it has since apocrypha. try it yourself if you don't believe me."
12/7/2009,"they know now.shooting yourself in the foot ftw.edit to stay on topic:i'm not sure how i feel about this proposal. the server code as written doesn't know if you disconnected or hit ctrl-q. all it knows is it can't talk to your client anymore and it responds appropriately.and ccp has a long standing policy of not reimbursing for (essentially) random client disconnects. so if they do legitamately disconnect and you blast them, they're not getting their ship back. the issue ccp faces is how do they balance the ""i got them pointed shoot them"" crowd against the ""wtf i disconnected and when i came back i'm in my medical clone!"" crowd."
12/7/2009,i'd rather have it fixed..
12/7/2009,"i hate this forum as i feel its the place to whine to developers to get your way, but i must agree to what the op is saying.i remember when people would jump through gate and immediately log off so they would disappear after the 30 second cloak timed out. even if they had a gcc or an aggression timer. it seems really lame for ccp to back up and make it fair again to log out to save a ship. if you fly a ship and get pointed you should stay in space till u break the lock, dock, jump through gate, lose your ship, or kill the people shooting you. if you do not want to lose your ship do not fly it in low sec or 0.0 or during war."
12/7/2009,"my only problem with this is, sure it is a shady tactic, but there may be a case in which somebody actually dcs.how would this be handled? would you simply make it that all log offs make you visible in space for 15 minutes after emergency warp? otherwise then what would be the point of logging of in space in lowsec at all?i myself have never logofski and never will, but i see it from both sides. sure you want to give the campers a shot, but at the same time, why make it nearly impossible to get through a camp if your not in a small ship or cloaker? how this turns out will be interesting..."
12/7/2009,"having your ship dissappear? c'mon seriously, how am i gonna explain that to anyone sane?supported for sanity and the love of humanity!"
12/7/2009,i support this
12/7/2009,"#you fit warp core stabs and a tank mal.also as i said in one of my posts above, there is a petition for ship reimbursement for such cases if you do get disconnected due to a server side issue. if its your own connection its tough and always has been, if ccp caused it and you can prove it you get your ship back."
12/7/2009,ugh :/ fix it
12/7/2009,"just clarify something mike:even pre-apocrypha, if a ship jumped through a gate into a camp, and then logged while still cloaked, it disappeared in 60 secs. it only collected a 15 min timer if it was aggressed before the server decided the client had disconnected.is this the issue you want fixed?"
12/7/2009,yeah
12/7/2009,"i didn't actually mean that situation fat, however that situation would be covered by this suggestion and also stop it happening. the mechanic changed post apocrypha though. say that you did get the ship aggressed before the server decided the client had disconnected, now after apocrypha, that ship still disappears in 1 min 30. now it's only if they aggress that they stick around for 15 minutes.mike"
12/7/2009,:-)the lights topic.
12/7/2009,"thank you for your support guys!also, shameless bump."
12/7/2009,"with dominion, the way people rat has changed, with i-hub upgrades now able to keep a constant stream of anomalies coming. as more and more ratters move to this kind of ratting over belt ratting, it makes it harder on those who hunt the ratters to find - and kill - them. currently if you find someone on directional scan and figure out that they are in an anomaly, you have to scan for anomalies and then initiate warp to each of the results to find out if they are in the correct direction. give anomalies that you have scanned out with your on board scanner or probes, a bracket in your in space view, like belts, planets, etc, so you can instantly determine whether or not your target is in the correct anomaly. ratting has evolved, ratter hunting needs to follow."

12/7/2009,a setting that we can set to have cans be blue by default when we kill. i mine a lot and kill a lot of rats but can't be bothered to loot or salvage usually. but i get tells from folks and mail asking if they can salvage and loot the wreaks. i would like to just turn on the make them blue option by default.
12/7/2009,seems reasonable to have as an option
12/7/2009,you can always right abandon all nearby wrecks. having a perminant toggle sounds fine to me though.
12/7/2009,hmm apparently you have to support your own idea by posting twice. even though you can tick the 'support' box when you first create the thread.
12/7/2009,"not supported, i see the .01 isk war as part of the game if you don't like move your sales elsewhere. i don't like that to compete and keep my orders moving i have to check prices daily in certain places so i moved my orders away from where so many sellers work and the price changes several times a day, if not a dozen. other players may sell more faster but i generally make more isk, per item(small seller/manufacturer), and spend less of my time updating orders which is how *i* like it.if people want to be at the busy hubs then they have to deal with all the other people undercutting them and modifiying orders over and over to get the sale. *perhaps* something like this could be implemented for places where a minimum of 5+ or so sell/buy orders of the same item are up, same for multi-system buy orders. easiest way to circumvent this is to sell at different stations, but i don't think all orders should be subject to this idea when the main problem is in the 'super' hubs and the people that choose to sell their crap with the other 50 people. no business owner would setup shop selling the same goods right next to someone else selling the same thing, along with another 50 merchants."
12/7/2009,i am against this idea. it will lower competition. it is is also complexone should want their orders to be seen individual. this is a great tool in a trade war.
12/7/2009,"as we are dealing with commodities (there is no ability to differentiate) the ""market"" would function better if it was an exchange. sell orders should be setup to have a minimum sell order, anything above that min price would sell. buy orders would have a max, anything below that would buy. this doesn't currently happen (or maybe it is supposed to and is bugged).unless ccp wants to put in place tools to allow people to function as brokers (which would contradict the fee people currently pay to place orders), it would be logical to have a fee per transaction. transactions include order modifications. presto-change-o... increases/decreases of 0.01 cease (as they no longer are worth the cost to modify the order). let's be honest, if a person were to place a sell order with their broker at the beginning of the day (above the going price), then step it down penny by penny throughout the day, their broker would **** them in fees. for good reason! each modification costs the broker time, if nothing else. in the game, each modification takes bandwidth and sucks on the server. in both cases, there is incentive to dissuade people from such activity. the simplest solution is charging fees each time it happens."
12/7/2009,remember that we're not just talking about modifications to existing orders but also posting new ones. if it wasn't possible (or economically feasible) to modify an existing order then that would give a major advantage to later traders who could simply outbid you by a cent. also there is a point where modifying orders is more expensive/more hassle than simply cancelling them and relisting.
12/7/2009,"when someone create a fleet with ""based on standing"" option the own corp members can't view the created fleet, because the corp members is neutral for other corp members.so, need to add a new feature or need to add own corp members to positive standing when created a based on standing fleet."
12/7/2009,just get your corp to set its self blue = fixed.its realy not that hard.
12/7/2009,"we didn't know why are corp members cant see the standing fleet in fleet finder system. all we are neutrals for each others. can you make a select ""corp members and based standing"", or make automatically corp members positive standings ?"
12/7/2009,you can't add own corp to blue standing.
12/7/2009,"the problem is still an issue with large corps, so i second the idea."
12/7/2009,you might remember a while ago you used to be able to use more than 5 droneswell they dropped they number from 10 to five due to apparent lag from it personally i think you get more lag from fleet battles and can spam than those dronestherefore i propose that the ability to use 10 drones be reinstated into eve after all surely now the servers should be able to handle it
12/7/2009,"/agreesorry, but lets face it, with the major cluster upgrades and the fact that major fleet battles will be laggy as hell no matter how many drones are on the grid, as a carebear; /agreed"
12/7/2009,"i'd just like a non-carrier version of the drone control unit module. at least one for the more dedicated drone boats: domi, myrm, etc"
12/7/2009,"pointless change, honestly.if they allowed up to 10 drones they'd cut their damage and hit-points by 50% so that interceptor is still going to mow through your 10 in about the same amount of time they currently mow through 5, factoring for the added lock time.20, 10, 5 or just 1 they will adjust them to do exactly the same damage and have exactly the same survivability."
12/7/2009,"lets not forget about having to cross train to another race to fly the vindicator. simply put at its current incarnation, the vindicator is simply not worth the time to train or the double price tag than that of the equally as effective navy mega.boost the damage bonus."
12/7/2009,"you grossly underestimate the power of a 90% web, never mind two."
12/7/2009,"first, sorry if this has already been proposed.so, how about faction spawns have faction salvage, and from that people can build faction rigs? yes they would be expensive, but some people like expensive stuff.and who wouldnt want a set of large dark blood trimark armour pumps?sorry its a short post, but lets face it, it doesnt much explaining..."

12/7/2009,i think it would be fun if corps had military ranks kinda to go along with the whole medals thing.
12/7/2009,0nce i joined this starcraft clan and after so many wins the clan leader would promote you and you got to change your name it got addictive and i couldnt stop playing and forgot to do all my homework for a week but it turned out you really dont need to do homework to graduate from highschool.
12/7/2009,wouldnt it be cool thou i mean right now all there is to tell whos who in a corp is just to see how long they have been in the corp which is kinda lame cause it makes mining alts look like some tuff dude but they really arnt but if there were ranks that the ceo could give out say like you have alot of fun ops and blow some ships up and the ceo can check that one tab out that shows everything the corp has killed then he could like hand out some promotions so like some dude with a high rank would prob be some awesome guy who has killed alot of stuff and is pretty decent at pvping and all the new guys could look up to him and it would be awesome to fly with him and learn how to be a good pilot so they could be like me one day.
12/7/2009,"i lol'di got very funny looks from my co-workers, so apparently i really did lol.0/10 for mentioning starcraft. we do not acknowledge the existence of that other gaming company here./in before this thread gets trolled into a lock."
12/7/2009,"yes it does need fixing, and ccp should look at it asap. a more serious problem in my view is the way a single vigil can attack an amarrian plex with immunity from the npcs because of their crappy weapons. they should fix that too."
12/7/2009,all the mentioned bugs and loop holes can be simply fixed with a small addition.an offensive plex may only be captured once the npc's guarding it are destroyed. for every thread that is started and supported that has purpose to fix fw will have to bring attention to have some one look into it or get a official response from ccp.
12/7/2009,"dear ankhesentapemkah,yes we all agree that fw is broken and plexing is broken.but some have enough imagination to give this broken system as little meaning as it can have and still have at least some fun with it.please stop asking a total tear down of fw in total.fw needs imho a three stage review.first, fix the little bugs and exploits (aka balance fw mission, reduce the rewards, the standing issue). 2nd an introduction of intermediate fixes (fw mission only spawn in contested missions, more lp for kills and lps for plexing)and then as third step you can do a long term evaluation of what fw could be and can be and redo it all over.since just asking ""tear it down, make it all new"" will just end up ""getting it removed and not replaced by anythin wthin several centuries"", least have us that little fun we have with what is there right now and get the little bugs and exploit out of the system.at least post a general proposal of changes and outline of what fw could be, but just asking ""tear it down"" is in my very humble opinion not really constructive.otherwise supported."
12/7/2009,supported.. even the people doing it openly admit they know it's a exploit and should be classified as one and imo the system taken should be reset. amarr never would have captured those system if not for using this exploit.
12/7/2009,"it doesn't need to be called an exploit because fw needs to be broken so bad that ccp will go back to the drawing board.system captures should be a large event bordering on weeks to capture a single system with massed pvp fights, and not something done quickly after downtime due to plex respawns.the guys who made pirates of the burning sea had a better idea in that pve bs only gets you a ticket into the final pvp fight. pve should count but it shouldn't capture systems.ccp know enough that they don't just let you blitz poses but they made it so you could blitz systems in fw?i only just came back after a three year absence (mainly because pos fights and 0.0 blobbage bored the crap out of me) with the hope of doing fw but it looks like at best i will just be randomly killing people because the capture mechanics suck."
12/7/2009,"the point of his topic is to not yet again argue about what should be done in the future, but rather classify what is being done as a game breaking exploit and start banning abusers.changing fw will take months if not a year worth of planing.. classifying this an exploit can be done now before a few *******s can ruin the work that has been done by many over a long period of time."
12/7/2009,supported
12/7/2009,because even if it was fixed orbiting a beacon for 15 minutes is great gameplay right? the whole plexing thing is dumb and should be redone.something amarr and gallente can agree on.
12/7/2009,"my objection to this is not just this, but capturing plexes with lowly-skilled alts and without risking your ship against npcs in general is a problem.i would dislike to have this same discussion one month from now when damar, still angry at ccp, simply gets a lot of pervs alts transferred to the tlf and starts mass-speed capturing amarr systems instead to make his point. as i pointed out, the exploitability has been there all along, its only the current industrial scale at which it is used that makes it a problem.i would be angry as well if i logged into eve to find out hordes of alts in vigils speed tanking the amarr plexes every day. i would be just as helpless against this tactic, and it would be just as fun destroying. think about it.fw is broken in many places, it will take some dedicated (or angry) players to expose these issues, but it can be broken in many other ways too. as far as i'm concerned its flawed at its core, and frankly, i'm very tired of fighting idiot game mechanics rather than my opponents."
12/7/2009,this sounds like a solid suggestion.
12/7/2009,for sure.
12/7/2009,"yes, definitely. and may i suggest someone put up a matching thread for the timer bug?"
12/7/2009,"i was the alliance leader for a long time, and the standing management was a real pain. once you get positive standings with one alliance, you have to set standings with all their pets/allies/alt corps ets. so the idea is - make the ability to import/export the standings lists, so coalitions can simply update it and publish on their pages."
12/7/2009,"well, atleast the export for the first time."
12/7/2009,hopefully something like this is in the works for the new corp and alliance management coming with new eden. more things need to be export/importable.
12/7/2009,yes
12/7/2009,my bet is onwe all know how well thought and tested ccp content intgroduction is right?
12/7/2009,thumps up. i really hate it to find a bpo between alot of bpcs.
12/7/2009,"it is not ""redesign the blueprint stuff"", it is ""redesign the database"", and that is the problem.to resolve the bpo/bpc issue would require to always register every bpc as a different item instead of using a generic bp template for each item and adding the bpc data only if the item is queried. seeing how each bpc has thousand of combinations of me/pe/number of copies it would increase the database size bye several orders of magnitude. not a good idea for the game.so ask for a better science & industry interface, allowing us to better manipulate the blueprints and don't ask something impossible."
12/7/2009,"if we can't have a new bpc template design, then even capitals for the bpo in blueprint if possible...augoror blueprint - bpoaugoror blueprint - bpcwhatever the outcome, a way of easily seeing the difference would be good.also, signed for the better science and industry interface :)-t'amber"
12/7/2009,"your suggestion, unfortunately, doesn't solve the problem venkul is describing. i'm not saying the problem is insoluable, and i would certainly like to see it solved, but unless ccp already has a major db redisgn on their drawing board, don't expect to see bpo/bpc differentiation anytime soon.that aside, i would also love to see a better s&i interface."
12/7/2009,everyone else may have an excuse for proposing this tripe... but you do not.you (you know who you people are!) already know the answer to this question... you have been there and you have read it.how disappointing that you obviously can't read let alone remember.please... stop embarrassing yourselves people.... ccp has said no and they have said why.give it up.... the whole mess would require redesigning the entire system. beating a dead horse is only going to make a bigger mess.this isn't a matter of opinion anymore... it has been said countless times... give it up.it's like demanding the sky to be turned pink... ain't gonna happen.
12/7/2009,"although there may be some great improvements with the new dominion email system and interface (such as being able to see 'sent' email) versus that of apocrypha, i do not claim to 'love' it. the automatic grouping of messages by sender and the on-line status indicator with portrait, are missed."
12/7/2009,i support my own proposal
12/7/2009,"a lot of people have posted doubling the missile velocity and halving the flight time to come up with a faster missile at the same range, but there have also been arguments that the physics engine can't support those speeds. at this point the idea is well known, and you just have to leave it to the devs to decide on.i would agree with removing unguided classification from missiles. it seems a bit odd to have the skill only apply to half the weapon class.the rest of these changes are pretty much unneeded. barring rockets, missiles work reasonably well against their intended targets. if any changes are needed, it's really rebalancing of some missile based ships, i.e. the hawk, which should have it's damage bonus boosted to a 10% and obviously rockets need some love."
12/7/2009,your ham changes are over the top.with that you would get a 875 dps ham drake. thats too close to a brutix. especially since you wont have tracking issues.also the explosion velocity changes might toast ships too easily as speed tanking them will get almost impossible.i am a missile user myself but your changes are over the top.
12/7/2009,"i calculated the velocities so that an afterburning ship with minimum skills take max damage, but an afterburning ship with max skills will take reduced damage. if you are mwding you take reduced damage as well."
12/7/2009,"missiles are already very deadly weapon systems (rockets not included). they have their advantages- perfect tracking- both close and long range damage. sure, you need to wait a few seconds for your long range damage, but it's a part of the mechanism that allows you to have no tracking issues- no cap- choose your damage typein order to apply your full dps, you need to apply some webs. just like blasters. unlike turrets, there is no counter (lol defenders vs tracking disruptors) and you can fight in a great variety of engagement ranges.also, a ship fitting an afterburner is gimped for many other aspects of pvp. some people still laugh at ab fitted ships as useless, others say they are op, imo there is now choice between fitting an ab or not.not supported!"
12/7/2009,cruises and rockets are a joke. they need a rework.
12/7/2009,"missiles may have perfect tracking, however they are affected by sig radius and velocity which makes up for that. also, missiles are the only weapon system, for which it is possible for someone to change their velocity/distance from you while your damage in enroute. so an inty can see you warp in at the edge of your max range and then accelerate away from you so that they are out of range by the time the missile reached them. and that totally sucks"
12/7/2009,"cruise missiles probably just need to be brought closer to what hml's are. make them rockets just plain lolkets atmhowever i do not see any needed change to lights/hml's/ham's/torps. hml's and ham's especially. both are powerful weapon systems. torps are very powerful against bs and bc sized targets. while light missiles don't have much in the way of dps, they have very good alpha for frig weapons, with stupidly long range."
12/7/2009,"and turrets aren't? sig radius and velocity of the ship (given flying) both affect turret trracking.which adds variety. other weapon systems have their tradeoffs, and i'd rather not every single weapon system be exactly the same.as others have posted, most of the missile systems are already very powerful, what you propose would make them far overpowered."
12/7/2009,"the funny thing is that, if some sort of gallente/blaster buff goes through as proposed in f&i, some sort of generic missile rework would be justified, as we would, by then, quite definitely be playing power creep online."
12/7/2009,delete please
12/7/2009,"i sell boosters and as the hardest working drug dealer in the game i think my life would be a whole lot easier if there was a skill inbetween biology and nanite control. i don't do this **** for the money, i love it but your making my life hard.btxi"
12/7/2009,how about a skill for synth junkies....triple that 3% to 9 and drag it on up to 12. that would bring the pvp in low sec up a notch cus thats where the gassssssss is.btxi
12/7/2009,use standards if you really want a decent puff. they're not even that expensive.
12/7/2009,"the solution is to make the naglfar better, not easier. not supported."
12/7/2009,"why hasn't this been implemented yet? give anti-piracy and mercenaries a chance to fight back without becoming pirates themselves. this change brings more pros than cons as far as i can see. discuss (and support, dammit! )"
12/7/2009,well if you dont want to start from scratch maybe bump the relevant threads.
12/7/2009,that thread died back in july 2008 .
12/7/2009,to quote the stick thread:
12/7/2009,fair enough. thx for the link. didn't know about it.
12/7/2009,"a small issue, but it does make sense."
12/7/2009,"i wasn't supposed to do this right, oh well, it is energy managment from 5 to 3 to get thermodynamics, which is a good skill to have not a waste in any sense."

12/7/2009,"can i please reserve space too, pretty please?here is some suggestions for what would do well for the iceland meetings:alliance logosmass forum-censoringboth are issues that aren't just ""we will do this"", but allows for dialog and discussion. spend your time in iceland focused on that. you have 4 months after that to bring up ""please implement x and y, fix z and k""."
12/7/2009,"do you have examples of posts that were not just deleted for spamming stuff like ""free abathur"" etc?there is a difference between censoring items you disagree with and enforcing the forum rules that everybody signed up to when they logged in. if people really are being censored then i want to see it stopped as much as the next person, but comparing post counts between the forum and eve search doesn't give an accurate picture."
12/7/2009,"congratulations on the secretary position teadaze, and good luck, i know from experience how much work it can be!"
12/7/2009,congrats (or condolences) on the position teadaze
12/7/2009,ccp wrangler was also present at the meeting :p
12/7/2009,"fair point, i only counted people who said anything in the raw logs."
12/7/2009,"i'm sure you'll get your wish for having more issue-related stuff in the minutes as time goes on. very glad to see you as secretary, teadaze."
12/7/2009,"gj - and as i said in the meeting, if you need a hand/advice/cyb0r session, drop me a line"
12/7/2009,"thanks for posting the minutes so fast, teadaze, and congrats again on being voted in, and on the new position."
12/7/2009,"lets sum up the meeting:1. zastrow spoke all the time, while just putting the ""!"" to speak once during the 1<U+FFFD> hour meeting.2. some people aren't happy with having to put a ""!"" and wait for their turn to speak3. teadaze managed to do a rather quick job of getting up the minutes. good job.that's 2 failures and 1 win thus far.better luck next time, and keep up the good job teadaze"
12/7/2009,gj on the article
12/8/2009,"i fully support this!i want a player operated station to look like a station, not a bunch of stuff floating around by itself in space. come on csm, let's get this on the table again!"
12/8/2009,*flog*
12/8/2009,"yes please,great ideas"
12/8/2009,/signedthis is good
12/8/2009,hope someone picks this up.
12/8/2009,"this is the same post your putting on the agenda, only this is a summery of the last 4 years worth of the dead horse pos thread... its the whole thing in a nutshell"
12/8/2009,"yes, its killing my eyes"
12/8/2009,bump.
12/8/2009,"i don't spend nearly as much time in w-space as you do, but i can still see the utility of this. supported."
12/8/2009,"align to bookmark would be very handy, i've counted many times when i wish i could of done this."
12/8/2009,yes please!
12/8/2009,absolutely
12/8/2009,"yes, moar tracking for blasters plz.i'd rather see the brutix getting an armor resist bonus and a slight pg buff."
12/8/2009,"fully agree, very well thought out.in ye olde days you would not have seen naval ships attempt max damage, close range, broadside volleys only for the cannon balls to mysteriously curve away from the target. or even a musket being able to pick off a guy with a massive sword swinging it at your face...in short:more blaster tracking! good work on the doctrines btw spot on!"
12/8/2009,"kronos and hyperion suck balls too, although that's mostly due to hybrids sucking."
12/8/2009,"supported, also here's a hyp fit to try, wouldn't fly exactly that but it's a good start:"
12/8/2009,"blimey, much :effort: went into that. read it, liked it. would question whether the ab bonus should be as high as 20% (15 maybe?) as it would be interesting to see the potential nanothron's that might pop up as a result! but yes, some very interesting thoughts taking into account the varying roles and philosophies.+1 (thumb)"
12/8/2009,"how could anyone who read that post think its a good idea?! its the embodiment of biased opinion, with that gallente would become the destroyer of worlds or something. go write up a realistic list of changes and we can talk."
12/8/2009,"you see, i do not treat the proposal as a list of things that have to be done, i treat it more as a list of problems that we have, and a number of solutions that we can offer. yes, ofcource if all of them are implemented at once, it will probably be overkill, but that is already for ccp to decide, which ones of them come through."
12/8/2009,"i read the thread before it was posted in here, and the only thing i feel would be even the slightest overpowered is the armour hp boost per level on the hyperion. but with only 6 lowslots i don't think it would be a big issue.the the proposed changes need some extensive testing and perhaps a few tweaks, but all in all i think the changes would be for the better."
12/8/2009,i even volunteer to personally screen / approve the logo's on ccp's behalf for 1 bil isk per month...
12/8/2009,"i like the idea and i'm supporting it, but it won't happen. same reason we were told they won't change the icons for bpcs to be different from bpos; apparently it takes massive amounts of effort to change the colour tint on a single icon. or something."
12/8/2009,"you assume every player knows what is and isnt a ""normal game mechanic"" which they clearly do not. spelling out known exploits will increase players ability to recognize and report them and hopefully lower the number of petitions for things that really arnt exploits."
12/8/2009,yes
12/8/2009,"what bagehi said. also it's a lose-lose situation for ccp, there are exploits that probably aren't detectable unless a gm witnesses it directly. if ccp list those exploits then the expectation from the playerbase is that they would enforce them - which may not be possible. if they don't list those exploits then players would wonder why the list isn't complete.there are good reasons why no mmo company does this."
12/8/2009,"it's not about things that are obviously exploits - everyone knows that macroing, hacking the servers, item duping, all that kind of stuff is obviously an exploit, and nobody should need to be told that. the classic example of what i'm pretty sure op is talking about is pos bowling. for those of you who don't know what that was, basically you park a guy outside a pos bubble, warp to that guy at range in a titan or other physically large ship, find yourself in the bubble, collision detection goes haywire, and a bunch of ships stored in that bubble wind up outside for your buddies in pods to jump into. for an extended period of time, this was considered valid(if lowbrow) gameplay, until ccp declared it an exploit a couple years back now. thing is, i don't think it's yet been fixed in the actual game code. haven't tried it myself(since i know it's banned), but imagine some guy who wasn't even playing when it was declared verboten, accidentally does it one day, decides it's really cool, and tries to bring back pos bowling. he knows it's a bit shady, but he can't find anywhere it says it's not allowed, so he doesn't know it's considered an exploit, and he has no practical way of knowing - what's he going to do, read 1.2 million forum threads to find out what is and isn't allowed? whereas if such a list of things that have officially and publicly been declared exploits is put somewhere easily findable, then if he has worries he can get a single, authoritative answer. it's not a perfect solution, but it'd be a great improvement."
12/8/2009,"the problem is in order to adequately explain what the exploit is, you have to provide enough information to be able to perform it. answer me honestly, how many people do you think will read that and go - ""huh. sounds interesting."" and then trot off to do it."
12/8/2009,"update: in the last few weeks, trillions of isk have been injected in to the economy by these players who are building ships for no other reason than to destruct them for insurance. this is over and above any losses from normal game play.this situation is urgent now."
12/8/2009,there's also the 'trash it' option.
12/8/2009,"i've been wondering about this for a while, actually. it'd be kind-of nice for a little contextual menu option to, basically, turn ""slaves"" items into ""freed slaves"" items or maybe turn the slaves in to some sort of agent and get ""freed slaves"" in return?"
12/8/2009,"yes, rp for the win. maybe make it a station service in soem matari and gallente stations."
12/8/2009,"there were these nice pos modules for converting slaves to freed slaves, or freed slaves to slaves. they were on sisi at some point. are they still coming in?"
12/8/2009,id like this. means i can get rid of the freeloaders :p
12/8/2009,"i've been looking for this for a long time. there are many options that this could allow, such as educating the slaves to have them become ships crew (if and when this is actually presented), or selling them for standing at regional outposts (in amarr space, we could sell the slaves to republic security service stations for minmatar faction standing, or sell the freed slaves to amarr stations in minmatar space).this would be nice, but npc corps would also like to participate. i think it should become a permanent option for slaves and freed slaves, without any module needed. i'd even pay to detox the vitoc poisoning, or the cost of the vitoc acclimation."
12/8/2009,only supported if an option is added that allows one to reprocess the slaves into valuable biomass.
12/8/2009,"give us a blueprint that takes slaves as input and name it ""republic citizen"" and we put them on a production process and get minmatar citizen by that. how hard can that be?thank you."
12/8/2009,support biomass secondary option as well
12/8/2009,"i chuck them out the airlock.hey, they're technically free at that point right?"
12/8/2009,supported
12/8/2009,"this is one of the features promised to the rp community ages ago.. then fw came and nothing happened.anyway, supported"
12/8/2009,support! free the slaves!
12/8/2009,"i play a slaver, and even i support this."
12/8/2009,only if we also have the option to turnfreed slavestouristsfreedom fightersjanitorsetc.into real slaves once again.
12/8/2009,free my family !!!support
12/8/2009,free the slaves!!! free the slaves!!!~mac
12/8/2009,both idea have a ton of merit.rp players should be able to make a difference as well.mike
12/8/2009,just trash them and rationalise it as removing their slave status. you're just getting them out of your hangar and releasing them into the general population. you don't need a new database item to do that.
12/8/2009,"i have personally always thought it a stupid implementation that when you attacked a plex, your faction npcs never bothered to come and help. defensive plexes would be made much harder if while trying to despawn it with you stabbed atron you had to deal with hostile npcs.and i also think there needs to be created a space where alliances can be made to join fw. cva and uk would really appreciate it. it would allow for corps in the same team to better sync wardecs, red and blue lists and the use of staging poses. and unfortunately for star fraction, no more abusing dec mechanics. you dec corp a in the gallente militia, you are kos for all the federation navy (in highsec!) and all the corps in the gallente militia. the creation of a meta alliance for fw purposes only would suffice.also evanda char:brilliantly put!"
12/8/2009,everything eva said.
12/8/2009,oh hell yes. supported.
12/8/2009,supported.
12/8/2009,"a) this is brilliantb) i definitely support fixing fw, especially if it includes allowing alliances to join."
12/8/2009,"nullsec, wormholes etc are all nice but for some of us faction warfare, even in its broken incarnation, is what keeps us in this game."
12/8/2009,supported.stop the madness.
12/8/2009,supported
12/8/2009,good to hear - let's hope ccp will listen this time.very much supported.
12/8/2009,"evanda is my new hero.also, supported."
12/8/2009,supported.
12/8/2009,"it's impressive how many bugs there are in fw that never got solved.i guess everyone already forgot about the ""contested status does not show in the top-left corner of the screen"" bug, because it's with us ever since fw got released, and never got fixed."
12/8/2009,"i was talking about this with some of my corp mates, i guess that the eve social site that is in the works will solve some of the information flow problems. but being able to build and deploy billboards for example would be better for role playing then having cans floating around with messages on them."
12/8/2009,"support the 'ticker tape' news summary, which could surely be automated from the stats that the in-game map & new 'eve facebook' app will collect. rentable advertising space sounds good too.i think that these techniques would improve user immersion."
12/8/2009,20% to damage/function or speed ( but not both )overheated mods only get one bonus for overheating not 2.plus the most important thing you forgot.drones do structure damage to themsleves while overheated until they splode in about 20 seconds.but yeah drones should be overheatable.
12/8/2009,and again
12/8/2009,"cool, you might want to check this out if you have missed it.."
12/8/2009,"the blame game is all we have at this point until ccp decides to stand up and do something about it. all long as corps like pie continue to support this actions by rping around them then yes they are part of the blame. we also ""do"" know what would have happened if it were not used. they never would have captured the systems they got so fast. proof is in the pudding in the fact they couldn't do it before this game breaking exploit was used."
12/8/2009,"who can we contact of the dev team so they give a response about this? i don't like much the idea of waiting and see what happens, because it might just not."
12/8/2009,"you're not supposed to swamp the devs with stuff. i've already forwarded as much relevant info to the relevant people as i could. if there are details you think they should know, you can of course mail it to me."
12/8/2009,"anger, tears and frustration is what i hear from the minmatar and is what amarr has been dealing with for well over a year.you wonder why the amarr vs minmatar front has been stagnant well here it is i have been in the fw for 1 <U+FFFD> years i have seen the good times and the bad times i have seen our systems fall and reclaimed.our systems had fallen with speed due to loop holes and crushing numbers from the minmatar, for those that remember outbreak, rkk, dark and despite amarr complaining about fw mechanics we did what needed to be done and worked hard to reclaim them.these loop holes that you talk about are the same loop holes that the minmatar have been using for well over a year. the standing bug is in essence the same as a t1 frigate speed tanking all amarr plexes, there is no risk.your generals were even paid isk incentives by neutral supporters to plex, not asking how the vp were taken not caring if they were taken using loop holes but paid non the less.amarr corporations invested months of time and isk to set up staging areas to assault your systems getting them close to falling only to have your tribals use loop holes to destroy months work in a matter of a day with loop holes. to move plexes from uncontested systems to a contested system is a valid tactic but to cap 10 of them using 1 ship using the timer bug in a 20 min period is a loop hole. in desperate times during war you did what needed to be done. we complained but still went on fighting.the same moral high ground that you ask amarr to take and the majority have is the sword that has stagnated this war. while using these loop holes you laughed at our morals and corporations, but now, you stand there asking once again, praising those corporations like 1pg the same ones you laughed at.do not presume to stand the moral high ground on what is happening to your systems. when it is your own doing that has caused the harshest response, tactics that you have been using that has now turned against you.for the first time in the war you systems are falling and you are now on the back foot just like amarr has been, how will you respond?as stated by many in the minmatar and neutral supporters you need to do what amarr did and fight and drive off the invaders. i do not believe minmatar will just give up.i expect this post will not sit well and only inflame your anger but needed to be said. and i hope that now that all this is out that some good will now come for fw."
12/8/2009,supported of course.
12/8/2009,"crushing numbers is not a loop hole nor is it an exploit. speed tanking is also ""not"" a exploit as you amarr continually whine about it. speed tanking dps is in fact one of minmatar ships active tanking systems. our shields are not strong like caldri's and our armor is not strong like amarr ships. we have a mix of both and added ability to negate damage by speed tanking.this is not a exploit, just like having a caldri or amarr ship sit there and tank the dps is not an exploit. the best part about this, is i see amarr doing speed tanking in plexes all the time. yet where are you to complain about that?you are your amarrios are just riding on the coat tails of the caldari and exploiting your way to system capture that you would have never gotten any other way."
12/8/2009,"if the caldari had come in and used vigils to speed tank the plexes with poorly skilled alts instead of standing tanking the plexes, would it have been ok?because *if* it would be possible to speed tank matari plexes so easily, the outcome would have been the same. however, unlike most amarr plexes, you cannot speed tank matari plexes with poorly skilled alts.the problem with the plexing mechanic is that the most efficient way to do it is have an alt semi-afk capture it. timers are stupid, being able to capture without fighting is stupid, plexing favoring doing it when no hostiles are nearby is stupid.the system is poorly designed, period."
12/8/2009,"you greatly overestimate the famed solo-plexing vigil. :-) e.g. it can't really do minors solo (takes ages), you can't really be afk (sometimes it doesn't work), etc.you also underestimate the ability of a crusader to solo capture minmatar complexes. i have seen them do it. it works. (no, i do not claim that it's ""just as easy"". no, i do not claim that it's ok as it is.)neither is comparable to just put your alt there and sit afk. you can ab to some of them for 70km and blow them up, only to get the first reaction a minute later. they aren't watching the screen for most part. that is why they can plex with around 8 alts at once (one has to admire the dedication, though).besides, all it takes are two ships instead of one to tank any plex. not that much more difficult. why hasn't it been done before?this whole ""look, even without this bug, we would have won now"" is highly annoying and nothing but trying to avoid the sour taste of this victory. you can not have both i'm afraid.had pervs decided to go to amarr space, amarr would have lost just as fast, just as much, just as unreasonably - not because losing systems is bad, but because this game mechanic is borked.this.and this.let's stop talking around it."
12/8/2009,"also, this thread started before any system in metropolis fell, as an attempt to raise all npc-related issues to the csm. including the different power levels of the npcs, as you can see in the first post.the power levels are being addressed. hopefully, the rest is as well."
12/8/2009,"using standing to avoid agro is not exploit either. it is working as intended. so claiming that caldari exploit is not true, caldari has never exploited and will not exploit. so i am asking you to stop these false accusations.truth is that minmatar uses same tricks every day in caldari front, smaller scale though. you should just find out what your own people does before you start to shout about exploiters and such."
12/8/2009,"this was used by caldari on gallete complexes quite often, maybe not by alts but by mains.in fact it would be easier to us. we have right standing on our mains so no need for alts.but with our standing we cant join gallente side and i am sure there is no one existing gallente corp who would take pervs in their corp and gallente is so full of losers that why would we do it for them? amarr has been our supporter on tough moments.and minmatar criminals hoarders all the time in caldari space raping our women and eating our children so we want to stop that now."
12/8/2009,"supported, bad game designs need to go.pity about the whining and finger-pointing though. it's not a bug. it's working as intended. so: game mechanics need to be improved."
12/8/2009,"yep. like all ""clever uses of game mechanics"" - they have been used before. what makes this different from all the other cases is that you pervs put a lot more dedication and time into it than anyone else has so far.which brings out all the bad parts of the game design: the game mechanics mean that the most effective way to ""capture"" systems in fw is to semi-afk plexes on a large scale, something you do while your (player) attention is somewhere else.the simple fact on the amarr/minmatar front is that both sides had trouble getting ""sufficient plexing"" done, and the defensive plexing was barely enough to keep up with single dedicated attempts (ab-c in metropolis, arzad in amarr space) before either side just gave up because of the silliness of plexing.both sides have had their rationalization for their lack of success. minmatar have the ""well, can't keep a system without post-dt superiority"", amarr have the ""well, what do you do against the uber-vigil-of-doom"" - both problems real, but workable with.both sides get frustrated with the silly mechanics. both sides use outright exploits (such as bugging timers - it was awesome to close a plex in an empty system while five others around me closed for the enemy). so far, both sides did this apparently in roughly the same amount, as neither side managed to skew it in their favor.what broke this delicate balance of ""can't be arsed to do more"" was a group of people who put in a lot of time and dedication into plexing. this was helped by using a silly game mechanic (and can't blame them for it) which demotivated and demoralized the defenders even more.it's sufficiently proven that fw is completely and utterly broken. the mechanics encourage a game style that can not be what ccp intended with the game, and even those silly game mechanics have so many bugs it's not funny anymore.now, please stop blaming each other for being ""bad players"". it's a game. let's get the game designer to fix it, and not bite each other for playing the game the best way we can."
12/8/2009,it is an exploit but it was rarely used intentional from either minmatar or amarr side during the war. until now. fact was that if you were running a timer and forced to jump out of the plex the timer sometimes kept running. we tested the issue and found no way to force it to happen. maybe some have found a way. this bug is ugly and needs to be fixed but i personally never accused the amarr working with it. and even now with those mindless caldaridrones exploiting the mechanic i am not sure that they use it intentionally. but of cause it might be the case. on the other hand the s-pervs won't need each 6 alts to sit on the buttons if they would. so this is an ennoying bug but i don't know anyone that is using it intentionally. funny that we found a lot of running timers in amarr space when looking for offensive plexes. but i don't turn that against amarr plexers for i know that that ****ty timers sometimes are keeping running when you have to warp out. but has to be fixed. urgently. how difficult can that be?! if(not entity in grid) {timer(stop);} have i do to have to write the damn code to show how it is fixed?!
12/8/2009,supported
12/8/2009,"you can not speedtank amarr plexes with poorly skilled characters or vigils either. i am the one who originally designed the plex-vigil for minmatar. and i know the limits of this vessel best. you need damn good skills for that you can't do it afk, you have to correct your fight path by hand and even then it can happen that you have to warp out the last minutes without ever be able to close that damn thing. it's something that can't be done afk. au contraire mon ami. you need a lot of skill as a player and you got to be sharp every second. it's something that can't be done with 6 alts at a time.it's something that can be done in matari plexes with punishers and crusaders too. i've seen it.so. let's drop that. what is true is that the npc are bad balanced, worst case are the caldari npc which are insane. the design is poor. but don't blame the vigil for all this. the vigil is a good vessel. but it has strong weaknesses too. and those who use it are not those who know the mechanism of speedtanking best. believe me. i know them well and i know their damn limits. and i don't use the vigil for it is not the reason i'm out there. i use the rifter instead. as the amarr prefer the punisher for that.i don't think every npc should be the same. there *should* be some racial differences. but the npc at the moment are insanely unbalanced. i don't think the amarr/minmatar are too much but the gallente/caldari are laughable unbalanced. but by the way, ccp should work on all. before you can speedtank an amarr plex you are almost on the level of flying interceptors. i tried it as a lowskilled pilot and only achieved it a week before i was ready for ceptors. which is a skilltime about - how long? five months?you can do l4 missions in a ceptor. i do when i want to have some fun. why should an enemy plex be harder like that? no. i don't think so. and the chaff about speedtanking is just a minor point that has to be fixed. the most urgent point is a fast fix of this standing issue. and after that an overhaul of the whole fw.because this breaks the game. it breaks the roleplay. it makes the whole conflict minmatar/amarr a farce. and i take the exploit of this mechanism personal. indeed. that's just griefing. i'm not in the age to really enrage myself about this. for it's a kids way to play a game. you don't go and beat up little children that do not know better. but i stopped to take them serious. for me everybody that is joining this stupid exploid is voiding his position for me to take anything he does or says serious. more serious than the talk of a child.and this is something i regret. i was thinking better of the majority of amarr playerbase than to fall for such cheap tricks and even support these caldari griefers in destroying the whole factional warfare. be serious: ""we do it to make ccp listen."" do you believe this?i don't think you do, for even now i have left a rest of respect for your intelligence. it's just childish play of kids that try to grief. nothing more. and what we minmatar do at the moment is go and spank their alts where we catch them, have some fun doing this and ignore their follies. we don't plex. i don't plex anymore. sasawong doesn't and most of the other. some remain in the fight. yes. and i honour this. it's just i can't. i don't play games on childish behaviour and let me dictacte rules. if you would play a game of chess with me and you leave the room for a minute you can be safe that i didn't touched the pieces to ""win"" the game. because only a unmature child would do this."
12/8/2009,i did some testing before operation and managed to speedtank amarr major plex with 60k sp alt in executioner. i do not say that you can tank all plexes with low sp alt but some of those yes.
12/8/2009,"i can totally believe that - the larger plexes are easier to speed-tank than the smaller ones because often, they don't spawn smaller ships at all. even the missiles from the minmatar npc bs do very little damage if you are moving fast.the idea of spawning frigates in larger plexes has been brought up very early in fw, and was put down because according to ccp, npcs are only meant to serve as a distraction in case no players show up.which is quite silly considering the vast differences in npc power levels and ewar strengths (amarr tds are pretty bad for pvp, btw, just not as easy to notice as ecm).luckily, as z0d pointed out, this is being addressed by the csm already (see first post). let's hope the rest is, too."
12/8/2009,good job guys!pervs are getting attention on stupid plex mechanics and others delivering this attention to ccp. hopefully we are moving towards a factional warfare upgrade. removal of fw missions and lp rewards for plexing! fights in plexes! heroic fights to death to save planets and stations from being occupied! massive front line warfare!keep on it!!!
12/8/2009,wouldnt the best all round solution be so that you have to destroy all the npc's to capture a plex?always seemed a bit daft that you are able to capture a beacon whilst there are still god knows how many people (npc's) protecting it.
12/8/2009,"agreed, but knowing ccp they'd do that and leave gallente rats as they are and squids would take them all over again"
12/8/2009,"i support this in general, but honestly have grown to not care about how the pervs are achieving what they are achieving. the real reason so many of us in the minmatar militia are unhappy about the situation is because at the rate the caldari/amarr are tearing through our systems we will not realistically be able to undo the damage because of the far more hateful downtime plex respawn mechanics and their consequences throughout the rest of the day.a number of minmatar militia corps recently hatched a plan to take as much amarr territory as possible, but when we captured arzad we found that every day after downtime plexes would spawn there and be captured by the amarr in short order. no more plexes would spawn until the following downtime. most of the minmatar active plexers aren't around at that time of day and we can't raise much of a fleet so we were completely unable to prevent the system being slowly, but surely, recaptured. needless to say this broke the morale of many otherwise dedicated plexers. what's the point capturing systems when it can be so easily undone with us powerless to prevent it ? long ago ccp indicated they wanted to remove gameplay mechanics tied to downtime. their apparent failure to address this in fw has now killed a large part of fw.now the caldari take our systems and that same downtime mechanic will prevent us reclaiming those systems when the caldari return home, assuming the amarr defend their new systems in their usual manner.by breaking the delicate balance of minmatar/amarr system occupancy in such dramatic fashion the pervs have rendered that gameplay mechanic null and void. i suspect ccp lack the resources to fix the downtime respawn problem so perhaps they could try something else.i personally have no problem with system occupancy meaning nothing but which side's name appears in the top left-hand corner of my eve client when i pass though the system. it's enough for me to know my team is doing well. i don't expect the isk hose to be fired upon me as a reward every time i cap a plex.i have always felt that the main point of the system occupancy mechanic in fw should be to encourage fleets to move around a bit and not hang around the same few systems. the way things are heading at the moment we might as well only have 2 systems in fw and each side can just spend all day sitting on either side of the connecting gate.i'd like to see it possible for a fleet of say 30-40 pilots be able to fully capture a few systems within say a 3-4 hour period. the current system takes far too long and makes it hard for casual fw participants to feel connected to what is going on. if you can join a fleet and capture a system within your time served in that fleet you're going to start to care more. it's a mechanic that works in popular fps style games and with a little imagination it can work in eve too.the current long drawn out, morale sapping grind of plexing in fw seems entirely contrary to what i thought ccp were aiming for when they launched fw. something fast paced and casual that people can dip into and out of with ease, having a good time for whatever amount of time they spent involved.please take the grind out of fw ccp, and if you have to completely remove the isk hose (i never liked fw missions anyway) to keep the exploiters out then so be it.if people want to be bored out of their mind on a daily basis they have 0.0 to grind in. let us have some fun in fw! please!"
12/8/2009,"ideally you should have to kill all the defending npcs to take the beacon. that said i agree this is just one of several poor game mechanics (along with the vigil issue and inexperienced alts).looking at that though i see another very similar problem that directly parallels this one. currently a non-militia corp can wardec a militia corp and fire on them without worry of the other militia corps helping the target. the reason? standings. the non-targeted militia corps would take a negative standings hit to defend the militia-mate. so what we have then is a situation where a gank-squad can cherry pick a couple to targets in a big militia fleet without being exposed to fire. this is no different from the current issue of allies not taking a standings hit and drawing fire its just ""reversed"".i would support a fix to this issue only if at the same time ccp fixes it so a wardec on a militia corp makes one a target to that corps entire militia. its common sense after all.archie"
12/8/2009,"true enough. but your experiences are from before the dirt cheap rigs came into being .. those damn things changed the small ship game immensely.vigils are hardly used any more though, they have been replaced with em/therm rigged extended rifters .. ab around with impunity in any and all amarr plexes with added offensive capability funny. i have been petitioning people with irrefutable screenshots as evidence, even a chat log admitting guilt at one point and the pilots are still at large.then again, there are gms that have to ask what a plex is, what the bug is and everything in between .. unless the statement came from a veteran/senior gm or a producer/designer i would regard it as nonsense.that is why a major overhaul is needed. there are so many flaws in the basic mechanics that even ccps emploees can't keep up with the bug reports"
12/8/2009,"they get a nice mail from a gm saying ""hi, you are using exploits. this is a warning, stop it, or you will get harsh consequences"" - they need to repeat offenses to actually get banned or anything.and the person petitioning always gets the same standard message: ""thanks, we're looking into it"". ccp does not tell you what they're doing."

12/8/2009,"tbh ccp mixing pve with pvp is the big issue here. it shouldnt have even been put into practice i think ccp should remove the pve side of things and concentrate on more pvp i,e the more ships u kill in certain systems gives u the right to take that system. it would encourage much more on the pvp front and fill faction war with pvpers i do agree on the mission side as the rewards are good for the faction ships just a thought"
12/8/2009,"i present to you exhibit a: a few days after the perv/damar alt army leaves for minmatar space and captures 6 systems in a day, the gallente capture a system back.you guys can keep them :)"
12/8/2009,"i support this idea. certainly, the whole idea of plexing without combat is against the spirit of fw itself.by the way, the argument of exposing bugs by exploiting them as often as possible sounds a little too close to the argument some people use when they design viruses to infect computers. ""we were only exposing security issues and bugs in the operating systems"" is not a defence that sits well with the people who suffer from the viruses, and it wouldn't work in court. if you know it is a problem, then highlight the issue like everyone else.i know people on all sides use shady tactics at times, but the argument of ""they do it, so i will too"" just sounds petulant and childish. and don't label an entire militia by the actions of one person, or a small percentage. we're all individuals bound into a collective. the collective does not make us who we are."

12/8/2009,yes
12/8/2009,i run mining ops in all spaces of eve high low and null ( when i can sneak in somewhere ) and i tell you the latter two are anything but dull. from the rats in battle ships to those players that love to gank barges there is always something to keep you on your toes. plus mining in low or null sec requires alot of player interaction. ie a combat fitted squad for defense haulers to carry ore from the belt to a collection area and then the miners themselves. in addtion you need a scout thats cloaked when your mining in 0.0 in space thats not yours. providence is the only acception to this if your a amarr lover. so i can't support your idea when all you need to do is get out of empire space and take the risk. this is eve risk = reward.
12/8/2009,"i support this. ccp claims that mining is a full-fledged profession, akin to trade, exploration, or pvp, but everyone in this thread is claiming some variation of ""i have my alt do it while i watch tv."" until we turn mining into an engaging activity, it will never rise above that.turning mining into a mini-game akin to puzzle pirates or something would go along way towards making mining an attractive profession."
12/8/2009,"that would be a good idea, if eve were puzzle pirates. if you want to play puzzles so much, open your in game browser and play bejeweled while you mine. the players above and myself would rather just play eve.no change necessary."
12/8/2009,"i wholly support a change to the docking games, but your solution has a serious flaw.imagine if you will, a non-combatant ship (miner trader etc) arrives at, or tries to leave a station, only to find themselves in the middle of a camp. of course, the station represents safety, so they immediately attempt to dock.if you are flying to a station, you are pretty right. you should be able to dock straight away.if, however, you are leaving the station, then you have a 30 second session timer that you must wait out before you can re-dock.what do you do during that 30 seconds?under your proposal, nothing, just do what you can to dock and hope that you survive. (assuming that you are scrammed and cant just warp away anyway)the problem with your proposal is that you are not permitted to defend yourself.obviously, a mining or trading ship or even a smaller combat vessel will not be able to dent you, so within 30 seconds, it can't kill you before you kill it.what it can do is simply try to survive. this will quite likely include aggressive tactics such as ecm, sensor jamming, or taking out any drones that you use. anything that drops your dps by even a point might just be the difference between surviving the 30 second timer or not.what you are proposing is that ships that undock are not permitted to defend themselves in anyway other than all out combat - which is not what many ships are designed for. you may as well be shooting fish in a barrel.i support a change to docking tactics, as i see it as a huge problem for dominion - you are right on that point.i cannot, however, support your proposal as is."
12/8/2009,"would be alot easier to add a docking timer that scaled upwards in relation to ship size or ship type. (think someone else said this too)this firstly changes nothing about the gate games, which are fine imo.for combat purposes, if you've engaged you have not only your docking timer but also the additional agro timer to take into account. if you have not engaged, you mearly have your docking timer to worry about.it relates to the fluff of eve, as larger ships take more time to manouver and more time to park.players undocking only to re-dock once shot are never really going to stay undocked, so with the above rules, they would either stay docked or un-dock and take the risks. none of this, in-out-in-out, whack-a-mole type gameplay.the only problem i can see initionally is the innocent industrials and the like that get ****d after warping to a station, but then again, people would argue if your putting an industrial in that situation then its your own fault.i personally feel its better than a purely aggression based timer, and keeps, if not improves tactical options.although there are bound to be holes galore in there but meh - if you find them, fill um."

12/8/2009,"lol not really dude, i'm not the one crying because i'm scared to take my ship out of dry dock !what ccp have done makes a great deal of sense when taken in context of game balance in general.a mom in a proper alliance fleet while it may get instad by 3 titans will be revenged by the destruction of titans if those titans arnt themselves properly supported by there own fleets.moms were never meant to be used for minimully supported lowsec/nullsec gatecamp invulneramobiles.a use for which they have been used and abused for years now, its that usage that has really been nerfbatted to hell and back by the mere possibility that they themselves may end up being pwned.moms used without support were allways vulnerable to dread/carrier hot drops , so really what has changed?maybe moms should be made insurable if docked up in outposts ? is that possible ?then they can be used by 00 alliances with limited risk.low sec players who dont have access to outposts are of course screwed.but then again it was ccp's original intent that these ships be used by 00 alliances in cap fleet warfare and not as ultimate gatecamp mobiles.i think the cap changes are cool and the cruelness of the eve universe has reached new levels.epic battles lie ahead , and the spoils will go to those alliances that have big enough cohonees to bring moms and titans to the field instead of mere carriers and dreads.let there be no glass ceiling to the risks we can take in this game.mom vulnerability is a good thing , death and destruction on epic scale is what makes eve the best game in the universe.if the kitchen is too hot for you these days then hello kitty online is this way.or sell the mom to someone who has the balls to use it and fly carriers instead , problem solved."

12/8/2009,"this issue was brought to my attention by a concerned citizen during the campaign phase of the csm elections and it seemed so obvious that i couldnt do anything but promise that i would bring it up. this is a recap from an old thead by that person in order to poll support at this time.since the introduction of tech-2 sentry drones there has been a major inconsistency in eves drone line-up: they are the only tech-2 drones that do not require the race-specific drone specialization skill. a few very easy solutions:1) make the racial specialization skills affect t2 sentries, giving them at best 10% better dps than they have now.2) make the racial specialization skill affect t2 sentries, but reduce base damage a little so they don't come out much more powerful than they are now.3) give the racial specialization skill some sort of other bonus for sentry drones  tracking or range or something, leaving base dps the same but improving effective dps versus faraway or moving targets.- sok."

12/8/2009,sentry drone interfacing takes forever to rain and its more than fair.don't fix what ain't broke.
12/8/2009,"this isn't strictly true. neither t2 logistics drones nor t2 mining drones need any racial drone spec skills.i am against this because the different sentry drones work in a different way to regular combat drones. normally the choice between different flavours of combat drone gets you a different damage type whereas sentries give markedly different range and tracking profiles. thus in some cases you might want to deploy wardens for sniping and then switch to gardes for close in work. while it's vanishingly unlikely that anyone who can use t2 sentries won't have at least one racial drone skill at iv, it's harsh to expect drone users to train all of them just to be able to have some kind of tactical flexibility."
12/8/2009,"i am a drone user, and i do support this.i, however, do not think that sentries should get their damage nerfed. why:t1 sentries out damage t1 heafvy drones. by a tiny margin, but they do. that is a compensation they get for inability to more. t2 sentries currently deal less damage then t2 heavy drones when used by a well skilled pilot. imao that needs changing, and sentury drones should apply racial skills, in exchange for higher training time.it takes just as long as heavy drone operation."

12/8/2009,"another logosfski thread, another bunch of supports, perhaps ccp will do something about itmany workable ways have been suggested. the simplest was to keep the ""warp back in spot"" the same no matter how many times you log. i.e you cannot log rapidly 10 times in a row to create a safe spot off the gate.the target will still survive (protecting the 98% of cheaters as well as the 2% of genuine disconects) but he cannot log back in until the gate camp decides to stop (meaning the genuine disconects will log back in and fight and the cheater will have a penalty for cheating (no more eve for you tonight timmy))its not perfect, it still puts the benefit of the doubt in favour of the cheater, but at least there is some punishment for cheating.ccp are ""looking at"" implementing this though they complained it was ""hard"" to programme. one wonders why they became computer programmers if they didnt want to programme.its also ""hard"" to serve customers at walmart for 10 hours a day but thats kind of the job of a shop assistant and what he gets paid for.skunk"
12/8/2009,"actually what happened is they logged off after jumping through and before decloaking... they decloaked to emergency warp, but since you did not aggress them while they were still online they don't get the fifteen minute aggro timer. if you had aggressed them while they were still online, they would be stuck. still, support making it impossible for ships to disappear from space once they are pointed."
12/8/2009,"so, what happens when i jump in, ready to engage someone, and my client crashes, then i die to a client crash when i would have killed you due to superior fit/skills/tactics?"
12/8/2009,agreed. this is problematic for the exact reasons the op mentioned. getting attacked should give an aggro timer regardless of whether or not the person is logged in.
12/8/2009,i've seen many kills disappear from under my nose cause of this.
12/8/2009,how about filing a bugreport first and get a response?
12/8/2009,agree..!
12/8/2009,"as a matter of fact it is quite the contrary. ccp's goal is to make eve unplayable unless you are in a *team* with other people where everybody fill specific *roles* that have been pre-defined by ccp. with no overlaps possible as per (ship) design. of course this aim of ccp's has nothing to do with emergence or the sandbox which have become marketing bull**** weasel words. ccp cares about revenue and are optimising their product to provide the largest possible base of player accounts.so, basically, those times are over where a couple of well skilled guys can get into their expensive t2 ships and go out roaming or wreaking havoc on some gate. in your case the ""damage dealer"" role was not filled. a hic (tackling) and a cs (command/team bonus) is not enough against a bs - you need moar people.only news is that now you don't get to capitalize on a logoffski anymore, if the victim had no intention of aggression. fair enough, tbh. as it is low-sec, and if we are to take the game background story seriously, you are not ""allowed"" to kill people there. so no reason for a game mechanic (that deals with loss of connection and not gate camps) to indirectly support the kill. relates to the discussion about timers and docking games, obviously.htfu pirate whiners! you must become *team* builders before you can kill..."
12/8/2009,this so very much
12/8/2009,"well at least we know who the carebears are. and for the contrary low sec pirating is a mechanic to the game otherwise concord would kill you like in high sec. just because ccp tailors to the wimpy no balls carebears does not make it a fair game anymore in my opinion it is turning into wow and soon you won't have any loss at all and then maybe your ship can do a little dance too.. so ccp stop tailoring to the new gay a$$ newbs who don't belong in 0.0. it took me my first year to get there when i started to get the skills to do something now you can be a day old and do ridiculous things. be a little more rewarding to your long time subscription holders than new accts, your giving them way too much to start off with and we had to start from nothing.if it moves shoot it!!!!! pansy carebear blobbers"
12/8/2009,had both a freighter and an orca log off jumping gates and both times the targets were scrambled and aggressed...both times they disappeared and in one case a friendly vaga was popped by guns...(was against a red target not random piracy in low sec system that borders 0.0)..gm's said it was legit mechanic..however..not sure it's right that a ship can be popped for aggressing a target that isn't really there..bottom line..ccp need to fix this so that any ship that is aggressed before it disappears from game through logging...gets the 15 minute aggro timer..
12/8/2009,yo
12/8/2009,like goring cheating the hangman.
12/8/2009,i agree
12/8/2009,this
12/8/2009,"in that case its like its always been, its your fault and not ccps and you don't get your ship back. if its ccps fault you get it reimbursed."
12/8/2009,"i have a hard time believing ccp doesn't know when ctrl-q gets hit - it's way too trivial to send a message on ctrl-q that would let the server know that it was an intentional quit.the real problem is a faked network failure by disconnecting in other ways (killing eve client from task manager, pulling network cable, switch off router, etc...). that kind of thing can't be distinguished from a real network problem.getting the balance right between punishing those lamers who just log off when in trouble and players with real network issues who would rightfully be annoyedby reconnecting to a clone in station without havhing any chance to do a thing is just not easy."
12/8/2009,"their simply has to be some sort of balance between the two. game should not become impossible for people whose isp is a f**ing b**ch and gives them unstable connection or has ""technical problems"" or ""maintenance issues"" every other day. sometimes, that happens. and sometimes, you do not have any better isp in the are to switch to, because odds are if they had one, they already would."
12/8/2009,"i think the difficulty is ccp is trying to fix multiple possible problems with one ""solution"". several different experiences i've had regarding this:1. recently had three ravens with names like ""123y243"" jump into a t2 l bubble, put dps on one which died. meanwhile, interceptors put webs and scrams on the other two so they couldn't get back to gate or get out of the bubble. shortly after the first raven popped, the other two were no where to be seen.2. in a big fleet. fc gives the order to jump the gate and hold cloak. everyone jumps. cloak is held, when it times out, we begin to engage. at this point, a lot of people in the fleet start saying ""still have a black screen/loading screen"". so, our fleet was smaller than anticipated as well as having a chunk of ships immobile, uncloaked, and uncontrolled. some did actually autowarp out. some died without ever seeing the fight. i died horribly, but not because of connection/loading problems.3. camping. freighter/frigate combo spotted inbound. frigate jumps. frigate decloaks and goes boom. freighter pulls a jump-ctrl-q. we are furious. vow on the blood of unborn children to kill him. we see him in local again for a few seconds before disappearing - doing the login/logoff stepping thing to get a safespot login. scan him down, but his disappears before anything meaningful can be put on him. rinse repeat. rinse repeat. we take shifts in tacklers at the last logout spot for a few hours. just before downtime, he's back but we can't get dps on him fast enough before the server shuts down. after start up, the vigilant finally get him (unfortunately, it was way too late for me and i had gone to bed after the server shutdown).4. enter cva space with a 20 man gang. scout jumps to next system... into a 100+ blood thirsty defense fleet. we warp to a planet and send a second scout to the other gate... big ugly fleet sitting there as well. we log, thus avoiding what assuredly would have been a very bad end to a roam.these are the ""game mechanics"". for 1,3,4 there should have been more blood. because of situations like 2, a ""solution"" that allows 1,3,4 to happen exists. the solution sucks in all 4 cases. whether it is op's solution, previous ccp iterations, or the current solution - it sucks."
12/8/2009,"because commenting and talking about kills is one of the biggest things in eve.let us instead of getting a single killmail, see all the casualties in the entire engagement, all damage done even if it did not lead to ship loss (e.g. i was fighting a abaddon in mega, i got it to 10% hull, that will be visible on the kill-mail)we should be able to see logistics ships involved separately, e-war separately, have a comment section underneath where people can emo-rage. we would be able to see not just one weapon used, but all the array of weaponry and e-war. a bar ""aided by"" and ""disturbed by"" (anyone can come up with better name) for e-war and logistics accordingly, even if they did not damage. kills by npc's will not be included unless stated otherwise in user preferences. their should be option to hide the kill-mail if all parties involved agree to do that. their should be corporate, alliance and group killboards that are simply produced by filtering from the mail global killboard. global, corporational and simply group ranking should be possible. (e.g. i create a group ""slaughter all pirates, yarr, invite 4 friends all from different corps, and we have a group killboard that is shown by filtering only kill-mails related to us. combat log should also include engagements that did not lead to fatalities. so, damage dealt by parties to each-other, and recond of who fled the field. it would also let us see latest casualties in the region, system, filter by the area where kills occurred, ship type, parties involved, etc. also make it possible to make killboards for a particular campaign, say war between two corporations, everyone will be able see how it is going. sure it is a lot of work, but pvp is the most important aspect of eve, and having proper records of it is very important, and would be rather encouraging if you epic kill of a afk carrier pilot in a noobship can be seen by the entire univerce, and you would have the pilot raging out on comment section and carebare tears spilt."
12/8/2009,i don't think running a killboard should be ccp's job.
12/8/2009,this. there are plenty of killboards floating around. use one of them.
12/8/2009,nope... not supported.
12/8/2009,"i think logi and ewar ships need killboard loving. i think the idea of having a tally of total damage done and total damage soaked would be incredibly nice. at the very least, it would identify the killboard *****s who get on 10 kills with a total of 0 damage done in the entire engagement for all to mock. it will also serve to provide a thumbs up for logi pilots who keep a primaried ship alive through several minutes of concentrated enemy fire. the way killmails are currently designed, it promotes glass cannons over all else. it would be nice to have something to promote/recognize the use of other ships.maybe not a ccp killboard, but at least some modification to and/or addition to the post-fight information provided would be nice."
12/8/2009,"ok, in such case let ccp rework the way combat log works so it incudes:logistics ships involved.e-war ships involved. yes, when you see a falkon in kilmail, you know it probably was e-war fitted, but in other cases it can be less obvious. istead of heaving 10 killmails for every kill, and having only guy recieveing the final blow recieve the killmail, everyone that was participating in engagement gets a combat log for all shipos destroyed, so even logistics guys get credit. record damage dealt by the victim even if it did not lead to other person's death, as i have stated above.make it all accesible though api and let third party killboards use it. would you support that?"
12/8/2009,deleted
12/8/2009,edit ... or this ^^^^
12/8/2009,"i'd like to see less intel, less kill-mail, less ""scoreboard"". not more. not supported."
12/8/2009,if there are going to be any kill boards why not have ccp do it. they have all the data already and that would mean we could finally stop having to post all the kill mails. ccp could have it done automatically.i totally support a ccp run killboard.
12/8/2009,"this, getting intel about fitting is already too easy. it shouldnt get easier."
12/8/2009,"1. eccm - omni ii and other samelike module do not offer any protection to caldari jamming npc in faction warfare complexes. aka, they don't work2. thes modules mentioned above do work against jamming npc in regular missions for hisec agents.3. sensor booster ii and related modules do counter the effects of gallente npc remote sensor dampening in gallente faction warfare complexes, as they also work against dampening npc in regular hisec missions.can the eccm modules please be made consistant in also working against caldari npc in faction warfare plexes to reflect the consistency of sensor boosters ii working against gallente npc in faction warfare plexes. currently, caldari has a way to counter npc's electronic warfare mods, but gallente don't which makes it kind of not fair and hugely imbalanced so to say.you can support this post by making a reply and selecting also the ""check here if you want to give your support to the idea/discussion going on"" checkbox"

12/8/2009,indeed.
12/8/2009,"much too complicated, eitherallow modifications one every 2 hours orcharge half the brokers fee on the entire order value, so lots of tiny changes becomes expensive"
12/8/2009,"make the brokers do the hard work they get a fee after all.advanced buy orders.enable entering of maximum price payable.quantity required.completion date required.tick box to leave order up at max price after completion date until order fills.range as now.the brokers job is then to modify the price on your buy order , up to maximum specified.the brokers aim is to get the quantity required by the completion date.of course technically there would probably need to be a new server that does the work of the broker.but at least this way the market would be less of a drag to use.and suspected market bot users would have zero advantage over players who play the game legitimately"
12/8/2009,"neither of which fix the issue. whoever lists their sale last wins in either of those systems, if your order is already up then you can't compete with people who list an order after you."
12/8/2009,make the npc starter and secondary channels joinable by everyone and anyone.would help encourage player interaction.
12/8/2009,"this has probably never been fixed because it's probably never mattered, but yes, a corp should always consider itself +10.0 standings."
12/8/2009,who are the standing towards while creating a standings fleet ?if there towards the fleet boss then all you need to do is set your ( the fleet boss ) personal standings towards your own corp to blue.
12/8/2009,"personally i'd rather see:drone interfacing bonus apply to all drones. (before a smartass says it: drone's role enh by 20%/level, not damage)sentry damage rig should be changed to apply to all combat drones."
12/8/2009,"it's not a pointless change but i'm sure it wont happen. the problem with dedicated drone ships, is they are the only ships in eve that can lose their fire power due having all their drones killed. no other ship class in eve can be stripped of it's weapon system before the ship is destroyed. drone ships have limited drone bays which means you can only carry so many spares and once you lose them you are a sitting duck. have 10 drones doing the same damage as the current 5 would allow you a bit more leeway and make it harder for others to leave you weaponless. not to mention as a pirate drone boats are pretty much usless in most gangs due to the fact sentries actively target your drones.one suggestion i had made in the past, was to allow your drone bay to be reloaded from the cargo bay. this way you could carry extra drones in your cargo bay to reload as you lose them."
12/8/2009,"so first they remove lag, and now you want them to bring it back? are you stupid or something?"
12/8/2009,"yes, fleet battles are laggy. protip: fleet battles use drones too. often a lot of drones. a big fight can easily feature north of a thousand drones on the field. do you really think it's a good idea to double that count in the single laggiest situation in eve? not supported."
12/8/2009,"no, should be 1 drone per ship, you want all drone damage on a singe target."
12/8/2009,"there is a considerable confusion concerning the pirate faction ships that are described as being of angel cartel design.currently there are 2 of each hull for angels: dramiel/daredevil, cynabal/vigilant, machariel/vindicator.obviously the vigilant and vindicator follow the serpentis designation and, unless i am mistaken, drop from serpentis rats. to my knowledge angels/serpentis are not allied factions?some adjustments should be made for the serpentis hulls to indicate that they are, indeed, serpentis design."
12/8/2009,"like... similar weapon systems? or ship hulls that look the same?dramiel, cynabal, macharieldaredevil, vigilant, vindicatorit's really not that hard."
12/8/2009,"the angel cartel and the serpentis are allied, of course.the guardian angels are a division of the cartel being responsible of defending serpentis stations."
12/8/2009,"yeah, a slight tweak to the descriptions could be useful - no reason the serp ships shouldn't say something like ""designed by the angels for the protection of serpentis installations..."". i actually got messed up by that the other day, was trying to remember which frig was which, saw they were both angel ships from the description, got slightly confused, then read the bonuses. a little more clarity on this topic would be good."
12/8/2009,"the ""special feature"" is the dual 90% webs. it's not as impressive as the godly bhaalgorn ew, but it's better than the rattlesnake gets. of course, a faction bs being better than a rattlesnake and worse than a bhaalgorn is sort of the default, but if i had to pick between nightmare/machariel/vindicator for the best of the three, i really don't know which i'd pick. i certainly wouldn't say that it's obviously worse than the other two."
12/8/2009,"the role of ""like a rig, but much more expensive and a little better"" seems well-filled by t2. might be cool, but i don't think it's actually a good idea."
12/8/2009,the orca fits the role your asking for. yes it is a mining ship and requires skill to get into. but it's also a very good cargo carrier. i use my orca for everything from mining to running ships and mods all over eve. i don't need another industrial type ship to train for when the ones that are in game are sufficent. idea not supported !

12/8/2009,"hello all,i know this idea has been posted during my term, and got pretty good player support but was shut down by my fellow delegates. for this reason, i am reposting it in the hopes that csm 4 is able to bring it to ccp.current ships in the game have little you can do to differentiate them from other ships. rigs gave us some way we could augment the ship to fit our play style, but still leaves a lot to be desired.after doing a lot of work looking at the throughput required when a ship loads into the screen, i believe a simple painting scheme would allow us to make the ships our own without bottlenecking the servers. some coding will need to be done to implement this, but it should be a relatively easy process.the first step is to give a checkbox in the escape menu to allow people to turn this feature off if they desire, as it could weigh down blob warfare even more than it has already. then, the ship models will have to be split up into two separate sections, and a colormap applied to each section as desired.this colormap will consist of a pallette of colors which allows only 12 bits to cover each of the two sections of a ship and allowing the servers to deliver the information to the respective client interfaces (using 4 bits per rgb color). each one of these sections could be colored the same or differently depending on the desires of the pilot, as listed below:color chartgiven the depth this simple change would allow, it would give a large amount of individuality to the ships, and a simple interface to 'repaint' the ships. there could even be a charge in the game for repainting a ship.future upgrades could allow for multiple color fields and/or textures, assuming the client lag wouldn't be too tremendous. i think this is a good way to implement the color schemes without lagging the user computers too much. with the checkbox available on the menu, it would give the users the option to turn it off in high-load environments (such as jita or blob warfare in 0.0)."
12/8/2009,noplease refer to my post in previous threads for reasons why
12/8/2009,with a new csm coming in i was hoping to kindly remind them of the following topics already brought up by previous csm groups: remote repair and agression:
12/8/2009,"i'm probably showing my noobishness here, but what does leadership 5 buy you, when you're flying as a squad member in a fleet with well trained squad, wing and fleet leaders?"
12/8/2009,oh this isnt meant to be some kinda joke thread. i was srs about the starcraft stuff and i was thinking make it alot of ranks maybe 30 ranks.
12/8/2009,"why are you all so negative? ccp are doing amazing thing there.. adding more things to the game will get you busy even when there is an op which is far away!! and much much more excited! you guys have been too much flying junk around, they will give you new faces too see, exotic dancers.. i am saying this:we should all backup ccp and tell them go ahead and release it!!"
12/8/2009,"so since there is a new csm meeting, i would like to get your attention to the dual screen issues. short: ship is spilt in half. solution: move the focus point of the view left/right. this issue stands already so long and sthe solution technically seems very simple.adjust camera center wiki - ah thread - f&i thread 1 - f&i thread 2 - f&i thread 3there are more threads, but i won't bother finding them all. f&i 3 is my own where i propose the solution a bit more indepth."
12/8/2009,"i read that thread on eve search, because the modhammer was dropping way too hard on the main thread, but i don't think it archived all that much extra. it was only about three pages longer, i think, whereas from the way people were talking, a lot more than 3 pages got deleted. people mentioned multiple times that serious, well-considered posts of theirs got deleted, not just ""free abathur! (angry little man)"" posts. i can't tell you whether they had legit posts got killed intentionally, killed accidentally, or whether they're just lying, but from the best archiving we have, i'd say that there was a serious problem with mod overreaction on that thread. also, surprised nobody has put the docking games fix thread on the agenda yet."
12/8/2009,1. this was already rejected by ccp.2. you should be very specific about the fact that heavy moderation creates apathy and starts a war ccp can't win.3. already raised.

12/9/2009,"it could actually reduce the load on the database not having to copy hundreds of bookmarks to an object, stick in a can and then load on another char..."
12/9/2009,"it also would breed consistency in bookmark labels, make it easier for lower sp / newer members of a corp to have access to well defined bookmarks without having to go out and make his or her own or have to go through the copying nightmare. overall better fleet organization that a centralised bookmark database for each corp would grant, as it continues to add new ones. finally, not needing to worry about preference folder issues and lost bookmarks."
12/9/2009,we wants the precious!something needs to be changed with the bookmarks. an other solution is to implement a way to convert a bookmark item into plain text and back into a bookmark. that way you could easily evemail bookmarks or post them on a corp forum or wherever you'd like.this shouldn't be difficult to implement and people can use already existing mechanisms to share bookmarks.

12/9/2009,i like this idea. it builds on an existing mechanic so how difficult could it be to implement? as for the second idea the type of passenger offered for enslavement could be related to the lp item gained.
12/9/2009,yes please.

12/9/2009,slaves have the unfortunate disadvantage of often being dependent on the anti-virus of vitoc. :/
12/9/2009,arrange a few bpo's1 x slaves + 1 x racial charter = homeless.maybe different racial charters create different groups.homeless + amarr charter = slavesslaves + caldari charter = mercenryetc.

12/9/2009,"quoting myself because i hate being right ;-)minmatar militia had two systems vulnerable today for 5 hours until the amarr could muster a fleet strong enough to kill the defense fleet and kill the bunkers. during those 5 hours, around 40ish plexes were capped. none spawned in either of the vulnerable systems.if that is not the intended use of the ""bunker mechanism"", what is it then?fix fw please. silly mechanics are silly."

12/9/2009,"exactly: give us something to rep up (like a pos out of reinforced) or at least something to do to turn the system back to contested. the way things are now, having system control in a vulnerable system doesn't help us at all, since we have to do stuff in the surrounding systems, and then cross our fingers."

12/9/2009,"making the captured teritory pay dividends would be a good idea i think.rp wise it can be explained as a tax put upon those peoples ( people living on planets , not players ) living in occupied teritory.every active player in faction militia that hasa) participated in a kill against a faction militia opponent in the last 7 daysandb) captured or defended a plex for the militia in the last 7 daysgets an isk reward from the faction they play for.the isk reward would be somewhere around 10,000 isk for every system held by the faction.the higher you faction rank the more isk you get."
12/9/2009,"lol. not sure if you are aware how long it took for ccp to fix sov mechanics or not. years. in all honesty, the sov mechanics just implemented in 0.0 are what you have had in fw for the last 6+ months (except they cost piles of isk and heavy pew pew rather than just some pew pew). they added a few things - probably stuff that will filter back to fw later (upgrading systems seem a logic thing to port). lag was more of a problem for mission running hubs and jita, where those lag fixes were focused (see how often jita is the benchmark).that said, i support fixes to fw - mostly because i would rather ccp test major changes on you guys, then port them to 0.0 after the major bugs are worked out than the other way around. however, i think the fw ""fixes"" should go hand-in-hand with the ""vegas"" concept for low sec. add the other factions into the fw mix in some form. have ""system control"" (or whatever the low sec version is of sov) cause changes/adjustments in the composition of a system. instead of a two-sided thing like suggested by vegas, make it 20-sided:caldariminmataramarrgallentejovian directorate (maybe/maybe not)concordammatarkhanidintakiguristasangelsblood raidersinterbusorethukkersoethe society (probably ditch jove and keep this)mordusanshaserpentisand have the benefits follow the standings between the factions (and the ""focus"" of those factions).the 4 races would put faction police at gates/stations, better enemy spawns in belts, improve faction/navy agent level/quality/count.concord might increase concord guns, concord presence, improve rat spawns in belts.the (offshoot?) races - intaki, ammatar, khanid, thukker, mordu - would provide benefits that were a cross between the big races and the pirate factions.the quasi-carebear-types - interbus, ore, soe, society - provide something like a cross between race and concord benefits. perhaps a focus on boosting asteroids.pirates provide corruption. resurrect pirate haven systems (rancer, etc...) - but with benefits (see vegas)."

12/9/2009,only way i'll step back into fw is if they address this kind of stuff. namely the lag. it was simply unbearable./signed

12/9/2009,"killmails have been a lil' dodgy for as long as i can remember, but ever since apocrypha they have started to misbehave to extreme ends, and i think its time some hamsters are punished for it.examples:no mods?wrong amount of total damage taken, no damage shown at all for tjespecially the 'total damage taken' and 'damage dealt per opponent' are very often wrong. there seems to be a rough correlation between the amount of people on the mail and the chance of it being messed up, but there are notable exceptions on both ends. sometimes the top few people seem to show accurate stats in damage dealt, while the rest ends up with very little or even zero. time and time it has proven that the mails are wrong by simply comparing them to the in-game damage logs.besides the fact that it is just annoying, it also prevents a detailed breakdown of fights and combat analysis at the end of the day.thus, i would like to urge ccp to re-examine killmails in order to find out why they are being malformed so consistently, and take measures to prevent that from happening.- sok.evelopedia article"

12/9/2009,"actually, i was just considering this. the best idea i could think of was the ability to build yourself a library that compresses all settings and stores it in a small file. this way, not only could you restore your settings and save the server hamsters, but you could also share settings with others.this would require a bit of coding, especially so it doesn't affect the raw game files and only changes the cache. the file could be shared on eve-files or saved to a usb drive for portability, or simply e-mailed.otherwise, i do support this measure."

12/9/2009,"ccp,we pay you money for a gaming universe that is complex, fun, and internally consistent. being able to capture plexes with unarmed, untanked, immobile vessels is not explainable. this is in an entirely different ballpark than solo-running plexes with vigils or crucifiers--a tactic that requires a lot of xp, a lot of skill, and does not blatantly fly in the face of intended game mechanics. this is an exploit, as evinced by the fact that a third party has managed to flip more systems over the course of 72 hours than the entire amarr and minmatar militias have been able to do in the past year. even if you don't know what you are going to do about this yet, please at least let us know if you are even considering it. we're all dying to know, and it is going to make a significant impact on many of our in-game decisions. thanks,kaito"
12/9/2009,i would love to see a fix on this but i don't see it happening soon. ccp is to concerned with getting everyone out of empire and into null sec. so maybe this is something on ccp's part to get fw to close down and push all militia pilots into null sec.

12/9/2009,"an eve price ceiling i define as any refineable item which is available at a fixed price via npc sell order. these inhibit competition by constraining the market, potentially keeping mineral prices lower than they would be.i would like the ccp economics and statistics team to devote some time to systematically identifying these items, ascertaining their impact if any, and then turning them over to the devs to either make them unrefineable or produceable by players only."
12/9/2009,what items are you talking about? i mean specifically... examples?
12/9/2009,"pos and related items come to mind. though i'm not versed in the economic dynamics to know if it is significant enough to be a determining factor in pricing right now, you can buy them in unlimited quantities from npcs and refine them.shuttles used to be text book example of this but ccp fixed them. i just want moar."
12/9/2009,"i can't see supporting asking the people who could be making my game better to take time to hunt for things we're not even sure are there. you don't know that this has an impact? couldn't you ask around a bit first? i mean you guys have a limited amount of time to get ccp doing things the community wants. wouldn't it make sense not to waste that time on speculated ""price ceilings""? ask in the market discussion forum. if you come back with data that shows refining of pos or other anchorables (or any other npc sold item for that matter) has a real effect on mineral price limits then i'll support."
12/9/2009,"a feature i would like to see is the ability to fix the start and end point of a journey and have the autopilot optimise all of the other way points in between.that way a destination is just that ... the destination.. and adding way points is a point between where you are now and the destination.this would allow you to guarantee that you visit all the stops you need to, and arrive at your destination, or even plot a round trip to get back home after going to 3 or 4 stops along the way.at present, if your intended destination is closer than a way point, you usually get a course plotted to the destination, and then to the other way points .. which become the new destination."
12/9/2009,"i like being able to plot my entire course, especially setting a waypoint just before entering low/nullsec so i don't have to sit at my computer traveling through empire :)that said, i don't see why they can't upgrade the autopilot interface to toggle on/off exiting autopilot upon reaching a waypoint."
12/9/2009,"as far as i know, there's an option for autopilot to ""stop autopilot at waypoints"".wouldn't this do?or am i misunderstanding something?"
12/9/2009,"yes dude you are missing something.say you are in new caldari and you have 8 pickups to make and want to drop all in jita for sale.currently there is no way to calculate optimal route from new caldari - ending in jita and visiting the 8 stops before you get to jita.programatically all the optimise routine has to do is reject any route ( while searching for optimal ) that does not end in jita.a tick box , keep current destination next to the optimise button should surfice.why this hasnt been a feature of eve for the last 6 years is a mystery because it would be increadably useful.espec for trader types."
12/9/2009,so long as it takes you to said destination at 12km off.sorry... but i refuse to encourage lazy afk autopiloting.i love it when they lose there ships to a suicide gank because they afk ap'ed.even then i'm not supporting it.
12/9/2009,sorry op i tried to explain.but i guess sometimes you just need to draw pictures for some people.
12/9/2009,oh i understood what you where asking.but autopiloting is always disastrous when people are given more features.if you wana fix the map to behave then go right on ahead.but i don't even use it in that fashion... typically i memorize the route or make waypoints in such a fashion that i make my own optimized route.honestly it's not that big of a deal to me.
12/9/2009,it is one thing to have the autopilot calculate an optimal route and another thing to use it to actually fly that route.and i'm sure no one will force you to use it...that's a good idea especially when you are flying a slower ship or having a long trip.

12/9/2009,"get rid of it! i'd actually like to see the locus signatures hidden. there's way too much easy info available about every ""unknown"" system."
12/9/2009,"at present, if an autopilot route goes through two or more systems that are immediately adjacent to the system the pilot is currently in, then all stargate icons for those systems on the route are highlighted yellow (both in space and in the overview), not just the stargate leading to the next system in the route. this issue only occurs when routes with multiple waypoints are set.i propose that a stargate icon should only be highlighted if it leads to the next system in the route. stargates that lead to systems that are on the route, but are not the next system in the route, should not be highlighted.i admit that this is a low priority issue. it's an annoyance that would be nice to be rid of, when ccp can spare the time to get around to it after handling more important things.thank you."
12/9/2009,never seen this before... but sounds like it needs to be fixed.
12/9/2009,"indeed. i see it most frequently when i'm doing courier missions for a particular agent. i'll set the distant station as the first waypoint, and my starting system as the second waypoint. while on the outbound route, both the system ahead of me and the system behind me are highlighted. granted, the one that i'm not supposed to be jumping through next is far more than 15 kilometers away from me, so that's not too bad.another example, and potentially more confusing, is if one needs to make an intermediate stop. suppose one needed to go from dodixie to amarr, but needed to make a stopover in jita to buy something, all following the ""prefer safer"" route. so, starting in dodixie, set destination for jita is done first, followed by add waypoint for amarr. upon jumping into the sirppala system, both stargate(urlen) and stargate(inaro) are highlighted. from the overview, it's not obvious that the urlen system next; a different part of the interface is needed to figure that out."

12/9/2009,"i strongly disagree with this both for the reasons it's asked for, and for lore reasons. people have been scuttling/self-destructing (choose to properly fit timeline) ships for ages to keep people from being able to use/loot them. they're included because sometimes you just want to blow up your ship. show me an example of any written or film work in which the character said ""damn...i sure wish we could make this ridiculously powerful reactor explode by over-heating it/looping the power-flow/etc...oh well, guess we'll just eject and let the pirates have it."" no...they flip the bird to the attackers, blow the thing up, and get captured or get the heck out of there.players all over eve destroy helpless victims simply out of spite or for kill-mail. no reason (on several levels both in and out of character) helpless victims shouldn't be able to kill themselves to spite the attackers or take away the kill mail."

12/9/2009,"i can imagine the ui being a bit confusing, though.

12/9/2009,"i agree with this idea. i do not think that ccp should try to squeeze this option in the current ui, but overhaul it to represent something with a lot more oversight."

12/9/2009,"all for it but if you get this fixed before the more serious problems on the agenda, i will lose what little faith i still have left in the intelligence of ccp's game designers."
12/9/2009,"i know, and it will be considered a 'minor' issue so be glad, not much time will be wasted on it. as it is now t2 sentries require no specialisation skill (this is true for logistics drones, but they are not combat drones, and have no racial variation in stats) and this could be considered an inconsistency in the drone line-up.besides, every serious drone user will have the racial specs to 4 already, and if not, its only a 3-day train from 0."
12/9/2009,"i definitly the skills should buff the drones but i dont think it should be accompanied by a base damage nerf. either apply the 2% to damage as-is, or, and i'd actually prefer this, add 2% to tracking."
12/9/2009,"i wouldn't want to suggest something that people could cry 'omg overpowered' at, so i did the numbers to keep the dps equal. if ccp would like it they can take it wherever though."
12/9/2009,"one of the major cons of sentry drones is they are stationary. to offset this they should do more damage than heavies.i am for adding the skill requirement to be race specific at level 5 but they should get the bonus of the damage from that skill.i also think the drone rigs should be reworked. the only rig/module in game that directly increases drone damage uses 200 calibration and applies only to sentry drones. i feel this calibration is too high. 150 seems balanced.besides, a navy domi only gets 350 calibration, so that ship can't even fit two of those rigs.in the end as a drone user for many years, i feel the proposed change is not a good one.not supported."
12/9/2009,"supported. i like the +tracking% variant, would be a nice differentiation. +10% tracking will be a nice little bonus, but hardly a game breaker.to prevent the inevitable tears, you could have it such that t2 sentries only need spec level 1 or 2 to actually be used."
12/9/2009,"if i'm reading you right, you would like it if they were given an edge because of the skill. (option 3) ?"
12/9/2009,"i disagree with you, as i think the op has got a point. i feel however that this change to drones is not the most dire thing that drones need.racial drone spec at lvl 4 isnt a hard thing to achieve. most people will have the racial dronespecs at 4, so there is no difference in the damage output. racial drone specs at 5 will grant the sentries a little extra damage, but that is a small percentage for dedicated players, which crosses over to heavy drones as well, so it's not enlarging the relative gap in damage between the drone types.the advantage of sentries over heavies is that they can do instant damage from long distances. heavy drones have the advantage of mobility, but i disagree that sentries should get more of a damage bonus because they cant move.furthermore, i think about every damage incresing rig ingame has 200 calibration. sentry drones do not need a buff in terms of less calibration used. 150 would also be too low for calibration, as it allows the navy domi to equip 2 rigs increasing damage, leaving 50 calibration for another module. if, and only if navy domi's would be supposed to be able to equip 2 sentry dmg rigs, the calibration should be modified to 175. i still disagree with this change, since you can fit navy domi's quite nicely even with 350 calibration and 1 sentry rig.in conclusion: i agree with op."
12/9/2009,"if you want to get really bizarre you could add option 4) sentry drone spec (damage/tracking/range (falloff) bonus)otherwise yes, supported."
12/9/2009,"not true. you also have the dps, tracking, and speed variables. minmatar drones are fastest, gallente do the most dps. so, you end up with minmatar having the best light drones and gallente having the best heavy drones in almost all circumstances.nooooooo!noooooo!one of the major cons to heavy drones is they don't sit right beside you and snipe things. you can't easily switch them out when someone/thing starts shooting it, unlike a sentry, to prevent it from dying. sentry drones are basically invincible because of this. this is why they do less damage than a heavy.drones need a lot of work in general. almost any suggested change is likely to be an improvement at this point, so i'll support this."
12/9/2009,"i'm for t2 sentries requiring the drone spec skills to lvl 4, thus increasing its damage and for reducing the calibration of the sentry damage rigs."
12/9/2009,not supported as a t2 sentry drone user.

12/9/2009,"supported, rather see the tracking bonus over base damage reduction."
12/9/2009,"it is broken, they are too easy to get."
12/9/2009,"fleet command ships are a great concept and they have a lot of potential. however as it is now, that potential is really only realized at near-blob levels and in the case of information warfare links, hardly realized at all because of their dilluted effects.i believe it is high time gangs of under 20 would favor the benefits of a fleet command ship over another ship type more frequently. additionally, the information warfare links are absurdly underpowered and uninspired; they need a role and they need a buff.my proposed solutions:1. in lieu of 2% base bonuses with the odd 3% sprinkled in, raise the base of all warfare links to 3%.2. make the following changes to info links to give them relevance and a niche:-sensor integrity: apply bonus to scan resolution and targeting range in addition to sensor strength-roll the range bonus of recon operation into the electronic superiority link-change the bonus of recon operation to apply to scan probe strengthhopefully this will be a step in the right direction and promote the relevance of fleet command ships in small-medium sized engagements. it will also increase the competativness of info links as well as give the eos a niche role in combat probing and worm hole work."

12/9/2009,"while i would like for the eos to have more functionality and i agree in principal with the ideea, i have to disagree with you on the use of fc ships in small fleets - under 20. breakdown ... assume maxed skills for gang links.claymore with skirmish mindlink - 15% to agility :- +38.81% to range of scrams/disruptors/webbs- +25.87% to mwd speed bonus- -25.87% to signature radiousvulture with siege warfare mindlink - 15% to shield hp :- +25.87% to shield resists, stacking penalized with invuls- -25.87% to cap usage by shield transfers - including capital ones- -25.87% to cycle time of shield transfers - including capital onesdamnation with armored warfare mindlink - 15% to armor hp :- +25.87% to armor resists, stacking penalized with eanms and anp's- -25.87% to cap usage by remote armor repps - including capital ones- -25.87% to cycle time of remote armor repps - including capital ones.changing from 2% to 3% means all of the 25.87% values will be replaced by 38.81% values. i don't think making rr even more powerfull than it already is is a smart thing - very nice attempt at a stealth boost if this is what you meant; not to mention the increase in velocity that comes with this - this in an eve where missiles already have enough problems.personally, i wouldn't mind if the resist mindlinks would be switched to 3% because they are stacking penalized and you end up with much lower in the end, but all of the rest, no freaking way. also, most serious fc users will not go with 3 gang links, but with 4. most fc ships can with relative ease fit the 4th - at most 1 mid and 1 low sacrificed."

12/9/2009,like camo or ship colour matters at all when your fighting stuff at 150km.ships use scanners to find other ships etc. not by eyes.camo on ships makes perfectly sence as the military is full of traditions and this could juse be one of them.that being said...omg its ugly :p

12/9/2009,"agreed,i live in an area between large russian alliances, as they seem to be the main culprits i see this on a daily basis. when they do it right they become invulnerable and you cant lock them. they then simply log in and out a few times and fall in a safe spot off the gate. becomes very frustrating when you follow a target more than 3 jumps and he keeps the same **** up."
12/9/2009,"this idea is to really make 0.0 profitable compared to empire, for the average alliance grunt. even with the new dominion changes i still see lots of complaining about how 0.0 doesn't compare to empire. many compare it directly to lvl4 missions. my solution is to give 0.0 lvl 4s in a specific way using the new hubs structures.you would do this by adding either a modual or structure that can be added to the hub to give out missions. for each mission modual added you would get an agent that would give the next lvl of missions 1,2,3 ect.how ever for each addition mission modual attached the reacurring cost for the hub would go up.say for the first 5 million, the second 10 million, the third 50 million. this is just an example the cost could be played around with. all agents would have 20 quality.now unlike normal missions these would be directly related to the alliance that built them and as such directly realated to the standings. my thinking is that to do a lvl 1 missions using the alliance agents you would need a least 6 standings with them so as follows.lvl 1 6.0lvl 2 7.0lvl 3 8.0lvl 4 9.0 lvl 5 10.00now this would allow all people within the alliance access to these agents as well as people the alliance would allow to use them through standing settings. lastly unlike normal agents no matter how many missions you run you can not increase your standings, standings can only be changed by the alliance."

12/10/2009,"currently the setup with every productive module having it's own storage, and limited to using only its own storage for production, needs to be re-examined.the tower should be the primary storage area for all pos production structure and corp hangars should only expand that storage. harvesting arrays have silos and would not need the tower's storage.make pos function just like stations, with all productive arrays listed the same way as the station interface. arrays with differing values would filter that way, showing the production array, the bonuses, and all available assembly lines generated by having such arrays anchored to the tower.offline modules should be removed from all pos facility listings regardless (nothing is more annoying than doing remote production when you have 4 of 5 arrays online only to receive the 'array offline' message) or have their production lines grayed out on the selection interface."

12/10/2009,destroyers might as well not exist other than for their ability to tug 4 tractor beams and 4 salvagers along to the person beginning mission running. in pvp i see very few t1 hulls being used to sc**** the likes of me off the bigger ships or scraping oiks off of me when flying something bigger. i fully support some panel beating of the destroyer class of hulls.

12/10/2009,this needs to be done asap!
12/10/2009,i support this. it will be useful for far more than just wormhole space. for instance setting up bookmarks for jump bridges and stealth bombers. i would suggest also having an alliance bookmark position that would allow an alliance member to share the bookmark across the entire alliance (useful for jump bridges and such) and also a fleet role that allows the same (this would mean that only one person would have to set a bookmark for salvaging after the completion of a complex or mission). also i'd suggest having an option to turn off automatically getting these since some people may not want them.
12/10/2009,i support this
12/10/2009,"absolutely - pls fix bms.* local cache (so it's faster)* corp and alliance sharing* align to* create bookmark shortcut* full fledged view/sort window (sort by date, delete old, ..)* store folders on server"
12/10/2009,any additional security that can get in the way of crackers is a good thing. i support this. i'd also support a wow-esque optional keyfob system.
12/10/2009,i'm fine with this as long as i'm understanding what is being proposed correctly. basically that you can set an option to lock the transfer of your character. if you do want to transfer your character then you will have to take this option off and then wait for a one week timer to transfer the character.the only possible issue i see with this is what if someone hacks your account and instead of stealing stuff just goes in and unchecks this option. then in a week they can come back and transfer the character and steal everything. i highly doubt that anyone is going to check this option every week or change their password once a week. so i would propose that when this option is removed that it shows the timer on the ui until the one week timer is up. this way a player can tell if their account was hacked and the only indication was the removal of this option.
12/10/2009,"hey hey awesome idea and would be a perfect. oficial games, scam proof (at least more legitimate) and the ui actually looks sexy and functional. great for corps and great for alliance use. a++++++++"

12/10/2009,nothing to add that i havent said a million times supported
12/10/2009,"just thought i'd point out that the only ship that can approach 40km with blasters is the rokh with null, which will deal ~680 dps at 35km or so with 3 damage mods. meanwhile the comparative tier 3 abbadon hits out to 55km with ~730 dps on scorch and a higher volley with 3 damage mods.it's true that hybrids use less cap, but they also use ammo and don't have instant reload for switching ranges.in any case, i'll support, but i'd like to see hybrids in general beefed up a bit. rails are in a slump at the moment as well."
12/10/2009,"definitely not supported, it is horribly unbalanced. so horribly i can't even take it seriously.blasters have tracking issues. some of these issue can be mitigated by smart flying. no longer can you just click approach, release drones, turn on your guns and webifier and sit watching the screen while your target dies. i think this is one of the biggest changes affecting many gallente players, you need to think a lot more.blasters do have tracking issues at extreme close ranges, then again, any gun has tracking issues at extreme close range. if the 500m sig radius hyperion is within 500m of its also 500m sig radius target transversal shouldn't really matter. the target is literally as broad as a barn and guns shouldn't have any tracking issues.the current to-hit formula undervalues sig radius at close ranges. i don't care how much your transversal is, but if you are closer than the sig radius of your target, and your sig radius is equal or smaller, i believe your shots should hit a lot more."

12/10/2009,"lol this is a joke post right ?your having us on ?you want to take the second best pvp race ( after minmatar ) and make it even more powerful by what look likes +50% boost across your entire range.ho ho ho.if your having problems with tracking then learn to fly your ships.i'll give you a clue , click approach , web , fire is not what you should be doing.the tracking boosts you request are unwaranted , blaster allready have the best tracking in game or at least equal to auto's iirc.you complained somewhere about pulses having better tracking at there optimal ?it may be true , but the point is when your at your optimal you have the better trackingmuch better than pulse at your optimal why on earth do you need 50% more unless you want the game to do everything for you.ranged rails are not a gall spec they are a cal spec.you want best short range boats boosted and you want ranged option ?erm no.if you want ranged rails then fly caldari rail boats.personally i wouldnt bother there all crap.a set of ships incursus > mega that get a 100% boost to afterburner speed.loooooolso every other race has to fit mwd with cap hit , sig hit and large cap usage while gal get to zoom about with ultra effective ab'sif you cant see how that would be massivelly overpowered theres really no hope for your game balancing asperations.drones are ****age when properly trained not only againt there class size , but also against smaller targets , blaster may require the application of some tactics but hit hard when used properly.some of the best ships in game are gallente.off the top of my headincursus , vexor , thorax , domi , mega , taranis , ishkur , ishtar , myrm, moros , thanny.gallente have plenty of pvp options for gang / fleet and solo they do not require any kind of boost."
12/10/2009,"no. and you're saying amarr is worse than gallente?? are you daft?caldari are also great gang ships, i wouldn't consider them to be worse than gallente atmok,. so i try to adjust my distance by manually flying away from my target and not just webbing. oh **** went to far since my optimal is less than 2 km. oh **** i can't fly back in cause the lag on manual flying is so ****ing bad that you can't possibly manually fly and keep your ship within 2km but not under 1.8 km where your guns won't track ****. it's really not as easy as you think, especially with how horrible manual flying is. i find myself quintuple clicking in space instead of double clicking cause most times the lag doesn't pick up just 2 clicksauto's also have the option of fighting in falloff (which is significantly larger than blasters) and blasters must fight up close. we may have the best paper tracking but it just doesn't seem to work when you're 1 km away from your target.tbh right now the game does everything for pulse. it's also really hard to get into that range before you're dead from pulses as mwd no longer work in scram range, kinda killing the effectiveness of alot of blaster ships."
12/10/2009,"you just failed massively @ understanding tracking mechanics. i'll give you a quick crash course:when things are closer, it's easier for them to increase transversal, which means that in blaster optimal range, a very high transversal is exremely easy to achieve. even with caldari bs'.you see, eve'o hit and miss mechanics don't understand the fact that things are effectively bigger when they're close. this is what makes blasters useless in todays world.secondly, you can't always warp in close. sometimes you're actually forced to close in. when you're only doing 100 more dps than a ship that has double your range and that other ship can change ammo for range in the blink of an eye and you can't, then you are at a massive disadvantage.blasters need more damage to make up for it. either that, or blaster ships need more speed. or you could increase the range of blasters, but that would be a bit lame, as it would remove the whole close range/face melting damage flavor of blasters."

12/10/2009,i haven't seen a single titan bridge without atleast 2-3 bumps. be it people mwding towards the titan or using approach instead of keep at range. increasing the range should give those idiots a bit more time to stop.
12/10/2009,i completely agree with this. this would remove a lot of headaches of having to wait for 200 people to get close to the titan again because one ****** couldn't stop from bumping the titan.
12/10/2009,"i agree this would be nice. however, i suspect it's limited by the same code used for stargates and pos jump bridges, and as such may be hard to modify one without affecting the others.in any case, if it's at all possible, it'd be worth a tweak."
12/10/2009,because improving comfortable gameplay is nessesary sometimes.
12/10/2009,"how about allowing us to use these 'slaves' as a method to gain faction standing (a very, very small ammount) when they are freed or, conversely, enslaved?admittedly i have collected very few slaves since the mission rewards changes (from useless goods to plain old boring isk) so this looks like a decent method of exchanging goods to repair bad standings over time.freeing or enslaving would remove the items so they could not be simply sold back and forth to farm standings.another exchangable item would be needed for the gallente, ofc. no such good is needed for the caldari, they're insanely easy to farm already with so very, very many agents."

12/10/2009,the biggest issue of fw is that the most central mechanism is most effectively done by an alt while you do something else with another account.that can not be the desired way of how fw works.
12/10/2009,supported
12/10/2009,supported
12/10/2009,"to my mind, the issues in fw all derive from one thing about its design. it has always been easy to tell what is working as intended in eve and what is a bug/exploit because what is allowed is always stuff that obeys in-game logic as being possible, and what is not causes that reality to break.for instance, pos bowling was an exploit because there was no reason ramming into the shield would convey momentum to the objects on the other side of it. corp theft is not an exploit because there is no in-game reason you wouldn't be able steal stuff you have access to.the fw complexing mechanic has always been exactly that - a visible mechanic, not an organic development of in-game reality. orbiting a point to conquer a solar system is illogical and all the issues people have with fw spin out from there. the ship that orbits best has an advantage, the npcs with the best tracking against orbiting ships have an advantage, the faction that can orbit without incurring fire has an advantage. make us shoot things and we're back to a level, logical playing field where we know what we can or can't do."
12/10/2009,"i support ccp looking at fw. it seems to me fw has to be more than an isk sink. there needs to be something that fw pilots can strive for to maintain the ships they fly. it seems that right now faction stuff is too costly. i think ccp did a good thing by allowing fw pilots to get certain items cheaper. i think getting more lp into fw pilots hands is a good idea. here are some of my thoughts:1) do missions give too much lp? well maybe they do in comparison to plexing. however, the cost of faction ships and mods are out of reach for pvpers. so economically speaking something needs to give more lp. so i see nothing wrong with letting fw pilots get that isk if for not other reason than to lower the prices. 2) i see nothing wrong with giving more lp for plexes. also the lp for kills would be good. so long as exploits are dealt with.(killing your own alt for lp)one idea of diminishing returns for kills was already offered. also trying to assign a value to the damage done might be good to. that would be a bigger undertaking but it would also help them with a different broken mechanic - bounties.3) 3rd party war decs need to be looked at.alicia had some ideas that should be looked at. i cant say whether they are good or bad.i would say i am not so negative toward ccp on fw. i mean sure they can do more. but the changes they made were good ones and they are heading in the right direction."
12/10/2009,"optimal solution, yes, but a small fix is better than no fix."
12/10/2009,can ads = diaflocal spam = diafthis is good
12/10/2009,"this seems reasonable. if the adverts could be cycled every day at dt so the devs didn't have too much work to do for siphoning out the bad stuff, it would work. there could be limited slots and a backlog, to the point where there are 20 slots per station, 10 per system, 5 per constellation, 2 per region, and 1 for all of eve each day (these numbers are just vague guesses off the top of my head).the cost could be calculated on a number of factors (population density, number of stations in a given area, etc). of course, with player-owned stations, the alliances themselves could set the presentations, which would work well with the new dominion expansion.i support this measure."
12/10/2009,i don't support the removal of the timer. but i do support lowering the timer. usually it's a good couple of minutes before i find something else worth posting on and then type up a relevant post anyway. a reduction to anywhere between 1-3 minutes would probably continue to keep out spam posters and stupid comments while also making sure that relevant posts don't run into this issue often.

12/10/2009,"pos guns have superior range to your ship's guns. guess what? they do more damage, because they are stationary. they also have lower tracking, and they cannot close in distance with their target, get back to the owner, have larger sig radius and cannot speedtank.. do i need to continue the list?rl perspective: since they have no engines. their is more space for guns.creating a skill that adds 10% more damage is not a nerf. 3 more days in training is not much for any serious drone pilot, sentries take months to train for, and you will want to fly a specializes ship like an ishtar to use them properly. 3 days is nothing in comparison to it, especially since you need them for t2 heavy drones anyway."
12/10/2009,not supported as irrelevant in my opinion and sollution 2) is a major nerf for anyone who is not a gallente pilot.make them appear closer to my ishtar instead...dominion screwed that up.
12/10/2009,"pos guns are super-powered because of the cost associated with them, not because they are stationary in a fight. also, they are beyond stationary, you can't just bring them to a fight like you can a sentry drone.your argument is equivalent to saying a dreadnought does more damage than a cruiser because it is slower. if you want another skill that gives a bonus to sentries, it should be for optimal range. they are, after all, the snipers of the drone world. sniper weapons/ships have range bonuses. boost base damage, have damage modified by spec skills and switch the sentry skill to boost range. they would fit their concept better if a sniper could drop them at 100-150km out and use them."

12/10/2009,"since the changes to speed and propulsion, one thing has become resoundingly clear - 'mid range' combat becomes very valuable once more. pulse lasers and scorch are proving remarkably valuable in combat - as it should, given it's always been 'the' mid range gun.the problem is, hybrids and projectiles suffer something of a lack in that department. the reason for this, is because guns get harder to fit, and longer range, and higher dps, and higher volley damage. this tends to leave weapons like dual 150 and 250mm railguns somewhat in the cold. i'd like to propose the addition of two new artillery cannons, and that the bottom tier railguns get adjusted, such that they each come 'somewhere between' the longest ranges of short and long range guns - in terms of dps, tracking, range and fitting. you'd end up with a 'medium range' gun that would be a viable alternative to either short or long range options, rather than ... well, hardly anyone seems to fit dual 150s or dual 250s, do they?"

12/10/2009,"we all know eve has a steep learning curve and ccp has tried to ease people in with new tutorials etc. but as i and a couple of my friends started playing eve some weeks ago, i think that user interface is one of the most glaring issues of eve. now that i have learned basics and starting to be more accustomed with eve, interface is still my biggest complaint.looking at screenshots from earlier versions of the game, interface looks alot like todays interface. considering all the graphical etc. revamps, it's odd that interface, certainly more important part of any game than graphics, hasn't got revamp.there is way too much clicking, right click menus, lists, deep menus etc. everything from ship control panel and target action window to chat interface and inventory management could use a ton of functionality improvements and streamlining(neo com is ok, minimized). im certain that all current functionality of interface could be done much better if whole thing would be done from scratch.in short, i think that revamping game's interface would greatly benefit new player experience and also old players(tho say if you dont agree).my issues with interface:- menus are too deep and hard to find- too many right click functions and menus- combat interface is like 'playing' some desktop application. alot of clicking on overview and target action window. right clicks for distance chances etc. doesn't feel very active or involved.- drone management is pain. collapsaple menus and right clicking.- chat stuff could be just copied from wow or any other mmo+eve security features. stuff like easy private messages and messages from many channels on one window etc.- tactical view. maybe you guys have found it useful but i havent, atleast yet.- took me while to notice how to know if im being jammed, i guess it's fine now that i noticed that bar... but these kind of things could be easier to notice.- comparing items is hard. it takes a while to compare for example, what turret would be best for my ship.- icons and colors on overview. i have no idea what some of that stuff actually means. would be nice if that stuff was more evident without googling.im sure there is alot more complaits and improvements to be made, but those are some off the top of my head.i like that eve is a deep game but i just think that all of current functionality could be done better. be kind to a newb. peace :)"

12/10/2009,"this mechanic is absolute crock at the moment, as it makes freighters running through low security nearly invincible which by no means should ever occur. however, i believe that there must be one small addition to your change. a message from the client should be sent when the grid is loaded correctly after jumping into a system, and only if this message is received from the client should the ship stay in space for some amount of time. this means that if someone legitimately crashes when going through systems, their ship will disappear in a short amount of time. however, no more people ctrl+q'ing when they see the camp and thinking oh shi-...under current mechanics a freighter running through low sec can only be destroyed on a gate if they quit after jumping by 17 pure gank bs (at slightly over 1k dps), or 4 dreads in siege mode. however, half the time you can't even lock the ships once the player logs out, and they become virtually invincible. secondly, the ships still disappear when getting disrupted, and even under a bubble or focused warp disruption. this means that during the full duration of apocrypha's release a freighter pilot pressing two buttons was more useful than a tech iii ships interdiction nullifier subsystem powered by super advanced ancient sleeper technology. third, if a person logs out multiple times after quitting on the gate, they are able to get further away from the gate every time they log out. this means they don't even have to appear on the gate after logging back in.also i have heard about this but not tested it. supposedly if you log onto an alt character from the same account, your ship will disappear immediately even with an aggression timer. i have yet to confirm this however.according to ccp last time i checked, this is not an exploit. however, i fail to understand how freighters roaming through low security space freely without escort or worry of destruction is considered normal game mechanics. infact, every time i see that advertisement of eve with the minnie freighter getting blasted the only thing i can think of is ""that pilot didn't know how to ctrl+q.""as obviously stated, i am in full support of ctrl+q not providing freighters immunity from gatecamps in both low and null security space."

12/10/2009,"really, the easy fix is ditching this whole ""super-warp after disconnect"". primarily, legit disconnects occur while jumping a gate into a lag-tacular event. don't put the ship into a system until their client loads the system - keep it in limbo between systems. this way:if it is caused by lag, they will eventually show up and start their cloak timer once they are actually in control of their ship.if it is an actual disconnect during a jump, they will get their cloak timer once they log back in.the only other time i've had (or seen) disconnects is when i'm sitting in space or a station without moving for a while (such as while waiting for orders from an fc - such as when springing a trap). in this case, a normal warp off and sit for 15 minutes (with aggro) wouldn't bug me any. conceivably, someone might be in a battle and lose connection from a storm or isp outage. i would think the likelihood is very low, so the number of cases where this happens would be small. that's what petitions are for, not some game-changing solution."

12/11/2009,would be a nice addition to the game.
12/11/2009,if ccp only used the already approved alliance logos and added them to the client data them you would load them locally instead of from the server. add in texture sharing between ships and the overall load on the client would be minimal at worst. also if it was restricted to only alliance logos for alliances of a certain size(ie no custom logos for one man alliances) then getting new ones approved should be a bit easier for ccp to handle. plus to completely remove any chance of performance loss there can be a graphics option to turn off the logos much like the effects and other items./signed as do we all but there are far far far too many of them to include in the client data so you would have to load them from the server which ain't gonna happen ever.

(there are many games which have this problem, hence the need for third-party applications)i would propose whole heartedly that development for trinity iii is based on directx versions that do not have this problem when using a method of shading that results in the eve client not being able to natively support aa.ccp must also consider that the eve client must work across all of the supported formats; mac, linux and windows to the same or comparable representation of the eve universe. this is a big issue.for now, i believe that aa will remain unsupported, despite the obvious visual deficiencies that it carries, as i believe the time it would take to resolve the problem would make it financially non-viable. however as stated, i support any discussions on this topic going forward.alleykat"
12/11/2009,"you see , you dont understand your own ships.flying away will not lower you tracking as much as flying parallelso why are you trying to fly away in a blaster ( ultra close range ) boat.here starteth the blaster pvp leason.1. use orbit 1km or 500m depending upon ship class2. web and scram opponent3. make sure you have velocity and transversal on your overview4. note opponents velocity when scrammed and webbed5. set your own velocity to be just a little more than your opponents6. if you cant do this then your ship setup is fail7. assuming you can go faster than your opponent then notch up the speed a bit at a time till your nearing your guns max tranversalif all the above is too much for you then use keep at range as this is a close approximation.7. for ultimate tracking nullification ( bs and cruiser combat ) ( too difficult for frigs imo ) , look at your opponent ( swing the camera around to face the direction he is flying , double click in that direction , select your speed to match his )of course this is for solo or small gang work, for fleets target calling by the fc is more important as anyone primaried by a pack of blaster boats is gonna go down so fast you wont have a chance to worry about any of the above.you need to get to your optimal and optimal tracking speeds , your opponent will try to get to his.use above methods or invent your own.dont ask for 100% afterburners bonues or 50% tracking bonuses so that the game does it all for you. if your beings scrammed then your also in scram range, if your ships not fast enough try putting less plates and more resists on it next time or fit an ab instead of an mwd and only agress targets that you have scrammed , if you cant get close enough jump your ship out.100% ab bonus would make the mega so awesome , all other bs would be obsolete.how can you seriosley even contemplate such a thing.ab fitted mega has no fitting issues , all other mwd'd ships would have fitting issues.mega would never have cap issues , all other bs would have cap issues.mega would always be able to dictate range and tracking , in short mega would allways win.and then you want 50% better tracking as well , sigh.players would have no choice but to train up gal bs and blasters."
12/11/2009,"yahrr supports gallente! (and learned to fly amarr-caldari and now even minmatar because of the reasons named in this topic) there's another thing that is not just about gallente, but all the drone boats in the game. still i think this belongs in this topic since gallente is the mother race to all the drone boats.the only real benefit dedicated drone boats have is the massive drone bay. however, in case of drone types like ecm/neut/damp the drone ""damage"" is exactly equal to all other ships that can field drones, while at the same time the normal weapon systems are not as advanced as they are on dedicated turret ships."
12/11/2009,"scrammed and webbed bs generally dont fly faster than 70m/s its very easy to null out the tracking if you know what you are doing.tracking to your opponent = opponents tracking to youa) other gun boat , will have a worse tracking situation than you ( lasers ) or equally good/bad ( other blasters & ac's ) .b) missile boats , may manourver to raise tracking and take less damage without affecting there own dps, but compensatorilly have no way of increaseing damage on target by lower tracking.sig radius is designed for damage reduction due to ship class, it has nothing to do with tracking.yes you are at a disadvantage from range , laser boats are a disadvatage close up.thats the game , getting your ship into a position to poon the opponent.blasters are allready the most powerful weapons in game with the best tracking.generally gallente have second fastest ships in class allreadye.g.tempest 120mega 105apoc 94raven 94before skills or mods.i think you will have a fight on your hands if you want fastest in class.mini have the toughest job for mantaining there optimal position as its neither close up or at range but somewhere in the middle."
12/11/2009,"i'm flying away at first since usually when approaching an enemy, it's hard to stop approaching your enemy and land in orbit or flying parallel to them perfectly at your optimal range. remember, flying just 1 km too close means you just effed up your chance at tracking correctly.yes flying like this comes with practice, but often you just cannot help it as you can't control the other person's ship so them doing something you aren't anticipating can mess up your strategy to get in your optimal and no closer.i personally didn't ask for that, don't try to push the op's ideas onto me without being sure i support it. i happen to not support this part of the op.wait, fit less buffer so you get ripped apart even faster as you attempt to close range to get into your optimal? as the pulse lasers are doing almost as much dps as you could be doing, but at a much larger optimal. you need the buffer to live long enough to get into range. pulses would kill you before you got into range if you fit no buffer.if i can't get close enough to scram a target with an afterburner fit, what makes you think i can get away?whoops we covered this"
12/11/2009,"so you understand? when a huge ship is right up in your face, it's really really hard to miss, no matter how fast they are going. tracking doesn't take into account that when close, you effectively have a larger target to shoot at."
12/11/2009,no he doesnt.and the idea about mannualy flying to minimize transversal in a 200 meters range it must be a joke.the same with the idea than since blaster cant track so lasers cant. he is talking about some virtual 1vs1 engagements.and i agree ab bonus on gallente ships would be bad.
12/11/2009,some idea's are completly nuts like the afterburner bones....wtf do u want people not flying those ships anymore? and the taranis is fine... u just want to nerf it on that way.... the only changes that 1 see that needs to be done is all the missile requiements on gallente ships.... gallente has a primary weapon hybrids or drones... so why do i need missile skills on a lachistis.. serious... the deimos could use some more cap or a additional bonus for mwd cap saving. do u actualy know what a diemos does upclose? it vaporise stuffs faster than u can say fast. 3 of those melt a bs in under a minut.. deimos is fine but the cap or powergrid need to be sorted
12/11/2009,"for the ignorant:the current tracking formula seems to be based on a point model. so whether you are 100km's away or 1m away the guns are trying to hit a tiny aim point. however when you are at point blank even though you may ""miss"" the aim point you still will have a near certainty of hitting the enemy ship some where.medium and up blasters should have trouble hitting a fast moving drone or inty. but there is pretty much no way they could physically miss anything cruiser sized or larger."
12/11/2009,totally supported. i find it irritating as hell that my friend's eagle can out dps my deimos by 100points while tanking three times as much for 5x as long.
12/11/2009,"^^ yes you did ( from your ticked support post ).or did you not bother reading before offering your support all the way ?.really dude you did support a post that so completelly overpowereds the mega no other bs would be viable.i know you wont , but you really need to go think about what the op is saying in his linked post before you withdraw your support.yes dude , i understand that when your close the silohette of the ship takes up a massive proportion of the view from you ship. like trying to shoot a freight train from 1 meter away.if game mechanics were ""realistic"" then you should get wrecking shots everytime you fire.by the same reasoning as missile explode at zero and the size of the target from the missile perspective is huge taking up nearly half the sky, your also supporting missiles doing full damage , irrelevant of sig rad ?eve does not use the apparent size of the target as a parameter in damage calculations , this is the same for all weapon systems , why should blasters be an exception ?."
12/11/2009,lolgo away troll.
12/11/2009,"its not trolling to point out inconsistences in peoples logic.i am not against apparent target size being a function in damage calculations.eve would be more realistic if it were so.but the same damage calculations run for all guns , so if blasters were getting the benefit of large apparent target size ( cant miss ) all other guns would also get the benefit of large apparent target size ( cant miss ) , even long range weapons would hit for full power at point blank.it really doenst leave much room for gameplay , which is probably why its not taken into account."
12/11/2009,"actually, i would consider gallente as bottom of the pile right now. if i recall correctly, the nano nerfs came at about the same time as the blaster tracking nerf. megas required both to make frigates, afs, and ceptors run in fear. as i really don't care at all about blasters (mostly because i prefer mid-to-long-range combat), i'm not going to put in the time to dig through the release notes to find exactly when the nerfs hit, but they were both around the same time.add to that the drone tracking and sensor damp nerfs that hit about the same time and you can easily see how gallente went from top dog to bottom dog in the space of a year (had to wait until dominion for minmatar to leave the bottom of the pile - because they were way down at the bottom).the hyperion is the gallente version of a raven. a nice missioning boat. the hyperion, raven, and maelstrom can be used in pvp, but the other two battleship options for each race are better choices for pvp ships. the only race with three good pvp battleships is amarr, but they get middle dps, alpha, speed, and tank (i.e. none of them have stand out attributes) in exchange.from a balance perspective, there's a reason gallente received several consecutive nerfs in rapid succession - gallente were over-powered. they do need some back though as they are now sort of underpowered.stop comparing apples and oranges. the reason amarr often look so good is because people throw together a mixed fleet and try to have everyone fill the same role. this leads to everyone compromising into the middle ground, where amarr sit.the complaint about gallente ships is less ""someone else can pawn me"" and more ""the other guys in my gang can shoot and kill things before i get in range"". this is a real complaint in blob-v-one. however, in a blob-v-blob, the blaster boat should be strong.as it is, when i call targets, i usually primary gallente as they almost always glass cannon fit their ships to do silly damage at mid-range. they also (more often than not) have a horrible habit of burning directly at long range fleet or are aligning/motionless waiting for a warp in - making them the best targets in an rr fleet (most likely to die from alpha). in short, their faults are 50% stupid pilots 30% good ship in the wrong fleet and 20% need for slight improvement."
12/11/2009,"ok if you're going to be cute by trying to base a large portion of your argument on how mine is wrong because i made a small mistake (logical fallacy which truly has nothing to do with the actual argument. kinda makes me think you're just attacking me instead of arguing your point) and accidentally said i supported the whole thing, then i can go change that. would that make you happy? what would you say to my argument then? would you have some real feedback? also, don't shoot down the whole argument just because one little part seems to be overpowered. that can be easily adjusted.probably because blasters are supposed to work close range, but are at extreme disadvantage since we can't even track or stay in range of our optimal range. something needs to be changed.it is completely feasible that a missiles has an explosion radius greater than a target in my opinion. now, that is very unlikely, given the size of missiles compared to the size of the ships, but it could happen. what's really hard to understand is how a turret can't hit a target right up in your face. in my opinion"
12/11/2009,"it's not an exponential relationship and if you dig up the thread about blaster tracking you'll see that your claims of terrible tracking aren't that well founded and blasters have 3x more falloff then optimal so who says they should hit well at their optimal?but yeah, blasters need a revision"
12/11/2009,"no, youtransversal speed is the component of the speed vector that's perpendicular to the origin vector. it's independent of |r|"
12/11/2009,"ok cute stuff, tracking doesn't take into account transversal, it takes into account radial velocity, which oh! doesn't directly depend on radius, but with a very small radius or distance between objects, is easy to get ridiculously high radial speeds.""transversal speed is the component of the speed vector that's perpendicular to the origin vector"".......wut"

12/11/2009,"oh right.the plex restrictions were introduced to allow younger players have some ""equal fights"", and not just always have the old, experienced players walk over them. this succeeded partly (sp still matters, of course, but you can push a rifter only that far), but with the recent boost to faction ships, faction frigates and faction cruisers are the undisputed kings of minor/medium plexes. those are usually not accessible to younger pilots, as they require a lot of isk and, for the better ships, cross-training.it would be nice if this could be returned to the original design state. this would likely require a new category for faction ships besides t1/t2, though."
12/11/2009,"with kind permission of marlona i would like to group his idea along with a few others into this proposal aimed at making fleets more enjoyable and improving battlefield logistics.1) watch lista. the maximum number of people on a watch list currently is 10. this is often insufficient, and unless there are profound technical reasons not to, i would like to see this increased to 20 at least.b. i would like to be able to see, other than the persons name and hp stats, the persons ship type on the watch list. this will greatly help in selecting priorities for logistics pilots. a dictor in half shield may well be in dire trouble - a hictor in half shield might hardly be a concern.c. the only way to add someone to watch list is to right-click their name, --> fleet, --> add to watchlist. this can be confusing because there are a whole lot of options in both menus, and i would like to see this simplified in some way.2) broadcastsa. the buttons for broadcasting in the new fleet window are way too small. make them 2x the current size.b. i would like to see a new position in fleets, dubbed 'targetcaller'. this would be a role that anyone can fill regardless of where they are in the fleet and there should be a maximum of, say, 3 to 5. the target caller position entails that this person, once he selects a target off his overview, gets a single-click option to broadcast this target. he has a small menu where he can see the entire fleet build-up by wing and squad, and he can select with tickboxes which individual squads receive his broadcasts. this would greatly help in picking different targets for battleships and support fleets and generally make fleets more enjoyable and less messy on comms.evelopedia article- sok."

12/11/2009,"and there lies the crux of the matter.moms were never meant for ""everyday use"".the reason why they along with titans can not dock at npc stations and the reason they can only be built in sovereign null sec is they were intended to be alliance owned super capital ships for deployment in cap fleet warfare between null sec alliances.of course players have found ways around these restrictions with chribba/darknesss escrow ship transfers and parking alts/poses.you really cant blame ccp if these ships are now unsuitable for roles for which they were never intended, i.e. minimully supported corporation level null/low sec gate camp and drop operations.in there intended usage moms should not fit tackle or local reps.they will have fleet tackle with them and enough rr support from other moms/carriers to make local rep a waste of a slot that would have been better used for resists.this leaves low slots ( shield tanks ) and mid slots ( armor tanks ) free for cpr's and cap rechargers.along with cap fountain transfers back and forth between moms/carriers and with cap pumps from logistics ships, moms even the tanked variety should have more than enough cap to perma run 2 , 3 or maybe even 4 capital remote reps.with 25 fighters / drones at there disposal and invulnerability to jamming moms are still a formidable force when they are part of a fleet large enough to discourage titan / dread hotdrops.a 5xhp buff would be warranted if moms had the cap killer roll where they are expected to go against titans toe to toe but cant effectivlly damage smaller ships.in there current incarnation with sweet damage , they can easilly engage and destroy any sub cap ship with ease.its unreasonable for you to expect 99% of the players base , who fly frig/cruise/bc/bs to go up against moms with that kind of damage and have to deliver 5x the current amount of damage to destroy there opponents.moms are tough enough and invulnerable enough against sub caps allready they dont need to be 5x better.no to solowtfpwnmobiles.no to players having there hands held by ccp because they have circumnavigated ship restrictions and now find themselves sitting in ships they cant afford to lose and now actually could lose.what the rest of us have to suffer 5x kill requirement because mom pilots spent 20b on there pride and joys and deserve special treatment ?.i really hope you drop this b.s. before you waste ccp/csm facetime on a solution to a problem that players have gotten themselves into that would negativelly affect 99% of the players you were elected to represent.yeah right , woot woot for selfish self interest.or come up with a solution that mitigates the titan damage whilst not opping moms versus everything else."
12/11/2009,just go away k?
12/11/2009,moms are already good enough to go against sub caps so getting 5x hp buff wouldn't really change things c/d? other than the fact that it makes it a little more difficult for a titan to kill a 20 billion isk ship with relative ease.woot woot for self interest you say?i don't own a mothership. i have never flown with a mothership. i have never seen a mothership. but i support this so it's not quite so easy to instapop a 20 billion isk ship.
12/11/2009,"what you should be trying to say is that ms are not supposed to be good at everything, claiming they were not meant to be used on a regular basis is perverse.nope. the requirements were only there to curb the amount that could be built - there have always been third parties around willing to secure the deals so claiming they were only to be used by sovholders is dumb.what are you trying to say here? the lowsec ms died with the introduction of the hic and even without them people managed to kill a few (see: x13). ms have never been capable solo ships apart from ganking the odd bs that jumped into them in lowsec.capital energy transfers are extremely inefficient and will only 'generate' minute amounts of cap. and i would like to see your setup that can tank multiple dd's and can permarun 4 crr.again, more rubbish. 25 fighters requires 5 drone control units and no ms will ever fit that, besides you were just talking about fitting 4 crr. and now that they are capable of being destroyed in seconds by a titan gank squad, they are hardly a formidable force, and when the attacker plays it well, the support fleet can do nothing but sit by and watch.please elaborate on your reasoning because its making sod all sense.rr bs can easily tank a ms. anything smaller than a bs can easily run away. their dps is hardly impressive. wow. we agree on something. too bad your grasp of game mechanics fails tremendously.once again you show how ignorant you are of the mechanics and gameplay surrounding (super) capitals.no. in fact you have only encouraged me to push even harder. now please go away and asphyxate (ingame, in space) *edited for courtesy*"

12/12/2009,dear dav. please stop posting. you have no idea what you're talking about.- sok.ps. the insinuation that i have a master/agenda to serve was great comedy!
12/12/2009,"dev's ramblings are quite entertaining. apparently, in his world, the role of a 20+ bil ship is to bend over and take one for the team, as he actually hasn't been able to produce a role for them that doesn't involve a titan bbqing it instantly. obviously, that's a ship i'm really excited to train for!"
12/12/2009,"problems with your words1: moms are spost to tackle things which is why officer webs and disruptors have suck high fitting requierments, your not going to stick a 3bill isk point or web on a carrier lol2: ncp stations? supper capitals cannot dock anywere.3: alliance owned suppercapitals lol this gets batted around a lot i don't know what alliances do give out free suppercaps but can i join, i think you will find a lot of moms are self owned and do not get any reinbursments from allainces.4: there for deployment in cap fights? no this role has been broken for meny years which is why you only find them camping lowsec gates.5: 25 drones? and 4 reps? i dont think you will ever see a mom have 25 drones out on anything other than maxskills day on the testserver, and 4 rr lololol these 2 things here just show how little you know about the subject matter at hand.6: discourage titan / dread hotdrops right you have a fleet with 40 dreads 20 carriers 60 support and one mom, 2 titans jump in and dd the mom and then log outmom dies insta death and you don't have the dps on the field to avenge the death of the mom before the 15min agro timer on the titan.so master of all what do you consider to be a sutable fleet size to discourage the titans jumping in?.....moms were desined to be the anti titan killer before the changes were nerfed, i.e have 2-3 of these in fleet and discourage the use of titans, but now thay are just wet paper.7: moms are spost to be uber and cool, there something you wish you can get into one day after years of planning and stuff, there something thats spost to make you go oooowwww we got a mom in fleet with us and have a boost to the fleet for fielding such a beast. there not that good. the only thing thats made them good is the fittings at the end of the day and with some moms fittings costing more than the ship in some cases, but gen in the 5-10bill rangeif you think that having the 2nd most exspancive ship in the game and then spending more isk on fittings than most people will ever have ever in game and you should not have a little bit of an advantage over some random gang in t1 bc's that prob cost less than one of your smartbombs you are realy playing the wrong game.was going to spell check this but i cannot be bothard as that would requier me to spend time enegry and effot and would not give me any advantage at all. mmm just like grinding for a suppercap then."
12/12/2009,"meh.though i'd laugh if they made a sort-of t3 shuttle which lets you fit it yourself. nothing fancy, no speedmods or extra hp, but just some fancy looks."
12/12/2009,"you can actually just do a ""warp within 0"" of the gate and jump that way. even though auto pilot does somehow take you out by a sizable distance. i just go manually but with the destination still plotted. its tedious but faster because you just warp then hit jump when warp is over.but yes it seems a little odd that your navigation computer would take you out 10km, especially if you in a freighter."
12/12/2009,"and i doubt you have any experience with coherent thought, but i was nice enough not to bring that up.if you don't like the warp while you autopilot, don't autopilot.or read a book.you can obviously read. or is your version of the forums all in pictograms?troglodyte."
12/12/2009,i don't think you even know what ganking is either.i would be more than happy to introduce you to the concept... meet me at a wormhole and i'll be happy to personally... introduce you (pats shrapnel bomb) to ganking.i'll even arrange to have de show up in her huricane. you game de?
12/12/2009,"how about ""intentional game design element?""you are supposed to play the game. that means sitting in front of the computer and keeping your eyes (and ears, if you're one of those freaks that has the sound turned on) focused on the game.eve, like all mmo's, is designed to be a timesink. about half the time of every game session is spent on traveling to and from somewhere. this is intentional. there is no reason for ccp to reward afk gaming. you want to arrive safely at your destination, you fly your ship yourself.not supported."
12/12/2009,"what is it with you two? you almost seem to live in the assembly hall...still, i say no to the idea. being at the keyboard has it's advantages, and if you were smart, you would either use the browser to troll the eve forums or use a second monitor to watch a movie or a tv series. it's not that hard, and i do it all the time.also, confirming i will help with introduction to ganking. i'll bring the tear jar."
12/12/2009,"i can't live in the assembly hall - they won't let me decorate. i have a cute little apartment next door.actually, like you, i read the forums while i flying to places.or mining.or waiting for code to compile at work - 'cause nothing's more boring than watching ant run."
12/12/2009,i don't live here... if i did... everyone else would likely run! x)for me its busy busy time while waiting for winblows to finish removing viruses at work (i fix computers for a living)too bad i can't play eve at work... but this is close enough. \o/
12/12/2009,i think these changes will actually make ganking more profitable. you just got to know what your doing
12/12/2009,"if shuttles can't be locked before they get to the gate and don't insta-pop, they will be functioning like a different ship in game... like a af or ceptor. why are you flying a shuttle in a situation where you might die anyway? that's just silly talk."
12/12/2009,"i never mentioned anything about reinforcing their armor or shield. only thing that changes is they come out of warp a little closer to the stargate. this thread is not about removing the gank factor, then i would have suggested warp to z. this is about making an autopilot that is fast an affective but still has risk to it."
12/12/2009,the closer you end up at the gate the more stupid people will use auto pilot while afk.2 words are the only conclusion one can reach.hell no.if you want minimal risk.. warp to zero.stop being lazy.
12/12/2009,"this is about traveling convenience, an improved autopilot that is not risk-free. making the shuttle come out of warp a bit closer to gates than average, say 9-10km away, more people will definatley use it for afk traveling/transporting. more people doing this is only a good thing from a gankers/pirate perspectivetldrimproved traveltime on autopilot, that will increase your productivity in other areasits not risk free. the dedicated ganker will still be able to get you."
12/12/2009,"a while back, ccp supposedly set it so that when you decline a mission, the agent doesn't turn around and offer you the same mission again. not so with ""driving a wedge,"" where, after declining a mission to go kill gallente ships, you immediately get the same exact mission, except sending you to go kill minmatar ships. getting this mission can lock out an agent for 8 hours to someone who is avoiding faction hits.furthermore, i'm not sure if ccp's new agent behavior actually works. as after finally declining the second ""driving a wedge"" section, i got one courier mission before getting a whole new ""driving a wedge"" sequence. so, i'm bitter right now"
12/12/2009,drone nerfs and drone stealth nerfs = not supported.
12/12/2009,came to thread because posted by new csm member.this about sums it up.
12/12/2009,i am really shocked by how many people see a 8-10% bonus to sentry drones dps from the specialization skills as a nerf.
12/12/2009,"because those +2% equal 4 months and don't add up with others. speed +2% is noticable, even more when coupled with an mwd that gives +500% =>+10%"
12/12/2009,"err, no, lrn2/maths."
12/12/2009,i've edited the first post to make it clearer that i'm actually looking to improve t2 sentries by this.
12/12/2009,personally i don't think they need improving. no racial spec bonus is a fair trade off for their instant damage/no travel time vs heavy drones.
12/12/2009,i'd say lrn2create good ideas threads and/or not simply respond with glib one-liners. you're in the csm and should at least present the illusion of taking things and the playerbase seriously.
12/12/2009,please bring back this skill.
12/12/2009,wtf where did this go?if this was removed what about the sp i had in it?
12/12/2009,rabid launch >>> rapid lunch

12/12/2009,"i still have the rapid launch skill, so i am not sure what you are referring to"
12/12/2009,@op: nicely done.
12/12/2009,"this needs to stay on the front page. if ccp nozh did not break the mothership he most certainly broke the naglfar. to have solid, universally accepted changes created basically by the player base promised to be released, then roled back 2 weeks before dominion went live, is basically a hard wet slap in the face straight from ccp to the players.dominion was not a good patch, dominion was and still is an insult to every single player who plays eve, regardless of whether the ship changes will ever affect your character. the naglfar is even worse than it was before. motherships are now huge isk sinks, nothing more, their combat viability is gone, their survivability is gone, there is no reason any pilot in their right mind would take out his ""supercarrier"" now.this is fully supported, and i would again and again if i could. ccp needs to remedy this situation, or i expect alot of their player base will begin to dissapear.ccp, our trust in you to continue to produce a quality, solid game is gone. our faith in you as competent developers is gone. our faith in you to understand the basic mechanics of your own game is gone. congratulations on alienating the majority of your player base with this patch."
12/12/2009,"meh, of all the screwed up button positioning in the game, this isn't one of them. at least ""align"" and ""warp"" are related functions, while ""make active"" and ""trash"" are not. if you wind up hitting the wrong button, it's not that big of a deal. if you want to warp and hit ""align"" by mistake, you're still getting yourself set-up for warping. if you want to align and hit ""warp"" by mistake, you get the ""warp drive active"" notification, your speed gauge switches to ""warping,"" and you can cancel out in plenty of time. the only exception is if you're in a frig, in which case, why are you aligning and not closing on the enemy?anyway, not supported."
12/12/2009,"i bought 10 of each - just 5 for the eos which i never actually used, and i unplug them ... not jumpclone."
12/12/2009,"why not bring fleet size in as a variable , so smaller fleets like up to 30 ppl could get 3% bonuses and as fleet size increase the bonus goes down to 2% at 100+ ppl fleets.this way small fleets get the boost but larger ones dont.also info warfare is the best for small/med fleets where ewar matters much more."
12/12/2009,remove insurance for getting concordokken and for self destruct.
12/12/2009,"while i agree that suicide ganking in hisec is a problem, i'm not sure that harshening consequences is worth it. maybe drop insurance to 50%, but for gods sake don't remove it. it keeps everyone from running around afk in untanked indy's full of valueable stuff.make it worth the ganker's time to study each victim, for instance with the above insurance nerf he has to make sure that he can cover his 50% loss, and thus won't kill just every hauler that comes his way. but if this is to happen, consider nerfing concord a bit (each ship equivilant of a top-tier sleeper vessel perhaps) so that the extremely dedicated might live long enough to finish a victim. to prevent abuse each additional offender spawns a new set of vessels, and sets keep coming until the ganker(s) is(are) destroyed.other than that mess away, but don't give in and let the idiots prosper."

12/13/2009,long overdue.
12/13/2009,"yep, pos could be a really cool and fun thing to play with, just like ships are now, but on a different scale. the current setup just makes them a necessary evil that everyone hates."
12/13/2009,but i thought they fixed everything with dominion... wait...
12/13/2009,"stil, just shut up. you've been clearly proven wrong already, you just blindly refuse to admit it. you're just trolling now. just shut up.and anyway, yes it is bloody fair that caldari get bonuses to all 4 damage types! they're the missile race! missiles are all-damage weapons! what part of this are you not comprehending?!"

12/13/2009,enthusiastically supported.i'm fleet salvager during mission ops and it would be very handy for the missioners to just throw me a bookmark.i like scanning. mainly i'm hunting hidden ore but i have corpmates who like different things i can find and who are willing to give me a finder's fee. it would be so much simpler to throw them a bookmark rather than meeting up to jetcan it or docking to contract it.and as a miner i have preset positions for belts in my favorite systems. it would save a lot of trouble in group mining ops to assign people bookmarks for their position so that we don't end up on top of each other mining the same rocks.lots of utility to this idea no matter what aspect of eve appeals to you.
12/13/2009,v
12/13/2009,"oh yeah, i'm so a fan of this."
12/13/2009,this is core functionality that should be made less clunky than it is today.though the people who want local bookmarks need to stop and think. converting bm's to a form outside the server allows for the creation of arbitrary bookmarks by third part tools.

12/13/2009,bump for gallente
12/13/2009,"supporting for gallente, boost the worst race... cuz they really are"
12/13/2009,"i would support a very large tracking buff, say 50% more. also a bit more damage, say 20%.i think though, however, i would like to see alot more drones and drone flexibility on all gallente ships. all frigs should having a drone or two eve. and ships should have space for spares, or a set of lights on the mega and other ships. this would give gallente flexibility they currently seriously lack."
12/13/2009,"this isn't comparing apples to oranges. you can't have an idea of relative balance without comparing the performance of ships. i compared the performance of a tier3 turret bs to a tier 3 turret bs. it's hardly stretching the imagination. and i did so specifically to counter a misconception that was brought up about blasters reaching 40km.you are right about the complaint with gallente ships. by the time you swing around and burn towards the primary, it's usually all ready dead or close to it. after a few ships, you'll also be capped out from whirling around the field with your mwd churning. this isn't the fault of bad piloting or target calling though. there's nothing you can do when you're out of range of the primary except attempt to close or fire at something else.your statement about target calling doesn't really help your argument. you specifically shoot at gallente ships because you know they usually have to sacrifice tank for dps and speed and they won't be able to shoot back at normal engagement ranges. i've seen the same thing done regularly as well. granted if the blaster boats get in range they pose a real threat, but that rarely happens anymore."
12/13/2009,"supported, gallente have been sub-par for some time."
12/13/2009,supported because it will improve corporation logistics.
12/13/2009,"lately in the gallente push we have been getting some nice small fleet and solo fights because the systems are so far away from nourv. there are some pirates too.i figured out that there has to be an incentive for people to plex. a lot of people can't really stand doing it, and i can't blame them for it! if there was some sort of lp reward for killing the npcs inside and to capture the plexes, more people would be interested in running them and this would attract people who like killing these people, increasing the population actively participating in plex fights and captures.i also think that the lp payout for pvp kills has to be increased significantly, at least 10x to make any impact what so ever, and make it not bugged so everyone gets a share of it, not only the person with the killmail."
12/13/2009,"i also think it would be a good idea to have missions where you have to ferry supplies to stations and staging points throughout lowsec in order tog get lp. you could choose missions that could be dine in frigates, cruisers or in industrials, but these would all have to be handed out by special agents so they don't conflict with normal fw missions.i mean it would make sense to use pilots to ferry goods/supplies into enemy territory or into captured friendly lowsec systems from highsec points, like blockade running supplies into intaki, or running fuel/ammo into staging points withing enemy territory."
12/13/2009,fw is just a mess with all the broken mechanics. please devote some resources to finish what you started ccp!

12/13/2009,"this change is urgently required.would also be very helpful to have some kind of tag column in the watch list, even if something as basic as a choice between eg: ""fc"" ""scout"" ""squad"" ""logistics"" ""other"". or even just a/b/c/d/e. max of 10 per tag would be just fine tyvm if that is necessary."
12/13/2009,"makes sense. i like it. might save your ass if you're engaged at close range with an enemy ship while trying to remote rep an ally who's flying the same hull. if you fired on your ally and repped your enemy, you'd never live it down."

12/13/2009,yes please
12/13/2009,"1) no insurance, period, if concord is the one who blows up your ship - regardless if you have it or not.i fear i might actually have to explain this change, but should be obvious...in case it is not i'd like csm to ask ccp to make this change. this would balance out all the folks who have 'suicide alts' who spam suicide players for profit because they platinum insure their ships, thus making the having an alt take all the negative security + lose no isk while their main and/or friend profit with no risk actually require some real thought (ie: having to make sure your target is really carrying enough to cover the ship + mods, as a whole, that you are about to lose).<insert suicide gankers crying because no risk isk opportunities would be actually made risky>"
12/13/2009,works for me
12/13/2009,"i won't vote on this subject because: a) i have no suicide ganking alts; b) i haven't been suicide ganked ever;...however, you do realize that removing insurance for concord blown ships don't remove the suicide ganking itself? do the math yourself if you don't trust my word."
12/13/2009,"as long as this is accompanied by a similarly ""small"" change to concord - ""evading concord is no longer considered an exploit"" then fine.if you want realistic insurance, then i want realistic police in return.<insert high sec carebears crying because no risk isk opportunities should only be allowed for people they like>"
12/13/2009,"i have no problem with that, really. you can't escape them, because to do so you'd have to get out of high sector space and the odds of that happening are next to zero. but, i find most suicide gankers, regardless, are failures at pvp and generally unsuccessful at the game as a whole. the basic reason they've resorted to this tactic is an oversight in game mechanics on ccp's part.that being said: i don't want to stop suicide ganks, i just want the practice of it made into a real risk management process (such as 0.0 rating, pirating, etc). as it stands right now, you can easily rake in a few quick billion with an alt character you spent 2 weeks training (at most) with a few friends. it should be more profitable to war declare than suicide gank.if concord removed your insurance payout because they were the ones who popped you, then suicide gankers would have to do more of a cost-benefit analysis, more reconnaissance, etc.i've only been 'suicide ganked' once, in a shuttle, with nothing in it. the other times i've had it attempted on me (freighter, once in a drake even, no joke) they've all failed and the only reason it was attempted was:1) exploit of being able to create and throw away alternative characters. very few are 'professional' ones that do ratting to rebuild their status to -2.2) the exploit of being able to be paid (sometimes at a profit even) for dying to concord even without getting phat lewtttzzz.folks, this isn't rocket science. ""realistically"" all-state does not come into your jail cell after you've had your car shot up in a shootout with the police and issue you a check.edit:tl/dr: if you want to suicide gank, you will now have to risk your isk because insurance won't pay out. so you can still gank the stupid carebears with phat lewtz in unprotected/unescorted ships, but now you can't just 'give it a go' on anyone randomly because you won't hardly lose anything. this 'balances' this. no one should ever be 'safe' in high sec, but at the same time, risk must be associated with everything."
12/13/2009,"it would also render whole classes of targets economically invulnerable to suicide ganking, specifically freighters, unless concord was considerably nerfed, say back to how it was in 2006.it takes about 25-50 bs to kill a freighter before concord arrives - that's around 2.5-6b. therefore the freighter needs to be carrying more than 5-12b in cargo for it to even begin to be a viable target.given that - as you say - you're not against the practice of ganking per se, the huge nerf of insurance removal would also need to be accompanied by a roughly similar boost, via reduction in concord response times, allowing escape from concord, reforming war-decs, limiting npc corps in some way or whatever else. without this balance, your proposal is incomplete. as presented, it is simply yet another huge boost to hi-sec, when hi-sec already has an overwhelming economic advantage. why does hi-sec need boosting even further?"
12/13/2009,"i don't think you 'get' the point of this thread. if something takes a few dozen people to gank it before concord comes then yes, you should be hitting some 5-10+ billion isk target, not just any target because it's there and insurance on some ships is a net gain currently."
12/13/2009,would be interesting to get an official comment on this now.if so then using it will be an exploit until it is fixed.
12/13/2009,supporting this./signed
12/13/2009,"eve established a sad record: it's the first game i'm playing without sounds, starting today.the reason is that new sound file they implemented in dominion that makes it unbearable to sit near any jump or warp gates - unless you turn down your world level to a minimum.i was close to that measurement a while ago when the active shield hardeners started to sound like a laundry dryer, but zooming out a bit fixed that for me.therefore my proposal: make the ingame sounds more manageable. the 5 sliders can stay the way they are, but how about a few more checkboxes like quieter turret sounds?possible options:station environmentgate environmentmodule soundspropulsionthe function would be the same as the checkbox for the turret sounds that is already there. that way everyone can enjoy the portion of sound he likes, because some of those sound effects in eve really are ... well we are not allowed to cuss on the boards are we?"
12/13/2009,"i completely agree,zooming out only does so much. i would especially like to be able to control the ambient sounds while docked at station (looks at amarr station owners and shakes finger) especially the amarr one's since i can hear the gleefull praise of their ""clergy"" in the background it sometimes drones out either my eve jukebox or my own mp3's playing in the background."
12/13/2009,"hello, hinata onishi.there's a thread for this already called ""[csm/ccp feedback request] how to better use sound in eve?""for me, i'm thinking about leaving it off until the next bit of related news arrives.by off, i mean off off."
12/13/2009,supported though instead of removing censoring alltogether there should be a forum option to turn it on and off.
12/13/2009,nice.

12/13/2009,all in for more bm improvements. will bring up these ideas to include the bm proposal already being brought forward!

12/13/2009,"hello everyone!i came to jita with industrial full of items(about 400 different kinds) and it took me hour and half to sell it all by clickin on each item and pickin sell, then wait till confurmation window and then again 399 times more!after this i was all dipressed, bored, sleeppy and went to bed =)this part of the game ui very dissapointing, so i deside to remake it by myself!voil<U+FFFD>please visit your user settings to re-enable images.this is your items interface, when you selecting several items and clicking right mouse button selling context menu will appear with ability to call ""the sell all"" interface window.please visit your user settings to re-enable images.so this one is ""sell all window"".please visit your user settings to re-enable images.as you see its very easy to use. with this interface it would took me about 2 minutes to sell all my items in jita.ps: i'm not saying this is finished ui, but a work-print of idea.pps: sorry for my bad english, it's not my native language"
12/13/2009,"i'll support this basic idea even if reality forces the use of a different implementation method. it isn't the smartest thing to do, but if you don't want to waste your time and just want to quickly dump all your stuff on the market, it should be made possible."
12/13/2009,i actually had another idea about self destructing. reduce the timer to about 10 seconds but change the way it works. self destructing should render the ship unusable but leave normal loot. this is good for pvp'ers and allows the player to keep them from stealing the entire ship. i would also say in event of self destruct the pod would gain a 5 second targeting invulnerability from the radiation of the blast. the pirate is happy because he gets your faction mods and your happy because you got away safly in your pod win win
12/13/2009,i fully endorse this product/service.
12/13/2009,"low priority or not, these would be insanely easy to implement. take the models from the armor bots, effect from remote hull reppers, add a new item id to the database, copy some stats to said id, and bam. hull maintenance bots."
12/13/2009,"seems simple enough, and makes enough sense to have."
12/13/2009,"to all of you new, old, and future delegates:if you do not wish us, the players, to voice our opinions in all ways we possibly can (here, other subforums, and using the in-game mail) then you should increase your cspa charge, or simply tell us to shut up because you don't honestly give a damn about any matters save your own personal issues.if you don't increase, or even set, your cspa charges to make people mailing you in-game costly then you should not argue when players communicate with you by that avenue.you are the csm, you've put yourself forward for the position, so don't bitch when people send you in-game mail."
12/13/2009,"oh, you must be the guy who forwarded one particular proposal of his to the entire csm by means of a mass mail.fyi - i told you not to do that again not because i don't care, but because having your inbox spammed silly by people who think they have the greatest idea since sliced bread is bloody annoying. i am very open to suggestions but please think your ideas through thoroughly before you post them here as proposals. if they live long enough to garner decent support, we will notice them eventually.you certainly weren't the first one to attempt to get some attention by mass mailing the entire csm, so i will repeat what i told you in-game..please don't do that for every issue, it won't help your case."
12/13/2009,that's a nice false dichotomy you've got there.

12/13/2009,exactly!
12/13/2009,"all of csm members read assmbly hall threads on a regular basis. we even discuss most of them and we also raise issues together. appart from that, as mentioned above, there is in game chat channel called ""csm public""."

12/13/2009,yes please!
12/13/2009,"1. officer web/scrams/dissys have been in game for many years before capital ships were even concieved let alone in game.1. the cost of officer webs/scram/dissy is a function of the free market ( supply and demand ) and is not designed into game to limit there usage.2: the non docking of super caps is a deterent to personal ownership and low sec usage.3: no one is suggesting that alliance ""give"" supercaps to anyone , the original intent was that they would be corporation assets flown in alliace cap fights by trusted pilots. whether or not things turned out that way , that was the original role/purpose of moms.4: mom lowsec gate camps are an abuse/misuse of moms , not there intended purpose.5: max 25 drones ( more likely 20 ) or max 4 reps ( with capacitor support ) which ever .6: enother dps to kill the titan in 15 , you do the math.6. the anti-cap role of supercarriers is still in the design phase , and will probably be roled out at some point.there current design has nothing to do with anti-titan.7: if you think you can buy invulnerability then you are playing the wrong game.most moms that get engaged in low sec , get engaged by mixed fleets with or without cap support.they are increadable difficult to kill , esp with triage carry support.i have personally witnessed one withstand a beating from 12 rr bs + 20 support, with the aid of 2 x triage carriers and then withstand another beating from 16 damage fitted megathrons !and you want to make this 5 x stronger , lmao.moms are tough enough.and so what if 210b worth of titans can pop one , that 10x the isk cost fielded and they can do so only once an hour.if you fly a sniper sliep , you can insta t2 frigs , thats a 300m ship instaring 30m frigs and a sniper sliep can do that once every 20 seconds.the only difference between the two scenarios in the number of zero's in the equation.20b is nothing compared to 210b.if you cant afford to lose a 20b ship , dont fly a 20b ship.eve is better played with fear in your heart, thats what makes it so intense , there should be no safe options.this campaign should really be called get ***** pilots out of moms , because they dont deserve to fly them."

12/13/2009,"why not? it does for me. very, very clear.1. what you think it's meant for is irrelevant. it does the job.2. what you're saying is not true, seeing as the in-game log disappears after every session change. the text file logs located on your hard drive eve folder are those that are meant to be used after the battle."

12/13/2009,"no.your suggestion is still pointless. why should 1 ship have a better autopilot than others, especially when it's one of the fastest ships in the game?you have not given a sound and/or reasonable answer to that question."
12/13/2009,"no. shuttles are very useful as they are at this moment. they're not made for autopiloting, but to protect your pod from being ganked anywhere - from 0.0 to highsec. this suggestion is thus pointless."
12/13/2009,"really??the point being ccp didn't want wtz to start with, so why would they make anything that boosts ap anytime soon?"
12/13/2009,and make it impossible for me to infiltrate + gank missioners' nightmares? nty.
12/13/2009,"well, for the overview i believe that a way to make it work better would be to change it from the current spreadsheet style to one that is able to display important information in a larger rectangle rather than columns. in addition, when something was selected in the overview, instead of a selected windows the rectangle would expand to include the buttons for the commands that would normally be displayed in the selected windows. another addition would be to have a better ""sort by type"" option. this way instead of relying on multiple tabs to separate data, which can sometimes lead to further confusion difficulty, instead it would be much more logically. for example; all ships would always be displayed before station, which would come before stargate, etc. as it is now there is now way to keep all of the ships together and isolated from other overview items without the usage of tabs. i would also like for there to be tags on items so when i search for logical terms in the market place, ie cpu upgrades, anything that is a cpu upgrade appears and not just the non-existent items that have cpu upgrade in the name. browsing the marketplace can also be made a bit simpler. for example; the search bar should be persistant over the list on the left side and that list should not show every individual item but instead stop at the item type, ie cpu upgrade. the right side would be split into an upper and lower section. the upper section would have rectangular section (similarly to the overview changes i proposed) which would be the objects that fall under the section selected on the left side. the lower section would be the current spreadsheet of prices for the selected item. also the lower section would be separated further into tabs, eg sell, buy, graphs, etc. all, people would be able to add labels to items so that when searching for say ""pvp raven"", anything that i gave a label of ""pvp raven"" would appear. (so basically give the new mail ui to the markplace."
12/13/2009,"yes, yes, yes. totally supported. i wrote about this in another topic, ill copy it here since this thread seems more popular :)we all know eve has a steep learning curve and ccp has tried to ease people in with new tutorials etc. but as i and a couple of my friends started playing eve some weeks ago, i think that user interface is one of the most glaring issues of eve. now that i have learned basics and starting to be more accustomed with eve, interface is still my biggest complaint.looking at screenshots from earlier versions of the game, interface looks alot like todays interface. considering all the graphical etc. revamps, it's odd that interface, certainly more important part of any game than graphics, hasn't got revamp.there is way too much clicking, right click menus, lists, deep menus etc. everything from ship control panel and target action window to chat interface and inventory management could use a ton of functionality improvements and streamlining(neo com is ok, minimized). im certain that all current functionality of interface could be done much better if whole thing would be done from scratch.in short, i think that revamping game's interface would greatly benefit new player experience and also old players(tho say if you dont agree).my issues with interface:- menus are too deep and hard to find- too many right click functions and menus- combat interface is like 'playing' some desktop application. alot of clicking on overview and target action window. right clicks for distance chances etc. doesn't feel very active or involved.- drone management is pain. collapsaple menus and right clicking.- chat stuff could be just copied from wow or any other mmo+eve security features. stuff like easy private messages and messages from many channels on one window etc.- tactical view. maybe you guys have found it useful but i havent, atleast yet.- took me while to notice how to know if im being jammed, i guess it's fine now that i noticed that bar... but these kind of things could be easier to notice.- comparing items is hard. it takes a while to compare for example, what turret would be best for my ship.- icons and colors on overview. i have no idea what some of that stuff actually means. would be nice if that stuff was more evident without googling.im sure there is alot more complaits and improvements to be made, but those are some off the top of my head."
12/13/2009,"i reject your proposal for the following reasons:# the ""agent won't give you the same mission twice"" mechanic is working perfectly and as intended. the problem you're encountering is that you've been handed one of a handful of mission chains where rejecting a mission will give you an ""alternate"" mission to complete instead. this mission is a precursor to the epic mission arcs that are now present in eve, and one of the few where you go up against tier 3 npc battleships. all in all, driving a wedge is a very unique mission chain, and should not just be thrown out because a mission farmer doesn't approve of it.# your goal (at least in the first part) is to kill the ambassador, killing anything else is optional. that's 1 faction ship you have to kill, 1 ship. surely your high and mighty faction standings can take the hit of killing a lone cruiser, can't they?so the way to solve your problem is this: you accept the first mission, warp into the mission area and waste the ambassador. the other ships present will all warp off. mission complete. then you can freely go and turn down the second part as that involves considerably more slaughter and standings loss. problem solved."
12/13/2009,"i cannot support this proposal on one main ground: they're both the same mission, and you can decline both of them with it only counting as one mission. the lockout you were discussing doesn't exist.i don't run anti-faction missions, but i don't want them to go away. it's part of the freedom of choice that is mmos, and this mission is exactly like every other anti-faction mission once you realize this 'trick'."
12/13/2009,"unless you're in fw there should be no missions against opposing factions, only opposing factional sub-groups (as we now have with 'gist' 'centi' ect).that way you can run these missions without utterly destroying whatever faction standings you may have.if it's factional warfare, however, it should not be changed."
12/13/2009,"bunyip: excellent, i did not know they counted as a single mission. thank you for that. and no, this wasn't a ""remove all faction kill missions"" post. my problem was simply with how this mission appeared.zak: as standings hits are always equal to the highest-value target you hit, the fact that it's ""one ship"" doesn't matter, as all standings hits from killing things are just ""one ship."" once you kill a single faction ship, you might as well kill everything of equal or lesser value to it within the next 20 minutes in that system, as you will not be penalized any more for them. and yet, even though all these standings hits are all ""one ship,"" many people keep trashing their standings."
12/13/2009,nothing obliges me to take every reply seriously and his idea of how a multiplicative bonus works was simply incorrect.
12/13/2009,"not supported. t2 sentries are fine, and skills for the sake of skills are pointless."
12/13/2009,simple process. make the number of lp one gets from killing enemy militia ships directly proprotional to the percentage of systems the militia owns. this way militia members get paid more for owning and defending more systems. also maybe the quality of missions are imrpoved by owning more systems.

12/14/2009,"ccp already did a mastermind's job by creating modular ships and (*cough,cough*) balancing them. all they need to do in order to keep the poor horse from being endlessly flogged is rinse and repeat, right? come on, give the wizkids at art department another challenge,and give us that bloody horse... uhm... pos!i dunno... if somebody keeps smirking and quietly watching other people crying their lungs out, yet doesn't lift a finger - for years! wouldn't that show a certain level of sadism? no offense though."
12/14/2009,"with the new soverignty structures it seems like ccp is taking a progressive approach to walking into this. they have removed soverignty mechanic from pos'es and done what appears to be a modular setup on those structures.now its a matter of gradually moving the existing archaic pos code over to the simplified modular format.but, that said, we need to keep the pressure on them...*whack thwap*"

12/14/2009,"i also have a problem reading it at 1920x1080 on my 42"" lcd. all the lower non native resolutions have a blurred degraded look to them. 1152 is the next best resolution and it still looks horrid(except for the fonts which i can then read). i've wondered if i could trick eve into using a different font. either change the font file in windows or perhaps somehow inject a different font...similar to how people do graphics model changes in other mmos, put an uncompressed file in a certain folder etc."
12/14/2009,yes please!
12/14/2009,"great idea and obviously fully supported! (and yes, this is perhaps a better place to bring it up)"
12/14/2009,"a game that's as text-driven as eve should really have far more font options than those currently available. choosing between a small list of serif and sans-serif fonts, and being able to set the text size of individual windows or the game universally would help alot.i have trouble reading some of the text, and my vision is quite good. my father (who plays) complains quite a bit about having trouble reading things."
12/14/2009,do want.
12/14/2009,blasters do seem to be a pretty weak weapon. your opponent will always have an easy plan of trying to keep range and if they can you are dead. if he sees you took the 10 seconds to load null he can move in and your transversal sucks. so you must dedicate resources to closing range but your tank often won't hold when you do.i agree the tracking should either be enhanced *or* the tracking of lasers and autocannons should be nerfed *or* a bit of both. the damage should be boosted a bit too.
12/14/2009,the double tracking on a eam laser surprised me alot.i fail to see any reason for it.

12/14/2009,"this.i can live with either hdr or aa being available, if both aren't supported at the same time (as is the case with games like oblivion and fallout). though i'd like to see both toggleable independently in eve, there definitely needs to be an option to enable aa in eve itself. resorting to third-party software like nhancer (as good as it may be) shouldn't be a requirement in any modern game. aa isn't some new-fangled tech, it's core in gaming these days.for that matter, antisotropic filtering should be an option too (i don't remember seeing an option for it, though i don't have the game here ate work to check). it would help alot with the shimmering of station textures.as for shadows: yeah, their really bad. when zoomed out a ways, they look ok. when looking over your ship in dock or zoomed in in space, they are far too blocky."

12/14/2009,"yeah, forcing people to bump in large quantities is bad, especially when bumping mechanics are as silly as they are."
12/14/2009,"this would be far more helpful than the relatively long text that flashes across my screen in combat.being able to better differentiate between incoming and outgoing (incl. drone) damage would be much appreciated. something like having the damage values displayed at different parts of the screen (incoming on left, outgoing on right for example) would make things clearer.making the damage display mobile would help alot too."
12/14/2009,it would be cool
12/14/2009,"i support this idea so long as there is also the option to enslave tourists, homeless and so on."
12/14/2009,"linkagesupported, mainly so i can continue to convince myself that i don't need to see a doctor about feeling guilty when i biomass slaves"
12/14/2009,these make good sense.
12/14/2009,"i completely support this idea, though i agree the drone interface needs a bigger overhaul.it seems odd that you can see the damage a drone has sustained while it's flying about remotely, but once it docks with your ship you no longer have any idea. fixing this would help immensely when re-launching t2 drones after spawn wave, if you're trying to prevent your severely damaged drone from joining the battle and getting destroyed."
12/14/2009,"supported.also, the other posters in this thread who said it were right, drones need a massive looking at in terms of their mechanics."
12/14/2009,"has been asked for 900 times, and hopefully it will be done some day."
12/14/2009,drones need looked at so this would be pretty essential.

12/14/2009,"i support the idea of fixing the timer on these forums.either use a captcha code for each post within a timeframe (5 minutes), or simply reduce the post time limit to a reasonable time like 1 minute. the forums already require a game account to post afik, and if you wish to further reduce the possibility of spammers, you can limit trial accounts to only a post on a ""new user"" forum section."

12/14/2009,that's a lot of megas.+1 for this though
12/14/2009,"i fully support a clearer tilde at small font sizes, though this should really be part of the larger font overhaul: [issue] the eve font.i also agree that tilde should be mappable. there's really no reason why it shouldn't be."
12/14/2009,"i think this is just one of the many tiny issues that's wrong with the ui that tend to pile on fast. and we do need many, many ui tweaks."
12/14/2009,"regardless of mechanics, a cool-down timer and evemail to executor corp directors."
12/14/2009,"not supported. it's the wrong solution to the wrong problem.there is no 'disband alliance' button, you kick corps until there is no-one in the alliance except the executor. it should always be possible to lock down rogue corps and kick them from the alliance before they can do damage, what's needed is a better way of managing that than the current implementation.bear in mind that the potential damage is more than simply role abuse, it bleeds over into other areas that can't really be addressed by mechanics - such as trust and misinformation. you can strip an individual's roles and kick him 24 hours later because there's not so much damage he can do in that time as a single person with (presumably) limited access to anything important. if you lock down an entire corp in that way however you open yourself to problems with misunderstandings, allies not getting the 'don't trust these guys they are getting kicked' messages and a massive potential for drama during whatever pre-kicking period you have. far better from an alliance-leader's point of view to simply cut them loose and set them red, that way there's much less chance of problems and everyone can see exactly where they stand.so, while i agree that a single individual shouldn't be able to disband an alliance, i don't agree with any of the solutions put forwards in this thread."
12/14/2009,i like this idea.
12/14/2009,i like this idea
12/14/2009,makes sense to me.supported!
12/14/2009,"yes, please."
12/14/2009,howdy.the directional scanner has been mildly offset from center camera/screen for quite some time and appears to have become worse since most recent patch.basically when scan angle is reduced from 15 to 5 degrees the actual scan is offset from center by at least 5 degrees and probably closer to 10 degrees. for you fps types it would be like having your cross-hair shifted left/right of center.it is really irritating. we should not have to use kentucky windage to get an accurate 5 degree scan towards objects fairly close together.please ensure valid center for both 4:3 and 16:9 monitor users.thanks.supported.
12/14/2009,"just to emphasize this problem - currently in the metro defense, the situation is as follows.right after dt, a lot of plexes are around. you go and capture as many as you can (alts help a lot here). the further you are from dt, the fewer plexes you have available.a concrete example. we had a single major complex to capture yesterday in an over four hour period. right before dt, there were no plexes at all in any of the defensive minmatar systems.dt happens. post-dt? in various systems:major, 2x medium3x majormajor, medium4x majorthe same is true for amarr systems, except they're less heavily fought-over right after dt, so you have a few more later in the day.this means the whole war is about ""who can bring the bigger force right after dt."" as dt ends usually before the official 12:00, most plexes are already captured when dt officialy ends.and this is supposed to ""work sufficiently well"" according to ccp."
12/14/2009,"this really needs to happen, why hasn't this happened yet?the old effect was terrible, this one is worse, and there is no need for sensor boosters to have an effect anyway.same goes for tracking computers, and probably every other static effect on a module which is designed to run indefinitely."
12/14/2009,"sensor booster and eccm make my eyes bleed, especially when both used.also, the old railgun and cyno effects were better."
12/14/2009,"the sensor booster effect looks horrible and sadly it's not the only one. in general the old effects were a lot more ""realistic"" and immersive than the fantasy-style magic effects we get now.back in the days when helping out with beta-testing, the warp effect was a big part of the reason i kept messing about with eve. (well, what else was there to do apart from mining or hauling at that time? ;) ) the warp effect now is laughable.. most of the time i barely notice the effect regardless of having shaders, bloom, hdr, etc. set to the max.what makes eve look bad though is the horrid pixel-stairs you find everywhere. would be nice to see a smooth line for a change now that the year is almost 2010.so anyway, supported! give us a reason to turn effects back on. instead of enhancing the gaming experience, they make the game unbearable whenever there's more than a handful of ships on screen."
12/14/2009,"i remember the subtle effect before this ray of light was introduced, it was good and subtle. even the old one was much better than this. what also bothers me is how it's possible that many of the effects have a center outside of the ship. my suggestion to ccp is just review all effects again.i support this post."
12/14/2009,in all honesty a screen full of sebo's going gives me a wonderful headache of epic proportions. it does need to be less.... visually loud.
12/14/2009,"yes!there was a short period during apocrypha 1.0.1 or 1.0.2 iirc when there was a beautiful and subtle new sebo effect, which then got exchanged with the effect used for ecm burst of that time. please, give us that subtle sebo effect back.not only does it give serious headaches, it also has serious performance issues when looking close at 50+ ships running sebo."
12/14/2009,"precisely! also, it only takes 16 or so people in threshers to drop a freighter, as well. but, if that freighter is dumb enough or any ship to carry a lot of isk in their cargohold compared to their escort/defenses -- well, that's what suicide ganks are for.i want suicide ganking to still be a danger (especially for all those who carry bpos in shuttles), but, i also want it to be done like real crime is: you stake out targets, you hit when no one is looking, and you maximize revenue because you are not getting any paycheck from anyone except the loot you grab.i don't want suicide ganking to end, let me be clear, but the risk should match the reward. currently, you can suicide, get nothing, and still profit (minus the sec status hit) due to the platinum insurance. that's wrong, and this is no 'high sec' vs null sec argument.in fact, smart folks operate in both and have resources in both."
12/14/2009,"this is fine, as long as concord also gets more realistic powers, like the ability to lock gates against people with negative security status - since we can't chuck them in jail.</sarcasm>in all due seriousness, insurance needs a long hard review by ccp because at present it unnaturally influences not only certain aspects of pvp (to whit suicide ganking) but also adds artificial influences on the general marketplace.while i normally am in the ""remove insurance for concord and self-destruction"" camp, any changes to the insurance mechanics are going to have far reaching impacts on other areas of the game, and they need to be considered carefully. the answer may be ""this is the best we can do and keep the game balanced"" and that's fine, but i still think the question needs to be asked.i'm not supporting the op's particular proposal, but i am adding a thumb for the csm taking up insurance with ccp and getting them to have a look at it."
12/14/2009,i'm not sure that is correct. could you provide numbers?
12/14/2009,"i can only support this if concord response times/effects are nerfed to the point where suicide ganking is not adversely affected by the changes. yeah, you should still die, but you should be able to kill a bigger target in a smaller ship if you're going to lose insurance. suicide ganking is not a problem, but i'd be fine with the change for reasons of internal consistency as long as gankers aren't nerfed in the process."
12/14/2009,"i would say it is roughly as accurate as your numbers. take a group of pests and you really dont need 50 bs, and there is nothing the freighter pilot can do about it, especially since the suicide gankers make isk from the insurance."
12/14/2009,so... numbers?
12/14/2009,"charon has 6000 shield(110/400 resisted), 20000 armor(130/400 resisted), and 106250 hull. base, that's 8276+29630+106250 = 144,156 ehp. with maxed hp skills and no gang boosting, that's 180,195 ehp. assuming concord takes 30 seconds to spawn, you need 6006.5 dps applied to it. we can ignore tracking and range, presumably, so we look at the raw dps and say that the magic number is 6-7 battleships. of course, from my knowledge of concord spawn timers, 30 seconds is probably long - if it's, say, 15 seconds, then you need 12-14. if you're comparing destroyers, the highest i can pump a destroyer with a suicide gank fit(meta-0 gear, faction ammo) is 266 dps at perfect skills, so you can replace one battleship with four catalysts. if you're willing to fit it nicer(with the commensurate increase in costs), it's 5 destroyers replacing 2 battleships. in other words, you'd need 15 t2 fit catalysts for 30 seconds to kill a charon with maxed hp skills."
12/14/2009,im for removing insurance for suicide gankers (and self destructs) if measures are taken so that suicide ganking remains viable. hi sec should not become safe. nerf concord- then you can nerf insurance.
12/14/2009,bumping this to make sure it stays up there to annoy the dev's
12/14/2009,sounds like a good idea to me.
12/14/2009,good idea.
12/14/2009,makes sense and eases another part of corp upkeep.

12/14/2009,"anything that is reproduced by the bh is labelled a defect, essentially just means the report has been validated and continues up the chain (at least that is how i understand the system).if the standings not transferring is unintended game design, why have they brushed off all comments about it the past (almost) 2 years?on a positive note, it means they have started working on fixing our worn-down home which is a good thing indeed .. fingers crossed for a massive revamp of the system and not just patch jobs to shut people up."
12/14/2009,"the usual reply is ""this is by design, if you think it is bad design, please post to the features and ideas discussion forum"" - if it's a bug, it's not by design.because the bug is not that standings avoid being shot at by npcs, but that you can avoid the standing loss for capturing complexes by being in an allied militia. very different things :-)i just petitioned someone for using this, and got a standard ""thank you for bringing this to our attention, we'll look into it and take the appropriate action"" reply - not the ""this is not an exploit bla bla"" reply they usually do."

12/14/2009,signed.
12/14/2009,yep i agree
12/14/2009,"tl;dr: add to the tactical overlay a representation of ships' speed in the form of speed vectors, visible at any level of zoom. this feature should be removeable from the esc menu to save on client cpu.this should also be mixed with the overview filters, to let the user choose which ships show the speed vector.this proposal was posted on the features board and seems welcome.long version (with motivations):when doing a 1v1, i usually 'look at' my target to see what he's doing and anticipate the reaction time. when the numbers grow, i switch the look at between the various enemies, but it becomes impossible after a little number of targets.resorting to the overview, with its lagged and sporadic changes, is not enough, and also the overview is hard to follow when there's more than a handful of ships in the encounter.solution: to follow the situation visually, have all the ships around you show a vector that points in the direction where they're going, with a length relative to the ship's speed: a speed vector. this permits, at a glance, to see where everybody's moving to, even if zoomed out.possible variants:- smoke trails. the problem is that smoke trails disappear zooming out, i want this to be visible at large zoom levels to help small gang warfare. the two don't exclude each other. also, a vector should cause much less performance issues.possible problems:- lag-- server side lag: none. the vector is a client only thing, the client builds it based on info it already gets-- client side lag: possible. to avoid it completely, add an option under graphics in the esc menu to remove the speed vectors.- crowded overview: possible. it can be avoided adding options that show and not show the speed vectors based on the friendly/unfriendly/in fleet/... status of the ships, in the overview settings."
12/14/2009,1
12/14/2009,"sounds like a good idea. anything that provides more info in combat, while being able to be adjusted and toggled off is welcome in my books."
12/14/2009,"they removed some. far from all. the one i'm more worried about right now is the insurance price floor, which most emphatically has not been removed."
12/14/2009,"this ship class would be meant to be the premier ship to be flown by bonus givers and fc's to cordinate fleets with. it would not be the size of a capital ship but larger than a battleship. it should have a really nice tank and ability to enhance thier fleet via bonuses like the current fleet command ships, but with some added features.currently titans have nice bonuses (i.e. erebus' 7.5% bonus to armor amount per level) when in fleets but very rarely are actually used for that purpose. so the same bonus but a smaller buff like 4-5% per level would come with this ship along with some others for fitting gang mods and ability for anti-support.here is my idea for say the amarr flagship:ship name: (insert something terrifying)slot layout:8 - high5 - medium7 - low4 - turret hardpoints0 - launcher hardpoints3 - upgrade hardpoints400 - calibrationamarr flagship skill bonuses:5% bonus to gang members' capacitor recharge rate and target painter effectivness per level (each race flagship would get the painter bonus to put on the primary target)3% bonus to effectiveness of armored warfare and combat links (see below on description of combat links)10% bonus to medium energy turret optimal range and cap usage20% bonus to medium energy turret damage per levelrole bonus:99% reduction in cpu need for warfare link modulescan fit 4 warfare link modules----------also the ability to store the spoils of war and some emergency back-up ships for the fleet:corporate hanger capacity: 2500 m3ship maintenance bay capacity: 250,000m3----------on another aspect of bonuses i would like to see the following gang links introduced. i tried to think what was the ""achilles heel"" for each races primary damage weapon and thought a link that would slightly buff that would be interesting.combat warfare links:turret cap usage - reduces capacitor needed to fire turrettracking enhancing - increases turret tracking speedoptimal range - increases turret optimal rangemissile impact - increase explosion velocity of missilesall the combat warfare links base bonus would be 1% with max skills of the flagship and other leadership skill putting the bonus up to 12.9375%----------the flagships could only fit medium sized weapons to get the bonuses so it could be helpful for anti-support. as far as power grid and cpu it should be able to fit 4 heavy medium weapons, 4 gang links, 100mn mwd and a pretty good tank. cost should be equivilant to say 3-4 tier 3 battleships.skills required should be the races bs lvl 5, command ships 5, hac 5, some other large size ship related stuff in order to train for the flagship skill itself.in closing it should not be a solo pwn mobile or even worth flying if a gang is less than 50 people in comparison to the isk to field it. it is not jump drive capable, can use gates and warp speed should be slightly slower than a bs. this is probably over powered but some constructive feedback to make it more realistic would be apreciated."
12/14/2009,my idea is meet with silence.
12/14/2009,because it is a bad idea.
12/14/2009,like every aspect of it?
12/14/2009,"the issue there its that tracking/optimal link are usefull for all turrets, cap usage its usefull for hybrids and laser whille explosion velocity its the only one usefull for missile (and wortless for turrets). if the ship its suposed to be used in fleet let someone else use the ewar, and let the flagship use the slot for something more important for its role (like tanking for the caldari/minmatar variants)"
12/14/2009,"you seem to be speccing out fleet-command battlecruisers with gang links. we already have those. if you want more fleet command ships, give them a genuinely different role than the existing fleet commands have. for example, a t2 battleship that gives flat titan-style bonuses to everyone in gang, whether they're a booster or not. i'm not sure how you'd balance such a thing, but it's the sort of idea you would need for them not to be too samey."
12/14/2009,v
12/14/2009,"can we get the t1 destroyers fixed (ie, make them worth flying as anything other than salvaging vessels or easymode l1 mission boats) before we start worrying about inventing new t2 versions?"
12/14/2009,"yeah, this would be very handy. supported."
12/14/2009,"very much supportedi would also suggest:1) making what is now a very small sliver of green (at the top of the module) to toggle overload by left clicking much larger. 2) make the modules show a different color when its overloaded. there seems to be a lag or something and often i find myself squinting at the module tryign to tell whether it is actually overloaded or not. just make the mod glow yellow or blue, purple or orange. whats with the slightly different shades of green to indicate its overloaded?"
12/14/2009,"yes, which is why a self-cleaning ban list would be good. save your real block list for harassment and scammers, use the 24h block list for mildly annoying people and for people who are going to disappear soon enough anyways. i proposed basically this a few weeks ago, but i can support this version too."
12/14/2009,"tl;dr buff gallente plz.people have been whining about gallente being sub-par for a while now, myself included. however everyone seems to cite blasters as the root of all problems. i have a new proposal, involving less changes to hybrids and more to the race shipline as a whole.main different out of the way now, lets give gallente flexibility by increasing drone capacity and usage. all gallente ships should be able to use drones, even if a very minor amount, and they should have spares or extra sets. blasters are severely limiting, and most people seem to think they would be happy if they had a huge damage/tracking buff.i am less convinced. i think we would still complain that the amarr ships are killing the target before we get there, that the caldari torps are beating us up before we get to optimal and that the minmatar are moving too fast. here are some example stats for the ship sizes.all frigates - 10-15mbit bandwidth, 20-30m3 dronebay. ishkur gets 25mbit, 75m3.all cruisers - 40-50mbit bandwidth, 80-100m3 dronebay. vexor gets 75mbit and 225m3. ishtar stays same, maybe some buff to allow guns to be used easier. phobos gets 25mbit and 50m3 possibly.all bc/cs - 50mbit bandiwdth, 150m3 dronebay on the brutix/astarte. 100mbit and 300m3 on myrmidon/eos.all battleships - 125mbit bandwidth, 250m3 dronebay for mega/hyperion/kronos. dominix gets same bandwidth, but 450m3 dronebay.i think these changes alone would get gallente in a much happier place. many people have said gallente also need a tracking buff so they can operate at optimal. while i agree they need a slight buff so that hybrids are better than projectiles for tracking, it would be foolish to buff them too much and allow larger ship classes to engage smaller ones easier. one definite change i think would be a capacitor usage reduction on hybrid weapons, between 30-50%. i fly all the races and its always seemed odd that a skilled up geddon uses as much cap to fire as my megathron.finally for railguns. i think railguns need a 10% rate of fire buff to increase damage output, and either a 20% optimal or tracking buff. beams can hit further, for more damage and with higher tracking. projectiles can hit for huge alpha strikes and use no capacitor. railguns are nothing."
12/14/2009,ccp hates gallente.sad but true.
12/14/2009,"i wouldn't say ccp hate gallente - the nerfs that have come our way have been understandable for the most part, but as the game has become more mid-ranged combat we have been left behind in our rigid ship design."
12/14/2009,"i think you're approaching this from the wrong angle. gallente have issues. not as many as some people like to claim, but it's nonetheless true. the solution to those issues is to fix them, not to paper over them with more drones. make damps good again, make blasters actually have the highest dps in practice in exchange for all their other drawbacks(range, consuming both cap and ammo, etc), and leave drones the way they are on every ship save the myrmidon and maybe the eos(but the eos is a whole other kettle of fish)."
12/14/2009,"yeah, this has always seemed silly. either highlight secondary jumps in a different colour, or bury it in anh option menu somewhere."
12/14/2009,"this is what should be done. it can get a bit confusing when plotting multi-waypoint jumps that include dead-end systems, or returns along the same path. i realize the route display helps, but it should simply be clear in the overview."
12/14/2009,makes me insane. support very very much.
12/14/2009,"hi, after read a loot a topic about invention and mission, i have one proposition.1) the first think. decrease the loot for the mission runner but increase the bounty a little. and make more loot type meta 3 or 4.if you decrease this loot you also decrease the reprocessing and the ore come from the mission runner. in the same time, you increase the loot meta 3 and 4 and the bounty. normaly for the mission runner that will be not difference about isk.2) for the invention, now when you miss your invention you have nothing. i propose to give a chance to give something.exemple : when you miss, you have : 50 % nothing 20 % bpc meta 1 15 % bpc meta 2 10 % bpc meta 3 5 % bpc meta 4in this case the meta come from not only the mission runner but also about the invention.with this proposition. you decrease the ore come from mission runner (good about miner), you increase the possibility for the invention."
12/14/2009,"as the author of the other proposal in question, i fully agree with this statement. seriously, while that'd be a decent short-term fix if there was a real review of drones coming in the next patch, it's not a practical long-term solution. you want them to be as good as the other drones on their own merits, not for them to just be cheaper. i can't support this."
12/14/2009,"amarr have the most imbalanced turrets, comparable drones would just make them broken.also, since no drone boat gets bonuses to a specific race of drone, it makes no odds. it's just as easy to train two levels of gallente drone spec and get a flight of shiny hammerhead iis as it is to get a flight of infiltrator iis"
12/14/2009,"it's not like ships. once you've trained for a race, you're stuck with it, more or less, as cross training is long.with drones, you're about 3d away at any moment from racial drone spec iv, so it makes no real difference.i do agree that, for pure logical purposes, it should be something like this (that is, from left to right, highest dps, from right to left, highest speed / tracking):eithergallente caldari minmatar amarrorgallente caldari amarr minmatarright now amarr has less damage and less speed / tracking than minmatar."
12/14/2009,"it is better to say ""em drones"" because a lot of people confuse amarr drones with amarr ships as i can see. an it is not a boost for amarrs. it is a boost for em drones.but i can't support this way."
12/14/2009,support for the more hp and a redoing of drones on the long term.
12/14/2009,"it makes sense.perhaps it would be possible to add a ""comparison to market"" row, so you could see what items would sell for considerably less than market price."
12/14/2009,if you're dumping that much stuff then the chances are you aren't simply selling to buy orders. i would expect that most 'power sellers' wouldn't be interested in this because they'd have no control over lowball buy orders on low volume items.if you have a lot of stuff to sell and you really don't care what price you get for it then it would almost always be better just to melt it and sell the minerals instead.i don't support this proposal but i am in favour of a redesign of the trading system and improvements to the market ui.
12/14/2009,"funny, i came up with exactly the same idea when i was trying to sell off a few l4s worth of goods in amarr.my only addition to the proposed ""sell all"" window would be to also include a column displaying the ""percentage of regional average"" value (can't remember exactly what it's called in game, but it displays a plus-or-minus percentage in either green or red, respectively) so you can more easily identify items you may not wish to sell."
12/14/2009,"the tax column should be replaced with a ""% of market average"" column, but other than that, yes."
12/14/2009,"what about having a limited selection of colours for each race. to paint your ship, it would cost isk, and you'd get to select a primary and secondary colour from a limited pallete for the faction of the ship (dark greens, blues for gallente for example). some colours would be reserved for only the alternate versions of the ship (t2, navy, etc.)this would prevent crazy rainbow colours, as ccp could limit the colour options to those that work well within the faction, while still allowing some variation. the database strain would be low, as it would be no more than a pair of hex value per ship.as for ship art, i agree it's not a feasible idea as it adds undue strain on the database."
12/14/2009,"all i think needs to be done is adding a few options. just like when ou create your character and make the profile picture. i mean seriously i don't think ccp put pink hair on any of the options in the profile picture (or at least i haven't seen anyone with pink hair). all i want is for them to finally release the different textures they have for all the ships (there are dozens of them) and then allow you to choose say two or three of those textures that would change the paint job of your ship. if you wanted it all one color you would simply choose all one color, if you wanted a black and red ship then you would choose black for one color and red for another.it's not a really hard change, the textures are done, all that you need to do is make the ui to change the paintjob of the ship and setup what parts of the ships are painted for each selection. if you want an example of it what it should probably look like just look at the army painter in the game dawn of war. basically just release it in the next major release as one of the big new things for eve.no pink ships, no neon colored ships, just colors that are already in eve."
12/14/2009,"the angle slider used to have equal spacing between the selectable angles so that all ( even 15% ) were easy to select , then someone thought it'd be a good idea to make the slider proportional to the angle being selected thereby making it extremely fiddly to select he angles that are closer together at one end of the scale.-10/10 for ui designput it back to the way it was before , equal spacing between selectable angles."
12/14/2009,"hmm... and how many times have you been rubbing said person's destruction in his face, i wonder. sorry, but this ""issue"" is nothing more than what you called it yourself: a mere annoyance for killmail addic... err... enthusiasts. nothing more to it.if this thread would be about the completely preposterous insurance claims after a self destruction, my opinion would be way different. but as it is now, i can't support your idea."
12/14/2009,"oh god, yes please.i also agree regarding adding ""align to"" in place of ""approach"" on distant objects for both the shortcut as well as the interface button, as well as shortcuts to each overview tab.i wouldn't object to key bindings for launching drones either."
12/14/2009,this idea makes sense and doesn't detract from the current limits on one-toon-training.supported.

12/14/2009,"while i agree that csm members should set their cspa charge to 0, this is by no means required. the job of a delegate is both an ambassador, a liaison and an idea filter; and therefore i think communication with the delegates is essential.that being said, as a democratic process, you elect the officials with the attitudes and morals which best align with yours, and thus you get what you got. here in america, that principle is proven every election, just as with the csm.and to the last poster, the csm does indeed have some power, but people must see us as commanding the very attention of every ccp employee or something. we do filter, and we can have say in some limited circumstances as to which options do become available or not (a la skill queue), but we are only liaisons and filters, and thus our power is as limited as any other ambassador here in the rl.tl;dr: rock the vote and elect those which represent you."
12/14/2009,"that wasn't his point. the op was suggesting that any csm delegate who didn't have his cspa charge set to an unreasonable level was implicitly agreeing to be spammed by people who are too special to use any of the normal channels such as this forum, the csm public channel etc.further, he suggested that having no cspa charge and not agreeing to be spammed by said special snowflakes clearly means that the delegate in question has no interest in communicating with the rest of the playerbase.it shouldn't be necessary to point out the failure of logic in either of those positions."
12/14/2009,i don't like the idea of people attempting to raise ideas directly instead of using the assembly forum. the csm process needs to be transparent so people can see what is being raised and by which players etc. suggesting things directly to avoid putting your name to a proposal makes people suspect that there are shady deals going on behind the scenes.that said at least one of the mass-mails was to attempt to gain support for an already raised proposal thread and not having access to my ingame mail right this second i can't check who sent that one.i would also suggest that this type of thread be put in the jita park speakers forum.
12/14/2009,it was a friend of the op.
12/14/2009,"uh, 40b worth of titans can pop one bucko. but nice number pulling out of your ass."
12/14/2009,"it is a great start, i am not to sure how much work needs to be done to iron out any wrinkles. one thing is for sure pattern you sure put a lot of effort into creating a usable set of ships for the minmatar race.i am not sure where i read it but to the people thinking that you should need very expensive implants to make a ship tank decent (notice i did not say excellent), what are you smoking? it should be decent before implants. if you can not operate it at a decent level without the implants it is broke. i am going to say this and i hate myself for it but get a drake, it does not require any billion dollar implants to make it good.there is not one ship here that would not benefit from the changes. it is human instinct to resist any change at all, no need to think this will have any major negative effects. it will simply free up a slot usable for you to better customize your ship to your style, may that be ewar, gank or snipe. that is not a bad thing at all, in fact i like to personalize my fits and wish ccp would get rid of a lot of the bonuses. i find too many bonuses do one thing only, they make a parameter for that ship that promotes cookie cutter setups. i for one would like the opportunity to fly ships that no one really knows what to expect when they get in a fight with it. this is one step closer to freedom of choice for minnie pilots."
12/14/2009,"thanks for the sentiments. i'll be sitting out the next race or two though - i haven't gotten close enough to winning to make me feel like i'm doing good things running. i'd rather let good people with a chance get my votes. when i get a better vote base than just forumers i'll probably take another shot at it, but for now i'll be on the sidelines watching."

12/15/2009,"i see a lot of people posting in this thread arguing that blasters are just fine, but i don't see any of those same people with very many, if any, kills using blaster ships. or kills of any sort for that matter.if you don't have solid experience flying blaster ships, and indeed solid experience flying most if not all races ships and ship sizes in pvp, you have no business posting in this thread. zero. none.since dominion i think that the balance between lasers and projectiles is at a really good point. lasers are the benchmark by which all other guns are now judged, and projectiles now have some unique features like real working damage selection with high damage ammo and improved falloff and tracking and so on. the damage curves actually end up being unique enough that each weapon system has it's own advantages and disadvantages.the goal of improving blasters-blasters don't need more range. that's not their role. short range is fine. leave the range alone. they're role is to do massive amounts of damage at extreme short range, and be able to hit reliably inside this small envelope of performance.boost blaster tracking to whatever point is needed to guarantee hits within their optimal range and boost blaster damage to the point that it's significantly more powerful than the next highest dps weapon at that short range (probably lasers) by about 35-45%. yes, you heard right- 35-45%.blasters need to work as well at point blank range as scorch works at long range. in other words, no other gun system should even be in the same league as blasters when fighting at extreme close range. don't like having your face melted off? then don't close to within 4km of a blaster ship. problem solved.t2 ammo is another issue, but t2 short ranged ammo needs to be addressed as well. right now the damage difference between t2 guns/ammo and t1 guns and faction ammo is extremely small. too small in fact. t2 ammo needs to have it's penalties removed and it's damage increased by a large margin so that the combination is clearly superior to t1 guns and faction ammo.as an example, void should have the tracking penalty removed. the longer optimal and shorter falloff make it unique, as does the higher cap use, but it should have significantly higher base damage than faction antimatter to make up for the higher cap use.similar changes need to occur for conflag and hail.blasters need a lot more tracking and a lot more damage. not range. we have lasers and acs for range."
12/15/2009,hey guythe beam as a good tracking ok. but look also the need in capa for that the double of the rail gun.one weapons is not only dps and tracking but also how it's possible to fit your ship.in first time you complaining about blaster and now you are in the railgun. it's not exactly the same weapons
12/15/2009,"yes for a well balanced but significant dmg boost. no tracking boost for blasters. it would ruin life of smaller ships orbiting bigger one, rendering them useless again."

12/15/2009,meh just start shooting the people that bump you ;-pthey will get the message soon enough to use the keep at range option.but improving the bo portal/titan portal to 5k would be f'n nice so still supported but only if they both get it... not 1 or the other
12/15/2009,"supporting this, but only to the point where it eases the worst of the bumping without making it too easy for superblobs to hop around the map./ben"
12/15/2009,"revise your op to take this into account, and yes. until then, no. this thread currently just looks like a mimatar emancipation rally. until i get the opportunity to enslave as well as free i don't see the point."
12/15/2009,yes
12/15/2009,its the simple things that add so much depth.
12/15/2009,"yes, having a bigger watch list would be nice.as for the broadcasts, ccp first needs to fix the broadcasted target icons so that they actually clear off your overview when the target is dead. as a person who uses the broadcasted target option quite a bit, it's annoying as hell to see your overview littered with those s1, s2, s3 bullseyes stuck to crap like planets, gates, etc because they don't clear off properly.once the overview bugs are fixed, then implement the broadcast target portion."
12/15/2009,"its been brought up before, but now with the new titan hp boost.. and (removed by ccp nozhnothing) proposed mom hp buff.we are looking at a sheer imbalance between armor tanked and shield tanked titans. already are we at a point where titans real tank is in hp alone, and now we bring into the mix the balance between hg slaves and crystals.even if crystals worked on titans we would still be looking at an imbalance. i dont want crystals touched, believe me otherwise its just more of the same and no diversity, rather i would like to see slaves brought inline with crystals and not work on cap ships. basically with 0 stacking between slaves, trimarks, and akemons/zet5000 you are far surpassing what crystals could even hope to acheive on a shield tanked titan.also bring up the fact that if your a shield tanked titan and you cyno into a fight, you are loosing a huge chunk of ehp due to gang bonuses not being applied to shield instatly as it is with armor. the larger these tanks get, the more glaring this issue becomes.i understand for many cap pilots this may be unwanted, because you already have those slave sets/capitals... but honestly you have to look at it from both sides of the spectrum... it needs balanced.tldr: remove slaves from affecting capitals and bring them inline with crystals(which already dont work on capitals)"
12/15/2009,"supporting my own topic 5min later because ccp is too *pants meet head* to actually moderate properly/prevent trial accounts from posting and instead thinks 5min is enough time to wait with their ""awesome"" forums logging you out every other minute"

12/15/2009,"not supported, get em to fix crystalls instead of asking em to nerf"
12/15/2009,hp tanked shield titans have more ehp than armor tanked ones useing slave sets.that is all.
12/15/2009,and now show me one of those 60m ehp buffer shield tanked titans. you can get those easily with an erebus.
12/15/2009,they cant post...
12/15/2009,"*correction*while you may be right in theory, the leviathan fitting required to beat an erebus / avatar in ehp is so extremely expensive that it can be pretty much ruled out (requires 4x estamel invuls), and it is far from pracitcal because it has **** for cap and no free slots at all. the armour titans on the other hand can reach 40+ mil ehp with a very reasonable fitting and have a lot of mids to spare and no general fitting problems.fun fact: with all mids overheat the leviathan can reach 140 mil ehp."
12/15/2009,"i dont fly titans so just shush me if i'm wrongbut dont the shield tanked capitals actively tank beter than armor (boost amplifiers working for cap modules and nano-pumps not working), and in fact all shield ships have better active tank, but armor is always better for ehp"
12/15/2009,not much to be said.
12/15/2009,"just in case you missed it. local tanking titans now is far from viable. given their raw hitpoints, you dont get any decent rep out of capital armor reps to rep enough. an erebus with t2 trimarked, slave implants,akemon's implant and bonuses from a damnation pilot with mindlinks has 6.4m hp armor. even without the t2 trimarks and leaving the implants/damnation we still have like 3.7m raw hp armor. someone mentioned like what 40minutes to rep up from 28% armor without taking dmg."

12/15/2009,"yeah, speaking as another member in the op's alliance (whoops, that we broke up to get into this, oh well nevermind) involved in metro... i find it rather frustrating when, on a couple runthroughs of metropolis at around 0500, no plexes could be found. most systems in the region, nope, sorry.i actually shifted my sleep schedule around to get in on one of the post dt fleets - fights over plexes got to be interesting small gang stuff, fought hard, against people with a clue, complexes to take, so on. but then the next day, hey, i had to go to work because it wasn't the weekend. yes, work. horror. i love this game, i play it a lot, but as i'm unable to use it to make my car payments or rent without breaking the eula, i unfortunately have to do other things sometimes... which means my strategic contribution? practically nil, unless i completely shift my sleep schedule.so could this please have something done?"
12/15/2009,"dt is midnight for me. i got up this morning at 0500 local and drove around metropolis all day looking for plexes. i heard about 2 major plexes 12 jumps away and rushed there to find that they were mission sites.other than that, nothing.can we please have this fixed?one option would be to do the sorting at downtime, like they do now, but have them not spawn until random amount of time has passed somewhere between 1 and 23 hours. you might need to increase the number of plexes slightly to allow for not getting to spawn them as often."
12/15/2009,"supported with all other ""broken"" fw mechanics.even if we are outnumbering post dt. it shouldnt be related to downtime."
12/15/2009,*wrong thread*
12/15/2009,absolutely not. this idea was thrown around last time suicide ganking was due a 'balance'. the option was canning insurance or increasing response time. increased response time was chosen. if this is implemented it might stop the -10 buffoons who cut around jita in smartbombing typhoons but it won't stop those of us who do it for real profit or group lulz (4 destroyers cost 5 mil total = 1 dead hulk amirite)...if you don't want to become a victim then don't allow yourself to become a victim.insurance does need looking at but that's for another discussion.
12/15/2009,"the ""bug"" has a very easy fix. add the opposed allied militia to a pilots standings sheet. that is as far as i know/understand the only reason why there is no standings penalty incurred when capturing for the aligned side .. you see the same on a corporate level where the corporate standing (the average of employees) can be manipulated by making sure the employees have had no contact (ie. no standings entry) with a given npc corp."
12/15/2009,"with respect to your bug report:it appears that the defect is simply that pilots plexing for 'off' factions aren't receiving the standings boosts that normally accompany plexing. as such, they can stay immune to npc aggro indefinitely by hiding behind their high standings towards the plex rats. it seems that the likely fix ccp would pursue would be simply to provide the faction bonuses to off factions so you can only cap a couple plexes before the local npcs start shooting you again. obviously that addresses the defect, but does little to address the issue people here seem to be concerned with...in the system proposed above, in which the only thing stopping high standing characters from plexing with impunity are the eventual standings adjustment there still exists a significant loophole which would still permit the behavior that spawned the initial complaint. in short, the same folks that are willing to alt grind plexes with high standings characters are also likely to be quite willing to use the same alts to grind the timer down to ~1 sec before leaving the plex to start another whilst a standard plexing character comes in to finish the initial plex take the standings hit/bonus. so really, such a change only represents a minor cut in plexing efficiency (you could have 4 high standings alt plexers + 1 standings mule plus a bit more warping about vs the 5 plexers the same person/corp might run now) while still leaving the door open for the same types of abuse.naturally, many people wouldn't consider it worth the effort. clearly there are at least a few pilots who do consider it worthwhile or we wouldn't have this complaint in the first place.tl;dr: bug fix for plexing standings boost/hit makes the plex grinding that folks are railing against harder, not impossible. keep pushing for a mechanics change if you're not happy with the current state of plexing."

12/15/2009,"i propose that all turrets and bays with meta 6 and above benefit from weapon specialization skills. keep t2 charges exclusive to t2 weapons, but the skills that improve t2 guns would have an equal effect on other weapons with a higher meta level than t2. it may be necessary to tweak current damage values of those weapons if they prove to be overly powerful.as more and more systems in 0,0 are upgraded, there will be an increase in the number of these high meta drops pouring into the market. it stands to reason that the increase in supply will have a downward effect on price.increasing the value of high meta weapons in this way may help them retain at least some of their price by sparking demand beyond what it is presently. perhaps even making some of these high end modules more likely to be used in actual pvp.p.s. please fix rockets."
12/15/2009,imho no.rather fix that t2 launcher get lower dps even with spec skills at 5 then cn faction launchers (using the same ammo). to get higher dps you need to use rage/fury ammo.
12/15/2009,"simple as the title suggests, eve players should be able to reserve their player, corporation and alliance name in the dust514 console game. this is necessary to have congruence in all characters in the eve-online universe being controlled by a single rl individual, regardless which interface players use to access new eden.this could be achieved in a number of ways, with varying levels of restriction for ccp games/immersion breaking for one universe:- players manually choose to reserve names- all eve-online names are reserved for a fixed period of months from creation- eve-online names are permanently reserved in the dust514 game.the inverse of this policy should also be applied: names created in the new eden universe on the dust514 console should be reserved from usage in eve-online.this policy should be further extended to all future games used to access the new eden universe."
12/15/2009,given ccp said both should basically play in the same universe ... i would expect that is the case already. no?
12/15/2009,"when they first announced it at the gdc europe, i spoke to ccp and they hadn't gone so far in their thinking (yet) - so it isn't already the case. we have an opportunity to make it the case if the issue is raised via the csm."
12/15/2009,it would be nice to see this although i could see a few issues with the numbers of alts with silly names in eve ^^maybe have an opportunity to register your current name or something?
12/15/2009,"yeah, i'm not sure what the exact policy here should be, but something is clearly necessary. i expect it'll probably happen on its own, but it's best to make sure."
12/15/2009,"dear c.c.p., please revise the buddy list from the current one-column model to a two-column design.one column on the left would be for user-named folders and the default 'all buddies' folder. a second column, on the right, would be for folder contents.this would allow for practical management of buddies. the best example would be as follows:when the eve client undergoes a major upgrade such as to apocrypha or from apocrypha to dominon, the player generated folders are lost -leaving one list of all buddies only. recreating folders in the present one-column system is very impractical in that, once a new folder is created and, by the time a player selects a buddy in the list and attempts to drag the buddy to the new folder, the buddy is no longer visible. by having folders on the left and folder contents on the right, this problem of organization would be eliminated. organizing could then be done by dragging the buddy from the right column list to the appropriate folder in the left column.thank you."
12/15/2009,"reservededit 20091216this thread has nothing to do (yet) with the buddy list taking so long to load that players think it to be broken.understanding that desktop space is at a premium, the buddy list could eventually be removed from the 'people & places' tool and added as a right column tab within the evemail tool. first things first though. edit 20091218here's a related thread...

12/15/2009,quite often while running missions (lvl 4) i will have interlopers scan me down and start to salvage my wrecks. this is theft pure and simple. if i take action against these thieves then concord will (and has) destroy me. this makes no sense because often the salvage is equal to or is more than the worth of the loot. pilots are stealing from mission runners without those mission runners having the means to stop the theft or react to it. this is a loop hole in the way high sec is intended to work and it needs to be changed now.
12/15/2009,"waaaaaaah it is this late in the week already?salvage is not yours. the loot is. salvage is owned by the guy who salvages first. you are late. well bad luck. get over it, its a few hundred thousand isk at most. compared to the millions you made in the mission."
12/15/2009,"while i have plenty of opinions on ninja-salvaging, the most relevant one is that i think it's completely fair game. here are some ways that you can prevent or respond to it:1. bring a friend to salvage for you.2. equip a tractor and salvager on your mission ship.3. warp out of the mission and come back later.4. shoot the wrecks.5. if you can tank the damage, just stop killing things and wait until they leave.6. if someone steals loot and you're confident in whatever way you can do it: blow up his/her ship.i have used any of the above tactics, and nine of ten times, the ninja(s) leave and don't come back. sometimes you get a persistent one, but from my experience--even in dodixie--these aren't very common.so, while i can sympathize with the frustration, i disagree that salvaging others' wrecks should be stealing."
12/15/2009,by that same logic the loot is owned by the person who loots first. clearly a moron like your self who doesn't understand that the very basis of his argument contradicts his point has no place in this forum.begone **** ant.
12/15/2009,"1. doesn't change the fact that he's not flagged when he steals our salvage and would just get my friend and myself blown up for trying to stop him.2. i have both on my paladin. i can't salvage everything at once.3. so that all my salvage is stolen? seriously what kind of advice is that?4. thus destroying my salvage so that no one can have it. pure genius.5. the point is that because it's not a criminal offense, concord will kill me if i attack him. can't tank concord. 6. they are not stealing the loot, and i'm quite confident i can blow up their ship. they are stealing my salvage. and i can't blow him up for that because it's not a criminal offense which is the point of this thread.thank you for your comments and your poor comprehension skills."
12/15/2009,"oh rofl!:) cute! :dnow would you be sad, when i tell you that ccp stated that ninja salvaging is a wanted mini profession in this game? stated multiple times by different gms?sadly i always forget to bookmark the thread with the quote.but i am happy you have a nice colorful language!:dwhine more please. *gets popcorn*"
12/15/2009,"that time of the month? get your tubes tied princess, it won't happen. this is exactly the arguement presented for can theft mechanics. i can guarentee that within an hour of such a change being made and you firing upon an 'interloper' you will have lost your ship and be right back here crying for a rollback.this is pretty much as is intended. salvage is 'junk' it's there for everyone, devs have stated it etc etc. go and google salvage rights or something."
12/15/2009,"i disagree, i should be able you wtfpwn ninjasalvagers if they are dumb enough to get into crosshairs of my 8-gunned bs with no transversal. give ninjasalvager profession some risk."
12/15/2009,and then i can watch the ninja salvager wtfbbq your leet mission ship with his pvp ship. like that absolution which got pwned by the hurricane. (commandship would beat t1 bc any time no?;))
12/15/2009,"don't get me wrong; i don't like pilots taking salvage from my missions either. but, in your rush to point out what you perceive as poor comprehension on my part, i think you may have missed that my post was not really advice as much as reasons that i use to support my disagreement with your proposal.in sum, i believe there are ways to try to protect ""your salvage""; therefore, i disagree that salvaging others' wrecks should be a red-flagging or criminal action."
12/15/2009,"see here, here, here and here for recent assembly hall threads that failed like yours is going to.it's all been gone over a hundred times already. unless you have some new argument to bring other than wahhh i wants it all, then the devs will not change their stated policy that salvage beings to the person who creates it from the wreck, not the person who creates the wreck."
12/15/2009,thank you malcanis! finally the quotes bookmarked! ;d
12/15/2009,"the problem with flagging them is that then you can blow their ship up, but then they can also come back with a pvp ship and blow your ship up also. and trust me their 10 million (at most) salvaging ship is worth far less than your 150 million (at least) mission ship.if you really want to get rid of them just blow up the wrecks (as long as they are yours).personally my proposal would be to add more salvaging skills into the game. this would make it so that a better salvager would get more salvage. which would in turn mean that mission runners would basically hire salvagers to salvage their missions since both people could get more out of it."
12/15/2009,"yeah, many ninja looters think the same thing, looks especially funny when one of them gets instapoped and the second one cannot break my tank and dies horribly to drones or warps off in case he is a stabbed *****. in more serious mood: i've killed looters/gankers/salvagers and can flippers, and i got killed by them (when i made a bad call), it's solely my choice if i should shoot him. more destruction is good. nija salvagers should need to protect themselves, and not just print isk, and it's even better if both sides call in teammates. yes, some idiot died to a hurricane in a commandship because it was mission fitted, obviosly, such people deserve to die. people that nija-salvage in failfit battleships/bc's also deserve to die. survival of the fittest/smartest/people with the most teammates."
12/15/2009,"well i was hoping for a bigger ship than a bs. but yes, something new that what already exist or maybe one that is better."
12/15/2009,there are two ways to kill a ceptor. i think this is by design.1. neut it so it can't fly fast.2. scram it so it can't fly fast.the other ways they die are because of stupid mistakes (see flying directly at a ship for more than a few seconds).really don't need a t2 destroyer to fill the role of interceptor killer as other interceptors do the trick as well as simply fitting large neuts plus light drones.
12/15/2009,"odd, i could have sworn you'd mentioned at one point that you were going to."
12/15/2009,"not supported.having these two very different groups of gamers have influance in the same universe is brilliant and great out of the box thinking that other developers should try to emulate. i am sure dust will not be the typical ""12y/o shooter"" as i think it will be far too deep and complex for most young players to enjoy."
12/15/2009,it's a good idea and deserves closer investigation

12/15/2009,"the importance and value of dust514's (slow and careful) integration with the eve-online universe should not be under-estimated for not only eve players, but for the entire gaming industry.it will attempt (force) the intersections between both the console gaming community and the eve/mmo community in an ambitious and inspiring vision which will enlarge and enrich the new eden internet space games simulation and places the expense of innovation on ccp games which the whole world-wide gaming industry will be watching. for example, as an eve online player, because of this ground-breaking effort, you can expect more top-caliber people wanting to join ccp games, which means better overall quality and speed of release for eve-online developments.ccp have already stated that they intend to integrate slowly and carefully between the two games, so the starting point of dust514's launch will unlikely be integrated, and the integration will appear over time. ccp are very conscious of the fact that the need for balance and non-disruption of the eve-online universe is paramount in their concerns for realizing the vision."
12/15/2009,"crap, i just neural remapped and realized i put too much into charisma. next remap available in one year.that is stretching it a bit i think. i can understand the need for an anti-abuse system. but its too tight to not allow any neural remaps for an entire year. especially considering the additional money ccp could be making if they allowed players to either purchase neural remaps for real money or in-game money."

12/15/2009,choice -> consequencethis is the heart of what makes eve > wow.you make your choices and then you live with the consequences. we don't need the option to make the choice more often. you need to exercise your ability to make a better choice.

12/15/2009,quoting my self from the last 100 threads about this issue.and once again... no!
12/15/2009,"as it currently stands, interceptors generally cannot catch other interceptors who immediately jump into a system and ""warp to zero"" toward another location, due to the agility and sig radius of the target ships.the situation is largely similar with other classes, with some cruisers able to catch the slowest cruisers, and some bc able to catch the slowest bc.i believe that scan res should be increased on most ships by 10-20% to give the average to above average tackle pilot a reasonable chance to catch hostiles that decloak within 24km of them and attempt to immediately warp."

12/15/2009,"i disagree to both suggestions of your post. first, the reduce/remove meta 0 loot has been suggested many times, even once by me. to do this, you would have to first make mining more interesting so more people would be interested in doing that. during my term on the csm, we discussed mining in-depth, and ccp are going to look into it (hopefully sooner more than later), as it's a huge hurdle to the pve side of the game (mission running affects and manufacturing is affected by mining). when this happens, your first suggestion will be valid, and even valuable, but not until then.the second suggestion is also less-than-desirable. invention is meant to be an all-or-nothing event, which is why it's sometimes risky and decryptors are needed. this makes it less risky, and thus throws the whole balance out the window.don't get me wrong, i'm not saying your ideas are worthless, but just that they need some work before they're even considered. best of luck to you though."
12/15/2009,"wis is a complete non-starter for me. you need to make isk in this game and i cannot think of any way to legitimately make a million isk per hour sitting at a bar. unless it involves gambling. it sounds like a massive waste of time.there are a thousand things that need to be worked on before ccp goes off on a wild goose chase that will add nothing of note to the gameplay. but if they're going to waste resources developing it, i hope they dedicate a few servers in the cluster to it so those who want to play their little space sims games won't affect the rest of us.the whole concept is pure fail. i'm not being negative, i'm being realistic."
12/15/2009,"i also believe forum censorship should be topic, but perhaps broadened into the category: poor communication by ccp with player base, or simply ""ccp communication"".to censor a post that simply states ""free abernathy"" i find disturbing. i might understand extreme foul language or threats etc. being removed, but innocuous protest statements by players being removed? i also believe a number of players stated major well considered posts were removed entirely.i think communication should be a primary subject especially for csm representing the player base. why? because if one party can simply decide what to listen to and not listen to - or even if truthfulness of statements being made by ccp cannot be challenged - then there really is no point at all in having player representation or the csm itself - or even forums where supposed communication between ccp and player base take place. communication has to be present and valid. it shouldn't be just be some kind of water faucet ccp decides to turn on and off at will. there is not much to gain from that type of communication - if that's what ccp wants, then they might as well just talk to themselves and forget the player base or csm.here are a few points about ccp communication:1. what happened to promised qa between csm & ccp over last months? this has been a serious communication breakdown.2. statements made in the mother ship dev blog that created such a furor by the player base were outright incorrect. such as the use of target painters by cap ships, and the assumption of there not being in general close quarter cap ship engagements.3. the follow-up statements by devs in a feedback forum such as the mother ship debacle did not improve communication at all - and in fact because of a bit of flippancy and lack of actually responding to key points brought up by players - made the communication even worse - with more players upset and less information being brought forth.4. another aspect i consider poor ccp communication is player expectations. i think many players having participated on the test server cap ship testing and providing feedback etc. to ccp had some reasonable expectations that dramatic changes wouldn't be done 1 week prior to dominion deployment. that sudden changes were made with apparently again not a whole lot of communication such as ""mother ships"" suddenly being able to dock at stations etc. which shocked many in the player base, then suddenly mother ships being pulled completely while all other cap changes were to remain in effect - i think left the players in the state of wtf? so here are some recommendations i would make to ""improve"" ccp communication.1. dev blog statements need to be carefully checked for truthfulness by other parties. and more importantly, if there is an error in the statements they need to be acknowledged and corrected immediately on a follow up.2. 1 or 2 follow-up statements (one being flippant) toward an outraged player base does not help anyone and just adds fuel to the fire. there needs to be more commitment by ccp to respond to issues - maybe an extra staff member just to handle communication. if a dev makes a blog post she should be committed to address valid issues being brought up in response to what he/she has posted. 3. heavy use of censorship does not help anyone and creates a terrible atmosphere between the player base and ccp. whether justified or not, there really is not much of a need for it - other than extreme language or death threats type of stuff. otw - this is an mmo forum, we all know threads can get hairy. so what. eve online is not a disneyland game and the player base in fact prides itself on being an htfu crowd. by using heavy censorship ccp just worsens the sense by the player base that they are getting honest communication.4. qa sessions between ccp and csm need to be done and not simply disappear into the void.5. better communication in regards to proposed"
12/15/2009,5. better communication in regards to proposed changes - so player expectations don't get wrecked 1 week before deployment.
12/15/2009,"section 12 of the forum rules stateposts spamming ""free abernathy"" etc can be removed under the rules people have agreed to when they login to the forum (alternatively they could be classed as trolling and removed under section 7 and some were personal attacks on the dev in question which is against section 6).removing spam posts does not count as censorship!it might blur the line sometimes but you can't be outraged about posts being removed that breach the forum rules.i have yet to see evidence of this from eve search or any other mirror taken. if this was the case then it needs to be addressed as a matter of priority.i agree that communication needs to be improved and hopefully we can lead by example."
12/15/2009,"hey teadaze. thx for response. i supported you in the election and glad you're on a seat now. gratz.in my mind - the problem is not really whether ccp has the right to do what they are doing - i.e. the rules (rules they themselves created). in fact, throughout history, those who have censored or burned books - created ""rules"" in order to perform the censorship acts (which in the censor's mind is usually justified) - that imo boils down to: controlling the communication of others - for whatever reasons.won't get into a philosophical debate over censorship as i've already blogged my position (i abhor it) - but rules not really problem here. it's the ""heavy"" use of censorship and needless overuse that created a huge negative impact imo on communication, and further distrust from the players posting.>> it might blur the line sometimesi think this is the crux of the problem. where do you draw the line and who draws it? ""free abernathy"" - frankly imo i don't see any kind of direct personal attack - only a very common protest statement - and too the point in fact. apparently abernathy was taken off the mothership cap development and a new dev (or team) replaced him and huge changes took place afterward and some gross misstatements were made by the new dev (nozh). the question by the way of why abernathy was no longer part of the dev team was never addressed. players asking that abernathy be put back on the dev team via a common protest slogan ""free abernathy"" - is considered a direct attack? i think that's a bit of a stretch.i was careful in regards to phrasing my statement - other players stated their posts were removed entirely - so you may well be right that this was not the case. but this goes to the point - perceived perception of the player base became very negative - as the heavy use of censorship caused much greater distrust and the perception that ccp was not listening, and instead of an htfu up attitude was taking a stfu attitude with communication.we are agreed. perhaps as i suggest csm should broaden the question - and instead of limiting the talking point to ""forum censorship"" - discuss how to improve communication overall. as i pointed out, there were a number of communication failures imo that could be improved that will help both ccp and the player base (and csm in the long run) to make the efforts to improve eve online (a goal we all agree upon) better.cheers to you teadaze and rest of csm board. wish you guys best of luck and glad you're going to bat for the players.o/"
12/15/2009,"it is tricky because ccp have the right to do whatever they like on their own site and people have to abide by their rules. in practice i see far less moderation here than in other games. also posts critical of ccp are frequently left untouched. but whilst people have the right to free speech i don't believe ccp have to provide them the service or the audience to do so.i agree here. i hate censorship and have been actively fighting against censorship software being installed at the local internet providers for a number of years. i don't see enforcing the forum rules on one site when you are still free to discuss the issues as you like elsewhere as censorship in the truest sense.i don't think it was addressed no, but here is where i draw the line.people just posting the same slogan ""free abathur"" and nothing else breaches a couple of the forum rules, the no spamming one being the most applicable. there were also people wanting nozh fired, people being very nasty and generally bordering on real life threats (diaf etc).then people started comparing post counts between the official forum and eve search and claiming heavy ccp censorship. this was a totally failed argument but some people went with it because they love a dramabomb.i don't know if abathur was taken off the team or what the reasons were for the changes being backed out, but the fact so many people had their expectations neutered was obviously going to end badly and i can't believe ccp did it lightly. i hope we will get an answer when we visit ccp if not before.things have got to the stage where i can claim ccp deleted my post and have people foaming at the mouth over censorship regardless of the actual reason.this is not a good state and needs looking into. i hope to talk with people at ccp about this issue in feb.thanks for your support"

12/16/2009,"it's so hard to tolerate stupid people. i know how to set up my overview perfectly well. it's insulting for you to make such a post as it implies that you think i don't know what i'm doing and that i'm incompetent. only a complete ****ing idiot would think that i haven't thoroughly analysed the situation before making this post.clearly you don't fight empire wars or have never come across the issues that all ultra skilled players come across when they're trying to get precisely what they want out of their overview settings. otherwise you wouldn't have made two posts trying to 'help' me with my overview settings.to reiterate the current issue: it is impossible to simply check 'war targets' and have the said war targets show up without assigning negative standings to the war targets and then checking war targets *and* 'players with horrible standing' (as an example) in order to keep neutrals off of the overview while still keeping war targets.the issue is compounded when you have players with different types of security status, bounties and all sorts of other small differences. furthermore, the current work arounds are simply unacceptable.i don't want *anything* on my overview other than war targets. it's disgusting that you thought it would be a good idea to explain to me how to set up my overview. twice."

12/16/2009,the op is correct.the 'helper' is correct.the flame is not needed. sorting war targets out of the chaff is damn near impossible even with all of the suggestions pointed out in the subsequent posts.in empire identifying a war target on a crowded gate without having 'show all' selected is a study in frustration. and if you have wts visible you're lagged to sin because you're also having to parse everything else at the gate.target is at war should be a trump card. if selected it supersedes all other filters whether on or off.
12/16/2009,"blah, sorry to have caused you such pain, little did i know you were such a sage and experienced pilot."
12/16/2009,each option needs an include and an exclude option rather than a single tick box.my overview should only show players that qualify under any inclusion filter and dont qualify for any exclusion filters.include exclude[x] [ ] wartargets[x] [ ] global criminal[ ] [x] gang members[ ] [ ] neutrals standing^^ like so.

12/16/2009,"this problem has been long ignored by ccp; it doesn't seem like it should be that difficult to fix. here are two possible solutions:1) instead of having each plex 'object' set to be of a specific faction (and therefore being unusable if it respawns in the wrong system), simply have each plex take on the faction that occupies the system it spawns in. all plexes will be valid, and no post-dt reshuffling would be needed.or2) when a plex is respawned in the wrong system, don't set it to be invalid, simply mulligan the respawn immediately. keep doing it until it works.frankly, i think option 1 is by far the better. yes, it does mean that there's a statistical possibility that all plexes will be aligned to one faction at once, but this would only last until the plex was run by the other side or died of old age. option 2 (which is basically the current mechanics, but not tied to dt) leads to fw being unstable, as the plexes for the winning side become more thinly distributed and the losing side become more concentrated."
12/16/2009,"the post-dt spawning issue is a) unrealisticb) leads to many european people with day jobs who would like to be involved in system capture being unable to do so; when my partner was in fw he could never find any plexes left by the time he finished work and now i am in it myself, i find i spend roughly 3 hours probing for every hour plexing and fighting.so yes, i would very much like to see a mechanic where plexes respawn throughout the day, so we can all have a go."
12/16/2009,"supported, but only as part of a major revamp of fw in total as just fixing this one thing for now would then be unbalanced and other fixes need to come in first like the standings reactions of npc's.i can at least see the game design sense in ccp making only a limited number of complexes a day spawn for any given area. ideally it was to stop a rapid take over from one side who could buckle down and grind for a day, which i agree is as bad.so they should keep the kinds of limits they had in mind but reduce it from a daily pot to smaller and more manageable time periods of, say, three hours for example. where less complexes spawn in that time, and they refresh 24 hours later.ok... that might be hard to follow so back to examples just in case.post dt, 12pm gmt to 3pm gmt. say 15 plexes are active. if they are all run then fine, they are gone until 3pm gmt to 6pm gmt where another 15 are activated. now say only 4 of them are run by 6pm. the other 11 remain and another 15 spawn at 6pm to 9pm. so we now have 26 on the field. however those 11 left from 3pm to 6pm will continue to persist on the field until 3pm to 6pm the next day when they are auto-refreshed and replaced with a new batch of 15. note: not at downtime."

12/16/2009,"if i turn the sound on it's a complete crapshoot what i'll hear.i generally only hear station environment or ship sounds, i never hear weapon sounds. if i happen to hear other environment sounds (gate fire, npc chatter) they tend to be ear bleedingly loud even with my world and master volume almost on 'mute' - and no, my system sound is (and has been for years) set on 30%.for 6 years running the eve sound engine has been, to put it bluntly, hopelessly broken. i don't see them fixing it any time soon."
12/16/2009,"this.i enter combat, and with my hardeners going will only hear combat sounds intermittently, followed by long periods of relative silence. the hardeners sounds in dominion are better (ie: less loud and deep) than in apocrypha, but still seem to overwhelm the sound channels.as others have mentioned, the ambient sounds at jump gates and in stations (especially amarr) are far too loud.options to reduce mining lasers separate from combat turrets would help, as would volume sliders for ambient sounds. overall, it seems like the sound engine needs and overhaul though."
12/16/2009,"at least warp drive is no longer as deafening. i actually have the sound on again after almost 4 years of playing with it off. it is significantly better, but still needs work. gate fires are probably going to lead to audio getting turned off again in the near future though."

12/16/2009,what is this doing on page three?bump for great justice i say!
12/16/2009,good ideal would be very helpful
12/16/2009,"the tanking mechanics greatly favor passive shield tanks. passive shields, especially when combined with a resist bonus become so powerful that they can easily outtank most other ships while still dealing decent dps, something an armor tanker cannot even hope for and no, this is not balanced by the fact that in pvp the medslots are needed for ew modules.the cause of the problem is, that shield extenders not only increase the shield hp buffer, but also increase the hp that are effectivly recharged with each secondother kinds of tanks can be countered, rr with ecm, armor repairer/shield boosters with energy neutralizers,but a passive tank can only be nullified by out-dpsing the recharge rate, which has become very hard on some ships.shield and armor should not be same but as it stands now the mechanic drastically favors the passive shield.so my proposal is to make a change to shield extenders, so that their hp bonus does not count to the auto regeneration of shield hp. passive shield setups would still be useful and able to soak up lots of damage but not on the ridiculous level they are now."
12/16/2009,"for cruisers.1 medium injector & 2 medium armour reps will equal most passive shield tanks.thats 3 slots.for the recharge portion of passive shields 4 spr's , 2 extenders , and 2 / 3 purger rigsare what are required.so a 3 slot armor tank is comparable to a 8 slot shield tank.or to put it another way gtfo."
12/16/2009,"sorry, but i have to say that you are totally wrong. dual reps do not come even close to the numbers of passive shield setups. or to put the another way: get a clue or gtfo"
12/16/2009,"and where will the cap to power the reps come from? please don't forget that passive shield tanks work only on very few ships, and it is impossible to utilise it with any sort of cap consuming module."
12/16/2009,"not supported, and here's why.passive tank ships pay a significant penalty in outgoing dps to acheive their numbers. if you reduced that defensive number, then there would need to be some compensating factor on the outgoing end to keep the ships balanced.i mean yes, i will freely acknowledge that my drake tanks as well as my maelstrom.but it also only does 1/3 of the maelstrom's outgoing dps."
12/16/2009,negative
12/16/2009,"the drake is a battlecruiser, a maelstrom is a battleship. also a drake does dps that are comparable to other tier 2 bc while having a battleship type tank that does not even need cap to sustain.also drakes are not the problem, but it is becoming a problem when a ship like the myrmidon is often more efficient when passive shield tanked, instead of using the active repair bonus. other ships with shield resist bonuses have a definitive advantage as well. take a look at the t3 cruisers and say again that everything is fine, the shield tanked ones are massivly outperforming the armor tanked ones."
12/16/2009,"qq less, roll caldari."
12/16/2009,"my rattlesnake (utilizing the best possible empire faction stuff, capstable):dps: 611 / tank: 1980 omninavy domi (using 6 dual 250mm t2 and an injector, otherwise it wouldn't work):dps: 577 - 716 / tank: 1027 omnitradeoff: 100 dps less (antimatter range! not like the 200+km for cruise) and 953 tank on the ""plus"" side. if you go for a decent range, there is no dps bonus at all, above 40km, the domi does less.thats why i fly the snake :) same, as mentioned, when you compare bc against bc (and not against bs).and it was mentioned that it should be ""balanced"" and not ""nerfed to oblivion"". the problem in my option are the high stack levels. the last 2-3 steps in passive shield tank stacking really boost the tank through the roof. that is why you lose so much tank when you try to increase the dps on such a ship as the drake oder rattlesnake (if i remove 3 from 14(!) modules needed for the mentioned tank to add, for example 3 bcs, then my dps will go up by like 100 and the tank down by 700).so a redesign would be great in my opion to prevent rediculus tank values and bring the dps in line with ships that use an active tank."
12/16/2009,"someone else recently brought up the point that any corp member in your fleet could, in theory, wander up to your carrier and pop out a ship. while this is quite useful, it would be nice if we had a bit of added security built into our carrier smas.for example, a ship maintenance array at a pos can be set to require certain roles to be able to access it. this makes it a bit more secure than an afk carrier, especially considering almost anyone in your corporation can join your fleet with a simple link, or even with the fleet finder now days.now, i'm not sure how easy/hard this would be to add, but a simple popup to the carrier pilot would be great ""<name> wants to launch a <shiptype> named <shipname> from your sma, is this ok?"" and you can click ""ok"" or ""deny"". the option to turn this on or off could be added under the ""configure ship"" option.to take this a step further, it would be nice (but not required) if you were able to allow fleet members to launch certain ship types, and deny, or ask you about others. group them into ship types, such as frigates, destroyers, cruisers, battlecruisers, battleships, assault frigates, covert ops, interdictors, heavy assault ships, etc. etc. etc.anyway, a little added security to the carrier (and by extension, mothership) smas could go a long way."
12/16/2009,"supporting this because, well, i can."
12/16/2009,"i'd like to bring spare ships for my alt as well as corp frigates, the lack of security on a carrier sma prevents me from doing this."
12/16/2009,should have been implemented a long time ago
12/16/2009,ok
12/16/2009,excellent idea. also having a check box to allow alliance members to grab certain ship types from your sma would be useful as well.
12/16/2009,sounds like a fairly simple but very effective and useful change.
12/16/2009,i support this idea.
12/16/2009,thumbs up
12/16/2009,i support this product and/or service.
12/16/2009,i certainly like the concept.
12/16/2009,there are too many goons in this thread but i support this as well
12/16/2009,"wow, there are a lot of goons in this thread.does not necessarily mean it's a bad idea though. would be helpful for my orca too./support"
12/16/2009,stupid gunes
12/16/2009,i see no reason why not
12/16/2009,"even goons can say something valid now and then; who'd have thought?in all seriousness, though, it's about time something's done about it. i'd rather have a setup window than a bunch of windows spamming."
12/16/2009,"considering goons like scamming and meta-gaming stuff, this problem is probably rampant in goonswarm. there's probably a pile of goons on the look-out at any given time to nab ships out of corp/alliance-mate's carriers, so this topic is likely a bigger deal for them than anyone else. that said, it makes sense."
12/16/2009,needs more options and customability indeed.
12/16/2009,supporting this good idea and or service.
12/16/2009,"agreed, this is a great idea."
12/16/2009,"no, there are more important things to be fixed/implemented first;~ musical instruments in ambulation~ music~ instruments~ ambulation"
12/16/2009,good point
12/16/2009,"not sure you read the proposal. i am suggesting that all high meta weapons (turrets & bays) benefit from the specialization skills. be it storyline, faction or officer. this has nothing to do with ""fixing"" any particular module.a person with larger blaster specialization v will get 10% added to damage of his tuvan's (officer) blasters. this adds value to the module. it also factors into the decision to use it in combat.more high meta modules in actual pvp (and on killmails) is good for the game and good for business. it's also a boost to 0.0 it's only matter of time before you start seeing the price of high meta / officer loot start drooping as 0.0 systems are upgraded and more complexes are exploited. at least this way you slow the dilution of their value and perhaps increase demand."
12/16/2009,"supporting this, although i'd go further and suggest that all meta 6+ weapons be made able to use t2 ammo as well."
12/16/2009,only if you raise the skill requirements for said weapons above those for their t2 counterpart.
12/16/2009,"and is their any logical reason to do so? because i do not think so. i would suggest letting all guns use t2 ammo, since it has it's own skill requirements, and making the specialization affect all guns. whole bunch of problems solved. rp reason:it says ""blaster specialization"" meaning it should affect all blasters, not ""advanced blaster specialization"" which would mean that it should affect only advanced, t2 guns. same goes for all weapon types."
12/16/2009,that's how it should be
12/16/2009,"agreed.all dust players shall make use of the letter '4' in their names along with prefixes and suffixes of 'xxxx' and 'xxxx'. besides, i don't want anyone running around planet-side doing stupid stuff under the name of wheatgrass."
12/16/2009,"surely if both eve and dust players are expected to use new eden (spacebook), ccp have thought of this.../me gives thumbs up"
12/16/2009,i endorse this service.
12/16/2009,there can only be one treelox!!!!!
12/16/2009,pretty good idea. supported.
12/16/2009,"surely by definition a pod pilot isn't a dust merc? so wouldn't reserving character names break immersion?reserved corp/alliance names is fine, although i suggest that only the names of corp/alliances with at least 1 subscribed member be reserved."
12/16/2009,for the sake of protecting reputations.
12/16/2009,"this is a good point. i'm a little torn on this issue. on one side i don't want to see a dust character with the name i've used for all these years. on the other side, i can't see any pod pilot actually putting boots on the ground in a fight."
12/16/2009,it should be reserved for a short amount of time i think.
12/16/2009,yup
12/16/2009,"bump, this feature seems easily done and quite a no brainer, it would be a pity if it didn't get seen by the empowered ones and get lost without a chance of being at least discussed. just support it plox!"
12/16/2009,+1this would encourage me to finally learn how to use that vector data.
12/16/2009,"mass 5,000kginertia modifier 1,000that gives it a base agility of 5,000,000 (lets go easy and knock the zeros off).the base agility of a vengeance is 4.95, punisher is 4.4, and vigil is 3.22a shuttle is 1.6do you seriously seriously expect us to use this thing if it has the same align time as a vanilla stabber? (5.4)no wonder sleepers won't target it, they're too busy laughing their asses off at its slow ass turns.delete it, gimme snowballs/launchers please."
12/16/2009,"hmm, its a solar sailer ship, might not be as fast or agile as a ship with actual engines. shocking."
12/16/2009,"1. let me put you in a sailboat... i'll get in a powerboat....which one of us do you think will turn faster/accelerate quicker?2. take a look at the solar sail tech of nasa (yes, it's not science fiction any more)the ship takes years of constant micro-accelleration to achieve an acceptable velocity.... the agility should have a couple more zeros on it.........ps... don't need launchers, got launchers..... need snow!"
12/16/2009,"are you tired of using your scroll wheel (or simulated scroll wheel) to zoom out to 75km every time you undock? me too.i'm not sure what's more of a nuisance, zooming out every time after undocking, always having to expand the drone u.i. window folders, or the 'read mission' details window popping up from a minimized state without my involvement. (someone else will please create solution proposals for the other issues.)so, how about it, c.c.p.? may we please have an undock zoom range preference setting please? i'll promise to zoom in at least once a week to appreciate all of the apocrypha graphics polish so long as i'm a subscriber -all of 14 days remaining now.thank you."
12/16/2009,"reserved.edit 20091228...although not changing the original intent of this threed, i'd like to note that such a preference would also be appropriate when canceling the viewing (i.e. 'reset camera') of an object in space.as an example, i used the 'look at' button of the 'selected item' window to view an object. i then clicked on the same button to cancel the view (i.e. 'reset camera'). what should have been the interior of my ship is what i saw next. this resulting view was not at all convenient at a time when large numbers of npcs were trying to kill my ass. as usual, about seven spins of the mouse scroll wheel gave a more appropriate view of the raging battle."
12/16/2009,"god yes! supported.i'd simply be happy if it remembered my settings from the last time i was in space. same for exiting a jump gate, as i often find i end up on the other side of the gate with different zoom levels than i entered the gate with.though it deserves a topic of it's own, i also agree on expanding the drone window. this should also keep my settings from the last time i was in space."
12/16/2009,"as pretty as the ship models are, i would rather not undock/jump and find my ship filling most of the screen when i'm about to enter combat. zooming back out to see what is going on is rather annoying."
12/16/2009,yes also a right click context menu item to assign buddies to folders in the same way that you can move drones into groups would be awesome. additionally/or a drop down in the 'add to address book' dialogue that lets you sort them to a group immediately.

12/16/2009,"when people steal your salvage, they are flagged. although why you would put your salvage in a jet can in the first place is a mystery."
12/16/2009,pah. half-measures.
12/16/2009,no.
12/16/2009,someone should make a wiki or a sticky about the salvaging issue in mission and complexes sub forum.... i cant even tell u how many half arsed salvage whining post i have seen past 3 months....
12/16/2009,"salvage is not owned by you, it is owned by whoever salvages it first.this has been explained many many times by ccp. if it annoys you so put insurance on your ship and 1-shot the ****ers, but this issue has been beaten to death and you will not win.not signed. countered, in fact."
12/16/2009,"and i say ""yes we can!"" i say no to absolutely secure and effortless and skill less profession of ninja salvaging. hell, miners have more risk then ninja salvagers! and they need to spend alot of time training to make anywhere near the amount ninja salvager makes."
12/16/2009,"what about a compromise: remove salvage from hi-sec rats. problem is then completely resolved forever. also gives a real reason to go to 0.0everyone wins!or how about my long-standing plan b:make mission spaces lo-sec. then missioners can freely shoot naughty salvagers before they can ""steal"" so much a single charred micro cicuit!"
12/16/2009,lol
12/16/2009,"ships --->(via your guns/missiles)---> loot. you created this, you own it.wrecks --->(via the salvager's salvage tackle)---> salvage. if it wasn't your salvage tackle, you don't own it.offensive weapons do not create salvage, salvage tackle does, ownership confers accordingly"
12/16/2009,"this is horrible logic. what you kill is yours. no matter what. ie: if i kill a deer, that deer is mine. you can't come in with a knife and say, i'm skinning and cooking the deer thus it's mine. look. it is what it is. it's theft. so what? i agree with the point that stealing salvage is allowed because it offers a mini profession. that's it. it is stealing but it is an intended game mechanic."
12/16/2009,wow how did i miss that little gem the first time around :p
12/16/2009,"if you don't have salvage gear on your ship but the other guy does then he gets the salvage cause he made it. sure, you made the wreak and the loot inside. and that is why he will get flagged if he takes the loot. but he made the salvage which is why it's in his ship. salvage is never stolen from an npc wreak. get over it and move on."
12/16/2009,"no matter what ? really, so i explode a person's house and all that's salvageable from their house is mine, no matter what ? you may not like the argument i used but it's currently the argument ccp uses. comparing rl to eve fails hard as you have just demonstrated.tbh i don't know why ppl bother, the only valid arguments about savage so far are really about balance, ppl should just stick with that"

12/16/2009,i do not yet own one of every ship in the game.
12/16/2009,my opinion is this: 1. why aren't ammunition and missiles free? i had to pay/manufacture them to create the wrecks that are free to everyone. where is my compensation for that?2. i had to pay for game time to train the skills and earn the isk to be able to complete the missions. where is my free game time for creating wrecks and salvage that are free to everyone?
12/16/2009,if were going to have a truesec mechanic then it should be fixed. tl/drfix true sec
12/16/2009,"for those of us who have no clue what you're talking about, could you perhaps expand on your original post just a smidge?what is broken with true sec, and how would you define ""fixed""?"
12/16/2009,"theres a region- delve i believe- where all systems have the benefits of the lowest truesec possible, regardless of their stated true sec values.fix would be to bring these benefits inline to the stated true sec value for each system.alternately you could trash it entirely and make all (nullsec) systems npc benefits as high as what the lowest truesec systems now have."
12/16/2009,i agree that the stated trusec of a system should be it's actual truesec. the presence of some npc sovereign systems in the middle of conquerable 0.0 should have zero effect on the truesec status of the entire region. this would result in all npc 0.0 following this rule as well.
12/16/2009,agreed.and for crying out loud op.... state your proposals clearly and post with your main.i seriously doubt an care bear would have the slightest idea over 0.0 subjects such as that.
12/16/2009,i would vote in favour of the true sec status being shown for all systems - rather than the rounded down ones. (and 0.0 for all minus)
12/16/2009,"agreed.we have 1.0 and 0.x all the way down to 0.0 where the numbers just... stop.it should continue to -0.xhonestly empire should start at 10 and count downward, with or without the decimal points. lowsec would then be 4.99 down to 0.0 and nullsec would just count from -0.01 to -10that just makes things sooooo much more clear."
12/16/2009,it alt spotted.
12/16/2009,i have read that self-destructing your t3 cruiser will prevent you losing sp.
12/16/2009,"they changed it so it doesn't anymore, if the ship gets killed just after you ejected you still lose sp."
12/16/2009,"no, not for ejecting. for self-destructing."
12/16/2009,"/me trains reading comprehension lvl 2yes, i agree that self destructing a t3 ship when aggro'd should incur an sp loss."
12/16/2009,"my fault, i just edited the subject. i did put ""eject"" in place of ""self-destruct"" in the subject originally anyway, now we're all on the same page, glad you agree"
12/16/2009,it's hard now to find something on market. and i can't tell my english mates. additional to this some of the group names are wrong (e.g. fl<U+FFFD>gk<U+FFFD>rper) or words not not from living people.so please please revert the translation. all names of items or groups should stay in common english.regards wultan
12/16/2009,mentioned in this thread; positive feedback there encouraged me to repost here.
12/16/2009,"implementing this proposal would involve a traveling salesman problem. calculating the shortest route between points without a fixed end is a different process, and far less intensive. in fact, calculating such an optimized path is one of a set of problems (np-complete) where no perfectly reliable, fast method of reaching a solution for high-complexity situations is known.tl;dr - they're vastly different, and even if implemented with much effort this can only be guaranteed within a certain level of complexity. and then you'll probably have people whining at ccp without understanding why it's limited. you're normally far better at this intuitively than any algorithm, basically. and that's part of the skill of being a trader (or traveller, in your case).edit: clarity"
12/16/2009,"actually no.the tsp stipulates that you visit each location exactly once where as the shortest path problem has no such limitation. in eve, the shortest path from a to b via a set of other locations, would still be the shortest path problem - hence not np-complete and solvable in polynomial time."
12/16/2009,"your objection to the np-completeness is the tsp's stipulation of visiting a location exactly once, and the shortest path problem not doing so; however, optimizing multiple waypoint travel means that you are visiting every waypoint exactly once (there are no negative edges, and all edges between star systems are equal cost, revisiting a location is always suboptimal). no, because the solution to the shortest path problem from a to b would output the absolute shortest distance, regardless of the intermediary set of locations. restricting it to visiting that entire set of locations is precisely what makes it np-complete. and do note that the waypoints are not the only available vertices to reach your destination, so a shortest path solution need not include any of the waypoints.it still makes me happy that i can have a discussion like this in eve, as opposed to some games *shudder*"
12/16/2009,"dust's eve-factor is the closest incentive to purchasing a console since the ps1. so no, no support (even though i loath console fpses)."
12/16/2009,"saw no rational arguments against.reason its important, the newbie might use his neural remaps as he figures out what he wants to do. first he reconds perception has to win, then he prolly reconsiders and makes it intelligence.then as some things changes he might need 1 last remap, to get his favourate character going. but its going to cost this time.you could even limit the amount of remaps you could buy within certain timeframes.the important thing is the customer feels happy about his character, and that the option to rebuy an attribute remap is fully explored. a happy customer is a happy ccp, which in turn is more happy customers. lets get some thorough thought on this, its a beneficial matter for both ccp but also the guy who feels he need another remap here and now."
12/16/2009,the newbie already has 2 remaps in the first year.
12/16/2009,thats not an argument against the ability to purchase a 3rd one :)
12/16/2009,and a 4th and a 5th and a 6th?no. eve is about decisions and living with the consequences.
12/16/2009,"your going to make remaps so cheap a newbie can pay for them? why not just simply make the option to change you attributes every time you wanna change you skill queue....in short sry but no, if you screwed up your remap then buy some implants to soften the blow and stay out of low/null sec so ya don't lose them."
12/16/2009,"if it should cost in-game money, people are smart enough to figure out to buy a plex and sell it for isk if they really feel they need the remap. good attributes can save you alot of time down the road, so dishing out additional money should seem reasonable for the guy who recognizes this and wants his attributes changed here and now.so my suggestion is, either if ccp deems there is a need for more isk sinky, make the remap cost x amount of in-game isk, or, x amount of irl money up front for 1 additional neural remap.then perhaps limit these kinds of remaps within a timeframe of 6 months to maintain some sort of balance element. but really, i dont really see a reason why he who wishes to spend that extra cash on neural remaps every month shouldnt be allowed to.eve is not a skill race, if you believe this, then you have lost already. its about archiving your goals at your desired speed. if the remap will help you, and you are willing to dish out cash for it, then i dont see any reason you should not be allowed to."
12/16/2009,then why don't you dish cash out for a char instead like every other smart player out there.oh... you didn't think of that.case closed.. moving on.ps: there's an isk sink already... it's called dominion.
12/16/2009,"and thus far you haven't presented a rational argument for it aside from ""oops, i didn't mean that.""my isk sink are all the faction ships i don't own yet.*sighs*"
12/16/2009,"xxxak is absolutely clueless about pvp, anyone who supports him is a fool."
12/16/2009,i too say no. you already have the option to boost sensor and you also have the ability to bring friends.
12/16/2009,"that i agree with, sensor booster is the answer. the sensor resolutions where carefully balanced to get what we have now."
12/16/2009,"this 'idea' is sound, but that still won't prevent cloakers from getting far too close to each other in a mixed battlefield because while they might see the 'in position' icon they can't see the other half dozen cloaked ships accompanying them.cloakers in the same fleet being able to see each other would be a much more useful function."
12/16/2009,staking my claim to his idea from back when linkage
12/16/2009,"consider the current situation with corporate hangars... we've got 10 now, but with the increased player numbers, larger corporations can easily exhaust the limits of such.perhaps a proposal similar to the 'overview' tab could be implemented for new corporate hangars.limit to 5 master corporate assets tabs [mcat] and 10 'corporate divisional hangars' per tab.this would make it more feasable to allow blanket access to a single tab to a title (for example: corp pilots) and within that tab it can be further broken down to ten additional rights (rookies, squad commanders, captains... ect). rights to grant access to divisional tabs would be an option that could be granted to people with rights to that mcat and would lessen the need for a director to micro-manage every pilot's access rights.then that same corp could have a manufacturing mcat or market mcat, ect ect and each of those could be sorted more specifically to the jobs that they perform."
12/16/2009,i'm not a surgeon.i shouldn't need to have mouse control over what seems like a 1x1 pixel button.
12/16/2009,"i keep forgetting to try that reporting feature. the squelch idea seems interesting.perhaps a splattered egg could appear on the display of the offender as well -rendering the effected portion of the screen unusable. the local chat u.i. tool could be dragged to another screen location. yet, if enough eggs are thrown, the squelched player's only recourse would be to leave the system via a jump gate -the harmonics of which would clear the field of view.unfortunately, the eggs on screen would indicate, to the offender, that their efforts were having an effect."
12/16/2009,"true indeed, just takes longer to find things that fit. since there is already a convenient ""show skills that fit in the queue"" option, this is an extension of that useful feature."
12/16/2009,"actually i'd rather have a ""don't show skills that are already at lv5 in my skill queue cause i can't train them even if i wanted too"" option but thats just me."
12/16/2009,"true indeed, and of course, that is the minimum effort required - the reality is at least 2 x that. however, it does make me wonder why more candidates don't try from south america, there were only 2 this time.ack, good point! i think that promoting the csm is an important, however it should be based on making eve better, not getting a jolly. i think there are good people who throw their hat in, if they understood that there was some direct compensation for the effort."
12/16/2009,two issues that have been going on for a long time now are rockets and assault frigates. dierdra kindly raised these topics and ccp came up with a half arsed ab boost that never made it to tranquility.given that ccp have responded to these issues then put them on the back burner they clearly see there is a problem bere.is there a person amongst the new csm who can take these issues on and make sure they get the same sort of attention that they have been given by the player base?
12/16/2009,as they have been raised already we'll get a status update from ccp during the meetings in feb.rest assured i have both issues on my radar and want to make sure they are still in progress if not already implemented by then.
12/16/2009,alliance disbanding? docking aggression timer?why isn't anyone care about these issues?
12/16/2009,"it is being addressed, example, just have a bit of patience."
12/16/2009,"""there is currently no text in this page"""
12/16/2009,we've just discovered that isd like to change the page titles when they approve the pages. aparently being in the csm category isn't enough and they have to be titled as such too...the new link can be found here

12/17/2009,"can't support this, as i do not like the idea of modular pos's with limited attachment points. pos's with high/med/low slots, no thanks."
12/17/2009,"fitting slots would be no different then the current pg/cpu limits we have, it would be comparable to how it is today, as to what you could fit on and couldn't, the main reason for fitting slots per say, was to make modular management easier then it currently is, though that can be put on debate in the thread itself if you like, please bring it up :) also keep in mind, this thread is to support the basic idea's in the op post, not everything anyone else posts after that, though some of it should be considered by ccp."
12/17/2009,do it do it do it!
12/17/2009,"watch some of the trinity testing videos. afic there is an iteron rotating around with red alliance's logo on its nose. whilst i remember someone from ccp doing the ""too complex, too hard"" routine. they said that about fixing pos's so this get my support as well."
12/17/2009,"/signedwould love it for corp logos too though (since those are produced by the game engine and not outside programs, so they're probably easier.)"
12/17/2009,i support this. in this day and age its pathetic that you cant atleast choose between aa or hdr...
12/17/2009,any chance we can keep to one thread for this? other corp bookmark thread
12/17/2009,"supported.but we cannot allow people to manually edit the parameters, as that would mean people could easily make deep safe spots and do any number of weird things (0,0,0 anyone?). should probably just remove the parameters in the first place."
12/17/2009,nicely done!
12/17/2009,"or....""place a check in the boxes you wish to see on your overview, unchecked boxes will not be visible:""[x] wartargets[ ] global criminal[ ] gang members[ ] neutrals[ ] etc.also: i read the op and understood exactly what he was asking for, and it was not what was ""suggested""."
12/17/2009,"the use the the brackets to visually describe the issue is a good one. i'll try to explain further:the current situation-if you need to have a war target on your overview you need to do as follows:[x]war target[x]pilot has horrible standing[x]pilot has bad standing[x]pilot has bountyetc. etc.if a pilot belongs to *any* of those particular groups, you must check *every* group he belongs to in order for the pilot to show up.what i want is the ability to check which attributes i want to associate with my viewable targets, so that if a player has multiple attributes i can ask for any one of those attributes to display that target on my overview.example:[x]war target, displays only war targets, everything else is off the overview, regardless of what their other attributes are.what is even *worse* than the war target situation is that if you're only dealing with players with negative standing you *can't* have -10 targets on your overview without neutrals on the same overview. this is an issue of you're using neutral alts to scout and simply want to display only targets that have negative standing set and nothing else.does the above help explain the issue further?"
12/17/2009,"supported, this is very long overdue."
12/17/2009,"[x] wartargets[x] global criminal[ ] gang members[ ] neutrals[ ] etc.the problem with an inclusive list as requested in the above example , is if any of my gang members get themselves gcc's they will now appear on my overview and there is no way to exclude them without also excluding all other gcc players around me , which i dont want.i want to see wartarget , i want to see gcc's , i do not want to see gang members ( whether or not they have gcc ).include , exclude[x][ ] wartarget[x][ ] gcc[ ][x] gang membersupported in original reply."
12/17/2009,nvm
12/17/2009,the ability to show nothing but wartargets would be a nice addition to the overview settings.

12/17/2009,"how about also splitting the delivery bay into one bay per wallet division? that way you wouldnt have all divisions market purchases showing up in the same place and different divisions could be devoted to entirely different ventures without having to sort it all out. would also improve security, because your juinor traders wouldnt have access to the really expensive stuff some of your more trusted members buy for the corp."

12/17/2009,"/signed, fix it please."
12/17/2009,it makes sense to have more details on a podkill than just 'a pod'. it would make knowing you did the target some financial harm a lot easier.for killboard programmers it would also enable them to properly value a pod.what needs to be shown should be pilot skillpoints (to determine clone level costs) as well as implants.
12/17/2009,pointless gloating tool. no one shoudl have to share how they set up their implants or their total skill points.
12/17/2009,"implants, like fitting and cargo, are a valuable asset and therefore noteworthy upon destruction. i fully support them being shown on killmails, but as soon as that extends to them dropping, it becomes a big no-no."
12/17/2009,"how about just reveal which clone grade was used when the pod squished?as well as implants, ofc.it's not pointless. certainly if i can get a killmail for popping a nuubship or a shuttle i should get a detailed invoice of the goods destroyed when i flashfreeze someone."
12/17/2009,"yes yes pls, i like podding people and it is often harder to do than just killing the ship. i think its worth showing it on the killmails including the value of the clone upgrade. old players need to pay 20m per clone upgrade. i think this is a very good idea"

12/17/2009,"aren't kill mails based on the ship that's destroyed, not necessarily the pilot flying it other than the ship owner's name and such?"
12/17/2009,"not supported.implants are not part of the ship (or pod) in any way, shape or form, and therefore do not belong on the killmail.it really is that simple."

12/17/2009,"since there is probably no easy fix for the whole fw mess i would at least suggest to completly stop all mechanics that influence occupancy until all the loopholes are fixed.if the mechanics stay as they are it will just drive more and more people into using one of this loopholes in order to fight against the ones that are using them against them.so keep plexes around for personal vp and standing gains by capping them, but stop occupancy vp gains and assign a damn team and not just a single person to reevaluate and fix/upgrade fw.and just stop this loophole competition asap"
12/17/2009,"you may have heard about e.g. the jc- bnd- el8- battles in the north lately.it appears that our usual definition of ""lag"" has grown to something like not being able to do anything for up to 90 minutes.essentially what happened in the past ""big"" dominion fleet battles was:force a, was on grid of the incoming gate with roughly 300(sometimes even 100 suffice)people waiting for their enemy (force b) to jump through.what happens next is that force b foolishly (pun intended) jumped into force a.while most of you would think that the whole system will start to lag and the grid won't load for either side, you are wrong.what happens is that force a is able to happily shoot and kill force b, while the latter is rendered helpless, without a grid or the possibility to react.while this clearly justifies calling it a bug, at least some, if not all, eve-online gms call this a feature that results from the increased amount of players participating in large fleet battles. i, for one, have had a long but useless discussion with gm gruber about this ""issue"". while he continually repeated almost the same sentences over and over again, i was trying to explain to him why this indeed should be called a bug.he was not cooperative. my bug report is still open, but it seems that ccp is not going to allocate more nodes/servers for 0.0 space or publicly address that they are working on a resolution for this issue.please csm, address this issue in an emergency meeting, since this will affect all current 0.0 warfare and politics severely. we cannot wait 24 hours for a node to be reinforced, this is simply impossible if trying to defend your territory. this is an utmost urgent issue, we as customers are not able to address this in any matter on our own. i have tried diplomatically, but all i got in response was ""there is no verifiable bug like this"", while others may received slightly different answers. we were not able to proceed with our request any further and thus the assistance of the csm is of utmost importance now.kind regards, kythrenappendix:today we had about 400 atlas+friends in y8r- taking down a wi station+ihub. we jumped in with 800 people(in groups of 300) on a 100au spot. after 20 minutes solar bombers found our bridge-in spot and bombed us, at that time we didn't even load grid."

12/17/2009,"so this is a long-standing issue. it needs to be dealt with.at fanfest, ccp kept harping on about how the api was important to them and they hate taking it offline. i even remember vague promises of them not taking the api offline all that much anymore.since dominion, we have seen the api taken offline over and over again. sure, it might be due to an underlying issue and them having to preserve resources.but in that case the problem comes down to the api being poorly implemented. and rightfully so. the api only offers xml. if it was done right, we'd be able to get a json version too without many extra lines of code.lets make it simple. ccp needs to get the message that the api needs to be looked at. we need a new api that we can rely on. we can't with the current one. the current bouncy ball of an api is an insult to the third-party developers together with the limitations that are put onto, for instance, the mail api.we want to know what their plans are to keep the api up to the exact same up-time as tq. tq is just as important as the api. the api is just as important at tq. there's no difference, it's the same thing.here's to hoping that the csm will take this to iceland and explain to ccp the importance of a stable api."

12/17/2009,"i miss the days of being able to quickly change between ship view (85% zoom), tactical view (50% zoom), and grid view (15% zoom). this was taken away from us during revelations ii (?) when it changed to ship view, system map, and galaxy map, and then removed outright some time later.it would be an easy thing to bring back the original implementation, and i can't see any reason not to. for some of us, the current method of zooming in and out is cumbersome and clumsy, especially those on laptops.so whaddaya say?"

12/17/2009,"i am still waiting for a reply on how 2 medium repairers and a cap injector are as good as your passive tank?also both are faction bs. so if you wish, you can give me your tank setup for a vindicator, just for some lulz. face the fact that passive shield tanks are overpowered. that is also a fact that it is beginning to influence fw since a powerful passive shield tank takes much less training time then training an armor tank that is not nearly as durable. it would also be smarter to agree to a slight nerf, since things with the passive tanks are staying the way they are, then one day a very heavy nerf will be incoming.remember stacking nerfs on damage mods and rather heavy changes to all speed mods, the ecm nerf? or that sensor dampeners where nerfed to oblivion? that is what might happen to passive shield tanks one day."
12/17/2009,well a passive tank without tanking rigs is **** and so is the active armor tank without rigs.

12/17/2009,"correct me if i'm wrong... i thought higher inertia mod was better? my machariel, for example, has an inertia mod of something like 0.015, while my rifter is 3 or higher, a shuttle 1.and the 'tiny' signature radius isn't - it's got the same sig as a shuttle or small drone which are laughably easy to probe down. the sig should be reduced by a factor of ten."
12/17/2009,"seriously?the sailboat. in both examples. you don't sail much, do you.nasa science facts vs 20,000 yrs advanced science fiction.you're wrong good sir :)a shuttle is far more agile than a rifter, btw.a ship's agility is the product of its listed mass and inertia modifier, and will always be in the millions.frigates have much worse inertia modifiers than battleships. that's because they have lower mass.inertia modifier * mass = agilitybs agility = ~12 (million)frig agility = ~3as an example:zephyr - 5,000kg * 1,000 inertia modifier = agility rating: 5 (million)shuttle - 1,600,000 * 1 = 1.6vigil - 1,080,000 * 3.22 = 3.48vengeance (af) - 4.96worst bit.. vanilla stabber is almost as agile as the zephyr, and a fleet stabber is more agile :(stabber - 11.4mill kg * .48 inertia = 5.472fleet v - 9.81mill kg * .445 = 4.365why give us a gift this slow and hokey, do you enjoy seeing the whines of all the morons about to get suicided? snowball launchers please."
12/17/2009,"*hah* wow, i didn't realize that they would suck quite so much.i'm sure that what we're seeing in the current 'show info' is going to probably change just before they (hot?)-patch them on the 18th.hopefully they'll make them smaller in sig radius than a shuttle and as nimble as a pod. otherwise they'll get probed in 6 seconds flat and unless they have a sizable sleeper escort they'll die in 2 seconds to a helios' one drone.as for the probe launcher... will it be identical to a standard probe launcher (i'm seeing that rof and scan duration is identical, no boost to probe str)?being able to scout a sleeper site unmolested is a small saving grace, but as easy as it is to probe not enough of one, imo.now, give them immunity to aoe as well as targeted warp disruption effects and they'd be more than worth their weight, even with a mere 10m/3 cargo."

12/17/2009,"am i the only one who is a little confused about how a free ship can possibly be underpowered?look, it could have been worse. they could have given us all luxury yachts.but yes, snowball launchers rule."
12/17/2009,the align time is understandable. the only thing i'm upset with is its sig radius. i was expecting maybe... half? or less.
12/17/2009,interesting - you are complaining about a ship you will get for free. if you don't like it.. just contract it to me after 18th december..
12/17/2009,"i won't be happy unless i can fit a dd on it.seriously though, might be nice to have some bonuses on the probe launcher. i'm curious why no one else is jumping up and down, pointing at the mass. you could fly that ship through a wormhole a million times without destabilizing the wormhole. is it seriously only 5,000 kg? where do you see the specs on this thing?"

12/17/2009,"by skiboat, i assume you're referring to a jet-ski. that's not the same as an in/out board powerboat.a 12ft laser at full speed will perform a 180% turn and reach full speed in the opposite direction faster than a 12ft boston whaler with a 15-25hp motor."
12/17/2009,also when you jump through gates. the number of times i'll have my camera inside my iteron is starting to actually get kind of disturbing. nobody wants to see clipping planes.
12/17/2009,"look, i'm the universes biggest carebear and i'm not supporting this. now if you'd said that stealing in a mission gave a 30 second warp disable effect i'd be all for it. no, i have no idea why suddenly the russian's seem to be fascinated by stealing cap boosters but apparently they are."
12/17/2009,"so if you destroy a player's ship, you have loot rights on that wreck... right?oh wai..."
12/17/2009,"it would drive malcanis right around the bend! i have to disagree with the op because:ccp has covered salvaging in detail, if you had looked, you would have known this.don't mission in hubs, when i missioned, i was never ninja'd, because i stayed away from busy systems.op sounds whiney... enough reason to disagree right there."
12/17/2009,i am surprised that - with those cheap rig prices - people still salvage wrecks
12/17/2009,"that compensation is usually called 'bounty', 'mission reward', 'loot' and if you're doing more than 2 dps also 'mission bonus reward'in those same wrecks, go fit a salvager like the rest of us.i may not like the fact everyone can steal my salvage (intended game mechanics or not, i shot the rat, i took the risk, i should get the rewards, not someone with 3 days training for a destroyer and salvager. if i hadn't shot the npc there wouldn't _be_ a wreck to salvage, hence the feeling it is mine, but not everyone agrees with me on that :p) as the salvage is a rather large part of the reward, but i've seen too many threads about ccps endorsement to pipe up :palso: why does everyone mission in the same system? this whole problem would go away if you'd just visit eve-agents.com and find a better system to mission in."
12/17/2009,"that salvage (and loot) wasn't on the screen before i shot the rats and created it. it is additional compensation for my game time. i'm simply saying that why isn't ccp compensating me to create these wrecks since they are generous enough to give them to everyone? are their efforts more important than mine that it is given away? is their money better than mine since i developed my toons to create it?i don't want to fit a salvager to my ship. i want to be able to decide for myself if i let everyone have it by turning in my mission as the mechanics should work. in the current system, it is free to everyone because ccp says that it is. i want compensation from ccp for the real life money and time that i spent getting to the point where i can create it. i could also use compensation for the modules and ship that i use in additional to the ammunition and missiles. i am basing this compensation on their generosity of virtual wealth and ability. when i complete a mission and return to the site with salvage ships and everything is gone, and there are four to six players (all red) cleaning out the next room i have a major issue with that. i created this and should be compensated for what ccp allows other to take. ""to every man, according to his needs. from everyman, according to this talents"" -carl marx, founding father of the cc(c)p."
12/17/2009,"no, stealing salvage keeps the salvaging profession alive, so you will have to deal with it yourself instead of whining for it."
12/17/2009,"i agree with this. if you shoot a rat you should be rewarded in some way. perhaps ccp should look at giving an ingame reward for shooting rats, perhaps in the form of isk? perhaps these ingame rewards should be displayed when you click on a rat so that you can see how much each ship is worth before you shoot it.another good idea would be to have some kind of quest system where an npc asks you to kill a particular set of rats and would reward you with isk and loyalty points if you were successful - perhaps you could even get an additional amount of isk if you do his 'space quest' within a certain amount of time.as it stands we have brave and noble souls like cletus deadman shooting rats for absolutely no rewards at all purely out of a selfless devotion to keeping the spacelanes free of danger for the rest of us. sir, i salute you! eve needs more like you."
12/17/2009,"you can absolutely be compensated: come back in a pvp fit and blow up their ships. then you can loot probably half of what they've taken in addition to whatever their ship drops.hell, then you can even salvage their ship."
12/17/2009,"please tell me how is letting mission rrunners pew-pew stupid people boosting missions? i have heard this argument numerous times and i have never understood how more bloodshed is a boost to mission runing. i would love to do that, but most ninja salvagers are in noobcorps, and don't have the guts to take loot."
12/17/2009,"you can absolutely be compensated: come back in a pvp fit and blow up their ships. then you can loot probably half of what they've taken in addition to whatever their ship drops.hell, then you can even salvage their ship.again, my point isn't that i can take back what is mine. my point is that the redistribution of wealth, my wealth, deserves compensation for my real money since it is generously provided to all by ccp. if a player exploits, it is called a violation of the rules and the punishment can result in banning. what is it called when the exploit is policy by the game designers?how is providing to all what cost me a viable policy?"
12/17/2009,"as usual, i vote no.if the mission runners are so adamant and protective about their wrecks then they'll stop whining and take things into their own hands by bringing a salvager in a high slot instead of an extra gun, or make a salvage alt.everyone gets to salvage wrecks. get it through your heads already."
12/17/2009,op : baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawtake a hint - go whine somewhere else. or travel to lowsec.
12/17/2009,"i see your point, and i think the root of the disagreement is in determining what is rightfully yours and what isn't within the game world.with respect, the only thing that our real money (monthly fee) gets us is the right to log into eve and control our characters. what we do with that, i.e. the isk we earn, the salvage, loot, and ships we acquire, and the prestige we gain as we make a name for ourselves--none of that is deserved. it's taken in competition with all the other players out there.so if someone tries to take salvage from your mission, then either you have to come up with a way to stop them or get it first or... well... it's gone."
12/17/2009,"yes,we are communicating on my exact point. there are two types of people and two types of policies in this world and in eve. there are providers and consumers, there are progressive and repressive policies. like in life, consumers are always provided by progressive policies, while providers are hindered by repressive policies. eve encouraging the salvaging profession is a progressive policy towards consumers (the people that salvage and loot from others). from my prospective, eve has made me a provider by a repressive policy since my prosperity is allowed to be taken by others, and this was not by my choice. to this point exactly, nothing is deserved. i used my play time to progress through training and isk for ships, etc. and my reward for it? a repressive policy that consumes my prosperity to give it to others.

12/17/2009,i asked about kill rights on salvage during the dev meet and greet in vegas this past may. the answer i got was salvage doesn't belong to anyone person so anyone can take it. meaning there will be no kill rights on salvage ever and has already been brought up by previous csm(s).

12/17/2009,back to the top!
12/17/2009,"and what would happen with a fleet command, or a t3 ?"
12/17/2009,"ohhh shussh up, and remember that we fremen have a saying: god created arrakis to train the faithful. one cannot go against the word of godsorry couldnt resist."
12/17/2009,"command ships?these even say ""fleet command""if you're worried about their tank, you should try killing one sometime. they can be fit to have 90+% resists. in a fleet with reps, that is as close as you can come to invincible.the bigger version is the carrier (you can fit a command link). bigger still would be the mother ship that no one would be caught dead in (get it? i made a pun) right now do to the ""new"" dd. bigger still is the titan (though rarely used in that capacity). it would also be conceivable for an fc to fly a rorqual or orca, both can fit 3 links, and both could grab loot for distribution after the fight (not the best choice though)."
12/17/2009,"supported, not having an easy way to guage what's going to spawn in your neck of the woods is a pain. sec level should display minuses."
12/17/2009,yes fix delve... getting officers in -0.30 sov sec space is redicules...
12/17/2009,its time for some lovin...more lvl 4 missionssleeper ai theres only about ten trillion ideas been proposed so far- these are my fav 2.bottom line though is- lvl 4's need some attention
12/17/2009,"the one thing i would change about l4's is i would like to see a randomizer build into the mechanics (sleeper ai ?) so that the npc forces will adjust to the number of opponents, randomly selecting targets/changing targets at random intervals and/or focus on closest opponent. this will eliminate the first one in draws aggro tactic and put the focus on more fleet tactics. this would only mean ""no more free rides"" for your corp buddies, and it may also draw a ninja salvager or two into the battle. this would make for a more ""realistic"" engagement and perhaps remove some of the monotony."
12/17/2009,"as a ninja salvager, i support this idea.i  when mission rats target me over the runner and i can kite them 150km away."
12/17/2009,"example: 1. make so that you can open a can inside all the pos modules. dragging into a ship just to open it can be tedious and troublesome. 2. fix the overview so that you can choose what you want shown and be able to save that without having to worry about brackets that dont always work.3. after this latest patch, my ships actually look plastic. yes i have updated my 9800 vid card drivers.4.once you set your destination, be able to rt click the next system on the screen and warp to 0 without having to rt click space, scroll down to gates, then scroll to the gate and then scroll to the warp to 0its the little things that needs to be fixed."
12/17/2009,omigodyesplease.fixed that for you.i have a 9800 series card and this is not a problem for me - all my stuff looks great.you can. use your overview. i travel this way all the time.supporting number 1 and a good hard look at the issues of the overview (which will in turn make #4 not so much of an issue)
12/17/2009,supporting #1
12/17/2009,as it takes a measly 5 days to repair the lost sp for level 5 (many i would figure stop at level 4 which is less than 36 hours to regain) i don't see what the problem is.fly it till it pops! self destruct should have the same repercussions as a combat loss.and... has something changed recently? the last time a target self destructed on me i got plenty of his loot just no killmail.
12/17/2009,"actually, the status quo sort of makes sense. sd is basically the best possible loss - you lose the ship, but you do it in a planned way, instead of just getting bbq'd by an enemy fleet. it seems to make perfect sense that an uncontrolled explosion of your ship will damage your brain somehow, whereas a timed scuttling won't. and from a gameplay point of view, i find it to be an interesting mechanic that doesn't harm very much."
12/17/2009,"i don't agree. i don't go by 'how it would happen in rl' thought-processes personally, as there's so may rl things that don't add up in eve. (wormholes for example, would all have a black hole at the mouth, so the black hole in the system being an ""anomoly"" seems wrong, somehow, to me..maybe i've got teh science wrong, who knows..but you can add sounds in space, and flying through planets to the list as well )point is, from a 'balance' pov, it just adds too much incentive to self-destruct, imo. if you are in your t3 cruiser and in a fight against a ship which is slowly, but surely, killing you then not only can you deprive them of loot and killmail, you also would not lose any skillpoints to boot. what possible reason would there be to not sd? and if your answer is that you remove the chance of you paying a ransom to survive...how many of you would trust that ransom to be honoured?"
12/17/2009,"to state it simply ships with split weapon systems suffer when fitting them with damage mods. my proposal is to either condense all damage mods to one universal mod that covers all guns and missiles or simply add an equivalent missile bonus to gyros, magstabs, and heat sinks.don't know if it's been said already, but there you have it. thank you."
12/17/2009,"proposal 1: ship maintenance array has ability to repair shipsreason: the ability to repair ships seems like a fairly resonable feature to expect from a mobile base platform and especially from a ship maintenance structure. idea: all ships stored in ship maint array repair over time (e.g few hours). alternatively, putting in a 'repair bay' into these arrays that repairs ships placed into it would work.conditions:a) ship array is online. b) would (or not ?) repair fittings - e.g overheated modulesc) if 'repair bay' concept is used then it still counts the volume as part of the sma hanger total thus preventing it being used as an extra storage baythe option to run to stations to repair for cash still applies and for short term repairs within the pos the use of repair modules works for 'on demand' repairs. proposal 2: ship maintenance array has ability to repair drones. reason: again, the ability to repair ships seems like a fairly resonable feature to expect from a mobile base platform and especially from a ship maintenance structure. additionally, drones cannot be repaired inside a pos and having to run outside to use a remote repair module on each drone is a clunky approach.idea: seperate bay within the sma that only takes fighters / drones / sentries. these are repaired over time (e.g hours). alternatively: 'repair bay' from proposal 1 works for drones. conditions:a) ship array is online. once again: the option to run to stations to repair for cash still applies and for short term repairs within the pos the use of repair modules works for 'on demand' repairs. proposal 3: allow pos the ability to repackage itemsreason: going through hundreds of items is extremely irritating and prone to delays in large amounts. it makes sorting difficult and makes for a horrible storage interface. repackaging and thus being able to stack these items like a station would be very helpful.none of these proposals are particularily revolutionary or new concepts and i dont see anything wrong with their implementation."
12/17/2009,"i could see a repair facility, even if it is incorporated with the sma, but i don't think isk would work. maybe having the repairs cost raw materials (minerals) would fit the idea of the pos better, such as in a separate hangar or in the ship hangar of the ship being repaired. also, the repairs should take time, and should not be automatic.the idea of repackaging inside a cha is reasonable and should've been implemented already. it would make things a lot easier on poses.supported, especially the third issue."
12/17/2009,supported.
12/17/2009,all 3 proposal sound no more than reasonable and would make life in posses less troublesome.
12/17/2009,supported.although i would mention that you can repair any ship if you have the ability to change the fitting and have an armor repper and hull repper on hand. you should be able to repackage items.
12/17/2009,"1/2) perhaps some kind of nanite repair paste for smas should be added, to let you repair things while docked at it, for an actual cost. preferably player-made somehow, not just npc seeded like at present. 3) yeah, makes sense."
12/17/2009,"supported. i'd also support the above suggestion that some type of material (isk, nanites) need also be expended to repair a ship/drones."
12/17/2009,supported
12/17/2009,"since no one reads the suggestions forum...i was thinking, why not give bonuses for fitting faction to your faction?i.e. if you fit 'imperial navy' modules to your 'imperial navy' ship?a small bonus, mind you, but something measurable. let's say (just as an example) a 3% bonus for fitting a faction module to its matching hull (true sansha medium pulse to your succubus, for example). for each 10-15% of the fitting you 'match' you get another 1% bonus to all of the modules.so, if you fully faction fit a faction ship with its matching modules you get something like 10% 'extra'.just a thought, would make it truly worthwhile to spec out a ship in such way... currently it's just better to put t2 on a faction ship rather than it's comparable faction (usually, but not always)."
12/17/2009,"it's been brought up before..in different iterations, eg. bonus for faction item on faction ship, or for race of pilot, or for sets. something like implant sets for ships..i like the premise of that."
12/17/2009,"the bonus from fitting faction gear to faction ships should be based on the fact that it's the best gear you can fit for that ship. for example, when you go to fit a bhaalgorn, you should generally look at the gear available and lust after the dark blood stuff the most. db neuts, db webs, db mega pulse, maybe some corpus hardeners. not all of those are actually the ones you want to go for, but in theory they should be. explicit bonuses seem like exactly the wrong way to do things."

12/17/2009,"hi, i dont know if ccp has any plans to change the forum and fix the bugs other than ""soon(tm)"". but one thing i would like to see implemented is that when topics are moved they dont get a blue bar on the side just as when its locked. i always check the blue bars just to find someone doesnt know the forum topics and misposted instead of a maybe useful answer from the dev's to the topic.i am h3llhound. and i approve this message"
12/17/2009,sounds good bro
12/17/2009,"hi guys,i`ve just recently discovered that the new mailing system no longer keeps a back-log of mails for player owned mailboxes which has basically ruined a couple of mailboxes that i keep ingame for all players to join called ""classic chats"". my mailbox was designed to keep funny convo`s we`ve had in eve for everyone to read again, it relied upon the back-log as when new players joined the mailbox, the mails that were already there were automatically downloaded to their mailbox so they could read what others had already posted,since the new mailbox was introduced this is no longer possible and after petitioning it i was told by the gm to make a post on here to maybe get some support from you guys to have this option re-instated as an optional setting within the mailbox settings.i have made a post in the devs section of the forum which can be found here"
12/17/2009,"backlogs are properly the role of a forum, not a mailing list. when ccp rolls out spacebook, i think some form of forums will be included. failing that, www.blogger.com has something to say to you. annoying for you, i'll agree, but this is the right way to do it."
12/17/2009,"having already had this as a forum, when it died and was upgraded, so did all of the mails that were posted. the old eve mailing system made this easier and cheaper, and like i explained in the post that was linked, when this was out of game as a forum no-one bothered to post as often so blogging isnt really an option."
12/17/2009,"as cool as that sounds, right now it is relatively easy to get decent attributes in 0.0. you only need 2 implants for a given skill, and +3's were around 10m last time i checked. assuming you don't get podded multiple times a day for days on end, this seems reasonable.however, it might be nice to give non-npc 0.0 space a way to generate implants though, maybe make rats occasionally drop +1 - +3's or seed bpo's for +1 - +3's (they would take about as much in minerals as what they are worth now)."
12/17/2009,"actually i do have to agree with you.if you pick two points in eve, then the shortest path between them can be solved in polynomial time.choose several locations and look for the shortest path to visit all of them is np-complete. it differs from the tsp in that you can visit one place several times (rather than exactly once), but it does not reduce the complexity.so yep - you are right.that said, the existing ap optimisation routine would already be np-complete .. hence the warning if you optimise a path with more than 8 way points. the only difference between my request and the existing is to stipulate the end point of the path, which neither increases nor decreases the complexity of the problem."
12/17/2009,"god i'm thick. past the 22nd hour without sleep studying for finals, my logic just isn't quite all there. now that i've got some sleep. yes, of course the existing optimization would have to be the identical problem. actually, from a programming standpoint implementing your idea would only require reducing the upper index of whatever searching algorithm they use. well, that plus scripting the extra check box for ""lock destination"". compliments for sticking to your guns when challenged."
12/17/2009,"along with this thread anything that makes corporate logistics easier is a must have, especially with the massive corporations that are in eve now.being able to set a master destination and then optimize my pickup routes ending in that master destination would be invaluable."
12/17/2009,"np-completeness is kind of irrelevant to this discussion. even if it's a factorial process, like the naive algorithm would make it, ccp is sitting on a gargantuan supercomputer and o(n!) is still a quick operation when n=6. if you're worried about your algorithm going to crap when people input too many waypoints, just code in a ""no u!"" message when someone tries to optimize more than, say, 100 waypoints. besides, arguments over whether or not it can be done are really irrelevant - it's already in game, and has been for several years. it's just that we want to constrain the possibilities somewhat, which would actually make the operation shorter."
12/17/2009,"i have to, simply to prove that pc gamers also do stupid things, as they say, ""for the lulz""."
12/17/2009,"this is about building a character yourself. there are even some things that cant be bought in this game.dont be superstitious, at least tell us your reasoning behind denying a player to advance their character a little faster."

12/17/2009,"you have never said why. but i dont care about your opinion on this matter -i mean why should i? you have been acting arrogant, and quite frankly resorted to personal attacks and this is not an isolated insident. i i should have been more specefic when i requested some reasoning on peoples positions, i was especially interested by malcanis response to the matter."

12/17/2009,"i have plenty of money if i need it. i still think it's a bad idea even if i could benefit from it. also i'm not against 'opertunity', i'm against blurring the distinction between money and time."
12/17/2009,"disagree with purchased remappings for the reasons others have mentioned.this i'd support. everyone could do it once per remap cycle, but once done you're stuck with it until your remap cycles normally.it'd allow you to get out of a focused mapping, but you'd be stuck with a mapping that's not particularly great for anything."
12/17/2009,this... but only if its allowed once a year.no more no less.and even then i'd be hesitant... as our schizo'd op obviously has failed to understand... remappings cause dramitic shifts in skilling that would be nearly explotive to those who have groundpounded all this time.i don't want to see people buying up gtc's to cash in remaps.
12/17/2009,"i propose to discuss security issues about account hacking and how to prevent them.the idea is something like wow offers, e.g. key authentication via rsa key pairs (private/public) perhaps even using hardware generated keys.there are many 3rd party apps for eve. it's becoming increasingly difficult to identify malicious software. key loggers are a very obvious threat amongst many."
12/17/2009,"proposal: allow salvager modules the ability to loot the contents of a wreck as well as salvage via an option to do so. thus ninjas can still salvage without getting flagged if they turn the loot side of it off but the looting process is streamlined in general for other salvagers rather than having to open each can, look in etc."
12/17/2009,"alternatively, while the salvager is doing it's work ... double click the wreck icon in the overview."
12/17/2009,why?
12/17/2009,"just watching this old stallone flic and browsing along when i stumble across an old thread that seemed to fit the movie rather well. it's in the ideas forum, but stands to reason that it might be looked at by the csm.some of the ideas need work, but in general the basic concept is sound (t3 modular frigate or destroyer) with some decidedly needed unique abilities."
12/17/2009,"currently you need to be docked in the station that your locator agent resides in order to access the agent's locator abilities. i suggest that the agent's locator services be available to the player while the player is docked at any station, accessible through the player's agent's list.if this seems too easy and 'overpowered' then i could concede to a higher cost in isk the further the player is from the agent while accessing the locator services. i think that this would also prove to be a great isk sink, further improving the game.thanks in advance for your support."

12/18/2009,"defender missiles are horribly skewwed. if there is any hope for them to be useful for anybody their basic mechanic of use must be changed.1. defenders should activate automatically when your ship detects an enemy missile launch. this is the biggest change that needs to be implimented, players have too much to worry about then needing to worry about keeping an eye out for missiles and activating defenders.this will probably face opposition from missile users. but defenders should also be able to target all enemy missiles (directed at your fleet), not just those attacking you."
12/18/2009,"1: your first suggestion is pointless and if it had any effect, it would nerf defenders by not allowing the user even a base level of control. if you want a defender missile launcher to mindlessly launch at whatever it can, whenever it can, you just need to click the module once, and it will keep firing.2: your second suggestion instantly makes defenders overpowered, as they can be launched from high-rof rocket launchers, and against grouped missiles one defender takes out more than one cruise missile.you need massive balancing changes in order to fix defenders, in addition to having a good reason for doing so. as missiles are hardly imbalanced in pvp fights, there is no point to nerfing them just because you have a thing for defenders."
12/18/2009,"you should be allowed to man pos guns on any pos within your alliance, not just limited to your corp.also, if you have roles to pos gun, you should get a mail for any pos in the alliance that is attacked as well."

12/18/2009,"why stop there?allow for ownership of a pos to be handed over to an alliance thus enabling alliance gunners.could serve as deterrent to would be aggressors as well since a tower owned by alliance equals guaranteed gunners.roles be damned, they need to be reworked anyway .. no time like the present."
12/18/2009,"really, alliance and corp roles for poses need to be relooked at as a whole, but yeah this will do until then."

12/18/2009,"my proposition is simple and probably will be heavily flamed. at the moment the local is not simply a channel used for chat by pilots who are in the same system, instead it is the best tool for gathering intel. you can check for bad guys, good guys, the number of all pilots, you can even spot somebody coming before he load the system.i want to propose a change to the local channel for 0.0 and low sec so its not anymore the greatest ever tool for intel. the idea is to be changed to a delayed mode or a mode similar to the way it works in w-space, so you can see somebody only if he talks or you can only see the number of the pilots but not their details unless they speak.the change will introduce a brand new warfare tactics, will bring back the skill intensive and highly unused black ops and will make the game more complex and interesting.i already feel a great disturbance in the force, as if millions of ratters and ninja miners suddenly cried out in terror and jumped on the flame buttons.ask yourselves what will make the game better, not what will hurt or help your game style and give me your support if feel so."
12/18/2009,"currently local is a one stop intel shop. the second anyone enters system you know their name, corp and alliance without having to do anything.the halfway option of local retaining just the count (possibly delayed) would be a good compromise should full w-space behaviour be seen as too much.edit: i suggest this change for 0.0 only and not empire (lowsec could also have it later on depending on how it works out in 0.0)."
12/18/2009,/flamejust go live in wh's where that is already the case
12/18/2009,"i very much liked the delayed local in w-space. seeing a pilot total would be nice to allow spikes to be observed but i think you should have to actually scout around a system to gather intel about who's there rather than just clicking on show info from the comfort of a safe. therefore, supported."
12/18/2009,"""recon - two in local, nothing on grid, drake on scan""has a whole different meaning to it if you can't find out which corp/alliance the drake belongs to, and if he can only determine your presence by use of d-scan or watching the local count like a hawk.+1"
12/18/2009,"this has been discussed ad nauseam, and while i fully support it, i believe the devs have stated they didn't want to change local until they have a good alternative source for intel. this is sort-of one of those topics that has been discussed, most people agree on, but no one has come up with a decent alternative yet. the current probing system is... drastically better than the old one, but imo still a bit more ""active"" (proactive?) than ideal."
12/18/2009,"supportedwish we can have the current ""magic"" local channel here on earth though, we could instantly check for those pesky little green dudes with flying saucers, laugh on their corp history or photos, and smacktalk them till they undock."
12/18/2009,"yes plz. however all anoms need to be as profitable as level 4 missions, or need to be completable in a ship capable of fighting back in pvp."
12/18/2009,i don't think that complete removal of local without any alternatives is a good idea but supporting this thread because local change is an old overdue.
12/18/2009,"i fully support a change to local.personally i'd like the delayed mode or just showing the number.however i seem to remember the same as seth, that the devs didn't want to change it till they have an appropriate intel tool to replace it.anyways +1"
12/18/2009,+2 to 0.0 local showing total number of pilots but not each specific pilot.
12/18/2009,"ccp indicated at fanfest they would like some replacement tools so this is a good place to suggest any.e.g. you could have a system upgrade to enable local in sov space, possibly with a delay that can be further reduced with more levels."
12/18/2009,dont be a fool. all your will ever do is reinstate local in a slicker form that resembles a scanning function. then comes a point when people are asking to chat in this new scan function and the cycle comes full circle back to what we have now.

12/18/2009,"signed. mostly.the api needs redesigning carefully; nothing needs to be taken away, some things need adding and adjusting to make more sense. with cosmos in the works i imagine redesigning the underlying code to use the framework created for that (nexus) is already underway for performance reasons and to enable more data to be accessed. there are lots of things the api could do that it currently cannot. i do not object to the current implementation; indeed i think it is important to keep the api simple and accessible. restful interfaces using xml and json are the way to go right now.the api does need to be stable however. the stability of the api is crucial to services using the api, to corporations, alliances, and more. in some cases, api downtime can mean total standstill for an alliance- you can't reverify someone's authentication status every day if the api is offline, and forums go into lockdown, tools become unusable as wallet transactions fail to be loaded, lotteries stop, evemon and capsuleer users cry out in frustration.ccp is sending out a terrible message by treating the api this way. but the underlying problem in my opinion (without knowing all the details) is that insufficient resources are being spent on the api. last time i checked, the api team was a few people who had it as part of their responsibilities. we need people whose sole function is to work on the api, improving and maintaining things for the third party developers who in some cases have spent hundreds, even thousands of hours on api applications. for all the work people like myself and other third party devs do for your community, for free, it's not a lot to ask in return."

12/18/2009,"ok, since you only want to compare a pirate faction bs to a pirate faction bs, i will give you a comparison:lets take an armor tanked vindicator as an example.first a setup wit 8 turrets and a passive tank.

12/18/2009,snake fail fit. with a few bcs you can easily break 1200 dps and chew through things (who needs tank when you got dps?).and who doesnt fit deadspace gear on a vindi ought to be shot in the face.more realistic vindicator fitsalso your snake fit is using what ... 12 slots and the 3 rigs just for tanking.how do you expect a 5 slots/3 rigs tank to compare to that equally?
12/18/2009,"your so forgetting to factor what happens to active shield hardeners whn the ship is neuted. your also forgetting that passive shield tank dosent benefit from boosters, and dosent have a set of implants like slave or crystal. oh and then there is the fact that it gets little benefit from 2 out of the 3 warfare links shield tanking uses. my theritical golum using implants boosters and faction fit pushes 3814 sustaiend and 5270 boosted overheting pushes that to 5069 and 8231 respectivly and this is not boosted by a command ship.(i could also get that tank fully sustained by fitting dule cap boosters look passive shield tank is good, but to get a good pssive shield tank requires the sacrifice of alot of dps. if your ****ed about the new rattlesnake fit remember that its twice as much as the navy domi, and takes twice as long to train."
12/18/2009,"so many posts yet no support lol. everyone posting in here is some loser caldari pilot that doesn't want their precious passive shield tank nerfed. (mal excepted)passive shield tanking is similar to the speed issue we used to have (before it was fixed). the knock on effects of rigs and the various other modules have made passive shield tanks far too overpowered when compared to other options for tanking in the game. particularly with battlecruiser class ships.shield extenders and shield extender rigs need to reduce shield recharge slightly for each module fit so that the original peak tank is maintained.note: i fly a max skilled drake and broadsword, so i'd actually be reducing my ship performance with this change."

12/18/2009,"you have done exactly what i predicted in my original post, only translatted to piratebs hulls instead of cruiser hulls.you have compared a pure tank ( rs ) setup every slot dedicated to tank ( except mwd )to a solo capable balanced pvp fit with tackle ( vindi ) , not the same thing at all.second, i never asked you to compare pirate facton to pirate faction , i pointed out that you were not comparing like with like. comparing the rs ( tank bonused pirate hull ) to a vindi ( tackle bonused pirate hull ) is not a logical comparison , in fact by choosing rs you have selected a ship class which has no peer equivilent ( there are no armor tanking bonused pirate bs hulls ).the closest you can probably get is a abaddon with it 5% per level armor resists but of course thats a t1 hull.a more resonable assesment of shield extender passive recharge would compare 2 similar pvp ship setups.for example compare a dual mar ishtar to a passive shield tanked cerb.remember to fit tackle and propulsion mods to both ships.this would be a better comparison because , both ships are damage at range hacs neither of which iirc receive tanking bonuses.problems with the setups you have looked at include.1. rs will run out of cap simply warping around , so wont be able to keep up with a fleet for more than about 12 jumps.2. rs has no tackle , compared in your example to a tackle fitted vindi3. rs has no injector , wont be able to run its own hardeners without maintaining nos range to a hostile , has no web and no scram so it cant maintain range and can run its mwd for maximum 30 seconds before its capped out.if you want to compare a rs to a vindi for pure bait tank setups then you should be looking at a tri repped dual injecting setup on the vindi and you need to fit tackle and injector to the rs.a tri repped vindi probably reps around 1,5k sustained for around 3 or 4 minutes and can still fit tackle.not as impressive as the rs but then the rs gets a tanking hull bonus whereas the vindi gets a tackle bonus.passive shield tankers get a passive recharge element.armor resist setups start with higher base resists and can fit larger ehp extenders.if you want to take out the passive recharge elements of extenders then you would need toa) boost resists on shield hulls by 10% on one resist and provide xl extenders, 4,200hp to compete with 1,6000 plates and also provide a pirate implant set to compete with slaves."

12/18/2009,"you really need to look at the whole ship when considering these things. anyone can say ""x"" tank is better! that's not really the point.first you need to distinguish pve vs. pvp. i think it is clear that missile ships (notably drake and raven) easily reign supreme in this area. in pvp they may not be ""best"" but are not exactly bad either.consider that a passive drake is immune to cap warfare (neuts), immune to tracking disruption and partially immune to ecm (can fof in a pinch which while not great at least it can still shoot). now compare that to, say, a harbinger. harbinger is ruined by neuts. ruined by tracking disruption. cannot shoot at all if jammed.can a harby theoretically fit a better tank o rout dps a drake? sure. it is also has numerous achille's heels which can be exploited that balance it out.add in that ccp seems to have a jones for neuts in l5 missions and with sleepers.taken all together the drake is a stellar ship. yes, you can get more dps in some other ships and better tanks in other ships but there is a reason the drake/raven are far and away among the most popular ships in eve and it is not because they actually suck and no one has noticed."
12/18/2009,"problemcurrently if you are selling, buying or trading you often can end up with several interfaces all at once stacking on top of each other or having to be on screen at the same time.the idea is to introduce a new market interface which makes it easier to customize, trade, check items and use the market interface in general.suggestionthis suggestion states adding several functions and combining several windows into one, i will handle it step by step and the numbers for the suggestion have numbers corresponding to a mock-up i have made.click for graphical example (eve-files link)legenda1 - the central point, adding a second window which can be hidden and shown and shows either orders, items or ships at all times.2 - a set of buttons to switch from from orders to items or ships.3 - the transactions tab which when activated comes in place instead of the market details windows still showing the split view if it's active.4 - a new settings which allows you to hide certain tabs in the market details interface and orders interface to save room for more wanted information.5 - an added search box working like the transactions search does now to easily jump to new items in the market details interface, saving clicks.6 - very simple, making sure you can export from this interface as well.7 - not shown on the picture, a drop down addition to items which states check transactions to more easily access these.tl;drimprove the market interface.all comments ideas and suggestion are welcome."

12/18/2009,"proposal - black ops ships can employ a communication jammer module that shuts down all chat and chat counters(ie local count) in game for a specific range. say maybe a whole constellation. this would be a 0.0 only module. skill training for the module would not affect its range, but would allow finer selection of duration of effect(see cloaking ramifications below). at level 1 the module activates for x minutes. at level 2 it's x minutes +/- some additional time. at level 3 you can add/subtract even more time, this time being user selectable to the nearest second within the range allowed, and so on. there would be a notification somewhere on the ui that you were in a comm-jammed system, perhaps a motd type notice in local itself or something else, but you would need to see this notice if you jumped into a comm-jammed system or logged on into a comm-jammed system. the benefit of this is that it would allow you to move larger numbers of conventional ships(ie, non-cloaky) into hostile space without the defenders knowing the fleet composition and route immediately via ingame chat intel channels. the jammer effect would ""linger"" for some seconds after module deactivation to allow the black ops jammer ship to deactivate its module and warp to the gate to jump to the next system, then safe spot up(you are working with a cov-ops running ahead, right???) and reactivate the module before the effect from the previous activation dissipates. this allows the black ops to move and maintain the blackout even though it cannot move when the module is active. duration of the ""linger period"" would have to be balanced with warp time, align time, jump time so that the black ops can move from system to sytem, but it should not be so long as to allow the black ops to deactivate the module and be able to do things in an unhurried, casual manner with no worries.another option - perhaps this module only puts local in delayed mode instead of disabling all comms. if this is the way it works my suggestion would be that there is no notification that the system is comm jammed. it will be obvious to people watching local if all characters disappear simultaneously. i really prefer the first mode of operation however as this makes it more difficult to get intel out of the jammed constellation and encourages people to use voice comms which is a better way to play eve anyway if you are pvp'ing and this is definitely geared toward the pvp crowd. eve voice comms would not be affected. obviously 3rd party voice comms are not affected. non-voice comm users can do what they do today, safespot up and cloak, or warp back to the pos, or log and try back later. but the nice thing is that they cannot warn in alliance/region intel text chat channels in game what is going on.the module can be activated while the black-ops is cloaked, however if the ship is cloaked when the module is active, the ship is no longer invisible but has a small sig radius so it can be scanned down. the radius would still be small like a frigate so you would need a good scanner to find it quickly. need to determine proper sig radius so to balance duration of the module with scan time. i do not know the details on what that should be as i don't do this type of stuff(scanning for ships) often but i'm sure other people do.the module has a duration time of some minutes plus or minus a user selectable additional time depending on skill level, during which the ship cannot move in space."
12/18/2009,"additional alternative for roaming gangs. module has a frigate sized version that that can jam only a single system with a relatively short duration. the idea being that after the main gang warps into system and gets established at a safe spot or whatever, this module can be activated to maintain the blackout in the current system only, while the black-ops jumps to the next system and establishes the next blackout(this is particularly needed if the next system is in a different constellation), thus covering the fleets movements and not exposing their count when he disables his module to jump ahead to the next system. the use of this module would not be absolutely required if the black ops version implements the linger mode discussed above. this module would be limited to being fitted on electronic attack ships only and could not be activated while cloaked. there is no t2 version of either module. the same skill allows both but in the frigate sized version the skill affects cap usage or something like that thus higher skill allows you to run the module longer while at a low skill level you may only get a few iterations before you need to cap boost or remote energy transfer or something like that. cap usage should be high enough that this module cannot be used for many, many minutes of operation under ""typical"" conditions. i suppose if you want to have someone feeding you cap boosters forever or multiple remote energy transfers going that's ok but i'm not sure there is a lot of benefit in doing this. it's really just designed to cover you during cross constellation jumps and to give the eas ships something else to do so maybe somebody will buy one. could be used by small gangs as well to create more chaos. maybe this one is allowed in 0.0 and low-sec?thoughts/modifications/fun or not fun? thanks for your consideration."
12/18/2009,good ideas... but there's one major problem.afk jamming.it's bad enough we covert ops pilots have to take #### from the general population... not supporting this due to that reason.i'd rather support delayed local/no local in favor of sov holders... and those who show up in system instant local.... only then would i support your idea... so long as the opposition had there abilities to use on a alliance scale.
12/18/2009,out of game communication could also be a problem.

12/18/2009,and both a ferrrari and my honda civic will go 60 miles per hour. that doesn't mean my honda accelerates faster.
12/18/2009,"hydrodynamics =/= aerodynamics(ideal conditions again) a laser will accelerate faster than a whaler.i know there's other sailors in game, it'd be nice if they would speak up and acknowledge or refute my statements ;)since zephyr's been released and this troll hasn't been all that successful:its a matter of hull shape/weight and water conditions. the hull of a laser, along with wind conditions and the general science of sailing, will allow it to perform a 180 turn practically on a dime and reach full speed a hell of a lot faster than a boston whaler, which has a hull made for planing.hull of a whaler, at full speed, has to: come off the plane, plow into the water, turn around, and rework itself out of the water and back up on plane. i'd say it'd take 50-100% longer to do so."
12/18/2009,"don't go power boating much do you?you can do a thing in a power boat called a power turn. the following assumes you are going fast already:1) spin the wheel fast to the stops (or push the engine over to the stops if hand steered motor).2) pull throttle to zero. 3) hang on tight (you can seriously send people flying out of the boat like this).essentially the boat starts its turn then loses all power. the water being dragged behind it is going faster and slams into the back of the boat which is now pointed right (or left) of center. this pushes the stern around right-quick. your 180 turn is accomplished in about 2-3 seconds. hit throttle and accelerate in the other direction.i've done it, it works. careful trying this as again, you can be thrown from the boat if not prepared.no sailboat can achieve that.eta: can see it done in this video:"
12/18/2009,"nice vids, here's a laser pulling a roll tack. as you see, he didn't even lose speed."
12/18/2009,"yes, and it's scary as **** in a sunfish. you can learn pretty quick why they call that pole the ""boom"" simply put, sail boats have less mass. of course, on a dead day, you won't be going 10+kts, but a common misconception for non-sailors is that you need ""a lot"" of wind.... of course, all this debate between power boats and sail boats is rather off-topic for a ship i spent zero isk on, i guess i really can't complain. it will not, however, be leaving my hangar, as it simply doesn't accomplish anything useful, and from a game design perspective, it's pretty crap that a ""rare"" ship (assuming this is a one-time only thing like the apotheosis) has the same signature radius as a shuttle, but the align time of a cruiser. it's just begging to be popped."
12/18/2009,"to be fair that laser weighs in at around 130 pounds. the mastercraft in the second video weighs in around 2,600 pounds. i have driven and been water skiing behind one of those and they are powerful boats. it can go from 0-30 in a touch over 5 seconds (and it has gobs of power so it maintains very near that acceleration despite other loads such as pulling a skier (this is very intentional as it is built to pull skiers better than any other boat).so, 30 miles per hour to zero with 180 turn and back to 30 miles per hour in eight seconds. looking at your video at the 1 minute mark looks like the laser takes 5 seconds to complete the maneuver but it very much looks like it is not doing a 180 (maybe 120?).all things considered i'll leave my money on a power boat unless it goes very far afield (e.g. a 10 ton yacht versus a laser).i will say the power turn is a lot scarier from inside the boat. from the shore it does not look too bad."

12/18/2009,"i agree re: the laser in the vid. its the best video i could find that demonstrates the turning ability of the laser. its not even going full speed, and as its going around the boat taping it, it doesn't complete a 180 turn.as for the person above me, you missed the part where this whole thread was a troll.yhbt, hand"
12/18/2009,the idea is great and the model of the zephyr is amazing but frankly there are a few flaws in the design one thing missing from this ship is any sort of adequet defence from roaming players in the wormholes give the zeypher one more high slot and the atribute is allowed to fit covert opps cloaking devices. at the moment not being targeted by sleepers is usless if a player warps in on you. as it is now the ship has no defences and is basically a scanning shuttle with a large bullseye on it. give it covert ops cloaking and everyone will be happy. fixing the aligning and speed issues as mentioned earlier would help. thanks for the early beta release of the ship ccp we hope to see corrected bp's soon :)
12/18/2009,"also, let it equip two bomb launchers at once. and fighters. it should be able to control 20 fighters. maybe also give you a 10x training bonus while sitting in one. and every time you open the cargohold, it should always fill the remaining space with exotic dancers."

12/18/2009,should potentially be only one line of code which needs to be changed ( || instead of &&) ;)
12/18/2009,"ummmm, maybe my overview is bugged. please, show me where the salvage shows up on the screen after you shoot the ship? salvage does not exist before a salvage mod is used on the wreck.your ""compensated"" by bounty when you make the wreck. salvage is what is created by use of a salvage mod.i can't tell if your an in-game troll, or playing an in-game (*word* for intellectually challenged person, either through poor education, or genetics...).demanding compensation beyond the bounty for shooting the rat is just greedy. didn't exist before a salvage mod was used on it, so it belongs to whoever used the salvage mod."
12/18/2009,"you know, that is a good point. the wreck wasn't there until he blew up the rat, so the wreck should belong to him, and anyone who salvages it should be flagged. similarly, i've logged in after downtime or a server crash, and often i've been the first one to enter a system, which causes a traffic delay as the node hasn't been loaded. ergo, i created the system. i should be compensated for that, too, no? the system did not exist until i willed it into existence by attempting to activate a gate. so, where's my compensation? should not the miners in that system be flagged to me every time they mine an asteroid that i made? it's just not fair, i tell you."

12/18/2009,how about scamming with a disposable alt?most risk free carebear system in any game tbh.
12/18/2009,"dayum, was i that transparent? just trying triple the price with exclusivity to it. can't blame a guy for trying...thought i had y'all for a minute there. oh well..."
12/18/2009,"except ninja salvaging in a high sec system from an npc corp alt.i am not saying it's wrong, just saying it is risk free, as long as you're smart enough not to take the loot too."
12/18/2009,"so people losing salvaging ships to npcs =/= risk?the real money in ninja salvaging is both the salvage and the loot. for those doing nothing but salvaging, and making money off nothing but salvage, i'd say the risk is about equal to an npc corp lvl 4 runner who ignores anyone in his mission flashing red."
12/18/2009,"it's definitely not risk free; i've had several ninjas get popped in my missions.the best one was when i started a l4, killed one or two ships, then warped out to afk for some coffee. i come back in ten minutes later and there's a t2 frigate wreck, complete with a set of sisters combat probes and a cov ops cloaking device. not ironically, i salvaged his wreck for a 12mil piece of t2 salvage.very generous ninja, if i say so myself."
12/18/2009,perhaps i am confused.how exactly does one manage to get asploded in a mission space when you're not even running the actual mission?
12/18/2009,1. sitting in a perma tanked ship in recon 3/3 *giggles*2. warping out and letting the other guy get aggro. i did warping in and out with a guy for 10minutes. he was quite persistent in coming back. so i went to do a quick hauling job for a friend before finishing the mission.^^3. triggering a respawn. a typical ninja salvager ship doesnt react too friendly to a respawn in blockade lvl4 ;)
12/18/2009,did i not say i was wanting something more in the op? introduce more bonuses? last i checked all those capital ships you said are not very good and going thru gates on roams and what not.stop trying to troll and actually contribute. there is way too many people who only read things and instead of making constructive criticism all they can think about is how to spin things to troll the op.
12/18/2009,is this not the role of the command ship ?
12/18/2009,he did give constructive criticism. if he disagrees with you that doesn't make him a troll. some ideas are just bad and can't be salvaged. this is one of them; let it go and move on.
12/18/2009,"i suppose this is true, too much at once, time to rethink this idea and come back later./me goes back to the drawing board."
12/18/2009,would be helpful instead of using outdated 3rd party tools
12/18/2009,would be nice to see.
12/18/2009,"when these came out 2 (3?) years ago they were hyped just like fw as a source for all sorts of new stuff (notably the racial encryption books).then they were farmed to death (re: fw missions!) and ccp chose to increase the encryption drop books considerably and introduced both invention and improved exploration content.after nerfing the farming of cosmos into uselessness they have done absolutely nothing further with it. they've even nerfed the meta 6 blueprints & items picked up by those missions to less than meta 4 usefulness... adding in hideously complex build requirements on them essentially turning them into the new mines.and now they're talking about introducing ""cosmos"" as the new player social interface (spacebook), which only causes confusion with the old, forgotten cosmos they released so long ago.csms bring this issue up at one of your meetings; what do they plan on ever doing with this content? throw it out, make it worthwhile again, or what?"
12/18/2009,"yeah, this has always kind of puzzled me. cosmos looks cool, but i'm still not entirely sure what it actually is or what one is supposed to do with it. as for spacebook names, yeah, those confuse me greatly. i can see why they don't call it ""spacebook"" officially, but do you have to give it two different names, both of which are already used to refer to things in game?"
12/18/2009,"uh... okay... l4s are relatively easy money and yeah they could do with some buffing.but for the love of jove don't let them use the cheat-tastic sleeper ai. getting webbed, scrammed, and neuted from 100km is not fun when they can lob a light missile 250 km for 200+ damage a hit on an 80+ omnitank is just plain broken.make sleepers, and all other npcs, adhere to the same dynamics we players do and then implement advanced ai for them."
12/18/2009,"i agree with allowing the sleeper ai being implanted into normal npcs, but not the exact power of the sleepers. however, i'd say that all lvl 4s need a slight boost in difficulty. to make it more for multiplayer, not soloers. this will balance risk vs reward if done right."
12/18/2009,"even a dumbed down sleeper ai would work, it would add variety and unpredictability. and having fleet/multi-player mission options in empire space is a definite win."
12/18/2009,"i agree that l4s need some attention, but sleeper ai for everybody? i'm alright with named characters (zor, etc) getting the advanced ai, but if every character got it, it would eliminate a complete weapon system from being used (drones). that's like saying all missile launchers against npcs can fire 5 times before they're destroyed....not fun.drones and ai are already pooched. dumb it down a bit so drones can still be used, and apply it only to named characters, and you've got a good combo going."
12/18/2009,"while i would tend to agree with this, what about those domis eh?"
12/18/2009,"implementing sleeper ai doesnt mean they need to copy paste it, they can make some changes to the ai used in missions (same for everything else related to npcs)."
12/18/2009,"probably we need a 4,5 level of difficulty for missions.for new players the passage from level 3 to level 4 (barring a heavily tanked drake) is fairly difficult. for experienced and well skilled/equipped players level 4 are very easy.so the best option would be to have a higher tier of empire (low and high sec) missions that aren't based on the current level 5 missions.about current level 5 i feel they have been badly developed; i have done a few and the ""add more neutralizing towers to make it more difficult"" approach penalize active tanking and cap using weapons while keeping it easy for passive tanks and non cap using weapons. a version of the sleeper ai with ships that conform more to the way player ships work will make missions more interesting. keep the general flavour of the different npc factions (guristas still mostly lobby missiles and use ecm, serpentis mostly use blaster and sensor dampers and so on) while giving a bit more variance in damage kind and resists (serp mega using the missiles slots to fire torpedoes, even switching them to a different kind [with a delay] if the target resiste well, guristas switching missiles with a reload delay and damage reduction if they aren't kinetics, ecc.) and the new missions will be harder and a bit more challenging. maybe give those capabilities only to the higher grades of npc (i.e. the grunt gusrista still stick to kinetic missiles only while the elite switch them) and the missions will still be balanced in difficulty so that the player generally win, but they will require more effort and be more variable. and yes, some level or rr between npc ships. maybe that is the reason why those guy stay 50 km away not firing on you, they are rr the frontline ships and they have no cap to spare."
12/18/2009,"another change i think would be fun is if the npc rat logistic cruisers actually did some rr in missions.as for making lvl4s more difficult to force multiplay... that's what lvl 5s are for.i think they need some sort of lvl 4.5, with slight sleeper ai.something harder than a 4 to force multiplay, yet not nearly as profitable as a 5, and can be done in high sec zomg!something you would actually do for fun, not profit."
12/18/2009,"things that need to appear, let's call it lvl 4.5 missions for now:1) fewer ships. that's right, even though it looks epic, when a single assault frig wipes out 20 bttleships with no tracking and 20 dps each, it is unrealistic, stupid, makes salvaging harder and does not make sence. instead, give us two-three battleships with same tank and dps and loot and bountly drops as all those 20 battleships they replace taken together. so now, you will need some reasonable firepower to destroy an npc battleship, it will have 4 times the tank and 4 times the dps, drop 4 times more loot&salvage, be 4 times smarter and have 4 times the bounty. don't make them quite as tough as sleepers, but tougher then they are now. 2) give them some brains. they still should not shoot drones, but shooting that paper-tanked salvaging destroyer instead of ubertanked battleship might sound as an idea. it might be interesting to let some ai warp off (lol? where is my bounty?) 3) having less ai, but having them tougher reduces server load, makes salvaging and looting easier. less werecks as well.4) a little randomness. +/- 15% in the amount and toughness of ai. meaning two different mission runners running same mission in same system could have slightly different amount of enemies. just adds a little differentiation. 5)have a choice. agent offers several missions and you can pick, say 3, an easy mission, a mediocre mission, and a tough one, where you take on solo the entire amarr navy. that way players can pick what's appropriate to their skill level. ofcource, rewards scale the same way."
12/18/2009,add to that a rebalance of destroyers to make them viable as combat ships rather than sub par salvage ships.
12/18/2009,i agree with that too!
12/18/2009,"oh, i'm hardly claiming eve is realistic. space does not have the viscosity of motor oil, for one. but i still find it useful to think through whether something is at least broadly sensible in many cases. gameplay > realism, but realism is still at least a little bit valuable. as for the actual game mechanics, you're complaining that it creates too much of an incentive for people to blow up their own, rather valuable, ships. but remember what we're talking about here. we're talking about people sacrificing fights entirely, and still having to be able to hold on for two minutes(a very long time in most combat) in order for it to make any difference, and at the end you still lose your ship. i have no gameplay objection to that having some advantages, and ""no sp loss"" seems among the reasonable ones. i mean, after all, it's not like it's really an especially broken tactic - fleets of self-destruct t3 cruisers are not exactly going to be the next fotm. as for ransoms, it makes me very sad to see pirates who dishonour them. i'm a believer that you always honor ransoms, because if you don't then you won't get one again. simple profit-seeking. had an incident the other day where we accidentally blew up a guy's hulk after ransoming it(there were some very ill-timed communication troubles), we refunded his 100 mil, plus gave him another 50 of our own money for his annoyance. the latter was kind of silly, but the former is what i would expect of every self-respecting pirate. so yeah, there are some i'd pay, some i wouldn't. sadly, c+p searches tend to take a little too long, but the principle stands."
12/18/2009,"for how long?and i didn't noticed it in the patch notes, you have a link?put this way it seem that if you eject from a t3 ship (for whatever reason) and you go around in a pod or another ship you will still lose sp if the t3 ship is destroyed, at least until you do a session change."
12/18/2009,"well it depends i suppose.. in the case of a ransom, i guess it's the fault of the pirate if he's not payed attention, and not noticed the self-destruct.in the case of t3 cruisers that have a passive tank, and being slowly eaten away by, say, a pilgrim, it would have plenty of time to sd as it fights, then just switch it off if the fight turned in its favour...even an active tank setup would most likely have plenty of time, as the pilgrims ability to kill off the ship relies on first removing it's cap..as for honouring ransoms, your argument is a good one...i have a pirate char (as is probably clear by now ) and i've always honoured my ransoms. however my method of pirating was to stick in the same lowsec region, ransoming missioners and therefore, sure, you want to maintain reputation.but there's other scenarios... what if someone didn't care about reputation? suppose they had tricked a high sec missioner into flagging themselves...said mission runner would never trust them again anyway, so maintaining their reputation may not be as big an issue. or there's those that just don't care. take the ransom, kill them, maximise profit, then move on, everyone be damned.the last two are certainly not how i preferred to do business, but let's face it not everyone's the same, and i've seen known both those types of players in my time..anyway, i figure that losing a t3 ship should incur a sp loss, regardless of how / why / when. that's the added price of flying this new technology, and that's part of what adds the new exciting element to it.. i admit your point about this happening everywhere is valid, it's not going to happen in every fight, not even most fights probably, so maybe i was a little exaggerated in my op lol.still, it seems that by denying loot, killmail, and saving yourself the sp loss, whilst retaining the ability to save your ship should the tide turn in your favour during battle...seems unbalanced somehow to me. as i've been typing this i can't help but think that the self-destruct warning could be clearer as well. during a ransom scenario it's not always easy to keep an eye on the log window and a clear timer in the top left of the screen would be very handy"
12/18/2009,"maybe if they'd 'un break' split weapon systems and eithera: allow pilots to decide on a primary weapon system (i.e. on a typhoon 8 guns & 8 launcher slots).b: decide what primary weapon system is supposed to be used and toss the secondary out the window (6 guns, 2 launchers for the typhoon).things would then work a heck of a lot better."
12/18/2009,"while i appreciate the effort to un-penalize ships with split weapon system, i do not support your proposal, because it would give ccp one more reason not to get rid of split weapon systems."
12/18/2009,love my typhoon.hate your proposal.not supported.
12/18/2009,"bumping, want to see this topic, and the related t1 balance issues addressed. with thrasher being the only ship capable of filling its stated role (frig killer) the entire hull size needs to be seriusly looked at. imo, t1 destroyer should be able to eat t1 frigs, and a match for a t2 assault frig, but no real challange to a good crusier pilot. t2 dssy should be able to eat assault frigs, kill a t1 crusier but not be a serious match for a t2 crusier. this is of course refering to attack type ships and not ships ment to performe a certain trick like the curse or rook."
12/18/2009,"one viewthough yes, it would be neat to be able to set up a room/suite/hall/etc and decorate and such with things both found and player-made a la second life or even eq2. where things in place for sl style, it could set up a whole additional economy."
12/18/2009,"so now you're in the csm, and my predictions ""kind of"" materialized already.i wonder what are you going to do, and when/how will ccp react ?"
12/18/2009,"hey teadaze, i gave you my 2 votes at the elections only because i liked your idea for change of the local channel.you gave up on this now?"
12/18/2009,"nope, it is still something i will support."
12/18/2009,"well, somebody must bring this up, no?"
12/18/2009,"indeed they must.as i repeatedly stated during my campaign, it is the job of the csm to take ideas raised by the players to the next available meeting, argue the case to the rest of the csm and finally submit the supported ideas to ccp for development (or rejection ).so far i've been asked about local changes by two other people and have told them to submit their proposal to the assembly hall then evemail me the link for review. thus far nobody has stepped up.i believe strongly in the process being followed correctly and if no player wants to raise this issue then i will be forced to support other issues from players who have"
12/18/2009,"so be it, if you are not allowed to do that i'll bite the bullet myself.just made the proposal, ready to dodge laser fire now i somehow left with the wrong impression that this is the main idea in your campaign."
12/18/2009,"it isn't so much that we're not allowed, more i don't feel it is appropriate for csm to support their own ideas over those raised by other players . supported the proposal and will (assuming some people support it) submit it for the first meeting next year ).the main ideas in my campaign were ensuring csm follow procedure and to try and improve communication instead of attempting to push my vision for any specific changes."

12/19/2009,"supported! give us ""show war targets only."""
12/19/2009,"massively incorrect. if there are no missiles currently in space and targeted at the pilot the launcher will stop cycling. it will not launch if missiles are detected after it has been activated once it has cycled down; the pilot has to manually re-activate it.the only way it will 'keep cycling' is when there's a lot of missile spam. with grouped missiles these days it can be far longer than the defender's launcher cycle time before another 'flight' is detected.defender missiles would be a viable fleet screening tool and should be enabled to do so. missiles always hit for the same damage, and as such can logically be given a counter. drones can be popped by anyone in the fleet, guns range & tracking jammed by anyone in the fleet, missiles should be able to be shot down (but not under the current mechanic) by anyone in the fleet sacrificing a launcher slot for the purpose (lowering their ability to dish out damage).it's not a nerf to missiles, it's just repairing an existing but hopelessly broken mechanic. defenders can't even be used within 20-40km due to their flight mechanic and incoming missile velocity."
12/19/2009,what he^ said.
12/19/2009,"better idea, remove them from the game altogether. also remove fof's. they suck too and have no purpose cept to get you dead in high sec or shoot your corpmates in null sec"
12/19/2009,"emphasized a couple lines for flat lies. missiles never hit for face damage. they have an inbuilt counter in the fact that they are highly vulnerable to speed or signature tanking, which cannot be negated by handy modules like tracking computers or enhancers. the only things that positively affect missile damage are target painters and webs, which are hardly missile specific boosts.any if you're trying to pass off that boosting defender missiles isn't a nerf to missile boats, you're out of your mind. it still blows my mind that this keeps coming up despite repeated lack of support. missiles are at a pretty sweet spot of balance right now. relatively few complaints about being either overpowered or underpowered by most experienced players. they have a nice niche for gang combat. i would agree with removing defenders more than anything."
12/19/2009,"asset logging is another area that is seriously lacking in corporation and alliance management. it will be there. one day. maybe for eve's 20th anniversary we'll see an expansion to add modest asset logging (we could even call the expansion ""eve online: the logs show something"")yes and no... maybe a tier 2 starbase defense skill could exist to allow you to control more than just 5 modules, but 5 is actually a pretty decent number. the fact you only need two or three pos gunners to (hopefully) fend off a fleet of 50+ seems reasonable to me, honestly."
12/19/2009,not supported.make the idea a bit more complex and i would support it. something like reverse engineering of a corpse to salvage some implants.

12/19/2009,"but it would require 2 kill mails then, which kinda seems like clogging the lines. 1 for the ship for the first kill, then a second for the pod. people don't die when their ships explode.lord knows it's annoying enough when people link 1 killmail, let alone start linking 2."

12/19/2009,"to be honest fw is what got me back into eve. 1st on the caldari front, and now in the amarr front. it is a great system where you dont ever have to go very far to get a fight. and thats what most of us love. but the system is both flawed and broken.to make my points and carry on the views of others. lp rewards for both plexing and ship kills must be addressed. after 359 minmatar kills over a weeks span earned me a total of 2000 lp. when i saw it i thought it was just sad. at that rate it would take me months to afford enough lp's for a navy omen.another if the actual reward of claiming sov in a fw system. make it mean something. no one gives a damn about shooting a bunker unless your opposing fw group is there trying to defend it. allow it to rebuke opposite factions ability to dock there. think about it. its a station controlled by your enemy. dont you think you would be shot on sight the second you got out of ur pod.a third issue is the fw missions, now i do agree that they have been farmed pretty bad, but the current change makes the even worse. the inability to find some way to decide what kind of mission and where it was located was a good thing for fw. where the risk v reward of fw missions is tilted 1000 times more of the risk side. you should at least give us something to find some way of making iskies while staying on the front lines. like those before me we have stated many changes that should be addressed. and thanks go for the csm that is fighting for us. if you want to help make faction warfare useful. listen to our advice. were the ones playing your game. least you can do is read and respond to our constructive comments."

12/19/2009,"supported!showing count just not the characters etc sounds like a good solution personally, but any change being looked at would be welcome.i don't actually believe the current intel tools would be all that insufficient without local - since it would affect both sides (e.g. to take the piracy example, it's just as difficult for the pirate to find his target as it is for the target to find the pirate). however, this could be an opportunity to add benefit to developed sov systems by enabling new intel functions there, since that's probably the main area where removal of local will be felt negatively."

12/19/2009,"if it hasn't been looked at yet and discussed i would be surprised.0.5 and up as is. concorrod is running the show.0.4  0.1 space delayed. concorrod dont like sending techs down there, so the equipment is down graded.0.0 no local like wh space. basic services to the people.

(cloaked alt with sound turned up)there is an onboard scanner.there is still the use of your alliance/corp intel channelthere is still the use of a good old scout."
12/19/2009,"to be honest the largest issue, which sadly no one has said is the fact that fw missions face a much larger risk v reward than your avg lvl 4 mission runner. the largest being is getting killed heading to or while even in the mission itself. the current nerf to missions is just sad. because of this were forced to accept a mission without even knowing if we could even get there to try to complete it. so what happens if we fail the mission, and cant complete it within the 12 hour time span. well than were pretty much screwed. allowing us to choose the missions to complete and what systems to do them in was one of the few fair ways of maintaining our isk flow. which if u are really involved in fw pvp you need because constant combat means lots of lost ships. these missions were originally put in place as a way for us to make money while still being in the war zone, and not have to fly back to our ""mission hub"" for a few days to get 500mil or a bil to replace fleet losses. just my opinion."

12/19/2009,"the passive tanked drake will not have mwd, point, or web. if it does then it will not run them for long, and will loose more than half it's tank. if it's using invul fields for the omni tank in pvp, a neut will easily turn them off, as unless the thing had just undocked, it will be low on cap constantly. takes over half hour for it to recharge.a passive tanked drake is a horrible ship for pvp, for anything bar possibly surviving 2 cruisers. even then, those 2 cruisers will probably quickly kill it.it also does **** poor dps without any bcs'sand no, i don't use a passive tanked ship anymore, active tanked tengu for missioning for me, and shield buffer drake for pvp."

12/19/2009,"it is hardly a niche. there are a lot more examples then just drakes. passive shield tanked hics are only one of the things that spring to my mind. there are also passive tanked myrmidons, since even with a bonus on active armor repairers a passive shield tank is more useful in pve and those myrmidons are not that rare in pvp. passive shield tanks are already very common in that ship class and that is not only because of the shield recharge, but also because a passive shield tank is able to auto regenerate and has not the many drawbacks of active tanks.so much for your small niche."
12/19/2009,"you've mentioned hic's (oynx) and the myrm.the last time i engaged a fully passive tanked myrm, i had him to the absolute breaking point of the shield tank by myself in another bc. if i had have remembered to bring the fury em missiles (just had to be the one time i forgot), i would have killed him easily. he spent the entire time slowboating his useless self trying to get in blaster range as his drones were already dead. when a hostile gang warped in, i simply left.with nothing to tackle other than a single point, he was left dead in the water, to any sized ship. a battle ship with an ab could kite him. absolutely useless other than possibly for baiting one or two ships, and the back up had better come quick, anything can get outta point range of it easily.the onyx is possibly a viable use for it. problem is, much like everyother ship, that it caps itself out too quick.basicly, if you're frightened of passive shield tanked ships in pvp, you're doing something wrong"
12/19/2009,"something must be done. the large roaming gangs of passive-tanked drakes are destroying everyone who comes against them. we are all doomed./sarcasmits a niche role for a few ships, that has barely any effect on pvp outside of a few cases. even then, its usually better to just bring a different ship."

12/19/2009,"how often can you make a new corp and join corps you are opening, just to avoid a wardec ?is it ok to do this endless ?its sort of corp spamming. if you just want to avoid war you could join a noob corp so in my opinion this should be reglemented.i know someone who has stolen isk and ships and is wardeced every 2 days inside a different corp he opened, just to avoid the wardec. i cant believe that its ok for ccp, that he is doing this endlessly.i see that there are some behaviour which is not allowed because its an exploit. how about corp hopping then ?"
12/19/2009,if he continually makes and closes corps to avoid declarations it is an exploit.if he moves from corp to corp to corp to avoid war declarations it is not an exploit.ccp is too terrified of offending a few frightened crybabies to make war declaration flags persistent on a per-character basis to prevent this continual exploit.
12/19/2009,so he stole your money and your ships...and he laughed at you. then he hops corps to avoid your wardec....and he laughs at you. sounds like he's having fun and you're not. stop chasing him and go have fun. keep your eye open for opportunities in the future to ruin his day but don't let your enjoyment of the game be destroyed by a useless chase that you can't win.what he's doing is not an exploit. he's following the rules of the game in the same manner as the people who are wardecing him endlessly. he pays the fees to open the corps the same as you pay your fees to wardec him.

12/19/2009,probably in a method similar to how you can currently jam coms like radio waves and cell phones....last i checked their signals weren't in the visual spectrum
12/19/2009,insurance is a completely different topic than he is proposing. have a look at the wiki entry for this one:
12/19/2009,"not supported .. the zephyr is fine ""as is""as it's a ""solar sail"" boat im guessing it's engine is actually the large bright spherical mass found at the centre of all solar systems .... not an inert mass of technology inside it's hull.all the comparisons made in this thread are based on failed assumptions.zephyr is a spaceship (in the same way an apple is a fruit)shuttle is a spaceship (in the same way an orange is a fruit)an apple is not the same as an orange."
12/19/2009,"the zephyr is a ""prototype gallente exploration ship"". a class of it's own.this could be the start of a new class of ships. i have a feeling there will be more, and better."
12/19/2009,"i once made a wish on a space-genie that this would happen to me every time i opened my raven's cargohold; unfortunately the third time i did it, the dancers mutineered and took control of the ship. they refused to give it back until i agreed to fly them to jita, buy them all drinks at 4-4 until they were nicely drunk, and swore a solemn oath to ""respect working women for the rest of my eternally recloned life"".luckily one of them took a liking to me and decided to stay with me as my girlfriend; sadly i lost her recently in a tragic accident involving a rogue drone, a shipment of whipped cream and a faulty amarrian torture device."
12/19/2009,i am asking for a a passive defensive system that will give an otherwise defenseless ship (that by the way is irreplaceable as of yet) the ability to survive in a wormhole with other players. as i said before not being targeted by sleepers is usless if anyone with a scanner can come in and instapop you. the ability to fit cloaking devices is a entirly reasionable request. also because of the nature of the zephyr there have also been reports of high sec suiciding simply because it is defenseless. you are the one who is making the unreasionable request of dual bomb launchers not me
12/19/2009,"sweet jesus. it's this year's snowballs and snowball launcher. it's a trinket, a curiosity. be happy it has any use other than hangar spinning. it was free ffs"
12/19/2009,oh for crying out loud. stfu & htfu. it was free. it is a ship that you pull out once in a while. its a freaking nice gift from ccp. cool effects and an interesting ship design. nothing else. the fact that you can fly with sleepers on its own makes the ship worth it. want a cloak? get a covert ops ship. good grief.
12/19/2009,"i dunno, there were some serious balance issues with the snowball launcher given the disparities in base thermal resistance."
12/19/2009,i had an idea to improve cap stability and allow a greater fine tuning of shield and armor systems. i propose the ability to set a auto repeat timer. i am not proposing changing cycle times or module effetiveness but what i propose is the ability to st in seconds how often the autorepeat will trigger a cycle. i have found it hard to manually babysit a x-large sb while focusing on rats and scrambling frigs. a delay timer will allow you to effectivly calculate the ammount of time needed regenerate your capacitor and effectivly make any fitting cap stable at the cost of fewer activations and reduced effectivness. allowing you to focus on other things such as targeting and raping things
12/19/2009,handling exactly that differs good from bad pilots. bad pilots just switch the module on. good pilots manage their cap.
12/19/2009,"alliances need to be relooked at and changed so that an alliance is more like a super large corp rather than a bunch of corps that share a name. 1. there needs to be a greater definition of alliance property versus corporation property. outpost/systems are a prime example; an outpost should be long to the alliance and not a corporation. the alliance leadership should then be able to give roles to anyone in the alliance, regardless of whether there in the executor corp or not, to say make changes to a station or ihub or system. and maybe even make it possible to restrict what systems a player has roles over. 2. alliance organization: this may kinda run-off the roles bit but regardless of what corp people are in in the alliance, members should be able to join special organizations that help to further organize the alliance. ie there can be a industrial group, military group, etc. that exist in an alliance and its members are all part of different corpoartion. so some members from corp a and corp b both join group a without having to leave thier respective corps.3. alliance wallets: this further runs off the above two suggestions. the alliance leadership (which can be a group of members from all different corporations in the alliance) can choose to levy a tax (or whatever they decide, donations could be another option) that goes into an alliance wallet, it doesn't belong to any one corporation or player, but belongs to the alliance, so even if the person who manages the account leave the alliance or the corporation leaves the wallet will remain a property under the alliance. the alliance can then choose to allocate fundings to different parts of the alliance, system upkeep, funding the different organizations, ship replacement programs, salaries, etc.what i'm saying is that currently an alliance seems more like a group of corporation under a single flag than its own intity. given how 0.0 alliance work, they act more like a single nation, rather than a coalition of corporation. so i'm saying the alliances should be given the tools to give it more options so that it can act like a nation."
12/19/2009,"that would be good.i had same experience, most gms are nice and smart, but some are really idiots, repeating the same phrases again and again and not willing to understand or to listen./supported"
12/19/2009,"i'll keep my proposal short...but it consists of 3 parts:1. number of entriesi'm sure this has been asked time and time again, but i still ask: increase the number of entries allowed for alliance-wide standings. with thousands of corps and alliances in eve, it becomes near impossible to keep an accurate list without ""pruning"" it constantly.2. sharingin some parts of 0.0 (i.e, providence), standings change every day. please allow some method of exporting the standings lists to be ""imported"" by an alliance executor to merge the standings lists. there's also an option for an api, but that would cause even more stress on the api (and let's face it, it's under enough as-is).3. loading lagsome people have extremely long standings lists, whether they have tons of agents or you belong to an alliance with a large standings list. make it an option to turn off portraits and corp logos to speed up loading times.well...that's it. discuss."

12/19/2009,"lol, eve's wiki has all the bureaucracy of wikipedia with none of the link forwarding. while it's admirable to put your role of representative before your own pet projects, i think it's a safe assumption that you were voted in because a significant majority of voters agreed with the issues you mentioned in your campaign. if we wanted the csm to be a ""tabula rasa"" style representation, we'd just ask ccp to hire a third-party consulting company. but that's just my opinion."
12/19/2009,but are you guys planning to demand a statement for rr aggression/docking games etc? i think that ccp have never actually commented/acknowledged that issue?
12/19/2009,"in a way ccp have hired consultants, just unpaid and drawn from the playerbase i never stated i would be pushing specific changes to the game, in fact i was very very clear that proposals would have to be raised by the players themselves. i always said my reasons for running were to ensure small gang pvp was represented in any discussions going on, to increase communication to the players and maybe improve the image of the csm by specifically not using it as a platform to push my own vision (instead accurate representation of the player raised issues). again i tried to be very clear about this during the campaign.if anyone wants to take me up on a particular issue raised during the campaign then they are free to post a proposal and pass me the link. i will then take it forward to the csm on their behalf"
12/20/2009,"this has been on my mind ever since before i was a csm candidate, or the csm even existed. i've put a lot of thought into the process, and have come up with what i consider a very eloquent solution, although it's just the framework. you can view the work* i've put into it at the following link:depots* not all of the ideas are mine. heck, even the picture on the first page isn't mine. however, i did put a lot of thought into it, so it should hopefully work out well."

12/20/2009,"interesting how people don't realize what the main issue is here: cheap minerals allowing ""insurance fraud"" to happen."
12/20/2009,"i'll agree insurance needs to be looked at again. the specifics, however, are still unclear.regardless, posting to support the idea of an overhaul of the insurance system."
12/20/2009,"this really really needs looking into, total removal i don't think is the key but, no insurance or half insurance for concord related death and for self destructing, this might just have the added affect of making those annoying people who try and deny you a km by blowing themselves up from doing so. in short.*reduce insurance in total down to 95% of average traded mineral value.*reduce payout by at least 40% for destruction by concord* reduce payout by at least 50% for self-destructed ships.taking into account my own ideas on this, i fully support reform of the insurance system, we should not be able to make isk off it."
12/20/2009,"for every pod kill. thats like saying killing teh support ships in a battle shouldn't be added as it clogs up the killboard if there is isk loss, it should be reported, to maintain accuracy of campaigns successes / failures.hardly a success if you do 1 billion isk damage to the enemies ships, but then lose one single pod that costs also billion to replace...means you've broke even.at the moment, killboards don't reflect this."
12/20/2009,"be careful what you ask for guys. someone came up with the bright idea that sovereignty needed overhauling and now its horrible. once ccp starts changing things, they dont always change them for the better."

12/20/2009,"it is the point, the local intel tool is 100% fair. everyone gets the same amount of information, there is no bias there. the point about the cloaks is that they make people unprobable now as it is. meaning that people have to rely on intel to even know of their existence, there is no other tool to use to find out that they are there. everything, everything in this game is designed to have a counter. without local, what counter is there to cloaks, both covert and normal? i am not trying to make a proposal here, i am saying that your change is an unbalancing change and it doesn't look at the whole picture."
12/20/2009,having spent some time in w space i don't believe that the removal of local + cloaks produce an unbalanced game. infact i actually prefer the situation in w space.in w space you have to actually have to work for your protection etc. i would suggest that the d scanner and the probing system does provide an adequate intel tool.you actually have to work for intel - good! if you need intel and don't want to get it yourself then pay someone to get itw space isn't unbalanced - introducing the same in 0.0 won't make the game unbalanced.definetly supported
12/20/2009,"/not supported - ccp will break it if they try to ""fix"" it."
12/20/2009,"there's a reason some ppl are, and some are not in w-space. if i enter a wormhole, i _know_ i won't have local, so i keep an eye out for probes. with the number of ppl going to w-space i don't have to be too worried though.0.0 otoh is a busy place, with lots of choke points everyone can warp to immediately. gates and belts come to mind, and ppl jump system all the time. if you don't know, cannot know who is on the other side, you're only buffing the roaming pvper.for the one claiming removing local would favor both attacker and defender, i'd say you're wrong. all the attacker has to do is a simple directional scan towards the belts, warp to them and kill the hulk, ratter, whatever. if that same ratter/miner would have to press his scan button every other second just to have a small chance of survival, what do you think he'd do? pack his things and leave for high-sec.face it, how much you want eve to be about cooperation, gathering personal isk or brining up ones sec status is mostly done individually, and personally, i don't think you should want to change that. it is, after all, a game. you cannot force ppl to cooperate down to the lowest level on every mouseclick they do, it will drastically change the game, and they will leave (either the game entirely or the parts that make them do things they don't want)personally i don't really need to be able to right-click show info on everyone in local, but only because our kos-list is actively maintained. if all the neutrals in our space would have to worry about all the other neutrals (as they can't right-click and feed them to the kos-checker anymore) it would depopulate providence.as it stands, local is the only thing that makes 0.0 viable for a lot of ppl. if i were to lose a freighter every week due to lack of intel i'd stop playing very, very soon, at least in 0.0i can fully see why nbsi entities and roaming pirates want to see local removed (the first one will want some sort of intel on number of blue, neut and reds though, the last will only rejoice because of the free i-win-button), but currently imo it would destroy nrds."
12/20/2009,"local as it currently stands gives you the information of who is in the system but not what someone is flying, where this person is going or what this persons intentions are. these 3 other facts can be derived from observing the system layout and the directional scanner. therefore the only purpose of local is is telling you who is in the system with you.now removing local itself a bad idea. pveers lose their only intelligence tool, pvpers sneaking up on ratters get a huge benefit (especially when using recons). this is just one example but other include 50 man gangs hiding cloaked near a gate, promotion of usage of directional scanner bots etc. in the end there needs to be some sort of intelligence tool. the reason why this works in wormholes is due to the low amount of travelling players and the risk of attacking players is big due to the fact that the ambusher might not make it out alive as well.delaying local is something which might just work but the question is how long the delay should be, if the delay can't be extended too long due to giving some parties the upper hand then the use of having a delay at all becomes a point of discussion.as primary a pvper i actually like local in it's current form as when used wisely it can also be used against your opponent. sure it tells your potential victim that you are there but these people need to pay attention to this channel to avoid getting killed. this means their safety isn't a guarantee and is determined by their own actions.however if anyone ever comes up with an idea which could revamp the intelligence tools then i'd happily support this, as long as it gives both sides the same information. one idea i liked for example was one where blues reds and neutrals were displayed in numbers. this removed the aspect of knowing who is the system but still knowing if this person is your enemy or not.so as to this proposal i'm going to have to say no."

12/20/2009,"only 10% damage bonus per level, and the ships have so gimped fitting attributes that the drones are basically their only dps."
12/20/2009,"that's not the case, as has been stated above me.but! even if it was the case, there are plenty of boats with damage bonuses to weapons (nightmare? 100%), along with the rig/implant damage bonuses. why should drones be any different?i'd also love if the drone rigs negative affect was something besides cpu.. but whatever."

12/20/2009,"signed.the api really adds to the richness, and helps to alleviate some of the sheer tedium due to limitations of the user-interface. it is realistic too, as you should have various data tools and software at your disposal, and options for 3rd party data management apps.this really needs considered a 24.7 mission critical resource, like the market. if the solution is hiring a few more very expensive expert admins/data architects so get that coverage, then that's money well spent."

12/20/2009,"buddy list, buddy - friend, so why are the majority of buddy lists filled with war targets?as far back as i can remember adding known war targets to your buddy list has been standard practice, knowing which targets are online is a great advantage. however trying to keep all your own corp members updated on new or changed targets is a nightmare, also adding all 5000odd members of goonswarm to your buddy list just isnt right.i am suggesting an addition to the wars tab in the corp interface, ""known targets"" or something similar, this would be a similar style and usability to the buddy list except it would be available to view and be added to by any corp member. in addition you might be able to add known pos locations, or systems/stations where targets are known to operate.this would form a collective intelligence pool, avalable to all members of the corp."

12/20/2009,"to be honest, i dont need the opinions of players, because they can be as different as the both above.i dont whine about the fact that this player was stealing.. this is normal behavior in our eve universum.but opening corp after corp just to avoid a wardec shouldnt be possible.but its part of the game until ccp is changing this, which i would like to support or ask for here.i have read very often that making new corps again and again is an exploit, is that true ?and yes, i would like to kick his ass in a normal legal way. and really best would be if i could wardec a person ... at the end i dont think that its much fun to open a new corp every 2nd day, even if he is laughing at me.but wardec and corp making is quite cheap, so this will be sort of an annoying endless game."
12/20/2009,this is not an opinion- it has been stated by ccp.closing a corp and creating another corp is not an exploit. he can make a new corp every day if he wants- it is allowed.
12/20/2009,"ok, do you remember where this statement has been made ? or who wrote it ? because i can also read, that it is an exploit."
12/20/2009,the original response can be found hereit reads in part-
12/20/2009,"thank you for the link, very interesting.ccp really should work on the mechanic to make it clear and not provide exploit lists.still i cant say that its really clear, if you do corp spamming endlessly, that cant be the way how it is meant to be, imho."
12/20/2009,posting in a thread.
12/20/2009,"hey,i understand this has been brought up most likely tons of times yet i'm going to bring it up as well. ccp has put a war function into the game which allows corporations/alliances to rage war upon whom ever they feel as long as they pay the fee.i find a problem with this how ever more then anything, entire corporations will completely disband and go join either an alternate corporation they created or stay in npc corporations until the war is dropped and then they go back and resume there daily life.i can understand being war decked is not the funnest thing in the world especially when you are not a pvp/combat pilot yet at the same time the people doing this are doing it to make isk as well so here is what i propose.i really do hope people will support my proposal or maybe come up with another idea to help prevent people from evading wars as it makes the game unfair to people who choose to do this. i know you can get pvp by going to low sec or 0.0 but for some people that isn't what they want. everyone has there personal preferences and mine happens to be empire wars.thanks for your time,~recoil iv"
12/20/2009,supporting my topic!i wanted to add to my original post above that what is the purpose of declaring war on a corporation/alliance if they can disband/evade the war then re-create after it's over. it defeats the purpose of the entire war declaration function in the game.
12/20/2009,war declarations are so hopelessly broken that nothing less than a complete revision of the mechanic will suffice to fix their issues.half measures like this one will just make parts of the problem worse.
12/20/2009,1) this is horribly broken no way in hell are you getting much support2) learn to line break more
12/20/2009,i will never support wall of text. no matter how good it can be.
12/20/2009,"i love this idea. i'd like to see it expanded even further into a true tactical display.in tactical mode, you'd get the velocity vectors, but you'd also have no models load. every ship would be represented by an icon for its type, color according to standing, with the appropriate velocity vector."
12/20/2009,"anything that npc's sell and that can be refined is a potential price ceiling, and insurance provides te floor on the other end.this is inhibiting to the free market spirit of eve and can definitely use some attention."
12/20/2009,so put some time into it and come up with an actual proposal rather than this extremely weak effort.
12/20/2009,this!what items are you claiming are imposing a price cap? what is that cap?
12/20/2009,"ok, as our csm delegates can't be bothered i took 3 minutes in game and did a little research on this. i'm not wealthy enough to look at the really big items, like the actual pos modules so i only looked at a pair of the guns.1. the small beam laser battery costs 450,000 isk on the npc market. it perfectly reprocesses to 3406 isogen. this would cap isogen at 132.12 isk.2. the medium pulse laser battery costs 1,800,000 isk on the npc market. it perfectly reprocesses to 7812 isogen. this would cap isogen at 240.41 isk.3. isogen (in the region i happened to be) topped out at 66.89 isk per unit in the last 365 days. it's currently trading for about 50 isk per unit.i don't think 197.5% of the last year's high price is a comfortable level. the eve economy is just way too crazy for such a close cap. was that so hard? i still can't support this topic and i still think the csm is wasting its time talking about this. a little research and thought would have led to a much more effective proposal. remove the npc market and seed the bpo maybe?"
12/20/2009,not supported fix the game killer issues like grid lag and balance issues first atleast the last would be a statistics tasking imo
12/20/2009,"if you could start by first identifying which ceilings are in place that are actually being capped, then you might have a case. but as it stands, you're asking others to do the work for you.you go and find some caps. crunch the numbers. and then come back to us with actual data about what you're talking about having any change on the market as it stands."
12/20/2009,"thank for the effort.it is possible to log on sisi (the test server) and try all the stuff there, as everything cost 100 isk on the test server.probably ccp could do a database query and check this stuff much more precisely than us. then there is the problem hos you calculate the price ceiling for items using multiple minerals. if this can be done with very few hours of work and a database query i am in favor of the check, so tentatively supported."
12/20/2009,"great strawman bro, a mastercraft is going to be 20ft +. lets see a 12ft powerboat pull 1500 lbs+ out of the water in 5 seconds (against its own wake), or lets start comparing the mastercraft to an 18ft skiff or a tornado and see which is more agile (protip: not the mastercraft)."

12/21/2009,bumping
12/21/2009,makes sense to me; i like it.
12/21/2009,"on the subject of the drone repair thingy...i think the repair function should be automatic, and it should be based on the amount of damage a drone has sustained in a fight. there should also be a command to have drones rtb for repairs, and cycle out accordingly. for example:a fighter is out and is taking heavy armor damage. the carrier pilot sees the damage building, and commands the fighter to come back for repairs. it lands, and immediately undergoes repairs. since it has only taken shield and armor damage, it only needs some repair paste and a quick shield recharge. after a few minutes, it hits the launch tubes and goes back out into the fight.also, it would be kinda interesting if we could have fighter/drone production facilities on supercarriers, similar to pegasus on bsg. supercarriers could, providing they have the necessary resources to do so, produce drones and fighters to replenish ones lost by other pilots. i don't know if this would break the game or anything, but it would enhance endurance of fleets. i'm not a capital pilot yet, so i'll let the cap pilots debate this."
12/21/2009,come on i know there are ore ppl out there that want this...
12/21/2009,"great, will they also make it so you can assign and accept contracts to yourself? right now i need 3 contracts: contract the ship to an alt, have the alt set up the courier, move ship, complete courier, contract ship back from alt to self.also: support for the op :)"
12/21/2009,"not supported.logically, the ship your looking for is a ship carrier varient.eve uses t2 as ultra specialised versions of their t1 counterparts that are a logical progression from the original ship role.t1 freighter = designed to haul large amounts of goodst2 freighter = designed to haul smaller amount of goods at the benifit of much longer rangeif a ship hauler is going to be introduced it should start as a t1 freighter and progress into a t2 varient like jump freighters.a t1 or at least a t2 varient of an existing ship mover makes sense leaving the orca the top candidate for a universal carrier ship that can enter high sec, w-space, low sec and 0.0 alike. thus servicing the entire community of eve. not just the top 2 tiers of class 5 and 6 w-space, low sec and 0.0 which already have the option to use carriers for ship hauling.from my perspective, the best option for a universal ship hauler is a t1 model varient of the orca. change the ore bay to an internal ship bay that can take rigged ships and bump up the size of the bay to accomodate 2 tier 3 battleship worth. the ship maintenance bay should not be used because the idea is to transport the ships to a destination and not turn into a mobile fleet refitting carrier.1) no ship maintenance bay2) no corp hangers3) extremely small cargo capacity. a.k.a 2,000 m3 max4) mass: can enter c3+ w-space5) costs approximately 600 mil ( carrier range )6) no high, medium, low or rig slots.7) no drone bay8) heavy resists and / or buffer tank9) can only deliver the ships to a) ship maintenance array, b) corp hanger, c) station10) ship bay cargo bonus of +2 battleships worth per level = maximum of 10 tier 3 battleshipsship skill:(working name) ferry 1adv. ship command 5transport ships 4skill training requirements:adv. ship command 4transport ships 4this ship meets all the criteria for being a ship hauler that services the entire eve community in its role. if this was to become a t1 version then the t2 version could be jump capable and become a completely alternative set to freighters. by not being racial its easier for ccp to implement by not having to draw up 4 new balanced ships."

12/21/2009,you can control the fov with the ctrl+zoom function. the problem is that the max fov has been reduced. take a look at this image it is taken with the new fov limits. it is a 1280*1024 image superimposed over a 3840*1024 image both taken on a dominion client.note: i have stretched the 1280*1024 image to illustrate the loss of vertical fov but the aspect ratio of both images remains unchanged.
12/21/2009,supportedi would merely suggest tying the payout to be 80% at max payout of the 20 day moving average at the time of payout. this would prevent people from spiking the price for just a day to attempt to manipulate the market. they would need to do it for days on end to shift it up.
12/21/2009,no
12/21/2009,"unsupported. 4 reasons.people in null are already skittish about fights, you really only get a fight if your out numbered cause people are afraid of loosing their ships. take away their fall back and you wont ever get fights.people who want to take away insurance money are people who get suicide ganked in their freighters and ya suicide ganking insurance needs to be fixed.people who want insurance taken away are people that have so much isk they could wipe their a$$ with it and still have some to use blow their load on.no insurance means less isk for people who fight and pvp and loose ships which means more grind and less pvp, which means less fun which means worse eve. nobody wants grind.... unless you came here from wow... in which case go back and stop tainting eve.solution to your filthy proposal based on filthy proof, remove insurance from self destructing you filthy noob don't freakin remove it from the freakin game. thats like saying o the abbadon has too much armor, lets take away 1/3 of its armor and low slots.my personal guess is that you produce ships namely rokhs and abbadons and are mad cause you have to loose 2m profit now cause people are blowing up ur ships.you sir are filthy, rash, and extreme. use common sense, not carebear emo wrath."
12/21/2009,"an irony about this issue is that rl capitalism dictates that ccp needs to keep some level of socialist regulation in the game to ensure players can still play a game they enjoy and hence keep paying their subscription fees.you could look at it as a balance between pvpers who will only put up with so much grind to pay for their ships and industrialists who will often have multiple accounts. an indicator of this balance is shown in the plex market.there's a lot of capitalist chest beating in this thread but sticking dogmatically to any ideology will run you into problems eventually, a truly free market economy is likely to go through periods of boom and bust and you should be asking what affect that would have on subscription rates.no support from me, though there was a very sensible suggestion about replacing rat loot drops with bpcs, thus removing a mineral fountain from the game.edit:the insurance system isn't great and i'd support an overhaul but don't think that the implications of removing the last mineral price floor has been thought through in this thread."

12/21/2009,"signed. i have an idea, but idk how well it will work."
12/21/2009,i agree there are many issues that need to be fixed with faction warfare. there are some things that can be done that are be debating if they are exploit or not. but there are things that are already deemed as a exploit by ccp and are still being used by players. example the login exploit which has been around since the start of faction warfare is still being used. this should be a easy fix but ccp has yet to fix it. if someone is in enemy territory and logs in the navy should announce them as entering system and attack them which they currently do not and never have. i have seen this done numerous times and also have been victim of it as well. i also feel that if a person is in the militia regardless of which side they are on if they enter enemy territory they should be attacked by the faction navy regardless of there standings. i have seen numerous players roam through high sec without the navy attacking them. they are a enemy and should be attacked. they should also not be able to dock at npc stations (belonging to their enemy) within enemy territory specifically high sec stations and those stations should attack them regardless of standings. if someone is in enemy territory and logs in the navy should announce them as entering system and attack them which they currently do not and never have.

12/21/2009,"you may make comparisons with wh space as soon as low sec/0.0 gates randomly change location and to which system they connect, need to be probed out, remove the map/ap and get a mass limit. until you do that it just means the attacker gets easy kills since he knows exactly where the carebears are (which is why it doesnt become anything harder for the attacker), but the pve'ers have basicly no way of knowing where the attacker is (and no it shouldnt be needed to have alts at every gate). so the end result is just that you need to go to high sec lvl 4 missions to make decent income. and the end result for the pve'ers who want to adapt and stay in 0.0? they can be smashing the dir scan button every 10 seconds, that would be about as terrible game design as advanced learning skills or not including dedicated servers for a pc shooter.highly unused blackops? please inform aaa of that, while now without us being able to cynojam every system they probably might start using titan bridges more, i see their blackops often enough used to hotdrop everything that is moving.i fully agree that local shouldnt be an intel source, but a chat channel. however untill there is suitable replacement which does not force you to smash a button every 10 seconds (and some people will actually call that skill) it is just a terrible idea to remove local that only is the complete opposite of the goal of dominion, and barely anyone will profit from it on the long run. (sure in the beginning the gankers get alot of easy kills, they happy, their victims do high sec missions, everyone sad). and while it would be nice when you can for example ambush another fleet since they didnt know you were there, it also promotes blobbing and metagaming, and i think we have enough of both in eve. (easiest way to find out what your opponent has is just asking the spies)."
12/21/2009,"you have no idea what you taking about.it much easier to get a fight without local , fight that is not one side blob.and no lonely hulk or lonely ratter arent suppose to be safe in 0.0 !!"
12/21/2009,"it is also much easier to blob someone since it is trivial to hide 100 people with no local and current mechanics. so you think income in 0.0 is too high and should be nerfed? for 90% of the normal players solo ratting/anomalies/exploration/whatever is how they make their isk, but apparently they should be ratting in groups"
12/21/2009,"1. thus i proposed local actually givin number of pilots in system but not their names,coprorations,favorite food, and names of their dog.2. go back to npc corp if you wanna ""solo"".3. income is broken for 0.0 becuase of lvl4 but its a diffrent story and has nothing to do with local.4. singel ratter/hulk in 0.0 is not suppose to be safe."
12/21/2009,"1) number of neutrals is only sufficient if you shoot every neutral, if you're nrds you have to either know who the neutral is, or expose the entire kos list / maintain a diff-list together with the other entities in your part of the galaxy. sure, it can be done, but for instance cva already reaches the limits of the standings slots, maintaining those standings will be mission impossible for the smaller entities due to lack of manpower.2) ah, you really do want to depopulate 0.0... either that or you're playing a whole other game than furb killer and me are.3) whether or not income in 0.0 should be compared to lvl4 i will leave out, point is, income is always in important factor. the ones who are eager to remove local are the ones wanting to kill ratters and miners (if you're only after pvp fleets, why do those get shot so often?), and the ones who are vehemently against it are the ones who need to not lose a ship every 5 minutes to every random passerby without a realistic (and spamming the directional scanner isn't) means of getting out. if i wanted to grind lvl4 missions i would do so, you're trying to force me to do missions as you'd break 0.0 even more.4) there is a _huge_ difference between ""not safe"" and ""sitting duck"". hulk and ratter already aren't safe, they have to constantly be on the lookout for hostiles to have a moderate chance."
12/21/2009,"supported. the only reason i ever use local is for pvp intel, and to that extent it's overpowered. i can be plexing in a low-sec system for hours without having to watch my back; but suddenly when someone pops up on local, i know to start hitting the d-scan for probes.get rid of it, imo. it's redundant as a comms. channel anyway."
12/21/2009,"actually, scratch that. make it like w-space, but you can talk in local anonymously if you choose. instead of names and avatars, others would see a signature identifier, like you do when probing.for example:531-abc (anonymous): who's out there?gallenteguy'12345: i am. my name is gallenteguy'12345, and you can see my bio by clicking on my name.531-abc (anonymous): thanks for the info."
12/21/2009,"this thread is about boosting piracy some more, because what we need is more ways to empty lo sec and 0.0 quicker.and then we can whine and ask why is everyone in hi sec space."
12/21/2009,"no, and then the next rally-ing call will be to move all level 4s to low-sec, then all level 3s and so forth. pirates these days are lazy.ok, so i have thought about this some more, and there really needs to be a system of acquiring intel thats better than smashing scan every 5 secs, perhaps a probe you launch that constantly checks for pings from other probes.idk, but basically all other things being equal, no party should have an inordinate amount of load placed upon them.that means that someone in system should not have to spam scan every 5 secs to counteract what a pirate does in local... which is launch one probe (system scanner probe), press scan, and find out if something is there.it has to go both ways, not just one."
12/21/2009,"right, because no-one moved from hi-sec in to w-space, which is now completely deserted"
12/21/2009,"something i do a lot of is to divide up the refined loot from an op amongst the participants. what i find tiresome after a long session is the maths, usually resorting to desk calculator to split the stack equally.simplest proposal would be the addition of a very simple divide by calculator to cut the stack in half say. it would have to be within the dialog and only require the typing of the divide by factor. a sighly more comprehensive solution would be to be able to split the stack into the number of piles you specify rather than just dividing it once.would make the looters job much more pelasant i reckon."

12/21/2009,"i like the idea about changing the trajectory of a warp-in to go around planets or moons. even better yet, set it up so that you drop out of warp at a very high speed and have to perform some type of braking maneuver around the planet/moon to allow your ship to slow down enough to dock at a station. i think that would be kinda cool. as far as worrying about gankability, it would be impossible because you would be traveling way too fast for anyone to target you, and every ship, having different masses based on their fitting, would require different speeds and trajectories to accomplish the same thing, therefore eliminating the possibility of engagement once out of warp.the only time this would apply would be when warping to something in low orbit of a celestial body, or when a celestial body is directly in the way."
12/21/2009,"maybe at once we could also solve the warp-through problem with having a ship go around the sayd planet? at lest client-side, we anyway don't have ships stopping in mid-warp"

12/21/2009,"i think it would be a good idea to have skill sets and add-on for crews in the larger ships, example.. you have a raven and it requires crew members to load torps well you could be able to purchase specialized crews or crews could gain experience though combat making them more effective.another idea would be purely ascetic, first person view out of your ship.. including a little bridge image or something. also,what about salvage drops from structures or at least rigs for them, and crews for them as wellgood or bad?"
12/21/2009,i agree that the war dec system needs to be over hauled.
12/21/2009,"interesting proposal however i spot a loophole if i'm understand your proposal correctly.if the wardecced corporations has to pay back the money when a certain number of people leave then they could easily put all money into the ceo's account and drop out a few members, having to pay nothing and being clear of a wardec.my own suggestion to ccp is to make it so that every member who leaves the corporation gets a continuous killright on his head till the time the corporation is wardecced making corp hoping a thing of the past."
12/21/2009,"i like the concept, but not the implementation. i would say limit the kill rights on the exiting members to 7 days or the duration of the wardec, whichever is shorter. it still gives the agressing time to kill the exiting toons, and while it won't completely remove corp hopping, it will make it far less useful.the problem, of course, is this requires ccp to revise the war dec mechanic so that it applies to individual people, rather than just corporations or alliances. though that could be interesting since hiding inside npc corps could be the next thing that goes on the chopping block."
12/21/2009,i cannot support a buff to war-decs when its obviously an easily exploited system to begin with.it is way to easy to war-dec... and even more so too easy to grief with it.honestly... i refuse to support changes that do not solve that problem.

12/21/2009,"though i agree that it's a broken mechanic, as i see it, the war-dec system is not root of this complaint. it's the fact that rational minds will avoid conflict when they see it as a lost cause. players avoiding your war-dec is a natural behavior, and constraining them by an arbitrary system will not change that.no matter how clever you are, no matter the rules that the game has in place, if people don't want to fight you, they won't. they will just find new ways to evade."

12/22/2009,"the blasters need a significant dps boost, to compensate for the laughable range and pathetic effective trackingor they need a significant tracking boost so they really become close-range rulerscurrently they completely fail except in eft where you get pretty numbers (and those are actually on average only 10% higher than other races)the railguns dont do much better either, i dont fly snipers so im not talking about pvp here, but railguns are realy bad for pve where the combat is at medium ranges... noone needs the max possible 200km range in pve, and in 30-70 km railguns fail... tracking anything at less than 30km is almost impossible (ok) and the dmg at 70km is just bad (not ok). add to that the galente-stopping sleeper ai said to be implemented soon(tm) into missions and the galente wil fail at ... well everything (thank god for hospital domi)"
12/22/2009,"/signedblasters may seem great but they can't compete with any other weapon; lasers ( better range and dps), missiles ( range and tracking with precision ammo), projectiles have good tracking and nice dps along with decent range.also, since blasters don't have range it sucks to have to fit them on a pve bc/hac/cs or t3 proteus. railguns have laughable dps and blasters have pathetic range... drones are okay but with new npc ai they are getting constantly attacked in anomalies.give us some sort of solution, since atm most pilots are flying gallente ships with completely different fits - shield tanked myrmidon, minmatar projectile turrets.. the only thing that remained are drones, for now."

12/22/2009,"thrasher is amazing, leave it alone. catalyst could use some extra cpu and something other than the falloff bonus, cormorant could use a bit extra pg or a new low slot. coercer could use a med but its pretty good as it is too. these are alpha ships tho, 25% rof penalty is fine."
12/22/2009,"ok, lets all take a step back and look at the problem itself  repackaging a rigged ship. there is no need to make an entire new class of ship to fix this. ccp wont devote the isk (literally) and manpower for a convenience issue. it would just cost them too much and only fixes a niche market problem.i think a better solution would be allow rigged ships to be repackaged. problem solved and there is no addition of a super high sec carrier that needs bpos, manufacturing, balancing, re-balancing, skill books, training, etc.i do agree that something should be done. but an entire empire super carrier with 20km3 of cargo is a little over the top. (not trying to troll here, just a different perspective in it)"
12/22/2009,"i agree with the above poster. the effect that a ship like this would have on markets is also immense. and to be honest, 20 fully fitted battleships is simply too high. as it stands, a proper mid-sized freighter (not the orca, but more like a jf (a little larger) with jf like agility is still lacking in the industrial department."
12/22/2009,"if you repackage a rigged dominix, then what is it? a dominix? to be sold on the market etc?as far as i understood the database structure from a previous bpo/bpc-thread a repackaged item has _zero_ attributes other than owner and location, once you unpack it the item gets the additional properties assigned (damage, me, pe, max runs, rigs, etc) in a separate table (this is also why it is impossible to show bpo/bpc in the assets list).so i'm not entirely sure what would be the easy fix: a new ship or a complete database overhaul."

12/22/2009,"very, very, very usefull in wormholes"
12/22/2009,"problem summary: inactive (unpaid) accounts continue to accumulate agent rewards, i.e. datacores. this had a similar issue (ghost training) which was resolved a few years back.problem impact: done on a large scale, a person could have numerous accounts loaded with 3 characters each that produce datacores to the tune of 350+ million per month in passive income. in itself this is not a problem; the problem is that the person could stop paying for the account and still continue to receive the passive income. typically, these accounts are dormant for around 6 months to a year, at which time the owner re-activates them and cashes in the datacores. earning billions of isk for the cost of a single gtc.this drastically deflates the cost of datacores for those of us that produce them on paid (active) accounts, and make a living through invention, production, or t2 industry. furthermore, ccp loses out on revenue by allowing this to continue. the solution: freeze agent rewards for inactive accounts in the same way skill training is frozen."

12/22/2009,"this isn't just about what to fix about faction warfare, it's about when. not soon(tm), not three years from now.i was watching the fanfest videos a day or so ago, and in watching the one talking about dominion (although it's already out) i heard something interesting: the reason that ccp decided to roll with the sovereignty overhaul was because the coming of dust 514 and the interaction with eve made it necessary.granted, not even ccp knows how or if dust will affect faction war yet - but let's presume that there's a high likelihood they will. so my argument is that the same principle ought to apply to fw as did to 0.0 sovereignty.apocrypha 1.1 brought in some changes that were an attempt to address some of the issues but also brought in unintended consequences that have been considered detrimental to the fw environment. but perhaps the biggest problem in my mind is the timing: the patch should have been done for empyrian age 1.x, not apocrypha almost a year later. even if they were smaller, incremental changes, they would have combated the nagging worry that ccp had ""abandoned fw"" that existed before the patch. and because the shape of the battlefield can change in a week or a day, ccp needs to be watching fw closely and be responsive to changes. it took at least a couple weeks before the storyline team noticed intaki had fallen to the caldari and longer for them to move ahead with the storyline appropriately.tldr:- be more attentive to the state of fw and make sure the players know it's getting attention.- push more numerous, more frequent and if need be smaller incremental updates to handle issues that can be handled in this manner. prioritize items players consider to be exploit-y and push those out in the current patch cycle (dominion 1.x).- commit to the release of a larger fw overhaul before the dust 514 release, preferably within a year.the priorities (in my opinion) for said overhaul are these. (however, you don't have to agree with them to vote up the proposal.)- a complete revamp of the plexing mechanic so that it is more fun, interactive and can't be gamed by single speed tank interceptors and the like.- the addition of gameplay consequences for captured systems.- pvp kills have a reward and affect the outcome of system occupancy.the specifics are best left to other proposals of course.(disclaimer: i'm back on a 5 day promotion pass, too poor to subscribe, so i may not be around to update this much. i've jumped back to fw for the duration and it was good to see the current action, but it doesn't change my evaluation of the flaws.)"
12/22/2009,"wholeheartedly agree, communication is key if any kind of satisfaction is to be felt by customers/players.approaching two years and the only changes made so far have been ccp fixing bugs/flaws that they themselves created by accident .. fw is in serious need of work.i posted my vision of how i would like fw to be keeping in mind the current bottlenecks, flaws and loop holes. while of the points can be used separately it is thought out as a package-deal.doesn't take much to make combat intense, cheap, fun and educational .. let the sun rise once more please, the darkness consumes us!"

12/22/2009,i think the insurance system as is should be removed and replaced with a player driven system.
12/22/2009,"hello csm, and fellow eve players.*updated op*another solution would be a 'global' training cue. being able to add, modify and delete skills from the global cue, enabling you to be more flexible, instead of logging out and in. and better utilizing your account's alts."
12/22/2009,"on the one hand, as a single account player, i would like to have this.on the other hand, i realize this would cut into ccp's bottom line. marketing even endorses the use of multi-account alts with the recurring ""power of 2"" promotion.so, not voting up because i think it has a snowball's chance in hell. however, if some mechanic could be introduced to make multiple accounts still attractive, this might gain more traction. top of my head ideas include training alt characters at half speed or some purchasable token that enables single-account alt training."
12/22/2009,"(1) low-sp alts are still highly useful(2) if you need sp on an alt, you can train them at any time you wish.(3) i support the idea of the skillqueue being for the account, not for the character, to make training across alts easier, but absolutely not multiple alts training simultaneously."
12/22/2009,"only way i could see this being agreed to would be if the training time was split between the various characters.for exampletrain 1 character - normal timetrain 2 characters at once - double time for bothtrain 3 characters at once - triple time for all 3if your proposal is for all the characters to be able to train at the same time at the normal speed, then i seriously doubt you're going to get much support. much as i, as a single account player, would love this, it'd unbalance the game as it currently stands too much to support.-----or, you could just train your main to be able to do the alt tasks you want to be able to perform? it doesn't take that long to train a combat pilot to be able to fly a hauler when he needs to, for example."
12/22/2009,wow is that way not supporting.
12/22/2009,"you're wrong drake. everyone knows that's the way to hello kitty online. wow is the other way.also, not supporting. one of the things that sets eve apart from all the other mmo's is the training system. don't you dare break it."
12/22/2009,"i disagree with this in every way, being able to train two profiles/toons at once will not cut into or make two account less attractive. look at most people that run two accounts, they use them both at the same time to either have more help in pvp or be able to pull in more while mining. or do both at the same time ""pvp and mine"". also for the people who don't have a tone of money or time to play and pay for it plex. it makes the game much less attractive cuz you are really stuck doing one thing cuz it takes to long to train multiple professions on one toon. i know many people in our gaming guild that tried eve and liked it, but because you pay so much just for training one toon in one direction they left for mmo's that gave them options to train multiple professions/classes on one account which makes the game more fun rather than being stuck doing one thing. i really think the council should really weigh this matter again and think how many more people my stay playing if you gave them more options in toon direction from the start. i also don't want to hear you can change direction at any time, i know you can but it will take you years of training to be able to do two professions well on one toon and you know it."
12/22/2009,*grumbles* dyslexia sucks.and to further de's point... the biggest problem we have right now is people pushing for faster training and the rampant rmt going on with char's.while i don't mind the fact i could train more than one alt without having the temptation for paying for additional accounts... i don't see this as a desperate need... nor a rational one.
12/22/2009,"how would it unbalance the game? using multiple accounts does. because you can be online at the same time. having dual characters on one account means you can only use one at a time. the only thing it would significantly change is the fact that ccp receives less income from alt-accounts. but only marginal. because dedicated alt users will prefer using a second 'main'.another solution would be a 'global' training cue. being able to add (in that particular toon), modify (in any toon) and delete (in any toon) skill from the cue, enabling you to be more flexible, instead of logging out and in.give me a good argument against my first proposition other than money wise."
12/22/2009,*lol*not supported!:)
12/22/2009,"that's another thing for so long people have been complaining about rmt / people selling toons. lets just fix that problem by removing it and letting people train more than one toon at a time. the whole reason why that even came about was because people could not train more than one toon at a time, so people started to buy them. its a sick cycle and it needs to end.how can people say that eve is so different and take such pride in it when it comes to training and such when you can just buy everything even toons. stop limiting people and give them options and you will find these work arounds like buying toons will be less of an issue. i'm sorry for being kinda a jerk with the way i'm wording this but just rather sick of the entire thing and wish people would stop supporting the very thing that people exploit such as toon trading. i've met people on here that have 5+ accounts and sell 3 toons every 3 to 4 months for billions of isk which allows them to make isk and pay for all their accounts in isk/plex and ccp supports this rather than let people train more than one toon, epic fail in my opinion.i find it lol when people yell about afk miners that ccp don't support but toon miners as i like to call it, yields a much higher profit and ccp does support it."
12/22/2009,"i support the discussion, but not the original idea.i would love to have the ability to start training on character a, then at a later date start training on character b without having to log off, log in as character a, pause training, then log off, log in as character b, and finally start training on character b.a perfect solution would be to allow skills for multiple characters to be queued up from the training queue interface. a near-perfect solution would be to have training automatically start on the next-longest training queue any time one training queue is finished."
12/22/2009,"i could back this idea - managing all three characters training from one queue, but as mara says, not multiple characters training at one time on one account."
12/22/2009,"i agree to both the original proposal and ^^^^^. think of it as mind shock. there should be some risk involved. brain thermodynamics if you will. the body in the end has limits. if you push those limits via greed or boredom there should be some risk involved. love the idea, but it would need a nerf out of the gate."

12/22/2009,"while i'd very much enjoy the reduced time, i think jump clones are a powerful utility to begin with; simply having the ability to jump makes a massive difference in gameplay.i think the 24 hour timer is sensible, as it restricts abuse of the system but isn't overbearing. it does force the player to choose wisely and plan ahead--and it can definitely be a frustration. but, i don't think dropping it by an hour here or there will make that big of a difference in the mechanic. the order of magnitude (i.e. one day vs. half a day vs. six hours) is such that someone is still going to miss action somewhere because they jumped the night before. they'll feel slighted because they can't jump back, and then we're back here arguing whether it should be reduced to 12 hours.by planning ahead, i've been able to minimize the frustrations of the wait time, so i'm going to withhold support for now. good idea in concept; i just don't think it's necessary."
12/22/2009,"jumping twice in 48 hours just means you'll have a 1000 strong fleet of goons on your door, then when they're done beating you up for three hours, they'll be on someone else's door across the other side of the galaxy.extend the jump clone timer to 40 hours."

12/22/2009,"supported. because it is not in our best interests to not bring as many pilots as possible to a fight, such battles will only ever get bigger. these issues of grids not loading after an hour of sitting there will become more and more common and paying customers will leave.one question i have though: can predictive grid loading be implement so that the moment you initiate warp the destination grid starts to load? the server knows the destination grid because it has to calculate the flight ending point, it knows if bubbles are present, etc. it should follow, then, that it should know the location, type, vector, standings, etc of all entities on that grid and be able to updated the client en-route. it's a bit more difficult when dealing with jump bridges, gates and titan portals but that could still be overcome by loading the destination grid once you arrive on the starting grid. so if you were in u-l4ks at, say, the gate from d-i9hj and you warped to the k25-xd gate. the instant you initiate warp, the server starts feeding you destination grid information. upon arriving on the grid with the gate to k25-xd, it starts loading the gate grid in k25-xd at the u-l4ks gate because you may make the jump. if you then warp off to a different location, the client dumps the now unnecessary data.yes, this would increase cpu and memory load on the client (and the server too)and could translate into a diminished but not catastrophic playability from time to time because you could have 2 different grids loaded into memory at a time. that said, if it allows for a smoother transition and eliminates this ****poor performance we've been seeing, i'm all for it."
12/22/2009,"hell, i'll throw in my support because i love the ""why iz evry1 in h1ghsec!?1!1"" threads .let's keep asking for stupid mechanics that make it even more difficult for anyone other than pirates in low/0.0 sec without replacing it by something that could even remotely even the playing field.there ya go, i support this thread. let's make it happen!"
12/22/2009,"supported, eve is supposed to be harsh, there is nothing harsh about seeing every potential threat and knowing tones about him."
12/22/2009,"a extra 2 cents...if you own the space and have sov, + beacon + a security upgrade.you get a warning of a neutral or enemy entrying your space in local. sen you paying the gate fees.so if someone red to your alliance entrys. then a red icon comes up in local window. no name ect... just the red icon, make a neutral grey, friendly goes blue. so no count of number of people, no name list just the icon if you got the upgrades."
12/22/2009,"supported, but i think it should be kept in lowsec and it should be available as a strategic upgrade for sov holders in nullsec"
12/22/2009,"i'm a bit of a nub, so this might not work...but.it seems to me that most agree local makes no sense at all, and is not the ideal way to handle intelligence gathering. one of the primary issues in wormhole space however is that you can get extremely good intel if you mindlessly spam the directional scanner which is boring, bad for the servers... and honestly equally stupidthe second most pressing issue imo is that the attacker has an unfair advantage without local as he knows when to start spamming the directional scanner, and the defender must do it constantly.i propose the following:1.) kill local, i'd prefer it not even give you a pilot count.2.) put a cooldown on the directional scanner, somewhere between 10seconds, and a minute.. i'd prefer a minute.3.) (and this is the important one) if your ship is identified by the directional scanner your warned that you've just been scanned. it's an active scan and as such ought be detectable. this adds a cost to the directional scanner, if you find someone.. they'll know."
12/22/2009,"perhaps a compromise would be to add a drop down box when you ask for a mission which allows you to choose which system the mission will be in? to balance it, however, if you choose a specific system then you cannot refuse that mission that is offered without a standings penalty (i.e. you don't get the standard ""free"" refusal once every 4 hours when using this option).also, not sure if the standings penalty is still in place if you fail a mission by running out of time. if it is, then that part should be removed (while keeping the penalty if you deliberately quit)"
12/22/2009,"yes! and, before you guys come in about server lag - the computations for this feature could exist solely on the client side.if all you are doing is reallocating assets, using the information that you already see and would do manually, even if someone hacked the client to change the automatic allocation, so what? it's only your assets that got restacked a little."

12/22/2009,"indeed, this makes all sorts of sense.you should have a couple of options when you shift-drag... default is just quantity but there should be a button that changes the quantity field to a stacks field. you input the number of stacks and, voila, it's equally divided into that number of equal stacks.having a second option 'separate x%' would be handy but i don't think would be as intuative. so you're wanting to give your hauler a 30% cut and everyone else 12% you'd divide the stack twice."

12/22/2009,"currently, the war-dec mechanic in eve is very simplistic. someone wants to declare war on a corporation, they declare war, and the fighting starts until they decide it should stop. people try to avoid war-decs by corp-hopping. people use neutral alts to aid them in fights, capitalizing on flawed aggression mechanics. war-decs as they currently stand are a one-size-fit all attempt at enforcing pvp, which lacks the subtly or options to make it a truly useful option. i would propose a number of refinements and/or improvements for the war-dec mechanic, to give it a complexity of goals, purposes, and tactics.political refinements:first, political entities in eve range from the player to the corporation to the alliance, from smallest to largest. any of these entities should be targetable in a war. participation in the war does not automatically confer to any higher political organizations in which you are a member. allowing for war-decs against individual players allows for spies or corp thieves to be punished, and add further flexibility to escalating wars (more to follow). it also allows for pilots to be targeted during a war and expand the war to effect them. one example would be neutral rr alts. these pilots can now be war-decced individually, no matter if they are in another corp or an npc corp, making them actually have to participate in the war instead of exploiting neutral rr mechanics. this system would also allow for corps to prosecute their own war-decs separately from the entire alliance, if needed. for example, if pilot joe steals from my corp, i can dec him, his alts, and his mother if i so choose, but my alliance does not necessarily have to join in the war.additionally, this mechanism allows for a way to handle corp-hopping. if corp a and b are at war, and pilot z leaves one of the corps, the game automatically generates an individual war-dec against that pilot for the remainder of that pay period for the war, whether it be 6 days left, or just 6 hours. this works no matter which side the leaving pilot is on, aggressor or defender. the same mechanic also handles corps leaving alliances during a war. at the end of the pay period, the opponent has the option of paying for the war to continue against that entity, at normal price, or not pay and finally let the pilot/corp withdraw from the war while you continue to pursue the individual target. or, you could stop the original war-dec, and continue to pursue those that deserted. it gives you options in how to handle the war.the declaring entity should be able to chose exactly who they want to declare war on, regardless of the target's political affiliations. a corporation could chose to declare war on individual x, without declaring war on that player's corporation, or its alliance. however, once the war is declared, the target side has the opportunity to use political means to expand the war. when a player is declared, his corporation is given the option to assume the war on his behalf. the corp may decide to back up their member, or let him face the consequences of his actions by himself. once a corporation is declared, its alliance has the opportunity to assume that war. however, they can also choose not to assume the war. if the target's side chooses to escalate the war, the declaring side is also given the option to escalate to a higher political level. a war can start as a corp vs player grudge match, which escalates to player corp vs corp, corp vs alliance, or alliance vs alliance, leading thousands of individuals into battle. it also could remain as a corp vs player battle, with players seeking each other out and doing battle regardless of other events and political maneuverings. the players themselves and their political connections to their corporation and alliance determine the shape and scope of the war.edit- 2 more sections to follow. this 5 minute timer isn't fun"
12/22/2009,"mercenary and allied entity refinementsmercenary entities also have the opportunity to participate in the war. players, corporations, or alliances that choose to follow the mercenary are available to be hired (via contract, or the future treaty system) to participate in any existing war-dec. for example, corp a decides to declare war on corp b, a small industrial corp. corp b uses its economic power to hire a merc corp of 50 pvp pilots. once the terms of the contract are negotiated, the merc corp is automatically enrolled (with 24 hour warning) into the existing war dec as opposed to corp a. the merc corp does not have to file their own war declaration. once the original declaration between corps a and b expires, the merc corp is automatically removed from a state of war. small corps could choose to be mercenaries, hiring themselves out as actors in small wars, or it could be a medium sized corp, or a 1000 person alliance of various corps. all sized political entities are capable of participating. this also allows corps to enlist corps friendly to their cause in war, allowing the battlefield to expand in scope and more realistically model the political aspects of eve gameplay, while avoiding the escalating cost for utilizing those polticial alliances. a corp could declare war on their local miners, only to discover that the miners have a significant bankroll to hire mercenaries, or are friendly with an experienced pvp corp that chooses to enter the war on their behalf. target selection and intelligence will begin to play a much bigger role.economic refinementsas it currently stands, economic power has very little direct application to the war dec mechanic. i would propose that economic warfare become a valid possibility, with significantly steep prices. there are several possible solutions.1- deny free docking rights. this would make it possible to bribe npc corps to deny docking rights to your opponent during a war. this is done on a per-station, not per-corp or per-faction basis, with a rising fee per station bribed during that war. (hqs and offices are exempt). the fee is based upon the amount of npc stations bribed, along with the target's standings toward that corp (player, corp, or alliance, depending on type and size of war). the fee sharply escalates with each additional station, making area denial for 2-3 stations possible, but cost-prohibitive beyond small areas. this allows mining corps to effectively deny docking in a pocket of systems, if they are willing to pay the price to bribe all of the station owners in the vicinity. this mechanic is subject to a 24 hour warning period before docking rights are withdrawn, and for counter-bribes (more to follow) to take place. 2- deny station services. this would allow corps to bribe npc corps to deny station services such as repair or medical clones to their opponents. the bribery mechanic, waiting period, and counter bribing is similar to the previous proposal.3 - counter bribing. of course, the possibility does exist for it to turn into a bribery war back and forth between sides, to either remove or regain docking or trading rights, restore station services, or bribe tax collectors. however, it is a blind war, where you have to put up a bid and hope it is enough to outbid your opponent. if you have enough isk, you win. if not, you lose the isk and have to try again. a successful bribe reverses the action, and starts a new 24 hour timer for your opponent to counterbribe. the timer gives both sides enough time to avoid explotation, and escalate the economic battlefield as needed.----1 more section to follow"
12/22/2009,"needless to say, this mechanic needs to have a strong scaling factor, to make it more of a tactical tool. each additional denied station dock/service will severely escalate the price, and npc standings, both of the bribing and the target corp need to come into play. the price should make it almost impossible to bribe more than a handful of npc stations in a given war, but it allows corps to strategically select npc stations to deny specific key stations according to the geography of their area.fee changeswar decs are amazingly cheap right now, but scale to ridiculous levels after a few war declarations. i would propose a system in which war-dec fees are based upon the respective sizes of the two entities. a ratio is done of (larger entity/smaller), and that is used as a basis for a cost multiplier. this would keep wars between similar sized, and hopefully similar strength entities. you still have the option to take your 200 person corp against that 5 person corp, but you now pay for the privilege. i'd also like to see the scaling costs for additional war-decs lowered somewhat, so that each additional war-dec does scale, it does not do so at near the current rate. while scaling costs do have their strengths, the current multiplier is too high. using the size comparison, along with a smaller multiplier would be a better approach. if wars are made to be more meaningful, and with a range of player options and types of warfare, a corp shouldn't need to have multiple wars going at once to have a full pvp experience, but the possibility should exist if corps wish to try it. i would expect the base costs (before size comparison factors and additional wardec factors) to be roughly 10m for a pilot, 20m for a corp, and 50m for an alliance. additional war-dec escalating fees would be based on the type of wardec, so a corp could have 1 dec vs a pilot, 1 vs a corp, and 1 vs an alliance without any additional dec fees. however, 3 decs vs pilots would involve those fees.this system would allow for a corp of 200 to dec an individual pilot, but at a substantial cost. it is up to the corp to decide if the declaration is worth the weekly price, or maybe the insult wasn't severe enough to justify the dec. the size comparison, combined with some sort of escalating fee per type of wardec (pilot, corp, or alliance) will also help prevent wide-spread grief-play, as most corps could not maintain the price to dec more than a few of each category at once."
12/22/2009,"yes to political/scaling refinementsno to economic ones. why? becuase you are giving griefers a whole load of new toys with that. if it delays docking. sure, but denying will just be abused."
12/22/2009,"not to demean all the work you put into this, but wouldn't it be simpler to just remove concord? i mean, if everyone down to their last drone should be viable war dec targets, then why even bother to have police?"
12/22/2009,in recent events i had found that both of my eve accounts had been keylogged and that both of my long time eve characters ( rexxar civire and elthana ) were transferred off my accounts with assests in excess of 50 billion isk.after working with ccp i finally regained access to my accounts only to find out that my characters were missing. this happened recently after taking a break from the game around december of last year. i have been trying to work this situation out for some time now.i then re-petitioned in game to get my characters back as i am sure something must be able to help in a situation such as mine. countless hours of time invested and irl cash in both gtc's and subscriptions.as of yet nothing has been done and i still persist in my petition for help.i am posting here to share my situation with my fellow pilots in showing that something needs to be done to make transferring characters more secure. eve online isnt like many other games and a lot of customers have much more invested in this game which surely warrants an increased security of thier assets.i can only hope that ccp will eventually help me as i am a victim of a crime and a very long time customer.rexxar civire/elthana

12/22/2009,"this. if it doesn't fill a vacant role in the game, your new items will either:a) never be used because an existing item does the task better, orb) replace an existing item because it performs better.what you're failing to take into account in your ""moar is gooder"" speech is that gamers are, at heart, min/maxers. we want the best performance for a given task at the least amount of cost.there are some niches that probably need to be filled - a specialist gas mining ship comes to mind. there's probably room for a dedicated combat scanning ship with bonuses specific to combat scan probes(though i argue that's what the covert ops frigates should have been in the first place).but tossing in, say, another type of missile launcher, doesn't really make much sense, since we already have long range - low damage and short range - high damamge varities. even if you came up with one that tweaked the stats a little, you'd end up bumping out one of the other existing types.it's like having a bowl of fruit and then replacing all the apples with pears. you don't end up with more variety, just a different selection."
12/22/2009,"i can throw cruise missiles over 200km. without special launcher rigs, i can only throw torpedoes about 20km. there is room for medium range weapons which give me eg: 80km range on the same ship, with a damage potential somewhere between a cruise missile and a torpedo.simply for mission-running, i'd much prefer a medium range missile system over the existing choices. i'd even trade some damage for missile velocity, since in the present system my cruise missiles don't make it to the target before my friends have blown the target up.it gets worse for capital ship fights, where for a long time the phoenix didn't have a long range weapon system. now it has a long range weapon system with a flight duration that is measured in multiples of target life expectancy.some pilots would be happy to sacrifice on-paper dps simply for the sake of appearing on the killmail with a damage score higher than the triage carrier.to use your bowl of fruit analogy - i'd like to add oranges to the collection of apples and pears."

12/22/2009,"i have long thought that instead of a rather trivial fee, that the war deccing party should have to put up a fairly substantial bond of some sort, which would be forfeited if they ""surrender"" ie: fail to renew.likewise, someone creating a corp should have to put up a similar bond - refundable on dissolution - to concord against being wardecced which they would forfeit on surrender.so dec'd corps would have a real incentive to fight, corp churning to evade wardecs would rapidly become expensive, and corps who make their living by extortion would be taking some real risk if they bit of more than they can chew.basically, a war should be for higher stakes than just pure ""lulz"".of course this is in the context of the whole of hi-sec pvp needing a thorough rework. the bounty system is in even worse shape than wardecs, and i believe that the whole suicide gank <-> piracy <-> killrights <-> bounty <-> wardec spectrum needs to be looked at and unified in to a single spectrum of ""legal"" hi-sec combat options.eve needs to change empire pvp from ""arbitrary and undocumented complexity"" to ""coherent and transparently complex"".in fact thinking about it, this could easily merit it's own expansion."
12/22/2009,wardecced personnel should be unable to leave their wardecced corp.period.
12/22/2009,"i think in the example of corps a and b, using the war dec mechanic defeats the entire purpose of having high sec at all. if we're going to have space where-in the magic police respond to unprovoked hostile activity, then it's silly to have a mechanic by which players can circumvent it. if corp a wants to defend a mining system, then they can go pick one in null sec where it's actually worth defending in the first place. and even if they do manage to drive off corp b from system 1, corps c, d, e, and f are still free to come in and mine away at their leisure. seems like they're going to have a hard time claiming ownership when they have to go through a mechanic like the war dec system to defend their turf--which isn't really their turf anyway, because the sovereignty indicator probably says it belongs to the amarr.as for catching ""war targets"" from null sec conflicts--if they want to mutually declare war, then it makes sense. otherwise, if someone is hiding themselves up in high sec, then aren't they out of the conflict by virtue of the fact that they're not in 0.0? that brings up the question: why is there a need to catch null sec opposition in high sec?raise the cost, add deposits on both sides, keep people from leaving corp--whatever. i don't think a non-mutual war dec system can exist without being abused. as it is, war decs are essentially just bribes to make concord look the other way."
12/22/2009,was that part actually under debate?
12/22/2009,i suppose not i just kind of got going and didn't stop--pardon the text blob. in retrospect i should've preceded that last part with /opine and post-scripted it with /endrant.
12/22/2009,"only if the wardeccing alliance has the same constraints.but this system would be ripe for abuse - infiltrate an enemy corp, declare war on them with your puppet corp, suddenly you have perfect intel on a prey who cannot get out of a fight they dont' want to be in. even if they realise you're a spy they can't kick you out!"
12/22/2009,"had this idea earlyer, blac opps ships suck right now and are not worth the isk you spend on them. so my idea give blac opps another trick that makes them usefull. a modual that work along the line of a command modual everyone in the gang affected by the booster mechanic will not show up in local unless they chat similar to the way it works in w-holes. this would make black opps a extreamly useful ship in both high and low sec and make its billion isk price tag a little more worth it."

12/22/2009,"picking a name in eve can be hard already with the hundreds of thousands of taken names. to eliminate these names from availability to dust players will suck for them.instead of blocking all names ccp should make a feature in eve where an eve player can reserve his name against use in 514. thus ""famous"" players in eve can reserve their name but others who don't care wont.i think this reservation should be available for free to all players through account management. this service should also be available to 514 players who create original names.not supported as op proposes."
12/22/2009,i wonder if anyone has considered whiteout.
12/22/2009,"you could reverse it in a fashion. this comes from a ""practical"" bug standpoint. bugs crop up and cause problems for folks at times... this suggestion of yours is decent (thus my support for it) but a bug... someone could get locked out of a station -- until a gm responds (which has been known to take days with some issues)instead of locking them out, you'd lock them in for the duration of the aggression timer -- up to 15 solid minutes locked inside or locked from a gates use. they cannot undock or use that gate again until the timer expires.so if they want to run, you have to hunt them in a gate situation. at a base, you have up to 15 minutes until they can undock to do anything you feel like in that system -- including flying off to another system to get repairs because they *cannot* leave that station (extended ship undock timer).the information would be stored at the station/gate. dock with an aggression timer -- that's recorded at the station. undock and redock before that first timer is expired -- with a refreshed timer -- and you are stuck there until that timer is completely gone. you know how long they'll be stuck because it'll be 1 minute shorter than your timer...imo, from a ""something bugged out"" perspective... it'd be better to be locked in a station than locked out of one. you can do things in a station but what happens if you cannot get back into a station to get another ship, get parts, etc? once you undock, you're stuck in space... the reverse and you'd be stuck in the station -- not good but at least you can access jump clones, buy stuff, sell stuff, fiddly fart around with your ships, etc... vs being stuck in space -- potentially in a pod."
12/22/2009,"+1, pure common sense solution to docking games and easy to code too."
12/22/2009,"how about giving black ops a trick mod. it would work along the lines of comand links everyone who is affected by the booster dosent show up in local, or even limitit to ships equiped with a cov opps cloak. it would make a black opps battleship worth the billion isk it costs. i will post that idea and see ift flys."
12/22/2009,"double posted, oops"

12/22/2009,"i am all for anything that improves the combat ui this sounds great!i also want the tactical overlay to instead of display vertical lines only to display curved lines that are part of a circle to indicate actual distance, but thats another issue.[edit] forgot thumbs up"
12/22/2009,"while a good idea in theory, unsupported.think about a large battleship, just constantly jetting and scooping more sets of heavy drones, or (*drools*) an ishkur constantly popping sets of lights, it could carry 6 more full sets of light drones!in pve, losing drones is an annoyance and generally due to not paying attention to your spawns. in pvp, it's a strategic move by your enemy."
12/22/2009,"*cough* drones *coughfake edit: and since i saw how the sentry drones vote went yesterday, you could just add the above to the whole ""complete drone review"" as opposed to voting on it at the next meeting....but i'd rather this be discussed in particular ;)"
12/22/2009,"wait... there wasn't a ccp rep? are we going to get any answers from them about their take on the issues? i know in the past, even if an issue has passed a csm vote, it's not necessarily implemented by ccp."
12/22/2009,"another possible solution for this ""problem"" would be to have ccp leave bridging range as it is, but to instead add 2000m option to the ""keep at range"" range drop down menu. the ""keep at range"" command is pretty good about slowing down a ship soon enough so it actually doesnt bump an object, unless your mwd is on.i prefer the 5km range, i just offer this idea up, if ccp says that to change the bridges range is too difficult. my suggestion might be a ""fix"" that is easier for them to implement."
12/22/2009,"thank you tea.i have a question about methodology: how come a vote with 7/2 passes, while another with 7/2 or even 8/1 fails?"
12/22/2009,"when a vote passes, it is shown for/against (people against)when a vote fails, it is shown against/for (people for)i did this to show the important information first (actual result and count of support for that result) then the people with the opposing view next that count - i.e failed 7/2 (person 1, person 2).if it is too confusing i can change it for the next meeting - failed 2/7 (person 1, person 2) - but to me this looks odd (having two names next to a seven).i don't want to put all the names on each vote because it will make it more cluttered. remember this is supposed to be a tl:dr and the full minutes are available if there are any questions of who voted for what.trust me that if it says passed or failed that was the actual result of the vote ."
12/22/2009,i mentioned this (as shown in the minutes) but was told that with 150+ people round a titan keep at range causes issues anyway.i've only titan bridged a handful of times but have seen bumping caused by people warping to 0 when told repeatedly to warp to 10 then hit keep at range (having been told to set the default to 2000). the 5km activation range change isn't going to help there (though swearing on vent might )
12/23/2009,"*flog, flog flog flog flog*"
12/23/2009,"i think the complete shiphull is wrong. drones are not the right type for the job. swapping the sin hull for a megathron would be better. the black op bonus should be a turret falloff bonus so its inline with the other black ops.gallente battleship skill bonus: 5% bonus to large hybrid turret damage and 10% bonus to drone hit points and damage per skill levelblack ops skill bonus: 10% bonus to large hybrid turret falloff per level and multiplies the cloaked velocity by 125% per levelthe black op bonus gives the pilot the option for more range and reduced damage or more damage and shorter range. however this all should be balanced out. i totaly agree on these things:-improved jumprange-reduced mass-recon resists-covert cynos in highsec-lower bridging costs-panther and sin lovin'jumprange needs some serious love. mass reduction makes them usable in wormholes. black ops are kinda recons so recon resists are welcome. i would limit the covert op cyno to stealth bombers, black ops and recons or ships with cov op module. trading can be affected by allowing blockade runners to use covert op cyno's. the costs for bridging are way to high. in a 1000m3 sin fuel bay go's 6666 oxygen isotopes. how about changing the use of fuel. the covert jump portal generator will only use fuel when u put the bridge up. lets say it uses 1000 oxygen isotopes for each activation. that should be enough to solve the fule issue"
12/23/2009,"the database issue would be a very simple fix. simply add a link to the rig table so that when it gets re-assembled the rigs will be auto installed. the item itself doesn't need attributes. (based on speculation and knowledge from an sql class in college )edit:remove the ""sell on market"" flag so it must be contracted if the rigs are in the ship. market problem solved."
12/23/2009,"basically you're suggesting 'fixes' that would have the server iterate over every single asset to see if it is a ship, and whether it has rigs if it is. if it were this simple we would already be able to distinguish bpos from bpcs.the assets list/item table way used way too often to 'just' slap on extra stuff, at least that what i gathered from previous discussions."
12/23/2009,ever considered to be happy with the option of just putting your rigged ships into a courier contract? works very well for me.
12/23/2009,"ever considered there, maybe, possibly, just might be ways to improve stuff? if 'be happy with what you have' was a valid argument, there would be no need for the assembly hall / idea's and features.also, ever consideren everyone already does this (even though you first have to give your stuff to an alt as you can't courier for yourself), as there simply is no other way. we are however, looking for means to move more than just 1 battleship at a time, as you're better off flying it yourself in that case (more agile, better tank, can shoot back if needed...)"
12/23/2009,"i'd be happy with just being able to fit a hulk and a battlecruiser in an orca's ship bay at the same time. or at least 1 battleship on its own. alter tableadd isbpcflag bit nullgo? just kidding...i dont think we need another ship for this, they already exist in carriers/orca.just need them to get a little more space. orca cant hold a hulk & an industrial at the same time, which seems weird considering its role. (nor a single battleship)carrier needs to be able to hold a little more.my real suggestion would probly be someting in the realm of specialised modular bays, similar to rigs or tech 3 stuff, allowing you have to make a choice of what u want to fit your ship with, but it takes away from other areas, (drops the cargo space for more ship maintenace space) or 20% more ore space for -10% cargo ect and its gonna cost u."
12/23/2009,"ok guys. i've been monitoring this thread and think we need to revisit the situation. i was the one who started the discussion that ended in the ship carrier, and i'm going modify our idea a bit and explain some stuff. dude, you're not understanding the idea, and you obviously haven't read the thread. pull your head out of your fourth point of contact and think about what you said. the courier contract idea works with bcs and smaller, and with high skills, which only dedicated haulers will have, you can only fit one or two rigged bb-1s or bb-2s. and no matter what you do, you can only fit one rigged bb-3 in a courier contract. herein lies our problem.here's the updated idea, incorporating input from a few other people.problem: many players have arsenals of multiple rigged bbs, bcs, and their t2 variants, bb-3s are especially large and take up so much space that you can only fit 1 assembled in a freighter. so, for those players and corporations who want to rapidly mobilize an arsenal of already-rigged ships, they either have to take multiple trips, especially when transporting abbys, rokhs, hyperions, and maelstroms, have each player fly their own ships (which could take a very long time depending on how many ships each player needs moved, and take pilots away from defense or other needed tasks within a corp or alliance), or destroy all the rigs and repackage the ships, wasting the time, money and resources used in getting and making the rigs. see the problem?solutions: ---a new ship, dedicated only to carrying rigged ships, it could be based off the orca, or a completely new design. i personally think it would look really cool to be able to see the ships being carried, but i think that would slow down too many computers.---3 new ships with the same idea as the 1-ship idea, one for ff and dd class ships, one for ca, cg and bc class ships, and one for bb class ships. they could be non-racial, making them accessible to everyone, and the t2 versions could be jump-capable.---xercodo's original ideahere's the big thing for all these ships: they would only be able to transport ships. they cannot jettison them, or launch them. the only possible way to offload them would be into a ship maintenance array or a station hangar. the other problem we have discussed, is how do we go about dealing with ships popping out of the ships when they pop like a balloon. there were a couple ideas on this: destroy the ships inside the ship carrier when it pops, or have all ships put in a can when loaded into the ship carrier, so only the cans appear when the ship pops.the bottom line with this idea is that it will make things much easier for larger corps and alliances, or even just rich players, to move large numbers of rigged ships at once, or in the minimum amount of trips possible."

12/23/2009,"ship build cost is irrelevant to the buyer of the ship since its almost never sold for anything close to what the ship costs. so basing insurance on ship build price is an injustice to the buyer who unfortunate enough to not a get a fair deal on the ship in question (overpricing happens constantly). i agree in that a better system is needed, for one thing me buying a ship and only getting payed for the hull cost and not the items i put into the ship seems a little crooked to me if i decided to spend money on good items and it goes up in flames.at the very least as a temporary measure id propose the payout be equal to whatever it was bought for, if it was purchased for 2 isk then you get 2 isk. the alternative is that if it does go up in smoke instead of money you pay the insurance and they have the exact same ship hull waiting for you back at the station you insured it at (perhaps sans the fittings but really id pay a little extra to get the exact same ship back if it were an option).this would remove the monetary incentive to exploit the insurance and still give a fair alternative to be underpaid by the insurance for replacement (this happens all the time in real life)."

12/23/2009,yes please

12/23/2009,"making a hack which should not be allowed into a core element of war strategy is a bad idea.to be honest, you shouldn't be able to see if someone is online or offline unless they approve of themselves being in your buddy list. the same goes for any other substitute that would tell you whether someone is online or not."
12/23/2009,"ccp has said otherwise - they've promised that spacebook contact lists will keep the feature of being able to see if someone is online without their consent. it seems intentional to me. but yes, op, this seems like a good idea. i don't want to auto-accept conversations from targets, i just want to know when i can shoot them."
12/23/2009,"this.seriously, i actually read your whole proposal, and hugo is right, if anyone is war-deccable for the right buck, why not ditch concord and just let the entire galaxy dissolve into endless warfare?"
12/23/2009,"i'm hoping you can see the difference between a system where pvp attentions are announced ahead of time (war-decs in high-sec), both parties have ample time to prepare, and combat is limited to announced combatants, as opposed to a system of free-for-all (no concord)."
12/23/2009,if your proposal was passed.. and that's a big if... then there's no bloody reason to have concord.thus... your proposal (as well written as it is) is a totally unacceptable.not supporting.good try.... but your making a-lot of assumptions... and those assumptions will not carry well.pretty damn good try tho... so i tip my hat at you for the well written proposal.
12/23/2009,"i would suggest that once someone reaches a certain sp limit they get transfered out of a noob school corp into one of the other npc corps, at which point they are able to recieve 'personal' wardecs. (if they want protection they should join a player corp)also a nuet aiding/rr a wardec'd individule should flag them as targetable to the other pary.everything else can remain the same as they are currently:if u want to target someone personally, u should be willing to have their friends/corp/alliance back them up. if they're scammers/corp thiefs... speak to their diplo, maybe they'll hand him over/kick him."
12/23/2009,"again, not trying to sound like a broken record, but why not just remove concord?the systems you've put forward would add immense complexity to the way combat works. you've got all the hundreds of thousands of war decs going back and forth, you have to track every neutral who interferes on one side and another, and now we're automatically transferring characters in and out of npc corps.removing concord gives you the same thing except without all the hoops, triggers, and arbitrary rules."
12/23/2009,"apologies, i missed your reply here before.i can certainly see the difference. a system where pvp intentions are announce is very much like the system that wow has built for its battlegrounds. players on either side know they are going in to fight and can prepare for it ahead of time.however, if one party doesn't want to be involved, i.e. doesn't want to be attacked, then the war dec is simply a loophole in the design and purpose of high security systems. extending it to the level of the individual just makes the whole thing pointless."
12/23/2009,"you cant remove concord, because it would spur endless griefing of 1day old noobs by fail-at-pvp ****ers in megathrons that usually just park outside tradehubs with cans. thus likely griefing them out of the game before they've even upgraded their account, leading to lack of new players and the subsequent death of eve, when all the current vets die from pizza/colestrol induced heart attacks or fires in their moms basement, with no new blood to take their place.as for moving people into a differnt npc corp, its as simple as a daily update job on the database at downtime : ""update char set corpid = random(12,42,56) where skillpoints > 1800000 and corpid in (1,2,3,4)"" agro from rr is something that should have always been there in the first place, and i actually always thought it was the case. since its already tracked if u rep a globaly flagged criminal u become flagged too. so i see a little copy and paste of code with a slight change here and there.leaing us with being able to personally wardec and individule... well a extra field on the wardec screen for a char name, a little validation to see if he's vulnerable to such. and same logic copied and pasted from if he was a corp.the mechanics are already there, since eve tracks if an individule has joined the fleet of someone in a wardec. so i dont see this as being more than a days work from a coding perspective + (6months for qa)so whats complex?"
12/23/2009,"first, thanks for the reply and excellent arguments.implementation of a new mechanic is only limited by the creativity of the programmers and project managers, and what you've put forward sounds like it would work in theory.however, the point i was making wasn't in regards to implementation, but rather the effects that it would have on the way combat actually happens in high sec. the proposed reforms of the war dec mechanic would raise the complexity of player experience by adding the need to be aware of any number of war decs against friends, corp mates, fleets, and of course yourself. i just think removing concord would would be a relatively simpler solution to achieve the desired ends: the ability to attack specific people without concord interference. that is what is desired, am i wrong?sure, removing concord would impact new player experience, but i'd wager it would be no better than the same griefers targeting new and low sp players with war decs. so do we add new rules then? trial accounts can't be war dec targets until an arbitrary sp level? until they leave the newbie corp? can new players war dec on their own? do we maintain the rules regarding the costs of war decs and limitations?please understand, i do not want concord removed--altered in several ways, maybe, but that's another discussion. anyway, i think that if the proposal is to allow targeted, unavoidable pvp-enabling ""war decs"" against anyone and everyone, then i it's simpler, relative to the additions to the war dec system, to remove concord.let's take your coding example, except in reverse. just find this in there somewhere:onaggressionaction(aggressor, target) { if(isflaggedforaggression(aggressor, target)==false && systemsec>=.5) { activateconcord(target=aggressor); }}select. delete. done.let the mayhem begin."

12/23/2009,"because every other minmatar capital is essentially shield-based now, the nid should go back to how it was originally - 6 mids, 5 lows, and base cpu increased to 775 (halfway between caldari and gallente). this would allow it to more effectively fill its role of a logistics carrier while enabling better survivability on the front lines...and not be a laughingstock of a capital.additionally, it would be helpful if the logistics bonuses were raised to 7.5% per level to balance out its comparatively weaker damage output vs the thanatos and weaker tanking abilities compared to the archon and chimera."
12/23/2009,"okay, first off, the switch of tank type wouldn't be a nid boost at all. it'd be a chimera boost - the nid would, if anything, be made worse by it. carriers tank with the rr of their friends, forcing gangs to split apart rr types instead of focusing on armor does not help the nid when it was getting the benefit of focused armor-rr support before. secondly, i don't fly them myself, but i've never seen any reason to believe that nid is underpowered. again, carriers live in a ball of rr. providing better rr is a good thing in such circumstances. i'm not against the 7.5% buff, but it doesn't seem obviously necessary to me. if you want to buff it, jack up the sensor strength, scan res, and cap to let it do its job better, don't mess with the tank."

12/23/2009,"the science and industry interface could use some updates, especially at the corp level. i'm not going to touch sharing of pos invention/copying/manufacturing slots, that ones been beaten to death enough time by others.what i am going to suggest is some stuff that would reduce the amount of repetition involved in jobs that people do on a regular basis, such as invention, copying, and manufacturing.-first proposal: create a skill that would allow a player to specify that a job they are currently installing should auto-repeat. the skill would allow one repetition at level 1, 5 at level 2, 10 at 3, and so on. in order for a job to automatically repeat tho, there must be an open slot available at the installation in question when the job would restart. in addition, all the required materials must be present when the job repeats. otherwise, the job just ends as normal. for a bpo based job, such as copying, the only things that would need to be there are any materials the copying job needs. for bpc jobs, there must be another bpc with the exact same stats as the bpc that started the original job. the me/pe/type and number of licensed runs must be exactly the same.this option would mainly benefit pos owners, as the required slots would probably not be open immediately after a job is completed, making auto-repeat an option only at a completely unused station or a pos.-second proposal: allow for mass installation of any given set of prints so long as there are enough free slots at the given installation and the quantity of all the items to be installed is the same.for example, say i want 50 each of a microwarpdrive, a couple different types of guns, and 50 runs of one or two ammos. using this, i would be able to select all of the prints at once (up to the number of jobs i can install), enter the quantity (50), and with one go, i would install many different jobs.the quote screen would have to show the total amount of minerals for all the jobs, and would have to show the average print waste. it would also have to show a total for install and usage costs, and finally it woould need to show the earliest and latest delivery time of the jobs in question, since pe levels and base build times are different for different types of build able items.-third and finally, allow multiple item selection and manipulation from the science and industry blueprint interface. this would make it much easier for someone to separate out a group of blueprint copies that have somehow gotten mixed up with a group of blueprint originals rather than having to show info on each print over and over. allow personal prints to be ""delivered"" to the cargo bay of the active player ship, or an assembled container in the players hangar."
12/23/2009,"the addition of a right-click context menu option of 'strip ship' for the hangar 'ships' window would be useful.such a feature would appeal to players who know that a needed module is fitted to a certain ship.the current method, as i understand it and have experienced it, of retrieving a needed module from another ship and fitting it to the current ship follows the following five steps:1) make ship containing the needed module active.2) remove the needed module from the active ship.3) wait for the session timer to run out....a) say a bad word while waiting for the session timer to run out....b) say another bad word.4) return to the previous ship by making it active.5) fit the freed module to the active ship.with the proposed 'strip ship' right-click context menu option, the procedure would be as follows:1) choose the right-click, 'strip ship' menu option after right-clicking on the ship which contains the desired module.2) fit the freed up module to the active ship....a) bless ccp for making the game so much easier.benefits of implementing the 'strip ship' option (i.e. pros):1) the number of steps to obtain the desired module is reduced.2) the session timer count down is avoided.3) the requirement of making another ship active is eliminated.4) reprocessing of a ship to obtain a module is avoided.5) the ""new player experience"" (and old) is improved.cons:1) i'm not sure how rigs would be effected.a warning about removing the rig or rigs could be displayed to prevent loss after all other modules have been stripped."

12/23/2009,"have you guys discussed overhauling destroyers yet ? and if not, please do."
12/23/2009,"everything discussed so far can be found in the minutes.firstly i have to admit i love the destroyer class but it is clear the thrasher is the best all round, the catalyst is great once in range, the cormie's main claim to fame is being able to tickle stuff at 110km and the coercer is a nightmare to fit.i have looked at some of the destroyer change threads. the last proposal i saw needs a rethink imo.trying to balance optimal and falloff bonuses between class and specific ship coupled with the flexibility offered by destroyers won't work. it would in some ways make more sense to split the ships and have close range and snipe dessy variants - however i dislike that idea for a number of reasons. i think it would be more interesting if they could have a special class bonus such that rails, arties and beams get optimal range while blasters, autocannon and pulse get falloff instead. then the question is what to do with the current bonuses on the cormie and catalyst, i'm sure swapping their 10% per level optimal/falloff for damage would be popular though 5% on the catalyst is too much.if that case the coercer becomes the only one without a damage bonus but without the cap reduction it will suffer in a long fight (some people have trouble keeping a dessy alive longer than a couple of seconds so i guess it won't matter ). as it can fit 3 damage mods it would also be op with 5% per level damage bonus so that would need to be balanced carefully.onto the 25% rate of fire reduction. even with this penalty it is possible for a thrasher with autocannons (two gyros) to get around 400dps (rigged but without implants). without the rate of fire penalty you would be in the 530ish dps range!lets compare them all with 2 damage mods, no implants, no rigs, no overloading and the best close range guns.autocannon thrasher: 330 dpsblaster catalyst: 350 dps blaster cormie (lolwut): 250dps (only one damage mod thanks to single lowslot)pulse coercer: 300dps (330 with 3 heatsinks)you can see the cormie is lacking but that if the catalyst got a damage bonus it would be pretty overpowered.going to bigger guns, the thrasher is unmatched on alpha, but due to long cycle times on arties compared to the others the dps is still pretty even, other than the cormie. the catalyst is very hard to fit even with awu 5 which leads on to...powergrid, i agree they should be able to fit a full rack of arties/beams/rails without fitting mods, so that needs looking at. it is even more important now that small rigs are so cheap because the drawback on gun rigs is higher pg use edit: i know i've not addressed ewar or tanking. they could certainly handle a bit of a hp boost without going op. on ewar, i see these as dps support ships backed up by a frigate gang, so rather than try to be a one size fits all solution it is better to play to their strengths (though a bit more cpu would give the option of fitting unbonused ewar). to improve them running with a light gang it would be nice to change the 3au/sec warp speed to 6au/sec in line with frigates (or at the least split the difference and go to 4.5au/sec).feel free to pull my post apart now"

12/24/2009,"you could read through the thread to find out. if you buy anything made from minerals, then the current insurance system is costing you isk, because insurance artificially inflates the cost of minerals. it is basically an npc buy order. that's why the market cant ""sort this out"" - players can't compete with npcs with infinite funds who dont care about value.as for the massive production capability, plenty of people have that capability. read the thread linked to in the op. the biggest time sink was actually destructing the ships.the problem that this causes is that it's a vast isk fountain, with no comparable isk sink, it's scalable, and that it keeps ship and module prices artificially high. it also means that suicide ganking is op, because you can buy and t1-fit a ship for free. whilst i do believe that suicide ganking is absolutely necessary at the moment, it should cost something to lose even a t1 ship. pegging insurance at around 85-95% of ship mineral value means that it will always cost at least a few mil to lose even an unfitted ship.however the bonus side of that is that t1 ships will almost certainly become quite a bit cheaper."
12/24/2009,"insurance doesn't need to be 'reviewed', just removed."
12/24/2009,"i follow this topic with interest, and have my own theories on how to best solve the problem.just as barnacles are exposed by a receding tide, and real estate fraud schemes are exposed by falling housing prices - the flaws in the current insurance system are laid bare by falling mineral prices.on common carebear cries to ""remove insurance for concord kills and self destruction!"". watching people post this is by far my biggest pet peeve, as it shows that most people have very little understanding of how economic systems work.it sounds good on the surface (at least to the bears) - in much in the same way as calls for 'raising the minimum wage' sounds appealing, but it inevitably leads to more unemployment for the lowest paid workers.edit: supportedactual results?removing insurance for self destruction will accomplish precisely nothing, as there are tons of other ways to artificially kill battleships rapidly and collect the insurance.removing insurance from concord kills 'ie suicide gank nerf', actually aggravates the problem by making carebears 'mineral producers' even safer and more numerous, it reduces combat and legitimate ship destruction further, and leaves insurance in place - so those ships would invariably end up being artificially destroyed outside a manufacturing center, merely for the insurance payout.insurance is simplistic and flawed, yes. if fixing the insurance system is too difficult, however, those flaws become safely hidden if we improve the game by driving up the value of minerals through encouraging a marginal increase in ganking and less mindless resource gathering. oh, and i'm glad there are people (like malcanis) out there whose posts show that they have a strong understanding of the principles we are dealing with, and how to fix them. its really a relief while reading these threads. so much simplistic and flawed thinking out there."

12/24/2009,"the point of insurance reform/removal shouldn't be to make anything cheaper/easier. everything is already cheap and easy.eve needs to be harder and more difficult, particularly when it comes to loss, as right now the majority of players seem to be fat with isk and a bs loss means literally nothing due to 110% insurance payout.everyone whines about 'less pvp', but most of the players that i know fly t2 in 0.0, which doesn't benefit from insurance in the first place, so that's an empty argument.i'd say 90% of the posts out there regarding insurance are selfish: they want more protection from suicide ganks, or they want less expensive ships for pvp because they're a bunch of losers and can't hack pvp without the free ride of insurance. fail more."

12/24/2009,"before i get starts i would like to say this is not ""let the players fully customize the skins and draw unwanted content on their ships""my idea is this.... add a system that allows players to customize their ships looks instead of just what goes ""in"" the ship like weapons, ammo, armor or shield tanking and so on. the systems i think would work are listed below1.) if you take the time to look at most eve ships they are broken into two colors for example the hulk is grey and red. my suggestion for the paint job is make these two differnt colored areas recolorable. so i could take my hulk and repaint the grey area blue and the red area gold (as an example). to change the color a number of ways can be put in place1a.) 3 sliders, r/b/g, the ""ammount"" in each ""color"" blended togeather makes a custom color for each section1b.) have a pallet of preset colors for each colorable area1c.) ""importing"" players set values for red/blue/green as well as saturation/hue/darkness.2.) have preset colorings that a player can pick from, this works best for navy/fraction ships who have camo instead of ""plain"" paint where players can pick differnt camo styles instead of colors3.) add a 4th special rig spot, kind of like the t3 cruiser sub system, a player can put a ""rig"" in this spot and when it does it makes the ship become a differnt color (this is kind of like the preset idea) but this can also give ships small bonuses too, like black ""stealth"" would reduce signature radius of the ship like real stealth black paint would on planes for example.of course all the ideas would requier players to make/pay for services as they do when they repair a ship, buy insurance or a rig to put on their ship. the price (i feel) should be dependant on the ship size/class, a frigate would cost 10,000 for a paintjob while a titan would cost 100,000,000 for example.now for all of those who are worried about lag or ""my computer cant handle this!"" very very simple.... we have options in the graphics section of our settings that list things like ""turrent effects"" ""drone models"" and so on.... just have one like this ""custom paintjobs"" when activated it shows the custom paintjobs on every ones ship, when disactivated all ships revert to ""defualt"" colorings that we see daily in eve. its the easiest solution i can think of. i know people are worried about server side lag and the only thing i can say to them and ccp about this is test it!!!!! :p if it does time for more servers/upgrades or discard my idea, but it probably will come back up sometime......now i just want to point out some games in history who have uses systems simular to what i have discribed.*call of duty 4 & modern warfare where you can put differnt camo textures on your guns*mech assult where you can color the mech and ""glow affects""*armored core games, you can color each piece (left arm, right arm, left leg, right leg, head) differntly, you can also add emblums(symbols)*metal gear solid 3 (and 4 i think) where you can change the main characters armor/camo*halo where you can customize the armor and color along with emblums (symbols)*supreme commander & command and conquer games you can pick the coloring of your army*dawn of war 1&2 you can pick colors of your army*rainbow 6 you can pick from preset camo colors*transportation tycoon delux edition and locomotion you can change the color of indivual colors on trains,cars,boats and planes*world of warcraft you can change your skin color/race/armor and each one looks differnt, though the armor and weapons themselfs arent customizableand here is a photoshop example i made of idea number onemega photoshop funim sorry if this idea has allready been posted, i scanned over the 3 lists and didnt see it or something simular so thats why im posting, thank you for taking the time to read and support (if you do) my idea to improve eve"
12/24/2009,"i ran out of space to put this in the first post im sorry :pupdate! first update and ""post"" of the new year i think :p its 1/11/10 and i got bored while mining in my industrial (thanks to hulkaggedon -.-) and took the time and used some photoshop magic to produce this!!paintshop windowbehold! a demo/preview menu window for selecting your ships coloring. this example would be used for normal ships (not ones with camo). the ships with camo would only have the presets avalable for use. i have also added the option ""metallic"" to make the ship appear as it normaly does, but i know how some people like flat colors with little to no reflectivity so when this option is turned off your ship will not reflect as much in the area which you have selected it so yes you can have half of it flat and the other half not if you so like ^.^this menu (in theory) would pop up like your manufactoring, medical, insurance, repair window would at a station (with the offered service) and allows you to edit the coloring of your ship at any time. the price you pay is based off two things the size of the ship and if your coloring only one section or both. for example 1 section on a frigate is 100,000 isk, both sectinos is 200,000 isk. on a battleship though it would be more like 1m isk per section. just for example ^.^also on a side note i have removed the decal idea from the post cause there was no support for it but i still want to keep the paintshop idea alive.if any one has an idea they would like to add i will move their idea up to this post and quote them so readers can find all the suggestions posted in this post easily ^.^once again i would like to thank you for taking the time to read, and support me (if you do), fly safe or unsafe if you likeoh and while your here make sure to cheak out my other posts ^.^new sovernty structure idea"
12/24/2009,now we think of the common 200v200 or 300v300 fleet fights where it already takes multiple seconds to load the grid properly. we add the extra informations for the useless colors (i am sure goonies would have a policy that noone is allowed to use the same color) and the grid load lag would be even worse. for no real benefit.that said ... not supported.
12/24/2009,"im sorry to sound so rude but if you would take the time to fully read my post you would see the part and i quote myself""we have options in the graphics section of our settings that list things like ""turrent effects"" ""drone models"" and so on.... just have one like this ""custom paintjobs"" when activated it shows the custom paintjobs on every ones ship, when disactivated all ships revert to ""defualt"" colorings that we see daily in eve.""the servers lag bad enough when these fleet fights happen and i can understand your problem with it but i specialy put that part in my post for people like you who do not want it, you can just leave it off, or while prepairing for a large fleet battle turn it and some other graphics options off/down to make loading quicker and easier for you."
12/24/2009,"i've said it before, i'll say it again:its a waste of ccp's time to even consider this. if they do, all cudos for them, but i'd rather they released new ships and much less lag then deal with pointless visuals like custom paintjobs. its not needed, very few mmo's bother with it, most of what you listed are fpses that don't have to deal with lots of lag and/or an evolving game. so lets just leave it alone.enough."
12/24/2009,"i agree they could spend a bit of time making it less laggy but the biggest problem is they support eve with one maybe two servers, buying 2 or 3 more servers would cure most of the server side lag, if its computer side lag you just need to update or quit *****ing cause the game is only going to demand more power some how from your computer as it advances.as far as new ships go i can only think of 2 or 3 ships they can put into the game unless their mega godly ships with 20 gunsa frieghter/carrier that carrys other ships around in high seca low sec only ""hulk"" with more then 3 lasersa t2 dreadnaught with more then 3 weapons which fits between dreadnaught and titan.more t3 ships which i feel are pritty uselesssure they could continue to add these navy/freaction ships that give differnt bonuses or have a differnt paint job but its still the same model, they havent released a new ship model sence t3's came out. when t3's came out the first thing i noticed is each subsystem changed the design of the ship so honestly if you support having more t3's with more subsystems like that just remember that demands more from the server then recoloring would cause of the differnt models and differnt textures for each model + the color ontop of it for each model/textureoh and one last thing i forgot.... if it keeps coming back and people keep posting simular things it might not be needed but its wanted. imagine if ever car on earth was the same color..... its not a useful thing, it can be expensive too but if we want it we should get it cause its such a simple thing."

12/24/2009,"not supported.unless cloaked ships can be probed down,and scanner provides intel on corp, or proximity sensors/probes are made availible.and for anyone claiming that local will make it harder for macro ratters, you're wrong, its easier. a macro can hit scan on a scanner every second and warp to a safespot as soon as something pops up.a real player is too busy chatting to his corp mates, buying **** on the market or having a **** to click a button over and over.now also for those that hunt said macro ratter... if he cloakes up, you'd never know he's there.edit: oh and local is also a social tool.jump into a system looking for targets, read peoples bio's make comments in local about haha thats a good one... start chatting. end up creating a new alliance."
12/24/2009,i agree that you should not appear in local unless you talk ( break radio silence ).this has always been a historical tactic in favor of the clandestine spy or overwatch in remaining silent and hidden. local is a spoiler in that it lets everyone know too much about somebody without actually putting forth the effort to approach and identify the ship that just entered the area.
12/24/2009,"before proposing a change to local, you need to suggest something else that will 1: let a hunter find prey in good time and 2: let the prey see the hunter coming in good time. the more interactive and entertaining this process is the better.simply removing local and changing nothing else would only increase reliance on the directional scanner, which i don't want to see because the d-scanner is horrible. when checking for probes, i don't want to have to sift through ten moons, five pos towers, twenty small railgun batteries, forty rat wrecks and a partridge in a pear tree. vigilance is something you should need if you want to operate in dangerous space, but a tolerance for boredom shouldn't be."
12/24/2009,"but you could still use probes. they'd function as they always have. the directional scanner would cut both ways though yes it would let prey know a predator was after them if they were to use it to simply finding them. prey would also be constantly broadcasting their position to predator if they spammed it indiscriminately.the directional scanner is currently a detriment to any fix to local, as no one (and rightly so) wants to click it every 5 seconds."
12/24/2009,suggestion for using probes without d-scanning is a joke.
12/24/2009,notification. it needs to be made more obvious. much more obvious.i was warp scrambled for 10 minutes doing a mission and i had no idea until i wanted to warp out when my tank was failing.no surprise my tank failed and i died. i would've killed whatever was scrambling me right when i was notified. but nope. i never knew. i couldn't even figure out what had me scrambled when i suddenly realized i was.there is something i know that is suppose to do this. and i have still not found it. not even searching meticulously through the knowledge base and evelopedia.what the hell is up with that?
12/24/2009,and the proposal is ....................?
12/24/2009,"you get a big message in the middle of the screen telling you ""... started started warp scrambling you""and you have the nice icon in your overview, something you always look at to lock more targets.and you managed to miss *both*?"
12/24/2009,"i confess, it's happened to me - the notifications are there but if it's hectic, or overview isn't set up right, it's possible to miss it when the stuff hits the fan.as a proposal though, needs work: more constructive suggestions, less whine. for example, i discovered the new audio alerts today while i died embarrassingly to a very expertly fit rifter pilot. that's an area something like this could be expanded to. bigger icons that are easier to see (placed above your ship controls for example) would be another."
12/24/2009,"well, it is clear but... not very.on the right had side of your hud there's an indicator of any ew being used against you. unfortunately it does not have it's own little column space so if there is any text there at all you can't see anything.i vote for having an remote effects (ecm or repair, ect) in their own column that's clear of other clutter so you can actually see who is doing what to you!"
12/24/2009,this.dont fix something that isnt broken
12/24/2009,"hmmmm, it does show an icon on the overview who has u scrammed. though its noteasily visiable. without checking the line carefully.paying attention helps, that being said, since there is usually a timer bar above your shield/armor/hull hud, which indicates if you're being jammed/damped ect, why not show a big flashy easy to spot sign about being scrammed, or make the speed indicator flash red.ps: notifications are too numerious (""your light potato gun did x amount of damage"" every second kinda make it tedious to pay attention to it..."")"
12/24/2009,"when you have roughly 15 small rats shooting at you, 5 bigger ones. and you're launching your own volleys, trying to maintain optimal range while controlling drones. 1 little (and yes. very little) message is going to disappear into the mounting notifications of misses hits and damage taken.in fact, i couldn't even figure out why i wasn't warping until i mashed my ""warp to"" button as fast as possible until i could get the ""you can't warp"" message.if there is something in the overview that is suppose to notify me i'm being scambled, i sure as hell don't know where it is. so yes, it is very reasonable i'd miss it.there's no tutorial on warp scambling? not even a page in evelopedia or the knowledge base?ccp has a lot. a lot of broken features. stop spending time making our ships look even more futury and just fix some of these nuisances. if i haven't been clear enough in my proposal.1. knowledge base and evelopedia need to be rehauled. not just with an article on warp scrambling. they are missing whole bunches of info.2. there needs to be an ingame tutorial on warp scambling. in fact. warp scrambling should be part of the very beginning tutorial for new players.3. there needs to be a 'history' of sorts. like a log, where you can readily look back on notifications (hits, misses, damage, ewar) that has been flashed at you in the past 2 seconds that you didn't see because you're being gang spammed.4. messages automated on local by the game need to be shown somewhere else. i don't know a soul who actually keeps local in their screen, they're either in corp/private chat or have that window closed althogether to save space."
12/24/2009,"i'm still trying to figure out where the ""your are unable to warp because you are warp scrambled"" audio notification went... i must have a corrupted install or something... surely ccp wouldn't remove that gem!"
12/24/2009,"some time ago you had much better acoustic and visual effects to see yourself being warpscrambled.we have nice marvelous new grafic on planets, which is pretty useless gimmicks for real gameplay. i dont understand why the grafical effect on such important issue is now nearly unvisible. you can even hear nothing. this was different in the past.there is just a little icon to see yourself being in trouble.there is need to fix that soon. it would help a lot if you hear a loud sound and at least the old visual effect clearly. i support this."
12/24/2009,whenever a ship has any kind of targeted ewar (including warp scrams and disruptors) on you you get an icon on the far right of your overview next to that ship showing you what effect is active on you. it's about as clear as it can be unless you're somehow running missions with your overview minimised?apart from this page you mean?your failure to pay attention to your overview is not really a 'broken feature'.
12/24/2009,"not supported.most of the removals in question seem to have been done because of rule violations, or fruits thereof. not to mention the flaming, the whining, and the total lack of restraint or non-constructive behaviour.will some perfectly okay posts get deleted in the process when there's a mass removal? yes. it happens. those who feel strongly about it and that there posts were unjustly removed should simply post again.above all else, it's ccp's forums and they can do whatever they like. people who don't want to follow the rules can move to the unofficial boards and sites that are outside of ccp's purview.and yes, i have had posts removed in the past, some that made sense and others that didn't. but it's no reason to get in a tizzy about it. now, when every single negative comment on these boards mysteriously disappears, then you can start worrying."
12/24/2009,"censorship is necessary but control of censorship is more so.i've seen far too much lately, ccp always seem unwilling to take criticism or accept that something went wrong, this is nothing new, but ... tinfoilhat on ... it seems like they've now got active word filtering that flashes lights and sounds alarms as soon as something is posted on the forum they don't like and the nerfbat swings down hard.as many have said before, it puts people off using the forum when they see swathes of moderation and then people complaining about the moderation also get moderated, it's almost comical and looks very unprofessional.instead of moderating, the devs need to look at the complaint, and answer as best they can instead of deleting posts.ccp - only 1 c away from communism the way they're acting. grow a set ccp, accept that not everything is peachy with the game, fix the problems and speak to the people who pay your wages."
12/24/2009,"being somewhat of a military history buff, i look to real world strategy and tactics often to give me an edge in the game. and i have an answer for replacing local as an intel source which would be both fair and add some ""realism"" to the game.the answer is found in ship signatures. encode into the game a passive full time scanner that will pick up local traffic based on it's emission signature. it will give you the following info: range to target based on signature strength, type of vessel, a corp or alliance readout ""iff"" (ident friend/foe) with appropriate color.it would not reveal any pilot info unless the pilot breaks silence in local (like in corp or alliance chat).high signature ships will be visible at great distances, where low signature ships will only appear when much closer. the readout will appear on the overview.any suggestions? support? stones?"
12/24/2009,"though lasers in real life are created by the laser itself and not the lens (crystal) the laser is shined though i love the idea, it would make mining much more interesting to watch cause in fleets it would look like a laser light show :pthough a suggestion for t1 lasers, have an option or ammo you can load that has no affect on mining yield but still changes the color"
12/24/2009,sure.
12/24/2009,the quick way to get rid the pop up is hit enter rather than click on it. still it would be nice to have the option to completely disable it.
12/24/2009,make all pop-ups optional????let the players decide what's worth their continued daily annoyance and not.
12/24/2009,"with the change in 2008 leaving it so there is no ghost training to be had, the developers gave the response that it was for the benefit of the players who actively play, but this is not the case. in-fact nothing has changed for the players who actively play from that change. in my opinion there needs to be a training bonus for those who are out and actively using their skills and playing it is not fair that playing does nothing extra vs being offline and training. i think this would bring players to the game more actively and give them incentive to play for more than 5 minutes just to change over skill queues."
12/24/2009,no skills grinding in eve. not supported. ever.
12/24/2009,"ghost training was removed because it gave an unfair advantage as in you get the same benefits as people who actually paid for their subscription. kudos for the attempt to try and twist it as a show of support for your skill grinding plan though.playing actively benefits you a great deal, but it just doesn't help you train faster directly. even on the sp front it does allow for better implants and buying a character with higher sp. having high sp count with no money or actual game experience just results in lol killmails, so there is no need to give any special training bonuses to people actively playing. if you just want to train skills faster, ask for it, instead of trying to bring additional grinds to the game.as a personal oppinion, any skill grinding is a horrible idea and i will never support it in any form."
12/24/2009,"in fact after bringing in the techiii cruisers you are able to loose skills, when loosing your ship.so it will be just fair, if you are able to gain faster skills while playing activly.i support this.you may limit this on the skills which you can loose, just for the new tech iii skills."
12/24/2009,"dominion [dom] brought with it a much needed improvement to projectile weapons, especially the improved ammo.prior to [dom] there was a relatively fine balance in regards to offensive/defensive capabilities of minmatar ships with projectile bonuses due to generally poor gun performance.the fitting requirements of acs allows thrashers, rifters and ruptures in particular to be capable of fitting oversized buffer modules on top of full combat fittings with correct size/number of guns.no other race is able to fit appropriate size/number of weapons on top of a huge buffer but have to sacrifice either speed (mwd -> ab) or damage/range (downgrading weapons)*.the [dom] changes made acs as good if not better than most other weapon options due to high-tracking, high damage, good range and near perfect damage types, combined with the full oversize buffer ability the ac fitting have become too good .. something has to give.examples:thorax has to use small weapons to use a 1600 plate.maller has to use small weapons to use a 1600 plate.caracal has to use light missile launchers to use lses.etc.solution:increase ac grid fitting requirement by 15-20% across the board. still allows for buffering but introduces the same kind of sacrifices that all other ships have to make thus bringing the minmatar ships back in-line with the rest of eve.note: a change in grid requirement will have minimal impact on bc and bs class ships in regards to fitting buffer modules, but excessive buffering will require sacrifices as it does for all others.*viable fits at any rate. gimmick fits do not count as they are not used."
12/24/2009,"this is just one big proposal of grief in my opinion. i don't see any kind of balance here at all, a matter of fact.. i don't see any need for concord here at all either!"
12/24/2009,"i support it. really hate this corp hopping. if i have a reason to wardec someone, i want kick his ass.if someone scammed you, stole ships and isk from corp you have a reason and thats not griefplay.corphopping and opening new corporations for avoiding war should be an exploit.personal wardec one pilot and his alts (if you know them) should be possible."
12/24/2009,"id like to see this change, mainly id like to specify my own orbiting distance instead of the preset ones that the game gives you. i dont know if thats exactly what you proposed but id like to see this happen.perhaps a drop down menu with the option to type in meters how far away you wish to orbit."
12/24/2009,"please!also- maybe beat whoever came up with the inane babble/background jibberish. it almost sounds like wind- seriously wind in space?i want to hear pew- and maybe some pew. thats really about it.dont need no wind in space. no chanting, no babbling, dont want to be deafened by my hardeners. to be fair the hardener one seems to be fixed- if we could keep it that way it would be great.tl/drat least an option to turn off the wind in space sound"
12/24/2009,"/signedto hear wind in space sounds totally stupid.sound and visual grafic and physics have to be fixed in many ways.oh yes, some of the new planets look great (did i mentioned that already ?) but a lot of effects are just unlogic, unrealistic and very stupid. it was better in most ways long time ago.this has to be fixed."
12/24/2009,"the idea here is that the more often a market order is changed in a given period (6 hours or 24 hours) the longer it takes for that order to propagate through to the market.if you make adjustments every 5 minutes just to beat the other guy by 0.01 isk you'll very quickly find that your order is simply not showing up on the market for 5 or 10 minutes. because you've glutted the system with rapid changes to your orders it has to clear the old que and re-initiate your adjustment.so, let's say that yes, you can adjust your order every 5 minutes, but each such adjustment increases the amount of time it takes for the order to be returned to the market que.so... add 30-60 seconds per adjustment after the first couple made in (let's say) 1 hour. this would add up quickly... 10 rapidfire adjustments in an hour would result in a 5-10 minute propagation lag for that order. if this counter is persistant for 6 hours or 24 hours the lag time could be upwards of an hour (which, in its delay, brings the counter down) or more for each adjusted order to re-appear on the market que.as time passes this counter drops back down just as rapidly as it goes up.this will advantage people who make a couple of adjustments a day, not one every five minutes just to whore for position or keep undercutting everybody in existence."
12/24/2009,"as shown below, the tooltip popups are more often than not in the way of what you're trying to read. i would like to suggest that we have the option of turning them off. possibly a toggle in the esc menu. though the tooltip contains the same info as the line item it represents, it is more distracting than useful.please visit your user settings to re-enable images."
12/24/2009,i suppose i should support my own recommendation
12/24/2009,"i may be mining and have large amounts of diverse ore types i drop in station, or mission salvage.. whatever it is-- it's quite ponderous having to sell each stack of items line by line. i'd like to be able to select multiple item types and sell them all at once when i am docked in a station that has buyers for it. if there are no buyers for some items i have highlighted ccp could simply give you a message like this:x items had no buyers, all other items sold successfuly.there are many times and reasons for wanting it, namely convenience of saving time and getting isk in your hand right now versus when or if the contract goes through. you lose 10k isk for every contract whether its successful or not, i have talked to a few about this, they like and agree with the idea."
12/24/2009,"i have to agree with you, not fully on all your topics but with out miners in eve the ammount of ships and moduals would slowly began to die off with no one to produce materials in mass number for these things to be made and we get the short stick when it comes to profits. in real life miners are paid tons of money to do their job cause they are the foundation of all things in life. i found a number of sites where it showed miner wages vs other profeshions and on adverage miners earned 20,000 more a year (33.33% more then other profeshions). i am not saying put mining on the top of the chart for profit but balance it a bit, expecialy with the dropping mineral prices cause of dominion and new null sec mineral avalibility."
12/24/2009,"what he said.also those guys bumping hulks are actually checking to see if you're a macro or not, ask them if they bored in local, and they'll probly move on... ignore them, and they'll come back in an insured geddon and suicide gank u.0.0 mining earns well over 30mil an hour solo, even more in a gang with bonuses and dedicated haulers. more than belt ratting or l4 missions.highsec mining does need to be buffed a bit, i can' see anyone not running a macro making any decent amount of isk, in a humanly bearable amount of time to be worth the skill investment, then again... plenty of 0.0 corps/alliances are *****ing about the amount of miners they need now to keep their industry indexes up... (upgrades) so maybe all those highsec hulk pilots need to move down to nullsec, and leave 1.0 to the noobs in ospreys, so they can make a buck or 2 on veldspar."

12/24/2009,"with the change in 2008 leaving it so there is no ghost training to be had, the developers gave the response that it was for the benefit of the players who actively play, but this is not the case. in-fact nothing has changed for the players who actively play from that change. in my opinion there needs to be a training bonus for those who are out and actively using their skills and playing it is not fair that playing does nothing extra vs being offline and training. i think this would bring players to the game more actively and give them incentive to play for more than 5 minutes just to change over skill queues.i have also posted this topic in the assembly hall, i hope it gets the attention it deserves.if you feel strongly about this please support the effort to give active players something for actually playing."
12/24/2009,"yeah, the hull progression path for the cormy is just not right.if you follow how races progress from frigate to bs it should be a logical progression.rifter - thrasher - stabber - hurricane - typhoon since the minmatar focus more heavily on projectiles the progression is pretty simple.punisher - coercer - omen - harbinger - armageddon like the matari the amarr have a singular weapon focus, but the khanid ships break this when it comes to t2. the punisher hull has 2 variants so the beam's don't throw off the hull progression. until you get to the heretic, which goes from a beam based hull to a sadly anemic rocket based hull. the heretic should be beams, keeping with it's t1 hull.merlin - cormorant - moa - ferox - rokh again, a break when you advance to the t2 hulls, but with two variants the merlin sets up a t2 hull progression for missiles. unfortunately the cormorant goes from hybrids to, anemic again, missiles. either make the cormorant a missile hull or introduce a second hull, the swan, that uses rockets/light missiles and make the flycatcher a t2 version of that. or give the flycatcher hybrids.incursus - catalyst - thorax - brutix - megathron unfortunately the eris gets a split weapon system that can't make up it's mind one way or the other. it should be a pure hybrid platform, or a missile platform with drones (75 m/3 drone bay, 25 bandwidth, +5 bandwidth/level). since it's dps would be laughable with rockets the addition drones (no damage bonus) would bring it into parity with the sabre somewhat. lacking a damage bonus on drones it would not eclipse the ishkur.another idea is an addition to the certificate system that gives a hull progression tree allowing new pilots to focus along a specific line if they want to specialize in certain hull types."
12/24/2009,"to make a missile based cormie would mean either a split weapon bonus (ask any minmatar pilot how bad these are) or lose the optimal bonus on rails thus making it unable to be a long range sniper. making a new hull is out of the question unless you want to wait years also remember the role of these ships is anti frigate hence the tracking bonuses. missiles don't have instant dps and even with a range/speed bonus will have issues killing ceptors that thrashers can instapop.we can discuss it is you really want, make a proposal."
12/24/2009,that makes pretty good sense. i could only think that a slight modification may be more clear.passed: +6/-2 (those against)failed: -6/+2 (those for)
12/24/2009,i like that idea and will add something similar for the next meeting.
12/24/2009,"they promised to be there to elaborate on the mothership hp issue but didn't show up - a day later we get a dev blog about it without any warning.gj on the minuted td, very clear."

12/25/2009,let's flog this mother****er!
12/25/2009,"i am a relatively new player and i enjoy eve a lot, however one issue is bothering me a lot:i play eve in 1920 x 1200 resolution and the fonts in the game are absolutely tiny and i really have to strain my eyes to read them. i did find the way to increase the fonts in the chat and also chose the ""expanded"" font width, but the fonts that are not in the chat or context menu are still very small and hard to read.i tried to find a way to increase the fonts in wiki.eveonline.com and found this csm issue:"

12/25/2009,"+1 for many of the reasons mentioned. blasters are simply a joke, railguns aren't much better. as a group, hybrid turrets need some serious attention given to them the same as projectiles just received.also, as much as i hate to swing the nerf bat, lasers"
12/25/2009,"want it. need it. willing to buy it. won't complain if it can only carry 2-3 bs-sized hulls. minimal cargo capacity (5000 m3, max) for modules, etc., in a corp hangar similar to the orca preferred. hideously expensive to train for and buy - i'm ok with that. t2 = vastly unequal insurance payout/cost ratio - no problem. we need this that badly."
12/25/2009,also repackaging ships will void any insurance you have on the ship
12/25/2009,you dont need to repackage ships to put them into a courier contract to put them into a freighter.
12/25/2009,"the reason why repackaging is hard to manage...when you repackage a ship, it becomes another item that is essentially generic (everything that was on the ship is no more). they would need to create variables for what is equipped on the ship. but if they did that and someone put the ship on the market, the buyer wouldn't know what is currently equipped, neither would the seller (no option on repackaged items to view fittings on the interface). the solution to that new issue would be to add a flag to the repackaged item to prevent selling on market and add an interface action to view the fittings. but there's also another problem now, what if you have more than one ship with different modules? if you stacked the repackaged ships together, one would become a copy of the other. of course now you could have a script each time you attempt to stack to verify the ships are equipped with the same things. so that makes another issue. now let's say you repackaged 4 ships with different fittings in separate stacks. how do i tell which is which easily?so yeah it carries on like that. way too much stuff to think over. so that solution is probably not the best. a new ship or repackaging methods could maybe work?"
12/25/2009,"agreed. they got rid of ghost training, ghost r&d should go to."
12/25/2009,"issue:if you join a fleet with armour bonuses, they are applied instantly, adding xx % to your armour.if you join a fleet with shield bonuses, they are *not* applied instantly, instead your total shield is increased but the amount is shown as 'damage', requiring you to wait for a long time for it to passively recharge, or to boost it / have it boosted to max before you can enjoy the full bonus.even worse, this happens every time you change sessions (undock, jump system, jump cyno, etc.)proposal:make shield bonuses apply instantly, like armour. if you have already taken damage, its easy to not make it exploitable by making new shield % == old shield %, or one of many other ways.the proposal has been brought up a first time, and it was deemed incomplete. i would like to re-raise it with the following addition:to prevent passive shield tankers (depending on recharge) to gain benefits from this bonus, it should increase shield recharge time by the same % that it does shield hp.this should count for both normal gang bonuses and titan fleet bonuses, so that the siege warfare skill would read:'increases gang member shield hp and recharge time by 2% per level'and the leviathan description would read:'increase gang members shield hp and recharge time by 7.5% per level'this makes sure that the recharge rate per second stays the same when compared to non-bonused, thus negating any advantage the ship main gain from recharge. - sok.evelopedia link"
12/25/2009,"shield fleet bonus increase total shields and so they increase regeneration rate, something that armor bonuses don't do. if ccp find a way to remove that added bonus ok, if it stay, no."
12/25/2009,what venkul mul said above. you're still getting a bonus from the moment they start to apply.not supported as it's clear you haven't thought this through.
12/25/2009,"you say that on a lot of things.what is the bonus? a very small increase in recharge rate? hardly impressive, except maybe on drakes and nighthawks..on battleships it can take up to 10 minutes for the shields to passively recharge and thus effectively be the full bonus. on capitals, it can take hours."
12/25/2009,"i support this fully, mainly as it annoys me when i have a lil red blip on my hud <,<"
12/25/2009,"supported :)and to the people that say the recharge rate bonus is good enough, it really is stupidly tiny.....the real bonus you need is that bit extra ehp to keep your fleet going for longer"
12/25/2009,"this makes perfect sense, i don't understand you guys shooting it down.have you ever been in a fleet with bonuses on??supported."
12/25/2009,"if i say that on a lot of things it's probably because there are a lot of badly thought out ideas floated.let me explain how shield tanking works as you apparently don't know:shields regen naturally over time. each ship has a shield amount and a recharge time. the recharge time to full is constant regardless of the actual size of the shields. so, if you boost your shield amount then you are also increasing the amount recharged per second. that's not a trivial bonus on any ship that shield tanks.armour by contrast doesn't regen naturally which is why the bonus amount from gang bonuses is applied immediately - otherwise it would be useless to any ship that didn't have an armour repper fitted and all ships would have to waste some cap repairing themselves to full every time the session changed."
12/25/2009,signed
12/25/2009,fully supported as i am well skilled commandship pilot it is really annoying!!
12/25/2009,"you get the recharge bonus and the ehp buff. you're still getting the bonus to your max shields regardless. seriously, do you guys even play the game?"
12/25/2009,"supported.alternatively, i guess you could make armor gang bonuses require 40+ seconds to take effect..."
12/25/2009,"now now, get off your high horse.i know my share about shield tanks, thank you very much, and to 99% of pvp fits, recharge is an unimportant factor, and the bonus in that area does nothing to aid them. basically, armour ships are 37.5% better off right off the bat unless the shield ships have the ability to regen it (which takes ages), or rep it up (which takes loads of cap).yes, it very much is trivial."
12/25/2009,hm ... not sure it is possible code wise ... but how about the shield amount bonus also increases the shield recharge time by a few percent. then you don't boost passive shield tanks too much and still get your instant buffer.
12/25/2009,"this was fun to think through; i think it's an excellent point for discussion and i nearly gave it a full support. however, after looking at the functions, i think it's actually a good mechanic as is.tl;dr: i think the current function is fair, as shield tanks can reap the benefits quickly by repping either passive or active, while for armor tanks, it doesn't really matter.as a shield tank, i've always rapidly filled the bonus hp; either by one quick shot from a booster on an active tank or from the sheer rapid recharge on a passive tank.for my fleet mates who armor-tank the bonus does take an exceptionally long time to fill, which severely negates its usefulness. at first glance, this seems unfair, as i immediately reap the benefits of an added armor-hp increase, while they get almost nothing from the shield-hp increase.however, since all of my defenses are focused into shields, when i hit armor, my tank is broken and i'm on the way out. an armor bonus is marginal and has never determined the outcome of a battle. likewise, my fleet mates don't gain significant benefit from the added shield hp--even if someone remote reps it to full. when they come under fire, the shields are gone within seconds and they've started armor-repping.thus, i think the way it functions currently is fair. shield tanks are able to reap the benefits despite that the mechanic adds the hp unfilled, and armor tanks don't need it (imo). hull tanks... well, they're having other issues."
12/25/2009,"no they can't, unless given a lot of time to recharge shields.that would be a very fair compromise."
12/25/2009,"as i said in my previous post, in my experience as a shield tank (sub-capital), i've always been able to fill bonus hp quickly. on an active tank, it only takes one activation of a booster; on a passive tank (i.e. the drake), the recharge rate is still fast enough near 100% capacity to quickly fill the hp.has your experience proven different?"
12/25/2009,"it's hit me that i'm looking at this from primarily a mission runner's perspective--so i'm always tanked to self-repair. a buffered shield tank fit for pvp with no active recharge and no reduction on recharge rate would have to wait it out as you say.i can see how that severely hampers the effectiveness of the buff; especially since it's reapplied every time you jump systems. looking at it that way, i'd support having it auto-fill the hp."
12/25/2009,"shield buffered hacs and bs will usually not have a shieldbooster so they rely on passive recharge only. on capitals, the shield amount boosted is negligeble compared to the total hp so that it doesn't work for them either."
12/25/2009,"however buffer tanks by definiton do better from the enhanced regen rate as that's the core of their defence. also buffer tanks and very high ehp ships like capitals are the least likely to need that instant 10/15% shield bonus as they are very unlikely to be alpha'd. the longer they tank for, the less important that shield bonus becomes and the more important the regen bonus is. by contrast the fast recharging shield tankers who rely on recharge rate and have a small enough shield buffer that a bonus is the difference between being alpha'd and surviving long enough to escape or get repped will regen that bonus very fast and profit from it almost immediately.so again, it's an unnecessary change."
12/25/2009,shield regen rate is basically a non-issue in pvp. people tend to stay a long time in in session in pve. i dont see what the problem is. shields and armour are already balanced with respect to passive regen - that +15% bonus gives me a lot more extra hitpoints from a 1600mm rt than it does from an lse ii.this especially applies to capital ships: the armour tankers get a big boost from gang bonuses; the shield tankers effectively get nothing.
12/25/2009,"no, a buffer tank works by having lots of ehp to start with; the regen rate is irrelevant. a passive tank, which is a very different thing, works on regen rate."
12/25/2009,that's borderline trolling.
12/25/2009,"only if you don't understand the argument.edit: herschel and i just had a long conversation in csm public. i guess i've not been too clear on how i've put my objections forwards. so let me clear it up.the problem that needs fixing is really persistence of bonuses over different sessions, not so much the instant application as that has repercussions at the other end of the scale on passive tanks and smaller stuff. so, if the discussion is about keeping the bonus persistent across sessions so that shild tanking cap pilots aren't disadvantaged in hotdrops etc then fine, i can get behind that."
12/25/2009,hmm well you didn't make much effort to make the argument clear originally. i'd be quite happy for the bonuses to be persistent across sessions; you're correct in that this is the core of the problem.
12/25/2009,"/supportedi dont know and care much about big fleets. i just fly mostly in a 2 men fleet and my squad leader is a siege warfare specialist, with mindlink that gives quite a big boost on my shields.it takes me 2 cycles with a x-large shield booster to fill up the shield. if i dont do that the boost is pretty useless.and of course its depleting my cap significantly to fill up the shields.the annoying thing is, you have to do this every time you jump or dock.so i sign this"
12/25/2009,"in my defence i'm pretty sick at the moment. this means i'm both less clear and more crotchety than usual. apologies to all if i've given offence.the session persistence is the major issue that i see. i wouldn't like to see the original proposal implemented as i believe that would be a big boost to some types of shield tank (such as passive tanks) that don't really need it however i do think that the problem for large buffer tanks needs to be solved.in my opinion this is an engineering issue for ccp to solve, the csm should be pointing out the desired outcome (bonuses persisting across sessions) and not trying to engineer it themselves."
12/25/2009,"that would not be a solution, because bonuses are applied only when the person giving them is in local with you, which when changing sessions is never the case. even if it were, recharging from 72% to 100 takes about 5 hours on titans and motherships, and 1+ hour on carriers and dreads, so the disparity would largely remain.but as promised, some numbers:typical rokh fit, 10625 shields, recharge time 1875s.recharges 0.053% of its shield hp per second.maximum gang bonus of 37.5% shield hp would increase that to 0.073% per second, and it would take approximately 16 minutes to passively recharge from 72% to 100.typical chimera fit, 156250 shields, recharge time 15000srecharges 0.0067% of its shield hp per second.maximum gang bonus of 37.5% shield hp would increase that to 0.0092% per second,and it would take approximately 125 minutes to passively recharge from 72% to 100.typical leviathan fit, 2,808,000 shields, recharge time 36000s.recharges 0.0027% of its shield hp per second.maximum gang bonus of 37.5% shield hp would increase that to 0.00382% per second,and it would take approximately 300 (!!) minutes to passively recharge from 72% to 100.(the shield recharge times are approximations, but should not be far off)this shows how ridiculously long it takes for the passive recharge to become a full bonus, unlike the armour hp, which works instantly."

(+3m)meaning, of course, that you clear a profit for every ship that is lost. no matter how inflationary it is.no matter how unrealistic it is.as long as you get your profit and ships are free.ok, got it. clearly, no convincing you - but merely clarifying your position so people with a sense of game balance will ignore your posts in the future. thanks for playing."

12/25/2009,"the op really just says ""we need a better system"". that's the csm's job: bring issues to the attention of ccp for prioritization, not present detailed design docs.as such, supported."
12/25/2009,"certainly 'static' insurance rates and payouts is inherently simplistic and flawed, though the problem can be solved in multiple ways. really, insurance is a variable-rate isk faucet, and in theory can also act as a sink.think about it - if everybody insured their ships - and none of the ships died before policy expiry - we actually have isk being removed from the system. in reality, insured ships tend to die in combat, but some of them survive and the policy expires. when minerals/ships are expensive, the ship is worth more alive than dead. under these conditions, insurance is an isk faucet, but its not out of control at this point.right now, we have a perverse situation: due to carebear overproduction and lack of demand (except for insurance fraud demand) - minerals are extremely cheap and t1 ships are actually profitable to self-destruct. (because of the static insurance rates.) what does it mean? insurance fraud.the % of 'policies redeemed vs expiry' is approaching 100%. furthermore, the number of policies created is skyrocketing. both of these conditions lead to massive injections of isk into the economy. the 'isk faucet' is now a firehose, supporting a huge population of resource gathererers, which then continue to over-produce minerals.this problem can be solved by either reducing/removing insurance across the board or driving up mineral prices. one or the other needs to happen, though i prefer the latter. but as far as i'm concerned - doing nothing would be a disaster."
12/25/2009,"offering my support. both sides of the issue have valid points, but most important to get this into the csm for discussion and let them find a middle ground that the majority can live with."

12/25/2009,"i don't like the idea of someone spending hours probing and scanning a system to find nobody there. i may not play in lowsec/nullsec areas but i have been the only one in a system a few times -- as a highsec player who has only played for 3 months.

12/25/2009,"account hacking, rmt & character salesfunnily enough, all these things are connected, and they're an issue.in eve online your character name is your identity. reputations are made and broken by the actions and omissions of a character. eve's very basis and its most fundamental game play elements are surrounded by the idea of social networking.ccp have even backed this sentiment up by the public release of their new eden social networking concept at fanfest 2009.whether or not you're a roleplayer, your character develops a reputation and persona due to how you play and the choices you make. in recent years this entire concept has been blurred from black and white, into grey because of character sales and trade that were made legal for in game currency by ccp.sadly other lines have also been blurred, and eve has begun to take on the qualities of many mainstream mmos. the sale of characters has been a thorn in the side of eve online for a long time, in its previous and current forms. out of game wealth is now a factor more than ever for those who play, with members of the community with the financial basis out of game able to farm characters, before selling them on for multi-billion isk profits.it's become more and more of an issue in recent years, and even more recently its also become a tool for those who seek to harm the eve community and its player base. it's become a tool for quick sources of isk for those who supply isk for rmt.these people don't care about you, this game, its community or its success. they care about profit. when their accounts are banned because they're caught stealing a character to sell on for isk to fuel their rmt, they simply create more and move on to the next victim.they care about one thing, real world profit from selling isk. they don't give a **** about who they're selling to or who they're ripping off.account hacking is on the rise, with thousands of us receiving bogus emails and links on a day to day basis for one reason; to capture our account details and steal characters to raise isk for rmt profit.two members of my corporation have now suffered from this, along with countless cases i've heard of where good members of the community have had their characters or corporations cleaned out by these people looking to profit from rmt.if people still feel the need to get ahead using their out of game wealth, they can always resort to selling plex available by redeeming gtc codes, but it's high time that character trading was stopped completely by ccp. the issue is spiralling out of control and causing more and more problems for the gm team with countless petitions that could be stopped with a simple change in policy, allowing the gms to focus on assisting the player base with real game issues.i can guarantee that the vast majority of the community will more than likely be against me here, with only a few seeing the sense in what i'm saying.in short, as a member of the player base i'm asking the csm to raise the sale of characters as an issue with ccp at the next meeting in iceland. rmt is choking eve online, and character sales are a fast and risk free way for those who farm isk to sell to produce more profit.i'm sure that there'll be arguments about ccp not being responsible for account detail security, and users being responsible for the security of their own accounts but people need to realise that not everyone who plays eve is completely technology minded and up to speed with 100% of current events.there are more than enough tools available to build yourself an awesome character rather than resorting to buying one.i expect to be flamed, but what else is new on the csm's forum?while i know that the majority will be against what i'm saying because so many people buy and sell characters, please, for the sake of eve online and its community, see sense, and support this thread."

12/25/2009,i couldn't agree more. i fully support this thread 100%
12/25/2009,"aye, i was goin to buy myself a 2nd char but after all these...support this 100%"
12/25/2009,i agree to this!
12/25/2009,even though i've been massively lucky in the past i still think that doing something about this would be the right way to go for ccp and would better protect the player base as a whole.
12/25/2009,"let me start off by saying that i fully agree that security needs to be improved, i believe it's too easy for someone who has gained access to an account to strip it not only of ingame assets (which is bad enough) but also of the most valuable thing it has which is training time invested in characters.having said that, removing the legitimate trade in characters will simply drive it underground where ccp will have no control over it at all. i believe that to be a bad thing. just like gtcs, having a sanctioned and (theoretically) secure channel to trade characters lessens the influence of shady rmt companies and provides another option for making money ingame for many players.regarding account security, there is only so much that ccp can do to protect you from yourself. yes, i understand that many players are not security conscious and that people do dumb things like put their passwords into random webforms sent by email. short of producing account dongles like blizzard has for wow though, i'm struggling to see how ccp can do more than the end user can to make the account secure. this isn't just ccp's problem to solve, so much revolves around online interactions these days that 'internet literacy' (including security basics) should be just as much a requirement for modern life as the ability to read and write. in other words, people need to be educated and to educate themselves and that isn't entirely ccp's responsibility.tl;dr: yes to improved account security - confirmation mails when personal details change on the account page or when character transfers are requested etc. no to removing the character trade entirely. users are responsible for their own security and they need to educate themselves rather than relying on others to fix the mess afterwards."
12/25/2009,"going to support this. not because i was told to, but because i have always believed there is too much metagaming in eve - online.i've grown accustomed to it over the years, have come to accept the need for alts, especially in my line of work, but i have trained my own alts, with my own money, and my own time.i've always thought character selling/trading was right on the borderline of what should be allowed for metagaming. people should, at the very least, pay for and train their own alts, not purchase them from other people in some barely secure web forum.furthermore, with the recent increase in account hacking and the subsequent selling of the characters hacked, i think it's high time ccp looks into this issue, and shuts down this method for the isk farmers to make income.also, without the character bazaar, ccp's job of administering the e-justice becomes a lot easier. not just for isk sellers, but for people trying to dodge a banhammer for other reasons as well. for all the reasons mentioned above, and also for all the reasons verone mentioned, i support this motion 100%.oh, and i'd just like to make something clear to those that don't get it:you can have your account hacked and your character sold without ever having clicked a keylogger link on the eve-o forums. there are many ways of getting keyloggers installed on your system, and not even running the most paranoid of firewalls/anti-virus/malware software will save you. it is far too easy to compromise a system and get this information. i've taken college courses on the subject, and know how this is done, it's actually quite a simple task to compromise your average system. so don't go thinking ""i'm immune because i'm not ******ed"". it's just stupid talk. take matters into your own hands, players of eve, support this motion, get ccp to realize that this is a huge issue that needs to be dealt with. and the first step is what is suggested above.for everyone else:change your passwords, today. how long has it been since you last changed em? can you type your password from memory? it's probably been too long then. run a system scan or three, just to be sure.good luck, and merry christmas to ccp & the players. a giant lump of flaming dog poo for the dirty isk farmers."

12/25/2009,i couldn't agree more. i fully support this thread 100%
12/25/2009,"would reduce the scope of such trades greatly, anyway. i do believe that forbidding character trade would be for good after all, although it's sort of a mixed case, really. don't belive csm would be able to do anything about this, even if all delegates wanted to. it's not even ingame issue or anything, it's the rules which are set by ccp..."
12/25/2009,hear hear
12/25/2009,completely supported
12/25/2009,i support this idea.
12/25/2009,"i agree, it's getting a bit silly.will this drive the market underground? most assuredly, however there will be much less people willing to get involved with this and it will increase the time significantly in regards to actually getting the character sold. this gives the real account owner much more time to notice that his account has been hacked and for ccp to do something about it.basically they hack an account, sell the characters, and then sell the isk for real cash before ccp comes along and resets the account and the isk. in the end the people who really lose here are the people that bought the ill gotten isk, as it'll get reset to the original owner once ccp takes action. the problem is the real culprit still gets away with the real cash. as long as we can stop them before the cash transaction takes place, they won't have an incentive to do this sort of crap."
12/25/2009,"characters are made through dedication, time and of one's skill - not isk.supported."
12/25/2009,"if ppl started using their bains rather then being mindlless morons that click on every link they find it wouldnt be a issue at all.i see no reason to support this, why punish everyone for the stupidity of the few."
12/25/2009,going to have to say i agree.
12/25/2009,"i can certainly see where you are coming from, being a high-profile player verone, but is abolishing character trading as a whole really necessary to achieve what you are trying to do?- enhance account security with randomized keys, similar to what banks are doing.- add a highly visible entry in employment history with the day of trade.- e-mail verification several days prior to trade. add same type of verification if registered email is changed through website.- etc.removing character trades completely when there are plenty of ways to avoid/minimize id theft still out there makes little sense to me."
12/25/2009,"i don't consider myself a high profile player at all. i like to think i've done my part in assisting making eve a little more enjoyable for the player base with all the evetv and tournament stuff, and the guides and articles in e-on, but in the end it's the people leading major power holding alliances that are the ones who're ""high profile"".remove the incentive, and you remove the problem.granted the situation will never be completely resolved, but those who choose to trade characters do so at their own risk if ccp make the stand to remove character trading. you'll find that 99.9% of people won't bother due to the risk of losing years of work on character development.coupled with this, it removes the incentive for people to have their accounts ripped off to sell their characters, because there's no buyers sat there with tens of billions in easy money that rmt companies can sell on quickly for real life profit before ccp cotton on to to what's happened."
12/25/2009,"voicing my support. haviong had my account hacked before, i'd have hated if mella was sold."
12/25/2009,this is my belief too.
12/25/2009,"i dont agree with selling and buying chars but i totally agree that the login procedure and the security of an account should be more safe.its way to easy to hack somones login and its impossible to make a windows system safe to prevent this. so ccp here has something to do to make the account safer. they are ways to do that.you can use sort of an asymmetric keypair, like pgp is doing that, which can make this login procedure ""pretty good private"" and even if a keylogger is logging the password the account cannot be completly hacked."
12/25/2009,"insurance is broken - you should not be able to purchase a bs, fit it with smartbombs, buy platinum insurance, go gank a hulk and cost someone well over 100 million isk, and make a profit in the bargain when your ship gets destroyed as a result of your action. where's the ""risk-vs-reward"" in that? i'm not against ganking (by all means, gank every macro'r you find!!) - if a target has the potential to pay for replacing your losses, then hit it and kill it. i simply want to make ganking have more risk for the aggressor than it currently does.anything else (such as what we have now) is badly broken. as a ""carebear"", i realize that if i make a mistake and get concorded in a mission, i will also lose my insurance payout. i'm fine with that - it's ""risk-vs-reward"". if i get ganked, and a faction module drops, well, the ganker took a chance, and it worked in his/her favor. no problems there.but fix this thrice-cursed current system."
12/25/2009,"on common carebear cries to ""remove insurance for concord kills and self destruction!"". watching people post this is by far my biggest pet peeve, as it shows that most people have very little understanding of how economic systems work.it sounds good on the surface (at least to the bears) - in much in the same way as calls for 'raising the minimum wage' sounds appealing, but it inevitably leads to more unemployment for the lowest paid workers.actual results?removing insurance for self destruction will accomplish precisely nothing, as there are tons of other ways to artificially kill battleships rapidly and collect the insurance.removing insurance from concord kills 'ie suicide gank nerf', actually aggravates the problem by making carebear 'mineral producers' even safer and more numerous, it reduces combat and legitimate ship destruction further, and leaves insurance in place - so those ships would invariably end up being artificially destroyed outside a manufacturing center, merely for the insurance payout.insurance is simplistic and flawed, yes. if fixing the insurance system is too difficult, however, those flaws become safely hidden if we improve the game by driving up the value of minerals through encouraging a marginal increase in ganking and less mindless resource gathering.not supported."
12/25/2009,"i support this. i've said it in several threads on the topic now, and i'm surprised that i haven't seen other posts noting it (could be my fault for reading through too quickly).anyway, i think the problem is internal logic: it's absurd for concord to blow up my ship and then have its ally, the scc, pay me for the loss. they are in the same bloody alliance.yes, suicide ganking would be impacted by the change, but i think suicide ganking is tangential to the issue, not a direct factor."
12/25/2009,"you got to level 4 missions and didn't know that you can be warp scrambled? ebayed account, or just naive?"
12/25/2009,this also a i would love to have notification to friendlys as to what are your fleet members doing as far as ew to enemies. who is jamming painting who if he has cycle or not would make coordination of ew for fc much easier.
12/25/2009,all you need to do is to drag your overview window wide enough (or make the columns narrow enough) that there's a small bit of blank space down the right hand side. et voila! no more visibility problems.
12/25/2009,seriously..... it's not an issue.sure it could be made more apparent... but i never had a problem with it.
12/25/2009,"last time i checked the call for shooting things in lvl 4s was points and ewar and then dps then everything else....so why on earth you weren't looking for the ships pointing you is beyond me.not a problem, adapt or die well you already did die but still you get my point"
12/25/2009,"erm, re-read the op. it's not about letting newbies directly on the forums - just allowing access to the api backend. many of us create new chars as cyno alts and whatnot - having the ability to load them into evemon directly and plan their training most efficiently seems like a smart thing, no?"
12/25/2009,totally agree.

12/25/2009,"this post makes me want an ""oppose"" option for this forum sooo bad."
12/25/2009,"a) if someone scammed you, it was an alt, and they aren't going to leave jita 4-4. so, you'd be wasting your isk anyway. b) if someone stole ships and isk from your corp, they probably had another corp lined up to take them, or they are selling the character, and so you won't actually be wardeccing them. just the poor sod who they sold the character to.in summary, short of busting into the person's house, holding a gun to his head, and forcing him to undock and fight you, you won't get your revenge unless he's a complete idiot, no matter the system you introduce. in which case: congratulations! you were outwitted by an idiot."
12/25/2009,"first, i'm not being snarky - just can't tell if your serious or not. back in 2004 eve was just like that.eve topped out at (roughly) 30k subs, and 10k online at once... often times as few as 5 to 8k concurrent users...there is a dev-blog somewhere (i can't remember where) that showed/explained/stated that eve became financially viable at 50k subs.ccp has been limiting, segregating, controlling and directing pvp for the last 5 years. instituting hi/low/0 sec space, concord, war-decs nerf, lofty nerf, etc., etc., in an effort to increase subs. have they gone too far? vov i don't know. however, if they did take concord out, i would probably set some cap skills training and just wait it out...removing concord would result in a metric krap-tonne of people not un-docking, setting long skills training, and checking the forums for when the rollback would take place, if they even bothered keeping their subscription active."
12/25/2009,"sorry to disappoint you, but its already been addressed:"
12/25/2009,"yeah, we're definitely not advocating the removal of concord. that would basically be chaos and i agree with your estimations of the impact (i.e. people never undocking). it just seems like the proposed everyone-can-be-a-wardec-target idea creates an environment that isn't too far off from that."
12/25/2009,up from page 5 to support my own idea.
12/25/2009,err you really couldnt read the release notes?just in case you cant find it: right click on the white triangle next to your speed display -> show zoom buttonsnothing to support here. lets move to the next thing.
12/25/2009,"besides what previous poster said, how is it cumbersome and clumsy for laptop users? i basicly always play on laptop, usually without using a mouse, and never had any issues with zooming, just press both mouse button and move a bit arround on touchpad."
12/25/2009,"hmmm, i didn't notice that. however, the functionality doesn't seem to work as it once did. instead of zooming in and out to general preset distances, it just moves the camera one small increment in or out. this is hardly practical.answered your own question."
12/25/2009,"as a trader and industrialist who still only makes a few adjustments a day, i don't understand the purpose of this proposal, other than to reduce competitiveness in the marketplace.what problem do you want to solve here?"
12/25/2009,penalize those who just sit on market orders and adjust them down by 0.01 isk ten seconds after you've put up an order.it would advantage those who put up orders and actually let them run for a little while and go off to do other things beside try to hold the botspot on every item in existance.

12/25/2009,"dear all, i would like to raise awareness of problems with sov structures during the past few weeks. my alliance recently encountered the difference in online time and actual description of the sov blocker unit, and a petition to ccp was opened when our tcu became vulnerable within the 6 hour described time before the 1.03 patch.problems have arisen with the petition and i feel this should be made public as to get other peoples opinions when dealing with these problems.the initial post to ccp read it took 4 days for a response, after posting another request for feedbackafter this post i got a response, they asked for teh system name, which was given and then no more replys for about 4-5 days gm correspondence removed, as per the forum rules.steviesgremember this was before the 1.03 patch which changed the description. we had no idea that the actual time was 3 hours, instead of the described 6. capitals were used as i felt annoyed by this statement. it was possibly unfair to use this tone, however we wanted compensation. we didn't want a refund of our deathstar pos, nor the ships we lost in the defense of it. it was a game mechanic advertised wrongly, thus we felt we should get a refund of monies lost buying our tcu.gm correspondence removed, as per the forum rules.steviesgreally now. so i dug up the patch notes to send back. apologies for the wall of text, but i think this should be a matter disclosed for public discussion. as this affects more than one player during this time, have their been any other corps who have been blighted by this ninja game mecahnic change and the stubbornness of gm's not addressing the issue, i would like to raise this with the council for public discussion. we just want the tcu refunded. not the countless millions we lost in defense of it, or the po"
12/25/2009,nvm
12/25/2009,"ah well yes it might look a little cluttered right now. this is because i run on a 1600x900 resolution and wanted to make sure it could be viewable by all so i decreased it to almost half. having to scale down the tabs since they can't be deactivated making it all look cluttered.however since most people's screens are wider than taller imo it would be better to expand it to the sides. also if all these functions were implemented you would only need one screen which could cover your entire screen, or most of it."

(fine to know i've got over 75 days of paid time on both accounts, but didn't want to pay for it all in one go)this could well be a big issue as i've got to pay for my car tax this week, and i'm also going away for a short holiday half way through january, so effectively being conned out of nearly <U+FFFD>60 is a potential disaster.please fix this problem with the website."
12/25/2009,"i had my credit card compromised and new one issued. i went to update my credit card info so that the next payment would be processed on the active card and found the same thing of being charged the full subscription amount, which in my case is 6 months.updating billing information shouldn't initiate a full charge of your regular subscription length."

12/25/2009,"okay. i thought i must've missed something since no one else responded to the post, but i have been under the impression ccp reps are supposed to be there to discuss the issues as well... in any case, i'll second the ""gj on the minuted td"" :)"

12/25/2009,ah okay. thanks.
12/26/2009,"i'll only support this if it applies only to outside of alliance/corp logisticsthose in the same alliance/corp should be freely allowed to give each other reps without incurring an agression flag. if you put this into place across the board it will effectively kill the ability to roam in rr gangs (in low-sec at least). not only will it affect your ability to travel but also it will force a rr gang into committing 100% into a fight with no possible withdrawal options.let's look at a hypothetical scenario..you're roaming in a 10 man rr battleship gang with your corp/alliance mates and your scout finds a hostile fleet of equal or larger numbers camping a gate. your fc decides to engage said gang. initially it's all joy and roses as you're easily able to tank the hostile gang and begin to take then down.then the hostiles decide to bring in more ships or they decide to hotdrop capitals into the fray (yes it happens a lot). now things aren't looking so rosey and you're unable to do significant damage to the opposing fleet so your fc decides to give the order to deagress.while you're in your cooldown period from deagression, you still need to keep each other alive but.. oh shiiii we've all got an agression timer now and can't even consider jumping though the gate to at least save some of (hopefully most of) our asses and we're all now doomed to lose our ships because eventually we'll sucumbe to the onslaught.now please don't take this as a whine because it's not. i'm merely pointing out just 1 of many hypothetical situations where an across the board agression timer for logistics would pretty much kill any chance of an already hard to find good fight.feel free to flame me unconditionally if i'm totally wrong here of course, but as far as i can tell, a lot of you guys supporting this aren't really looking at the larger picture of pvp and gang warfare in genaral.spas"
12/26/2009,agreed.as the original post is put up i'm not gonna support it.
12/26/2009,"anyone who doesn't support this in all likelyhood partakes in neutral repping, which is a cheap part of the game that pretty much shouts ""i'm a coward!"""
12/26/2009,"you guys need to think this through before voting for this. at the moment it is not easy to know how many actually choose to recativate accounts for this purpose, but i am one of them.still, you may say that it deflates value of datacores. this is true, but you are forgetting the fact that the price of t2 stuff is still going up atm and the datacores costs alot(they can take some more deflation imho). and if this is implemented they will reach an all time high.give it some thought."
12/26/2009,yet why should you get the benefit of an account that you're not paying for?
12/26/2009,not saying you should. im just saying what the results of such a change would be.edit; leave space for people to find text!
12/26/2009,if your not paying for the account... you have no business exploiting an game mechanic.market prices are frakked as it is because of the exploitation and anything else you can think of that people shouldn't be doing. it isn't an excuse to allow it to continue.for you to even dare defend such a thing proves this is a larger problem than you claim it not to be.
12/26/2009,"right, lets try to have an intelligent discussion.your first point; if your not paying for the account... you have no business exploiting an game mechanic.i agree with this, apart from the fact that you call it an exploit. it has been like this since 2003.your second point; market prices are frakked as it is because of the exploitation and anything else you can think of that people shouldn't be doing. it isn't an excuse to allow it to continue.what? allowing this particular thing to continue will allow the prices to remain as they are, stopping it would create a massive increase in t2 prices that would ""frakk"" the market.your third point; for you to even dare defend such a thing proves this is a larger problem than you claim it not to be.at the moment the market would suffer more from changing the current mechanic(broken or not) than it would benefit from it. so yes, i am defending it. have you even seen the t2 ship prices lately?darax thulain."
12/26/2009,"darax,i dont think the markets are a fragile as you make them out to be. lets say this proposal goes through and the exploit gets fixed. you could still maintain your datacore income by simply paying for those accounts every month like everyone else. or, lets say you (the greater you of people that do this) choose to fight back by not paying for your accounts and attempt to crash the t2 / invention market. a temporary vacuum will be created that will be immediately filled by entrepreneurs.i envision things will go like this: ccp announces the end of ghost datacore production. all accounts like yours become active and cash in to avoid losing the cores you have already accumulated. a small but temporary decrease in t2 prices result as the market is flooded. those flood stocks will eventually run low, increasing demand. active players will notice this and rush in to fill this demand and their wallets. the markets will again stabilize, healthier than before, thanks to active producers supplying a steady stream of cores rather than a group of individuals dumping thousands of cores into the market on an annual basis.another way to look at it: if you choose to not keep your accounts active then you could always sell the characters on the forums for another isk windfall to people that will keep them active and producing cores.as always, feedback and discussion is appreciated.edit: just because this loophole has been around since 2003 is no reason for it to continue. our goal should be to make this a more fair / balanced game."
12/26/2009,"@ vod****.well, you do make alot of sense. as far as prediction goes this one is as good as any. but since i am one that have made numerous r&d alts i can at least attest that this isnt something you do overnight, and the market would not be ""immediately"""
12/26/2009,"darax,i appreciate you arguing the other side of this issue. it has given me some valuable insight on the potential results of its passage.to pick your brain a little further: if this measure is passed and implemented, what would your likely course of action be with your datacore accounts. although its a given that any market speculation at this point would just be a shot in the dark, lets say datacore prices were to increase. would this influence you to keep those accounts active and reap the rewards? or would you find it more viable to just move on and sell the accts (legally) or let them sit unused?at this point im just trying to gain more info on the results / impact of this issue on characters (like you) and the markets.vod"
12/26/2009,"market results? easy enough.if all unsubbed accounts used to farm datacores where subbed because of this change prices would remain at roughly the same level. there may a slight decrease at first- from ppl cashing in their datacores all at once. but over a period of time the price would stabilize back to their ""normal"" levels. the accounts that are left to die would be replaced with new datacore farmers."
12/26/2009,"it all depend on your definition of pvp.gatecamping is pvp? the shield regen rate help a lot while armor buffer tankers need the help of repair drones from other people.sieging a pos without a gunner? again the reg rate help a lot while armor tankers need rrroaming gang? sure the shield thing suck there as you are jumping to another system every few minutesthey have different advantages. i repeat, if you want istant regeneration after each jump you must pay losing the extra regeneration over time. one or the other, not both.oh look. lots of hp (one of the requisites to have lots of ehp) mean you have a good regeneration rate and having them boosted increase that regeneration rate."
12/26/2009,"ehm, no, the recharge % stay the same, the hp recharged change. so, taking your typical fit numbers for granted:10625 shields, recharge time 1875s, recharge 5,66+ per secondwith bonus 14.608 and 7,79 hp/s156250 shields, recharge time 15000s, recharge 10,41+ per secondwith bonus 214.843 and 14,32 hp/s2,808,000 shields, recharge time 36000s, recharge 780 per secondwith bonus 3.861.000 and 1.072,5 hp/sso if you don't want to lose the bonus regeneration and want istant hp the other solution is that armor link should give a bonus to armor reppers beside the armor hp."
12/26/2009,"i could say the same to you....the ehp buff only arrives after the shield has regenerated itself, which on a bs can take a good 10-15 minutes, and on a cap it probably wont regen before you get bored and log. so basically if your moving around in a fleet and jump into an enemy gang, you want all of your bonuses applied instantly to gain max ehp, but with the shield one you dont gain the hitpoints before the fights over."
12/26/2009,"first, i find it unnecessary to arbitrarily reduce shield regeneration rate if applying the proposed solution. by the very examples sokratesz and you provided, such a detriment would not even be significant. we're talking about reducing a percentage of .053% to an even smaller number. adding the shield hp immediately upon receiving the bonus would not enable the recharge rate to be an overwhelming factor for any of the ship-examples provided.second, there are already warfare links which provide bonuses to armor repairers. the proposed change addresses the perceived problem that shield hp bonuses are at a disadvantage to armor hp bonuses at a level which causes imbalance. if you upgrade the shield hp bonus to pursue balance, why is it necessary to add a bonus to armor repairers, thus re-creating the imbalance?"
12/26/2009,"supporting the original idea proposed by sokratesz in this thread. i'm tired of newbs asking me why they just took some damage when they join my fleets. the newbs are right; they shouldn't receive damaged shields as a bonus for being in fleet, and even newbs know it.-not supporting all the bickering and faulty logic thrown up by the opposition in this thread."
12/26/2009,the bonus is good as is.
12/26/2009,"so to sum it up, you want both advantages for 1 shield shield link but nor for 1 armor link?if the 37,5% increase in recharge rate is not important, you can shed it without problem and in exchange get the shield buff immediately.if it is important so you don't want to give a similar advantage (not a 37,5% bonus to active repping, note, but a bonus that give a comparable passive repair or a bit larger active repair bonus) to armor buffing links you have and advantage (bonus recharge rate) in exchange to a disadvantage (not immediate buffing of hp).you can chose one or the other, not both. btw: the title of the theread is ""shield gang bonuses should be applied just like armor ones"" and it is exactly what i am suggesting.you get the immediate hp increase but lose the shield regeneration bonus."
12/26/2009,"all the arguments about the shield regeneration are ridiculous- if your shields arent passive tank fit then it doesnt matter.but how about this as a solution.since shields dont ""fill up"" the potential max is increased do the same to armor.instead of ""filling up"" the armor- increase its potential max. they would need to rep up to enjoy the benefits. then armor tankers would be on an more even playing field in regards to fleet bonuses."
12/26/2009,"just had loot stolen again.now ccp may i ask how difficult it was to make:cans belonge to the one who drops it.npc wrecks belonge to the one who started the mission.make a wreck flag free for all (and if you get concorded because of a suicide run, make the suicideganker wreck free for all)must be difficult to programm a solution to our problem."

12/26/2009,"actually, i debate it, at least in the long term. remember that while insurance provides a floor to mineral and ship prices, it also provides a ceiling. most larger t1 ships tend to hover around insurance profit plus or minus 1% for those ships which can be produced cheaper. with that incentive gone, shipbuilders are going to leave the large t1 game. removing insurance would, long term, drive up prices on large t1 ships while driving down low end mineral prices. the net result is new players make less while older players make more. the truth is that a player willing to accept the boredom of mass suiciding himself can make 1-2mil per battleship buying off the market. the builder supplying him can make perhaps 3-5% but to produce in quantity requires considerable time, effort and seed capital. as a relatively new player with only nine figures in my account i can't see how the high end of that equation is especially meaningful. the low end, though, serves only to accelerate the new players. if someone has 1bil to buy a bpo at market, puts the time into researching it to proftability, makes the effort to collect the materials and find factory slots he can burn 24/7 for weeks i don't see how a profit of roughly .5mil/hr/slot (based on four hour per ship production) is going to be a big deal. maybe if there was a way to bid for factory slots. . ."
12/26/2009,how it is now: payout = (2 * premium) + (basevalue * 0.4)how it can be: payout = (2 * premium)i think removing the 40% unconditional payout while leaving the double premium compensation alone would be what the majority can live with. it would require the ship's market value to be 30% of base value to break even with insurance instead of the current 70% of base value. i don't see ship prices dropping that low in the foreseeable future.
12/26/2009,"my only problem with the idea of modifying the base payout in any way is that right now t1 ships and by extension their components are pegged to insurance plus or minus 1%. the more you believe that overproduction for suicide is propping prices up, the more true this is. if 10% of the ships constructed are sold as suicides no insurance change in any direction will change much else. if 90% of battleship production is for suicide then changing insurance rates will directly change the prices those builders are willing to pay for minerals so they can still make suicide ships. raise payouts, mineral prices go up, directing more filthy lucre from the mega-rich mass suicide builders to the newb miners. lower payout and you won't change the big boys' balance sheet much, but you will change the new guys'. an alternate theory is that there is a magic number below which the big boys will stop. in that case they'll probably stop building ships entirely, raising the price on a bs even as the mineral prices plummet."
12/26/2009,"i prefer having a single char that can do it all, however i can see how this would lessen log out/in hassle for others (and less load for login related servers?)."
12/26/2009,"a simple alpha layer to control colors of certain parts of the ship shouldn't cause much load because the base skin texture is still the same on all ships, doubt it would increase lag either since the extra data here is simply rgb codes.afaik this is what is already done between all variations of a ship. someone correct me with facts if this is untrue.also this would be a fine isk sink as well."
12/26/2009,they're all minmatar anyway. just sell them at a minmatar station and let their fellow republicans free them or eat them or whatever it is they do to each other.
12/26/2009,"confirming my support for this.. please ccp look at the ideas and concerns of us the players who are making faction warfare our end game.. a lot of very very good ideas in the various threads, take a look, or at least let us know if you have plans for fw throw us a bone ccp please :)"

12/26/2009,"verone, i sympathise with your sentiments, but i fear the law of unintended consequences will come in to play here.at the moment, with santioned, legitimate character sales, there is at least some recourse. banning legal character sales will just drive more people in to the arms of the rmters.the answer is improved options account security, a ""cooldown"" period on character sales, and maybe even an option to 'lock' a character to an account for a specified period."
12/26/2009,"supporting this topic for my brosef, verone"
12/26/2009,"in my opinion, what they really need to do is secure the login system:the primary email on the account should not be changed without gm intervention.- the method of changing the primary email on the account needs to be made as secure as possible to prevent unauthorized changes.multiple (>=3) failed login attempts need to be forwarded to the primary account email with:- 1. ip address of the person trying to login- 2. region (country, state, city)- 3. partial password (half of it or so)the last successful login should be displayed when logging in, including the ip address and region.players should be able to opt-in to a region lock to only allow an account to login from a particular region. player can configure countries, states, cities that logins are allowed from.logins that violate these conditions would alert the account owner and deny the logon.any changes to the account (including character transfers) will require an email to be dispatched to the primary email to confirm the changes.disabling account transfers won't stop rmt or account hacking. both of these were problems before ccp decided to put in the transfer system.account hacking can be fought by implementing new security measures.rmt can be fought by pro-actively going after isk sellers in the game and ruthlessly banning farming accounts before they have the ability to generate large amounts of isk.hacking being on the rise is a sign to me that they are having a hard time generating billions of isk from farming because ccp is going after them, so they are resorting to hacking to make up for the losses. now that they are fighting rmt more it's probably time to fight the account hacking by implementing some security measures for the 21st century.i don't support disabling character transfers because in my opinion, it won't fix anything by itself. if they just disable character transfers, they can still take the account and clean out the assets and isk, leaving the player penniless. they still win.where as if they secure the logon systems more, it'll protect the accounts from their stuff being taken and prevent unauthorized character transfers.but i see where you're coming from and i'm fairly sure your overall goal is, less hacked accounts."
12/26/2009,"i'll be the veto. outcast and go against what seems to be the grain here. hahi've made for too much isk over the last 5 years from selling off old toons i get tired of/have no use for to endorse this.however. if this thread were simply about beefing up security in some way. longer passwords, req of more complex passwords, log in forms that firefox/ie can't retain credentials for, i would fully endorse it.<3 to the fascist dictator and those in the family that have recently had accounts hacked. i just don't see quite eye to eye with many regarding this."
12/26/2009,agree with this...so...signed
12/26/2009,"supported, good arguments were put forward."
12/26/2009,"pretty obvious that account hacking is on the rise. verone's idea at least represents a soft counter to the bs that's been taking place regarding this issue, which is definitely better than nothing. hopefully some sort of solution will come out of this if nothing else, and hopefully the devs realize what's going on and do something to correct it.i have made use of the character sale program before and in theory it's nice, but i'm not thrilled at the thought of my personal information being hacked over an online video game just so someone can make a few bucks. i would prefer having account security over the ability to make some extra isk on the side or buy an alt any-day.thread has my support."
12/26/2009,"no issue here, the scrambler notification on the overview is perfectly clear (unless you havent turned it on, in which case you're kinda dumb and should fix that)."
12/26/2009,"indeed, one of the first things you tell a nub is to get evemon and play around with skill plans."
12/26/2009,"plain and simple, after you kill someones ship there drones unlock you.i remember reading the game mechanics correctly and drones are controlled by a players ship so if the ship is no longer present then should the drones unlock the target they were shooting at.i call for this because having just lost my arazu i only lost it because after my fleet and i had killed the ishtar we all started wrapping off. i couldn't cloak because the ishtar's drones were still locked onto me even after we'd killed the ishtar. his m8s came in and were able to get a point on me before i could warp away.i wouldn't of died had i'd just been able to cloak up."
12/26/2009,"i agree, seems that would make sense seeing how they are controlled by the ship hence is ship is gone the drones become (should) inactive."

12/26/2009,they play the game. they put psychological pressure on the people in the system. or they gather intel. all playing.dont fix what aint broken. god all the whining lately :s
12/26/2009,"i knew there would be some one who fails to read. i am a cloak user. i do collect intel. i do cloak in a system and gank their miners or ratters. how is that whining? i rather enjoy how easy it is. heck, i can get kills while eating dinner, watching a movie, or cleaning house. its easy. but...is afk sitting in a system really playing? and the main point, was the risk. where is the risk? you sit invulnerable for as long as you want. ok...what do you risk for your reward? and if you say ""i risk getting baited"" well pick your targets better, every one risks getting baited.just saying, i love cloaking up. but afk cloakers...are lame. and i am guilty of it myself. projectile guns werent broke, but we fixed them. (in some peoples opinions). nano didnt need to be nerfed by a lot of other peoles opinions. i use cloaks, and im against unlimited time for cloaking. thats all."
12/26/2009,"risk is only half the equation. the other half is reward. where's the reward? if its in spooking the in-systenm players then you have to count your entry to and exit from the systems into that ratio. as a covops pilot, i know how risky those two points can be and feel they cover the reward. in fact, i would say your risk/reward ratio is worse than a well-tanked afk/macro miner."
12/26/2009,"and of course you're always vulnerable to the ratter/miner who pays attention and is on comms. you're in 0.0, you should have friends."
12/26/2009,"2 cloakers in local and miners cant do anything anymore, no matter how much attention they pay. cloakers never have to pay any attention and are completely safe and can risk free gank the miners if they would be stupid enough to continue mining."
12/26/2009,"ratters are absolutely fine. even miners can work if they pay attention. mining with potential hostiles in system may be a bit difficult given that you need to watch d-scan constantly, but that's a problem with mining barges (a bit too slow/weak on buffer) than with afk cloaking."
12/26/2009,"how exactly do you see a cloaker on d-scan? they come in, drop bombs, you lose your hulks, nothing you can do against it. (and the chance a ratting ship, or worse someone doing anomaly, surviving 2 sbs before help arrives is also very small)."
12/26/2009,"hulks against a couple afking sbs? you probably have a point, but that's a problem with hulks.what kind of failfit ratting ship do you use that dies to a solo bomber? if he's in point range, you can put drones on him. if you can put drones on him, he's dead. or, if you can call in friends, he's dead. if your ratting ship can't survive that long, then get a better ship for the job."
12/26/2009,"which part of two did you not grasp? and have you actually ever tried in a ratting ship (or worse again, anomalies) against a non-failfit sb? it can take you out before your light drones kill it."

12/26/2009,"eve is a game of risk vs reward. and i love this game for that. however, i was sitting cloaked in a enemy system for a few hours, scouting the activity in my pilgrim. then i logged off, went to the cinema, came back, and logged back in and started watching activity again.then it hit me....where is my risk in this? i sit there, and logging off in a safe spot makes me invincible. no one can scan me down, no one can probe me down, and i will never log back in or risk anything unless i want to. this does not seem like the eve i love.so, im sure this as come up before, but why not have logging off require fuel of some sort? give it a long like say...5 minute cycle time (which you can cancel mid cycle), and have it cost 50 units of fuel. there is plenty of room on those ships to carry enough for hours of logging off. but this would also prevent logging off in systems, and force pilots to actually be in the game at some point.i understand the common arguement of ""logged off ships are weaker if they engage"". yes...i know. but thats if they engage. and, with fuel you can still log off for a couple hours and do everything you normally would, but not for a day or two at a time. the only thing this would effect, is it would put a little cap on the perma afk of logged off ships. because i thought ccp wanted peopel to actually play the game...not sit logged off with no risk to their ships. does not seem very eve like to me. and i do it!"

12/27/2009,"the ""magic number"" you speak of is obtained by pegging the net insurance value of the the ship to slightly below the mineral value at the time the ship is insured. thus at any given time, it will always pay someone better to sell or reprocess a ship than it will to insure it just to suicide it. it will never be worth building of ships just to suicide them, because the net payout will be less than the cost of the minerals you used to build it.if you peg the net payout at, say, 90% of the mineral cost, the effect on player who use the ship 'normally' will be fairly minimal. without the artificial price floor, the market will be able to set a true value to minerals, and prices will probably fall. i reckon by at least 30%. this means that a tier 1 bs will probably sell for around 40m isk. given that it costs about 20-40m to t2 fit a bs, increasing the post-insurance cost to 24-44m isn't really going to make a big difference to most people's willingness to use them. even if prices stay the same, we're looking at 25.5 - 45.5m instead of 20-40m."

12/27/2009,totally agreecigi
12/27/2009,"i agree and disagree with the suggestions here. first off i 100% agree that character sales need to be more secure. i've done two now myself and it's odd for me to say this, but i really did think it was almost too fast and too easy. this makes it very easy for these hackers to steal toons from their rightful owners.i also agree that your reputation and persona, is wrapped up in your character. even though i've bought a toon before, it does bug me a bit that it can be so easy to wash your hands of one character and put your self in another with no real draw backs.a) i'll state out a few issues i see with the current proposal and arguments for the removal of character sales. 1) hacking of accounts, was going on long before this current rise in attacks. i myself had an account hacked but luckily the only thing they did was change the training que and i received the account back after about a week or so. i was lucky and had no real assets on that account. stopping character sales, will not stop the hacking as there isn't much ccp can do to stop someone else's computer from being violated. adding to this the hacker has access to the persons computer which will allow him to check e-mail accounts and so on in many cases.2) if you look at any other mmo, they all have these same problems as far as i know. if people can't sell their toon in a legitimate way, they will sell them via a black market which will likely be controlled by the very hackers we are dealing with today.lets not forget, rmt and toon sales is a very big business, when you figure these groups are doing this very thing to many other games and not just eve. these guys are making millions of dollars a year doing this stuff which means they wont stop just because ccp bans character sales, it will just move even further underground and pull the player base to them. right now even though it's not as secure as it ""should"" be, at the very least ccp has control of the market on the sales. i'd much rather them have control and work on making things more secure than just ban it and turn the entire market over to the hackers and rmt'ers.b) now i'll toss in a few solutions that i think might help this proposal. i do think something needs to be done for the various reasons many have posted already.1) i think we shouldn't actually be able to simply sell the ""reputation and persona"" as verone has mentioned. i see this as the major draw back in character sales. not to mention 90% of the character's for sale have crappy names. the solution to this, would be that only the ""skill set"" should be sold. this would mean you could still effectively sell the time you have invested but not your actual toon. it would also be safer because if theft did occur, the toon would be in place and only require the skill sheet to be replaced.doing a ""skill sheet"" transfer, would mean each toon created would remain in the original owners hands, until he decided to terminate that toon. this would mean that you would keep your own history and others simply couldn't just buy another players game history.this would mean that the market could still stay alive and players that haven't been in game since beta could still get access to decent skill sets if they could afford them.there are of course advantages and disadvantages to what i've suggested, but even from a rp view, it should be more reasonable to do than actually buying the entire toon. i will add to this that as a early 09 player and noob to the game, the training time is very discouraging at times. i can't do anything to make my toon train faster other than skills and implants. even that is really not enough when you look at how long a basic skill plan can be. meanwhile i do make enough isk, that i can afford to buy a older toon. there are of course many like me which means the market will always be there. because of this i really think ccp is doing the right thing by controlling it. we just need it to be safer.."
12/27/2009,"one thing did cross my mind, it's certainly not a solution to the problem but could certainly ease the burden on ccp and the targeted original account holder.i'm wondering how practical it would be for ccp to offer those of us who have no intention of selling our characters the option of 'opting in' to a minimum period of 'non transfer' maybe 3 or 6 months at a time.while admittedly the hacked characters assets would still be at risk, there would be some form of comfort in the fact that the 'non transferable' character can not be sold.i'm just thinking out loud really"

12/27/2009,"the drake is perhaps one of the most loved and demised ships in eve. in my opinion, it is among the finest ships in the caldari line up. it holds the distinction of being the only non-faction ship with 7 launcher hard points. it also holds the distinction of having the smallest cargo hold of any other ship intended to field heavy or heavy assault missiles as its main weapon.i recall during the last alliance tournament that one drake apparently ran out of ammo. the commentators even laughed. i did a little research on all the missile ships in its same weapon class. what i found is that the drake cargo hold is lacking not only to other bcs hulls but to cruiser hulls as well.it is also worth noting that, despite popular belief, heavy missiles are the largest medium charges in the game. heavy missile charges have a volume of .03 m3 (more than 2x the volume of medium projectile charges at .0125 m3) despite this fact, even minmatar projectile ships have larger holds, though their ammo takes up less m3. here are the numbers: battle cruiser hull:ship / missile slots / cargo hold: drake / 7/ 345 nighthawk/ 6/ 700damnation/ 5/ 645*hurricane/ 3/ 475*cyclone/ 3/ 475*claymore/ 3/ 475*sleipnir/ 3/ 475(*note the consistency across all minmatar battle cruisers and commands)let's look at smaller hulls:cruiser hull:ship/ missile slots/ cargo hold: cerberus/ 5/ 650sacrilege/ 5/ 615broadsword/ 3/ 452caracal/ 5/ 450onyx/ 5/ 450stabber/ 2/ 420vagabond/ 2/ 360*curse/ 4/ 345 (same as drake)is tere any reason for this insane gimping? i am aware of the fact that some of the above ships are often fitted with cap charges, but that does not account for the obvious unbalance of these ships when compared to the drake. deciding to fit a cap charger is an option. drake should have no less cargo capacity than any of the above named ships. it is apparent to me that it should be boosted at lease to the same level as nighthawk. it does after all have more missile hard points."

12/27/2009,yeah guys! boost drake it sucks!not supported. post above me clearly illustrates why.
12/27/2009,"i love my drake, i cross trained from minny to fly it, it's better than my cane and that's no mean statement. that said, drake needs no buff, it's cargo is plenty, comparing it to command ships is stoopid. it may have 7 seven launchers but that does not qualify it for a bigger hold than everyone else, it's a balance. if a smaller hold is the downside to seven launchers i'll take it every day and twice on sundays.not supported"
12/27/2009,2 words... cargohold expander.
12/27/2009,as much as i respect your oppinion normally but you should be shot for that suggestion.:pthough i dont see the drake's cargohold as much of a problem. 11500 heavies last a while (roughly 2.8h with cn hml/almost 3 with t2 hml not taking reloads into account and you would be firing constantly). thats plenty of ammo if you ask me.
12/27/2009,supported drake has too little cargo bay for its ammo need
12/27/2009,"dear sir, you did not read my post. i compared the hold of ships intended to use heavy missiles and/or projectile charges because those are the highest volume charges. it is common for ships that use missiles or projectiles to have larger cargo holds.laser and hybrid focused ships typically have smaller cargo holds (as you pointed out) in fact your list further proves my point. drake cargo hold is more comparable to that of a laser or hybrid focused ship. it should not be. it is as it the person who designed the drake was preoccupied and simply treated it like a hybrid ship when it came time to give it cargo m3.all of the minmatar bc / cs are split weapon platforms and have generally the same number of missile and turret hard points. they use the second largest charge (projectile) as their main weapon, and the largest charge (heavy missile) as a secondary weapon. they should have the large cargo holds they have. drake should have no less.nighthawk has the largest hold of all bc hulls (700 m3) precisely because it has 6 launcher hard points. this is balanced around the need to fit more missiles. did i mention that heavy missiles are .03 m3? therefore, how is it that the drake with 7 launchers hard points only has 345 m3?please revisit this match at7 day 6 -hun reloaded vs the wrong alliance fast forward to about 12:30 in the vid. the drake runs out of ammo!! it almost cost his team the match. listen to the commentators give color. read the comments on the youtube post. that should be a pretty clear picture. they lambast the pilot for running out of ammo. now you should see what may have caused this.so you are saying that the way to solve the issue is to fit a short ranged ammo? what if the engagement calls for long ranged ammo? please refrain from posting if you have nothing of value to add."
12/27/2009,"from a functional point of view, rather than comparative to other ships, i don't think any increase is necessary. the fastest base rate of fire on a launcher is 10.50s on the caldari navy and dread guristas launchers. suppose we take that and give it bonuses to an arbitrary number of 8.0s. if firing non-stop, that results in: 7.5 missiles per minute and 450 missiles per hour. this is per launcher, so times seven means 3150 missiles per hour--not accounting for reload time.the drake can hold 345m3; at .03m3, that's 11,500 heavy missiles.if fully-filled, the drake would have to fire non-stop for at least three hours to empty its cargo of missiles. that's plenty of space."

12/27/2009,/agreed
12/27/2009,"i'd imagine any drones have ai in them, just like today's uav's. to me it makes sense that they work autonomously based on the target orders given from controlling ship, so the comms link to drone is open only when issuing new orders, rest of the time it works autonomously. for example when the controller ship is destroyed the drones stay to perform given task.drones should stay to perform the given task even if the controller ship warps out but would stop after the current objective (attack order) is fulfilled (target destroyed or escaped) and stay put to wait for new orders.new breed of drones would be a logical step (tech 3 hello?), ones that have built in ai so they keep attacking anything hostile and escort anything friendly once controller link has been lost. this would obviously fubar fleet fights with more server load bandwidth wise."
12/27/2009,"not supported. kill the drones or the drones will kill you. they are are a unique weapon in that you can completely disable the offensive capability of drone-focused ships by destroying their drones. just as a final volley of missiles will still do damage and a bomb will still explode after its controller pops, it's important to keep in mind the fight is not over until all threats are eliminated."

12/27/2009,"i don't really see a problem here. obviously your're a bad miner! ok lemme be nice and support this. i've ninja mined with an orca and a hulk in wh space. on a laptop, on the bus! so there i was sitting with two accs mining in wh. when a bloody falcon appears. lucky me i was aligned so when he uncloaked both my ship warped off to a ss and took defensive measures. like cloaking! - see no problem!and honestly. if you loose a hulk to a bomb, you're doing it wrong! if you pay attention, there's no ship that can kill you while ratting/mining. there's no shame in warping away, honestly. if there's two cloaky in system, spread out. or gather up in a great pile of aligned hulks. and btw, there's an extremy useful command in fleet for protecting a fleet. it's called ""regroup"", it's like warp gang, but this time the gang alignes to you, so when you press warp gang, evryone warp out! this you can control a minor army of hulks versus nasty bombers and evil arazous. learn to pay attention, learn to use fleet commands. and yes, this does force you to play the game. or is that the problem? that your jealous of being forced to play the game while mr cloaky goes to the cinema. if that's the case you don't belong in nullsec nor lowsec. i've lived in all three. i never lost a ratting/mining ship while mining/ratting. i have however lost a ship on bubbles, but those are not usually a problem while ratting. this is my 2 cents on the matter."
12/27/2009,"are you thinking about what you're saying?your advice is to force someone to play the game, because otherwise they don't belong in null sec, but don't anyone dare force you to play the game. you should be allowed to go to the cinema instead .you guys are the true carebears of eve."
12/27/2009,"the kind of failfit ratting ship that is already tanking rat dps? a good nullsec bomber/recon pilot will know when to strike. there is nothing ""harmless"" about a cloaker in system."
12/27/2009,"its more like there is a risk to cloaking and the anti-cloakers refuse to see it. yes, a cloak ship can sit, as long as it sits in a safe, which means it can't see. of course they have to get to that safe first, and there's the risk. taking a light ship through a gate that should be guarded if its ""your"" system.you seem to think that a camped (and specifically afk) cloaked ship is somehow more of a threat because its something you can't see. i counter that i can scout you actively with my ship and duck into a station when i see a safe chance. now that i'm there i can afk for days just waiting to call a whole strike fleet through the gate when you're weak. my capabilities are not diminished in any appreciable way.you're in 0.0. unescorted miners are never safe if there's another name in local. ever. if you haven't learned this the hard way yet, you're lucky.i will happily come out and deal with your camped cloakers for you. in less than seven days either they will be gone or your people will know how to counter them effectively. of course countering a cloak ship requires actual work and certain skills and i'm not sharing the details for free (but will happily send ccp the details directly. . . as if they don't already know them). if you're not willing to invest in your system's safety, of course you're going to be hit by a sb fleet, or just a big blob at your gate."
12/27/2009,"the only point i never understood is why being cloaked makes you untraceable.i understand it hides you from visual, but the ship itself is still there. signals would still bounce from it (like from probes and other means).i suggest adding some technobabble to patch this up."
12/27/2009,"hamano walker have you actually ever been in 0.0? you are saying we should perma camp every entrance to our space? do you know any entity who does that with a large enough camp that they actually catch cloakers that try to come through? because i am reasonably sure no alliance does that. and what kind of defensive fleet arround your miners do you think will do anything against a stealthbomber? i guess a fleet of titans would work to decloak anyone trying to come close enough to the miners, but that doesnt sound to practical.luckily you and only you are able to decloak afk cloakers, but of course it is a top secret. sounds legit"
12/27/2009,"oh, i didn't say i can decloak them. i said there are tactics which will keep you safe from them, at least as safe as you would be from anyone coming through one of those unguarded gates. now just to differentiate undetectable cloaking from idling, i'm perfectly ok with people who are afk for x time being logged off as long as its universal. cloak ships, mining pilots, non-pos deployable equipment etc. if no one who is idle is allowed to effect gameplay, that's fine. picking on cloaks sounds more like an unwillingness to figure out how to deal with them.i'll give you a hint: the best defense is vigilance. you should be vigilant in 0.0 all the time anyway."
12/27/2009,"oh dear lord knucklefux, why is this such an issue?????????????????????just turn of the g$&@#$%@*&! local and stop acting paranoid...eve whine #524 ""...but if there is an afk cloaker out there, how can i do any afk mining...it's not fair""please visit your user settings to re-enable images."

12/27/2009,"dear m-csm's,i'd like to attract your attention on the issue of factional warfare for a specific group of people: pvp newbies.as in life: great risk must be rewarded by great return + concrete proposition for a solutionlet me get into details:1.a. the risk.my currently lvl 1 agent requires me (in a level 1 mission) to sneak in the middle of ennemy territory (stacmon: like 16 jumps total and 8 jumps in enemy territory, 8 in lowsec enemy territory, 5 jumps in 0.8 - 0.9 solars). this is a level 1 mission - t1 frigate or destroyer only. lvl1 missions should be doable solo. doing this assignment solo is a very high mission, not because of the mission itself, but because of the ""ship chase"" between the rookie missioner soldier, the heavy npc militia/police in the 0.7 - 1.0 solars but mostly because of the inevitable pvp action on the way to, or back from the mission spot.if you jump through the acceleration gate (if there is one, luckily), you should be *a little bit* safer.conclusion: for level 1 missions, which are *rookie missions* this level of difficulty level is insane.1.b. the rewardwhot ??? no bounties ??? no money ? how can i buy the ships i loose ? with plexes maybe ? is that the plan of ccp ? i participated in the ""big story"" for my homeland. i certainly risked outnumbered pvp at *any* stage of my touristic trip (never did pvp, that's why i joined the army - to be able to participate in fleets and learn on-the-job). i shot down ennemy armymen. i traveled 16 jumps and dodged the poooolice like the dukes of hazzard. c'mon ! in lvl 1 missions, cruisers are not allowed for a mission in the middle of ennemy territory - absurd ! so, i'm declining the mission. which should normally send me to court martial for refusing to obey direct orders during wartime. the army should in the other hand do everything to help his army succeed in the execution of his marching/mission orders.ideas for solving the problem.proposition for implementation: look at how they do it in real life, once in your life, ccp. soldiers risk their skin every day, it's true. but they are paid for their duty. they don't have to pay for their weapons (i never saw a pilot buying his own airplane). if they are in deep ****, they should be able to call the base for extraction.1. the bounty values (under theformof lp's) should be *very* high, even for drone shootings and frigates. lp bonuses must be given for every ennemy armymen kia.2. factional warfare missions should be ""linked"" under the form of ""tour of duties"", similar to epic arc missions, but only 5-8 missions long.3. the ships must be ""lended"" to the pilot, the time of the assignment, ready to fly (and die), fully fitted with *faction* modules. soldiers use the weaponry they are assigned to, not a ragtag army of ships arbitrarily fitted. anyway, i won't have the isk (as a newbie in fw) to buy correct equipment.did you see an ""armored brigade pvt"" buy a tank in a shop and say ""and i'll take a box of depleted uranium shells, and two packs of smokes"", irl ? 4. the soldier in a tour of duty should have access to unlimited jumpclones and a daypay (x isk per day, depending on the grade). his standing at 8 (to/from his militia corp) as long as he is enrolled. the idea of ""we don't like you very much, but please help us"" is absuuuurd. the ""boys"" must be appreciated by their army.5. the militia channel doen't fill its role because of the presence of spies. solution: only characters of a race may join his own army (sorry guys), but anyone should be able to join (even outlaws). outlaws may ""rebuy a life"" by joining the ""legion"", as the french do. alts on the same account should not be able to join another milicia.to be continued in part 2."
12/27/2009,"(part 2 about the mail concerninig fw)6. last idea: create a new mission type: ""battle missions"". the player should be assigned as fleet commander of an npc fleet.option a: for the npc fleet/squadron: normal ai for lvls 1 - 3, and sleeper ai for levels 4 & 5.option b: give orders to the fleet/squad like orders for drones, but more tactical (""regroup"", ""defend me"", assign primary targets, ""stay in position"", ""patrol and broadcast when ennemy spotted"", etc...). man, that would be ossom ! a *real* pvp school, and a *real* fleet commanding school. ccp can create a skill ""command fleet"", and create two certificates: ""fleet commanding"" (based on skills) and ""militia fleet command"" based on a number of pvp-type missions succeeded (maybe one pvp-type mission at the end of each tour of duty.7. very last idea: a soldier should be able to take a ""permission period"" (i think it's balled ""rest and relaxation"" in the us, but i'm not sure)), and leave militiamen status ..implement that, and you have a better fw aspect of the game.8: the most important. once the tour of duty is finished, at home (the army ""barracks"" or ""presidios"") with comrade npc's , after a short ""burial"" ceremony (game-engine cutscenes, a short voices instead of 1pt font text), we go to the bar, iceland-style, or to the red quarter, international style. oh what ??? no ""walk in stations"" yet ??? we'll wait. but some cutscenes would be so easy to implement, and would be an important attractiveness for the game.by the way, in fw, agents should not be called agents, but should be called captains - colonels - general, depending on the rank of the soldier. missions are not optional, but orders.by the way, raising in ranks should be automatic, depending on the number of tour of duties realized.star trek online and jumpgate evolution are cometh. the winning game will be the one that offers the best options for beginners. do you think that someone in a trial account that gets blown away in each encounter will upgrade to paying customer ? forget it ?fw is fundamental in the new player experience for the simple reason that the armyis the most obvious place to go if you know nobody. help beginner pvp players to learn pvp in a *meaningful* context.the csm should help ccp to ""warp-jump"" eve-online into a next generation game. factional warfare is the perfect first step for that.could it be possible to implement all this for last week ? it's *that* important."

12/27/2009,"as anyone whose ever watched a naval warfare knows, formations are an integral part of warfare. groups of ships gather in different ways to do things like concentrate their firepower, or shield smaller ships from harm. yet in eve, despite all that we see in our beautiful trailers, players lack the ability to get all their ships together in a lovely formation while ripping opponents to shreds.how it works: a new leadership skill, under the working name ""formation management"" allows a squad commander to group up to 10 ships together into a formation. while in formation, ship control is slaved to the squad leader. all ships in the gang will travel at the speed of the slowest, thereby encouraging groups of similarly fit ships together. each class of ship (battleship, cruiser, frigate) would have its own set of formations (destroyers and battlecruisers are counted as cruisers for this).in order to prevent abuse, the bonuses of a formation would be directly linked to the number of ships within it. if a player breaks formation, all ships would lose the bonus that the leaving vessel provided (ie: 3 rifters are in a skirmisher formation, all recieve a 6% bonus to speed. one breaks away, returning to it's default speed, while the remaining two only have a 4% bonus to their speeds.)example frigate formations:skirmisher wing: v shaped wing. all vessels within recieve a 2% bonus to speed per vessel.disruption wing: each ship recieves a 5% bonus to web and warp disruptor range per ship.example cruiser formations:shield formation: x-shaped formation. each ship gains a 1% bonus per ship to all resists.barrage formation: all vessels recieve a 3% bonus per ship to damage per ship.example battleship formations:sniping formation: semicircle shaped. each ship recieves a 2% bonus to range and falloff per ship.endurance formation: each ship recieves a 2% boost to armor and shield repair amounts per ship.please let me know what you think. thanks in advance."
12/27/2009,you know that ccp has that on the agenda?if not see this. around 55minutes.the proposal sounds quite nice but some details could use more work. e.g. how do i break the formation? how much more piloting would be needed for a squad member?because if full control for moving goes to the squad commander the bonuses might be a bit strong.
12/27/2009,"i wouldn't mind a simple wall formation for defensive purposes. the ships are arranged and aligned together, and in return, get a defensive bonus. ships could still be focus fired, but a % of the damage would be spread to its squadmates, instead of 100% going to the focus fired ship.for each ship in formation, 4-8% of the damage would be spread to its squadmates instead of itself. this means at a squad of 10 ships, the primary target would take between 20-60% of the damage, with the remainder randomly distributed between squad members. it would add another layer of tactics to battles, as it would be better to concentrate on ships within a single squad first, instead of picking pilots alphabetically. furthermore, squad composition would become an interesting addition to fleet formation, as people try to protect weaker ships with stronger squad members."
12/27/2009,"darius is quite correct in saying that ccp is working on it. for those who are too lazy to go watch the vid, here is what they said they want to do:-work as a full mechanic, not just visual appeal (""though that's cool, as well."")-multiple bonuses to squadrons in formation (""'bonii', which means many bonuses."")-not just a random ai running things-adds organization to tactical combat-""did we mention that they are awesome?"""

12/27/2009,"dear m-csm's,i'd like to attract your attention on the issue of factional warfare. missions and pvp.as in life: great risk must be rewarded by great return + concrete proposition for a solutionlet me get into details:1.a. the risk.my currently agent requires me in a level 1 mission in the middle of ennemy territory (stacmon: like 16 jumps total and 8 jumps in enemy territory, 8 in lowsec enemy territory, 5 jumps in 0.8 - 0.9 solars). this is a level 1 mission - t1 frigate or destroyer. tech 1 missions should be doable solo. doing this assignment solo is (at first view) a suicide mission, not because of the mission itself, but because of the ""ship chase"" between the rookie fw soldier, the heavy npc militia/police in the 0.7 - 1.0 solars.if you jump through the acceleration gate (if there is one, luckily), you should be *a little bit* safer.conclusion: for level 1 missions, which are *rookie missions* this level of difficulty level is insane.1.b. the rewardwhot ??? no bounties ??? c'mon ! i shot down ennemy armymen. i traveled 16 jumps and dodged the poooolice like the dukes of hazzard. t2 frigates are not allowed for a mission in the middle of ennemy territory - why ? ??? i participated in the ""big story"" for my homeland. i certainly risked outnumbered pvp at *any* stage of my touristic trip (i never did pvp, that's why i joined the army - to be able to participate in fleets and learn on-the-job). i *consider* (...) politely but strictly declining the mission. by the way, declining a mission in fw is absurd because a soldier does not refuse direct orders. the army should in the other hand do everything to help the soldier succeed in the execution of his marching/mission orders.ideas for solving the problem.proposition for implementation: look at how they do it in real life, once in your life, ccp. soldiers risk their skin every day, it's true. but they are paid for their duty. they don't have to pay for their weapons (i never saw a pilot buying his own airplane). if they are in deep ****, they should be able to call the base for extraction.1. the bounty values should be *very* high, even for drone shootings and frigates. lp bonuses must be given for every ennemy armymen kia.2. factional warfare missions should be ""linked"" under the form of ""tour of duties"", similar to epic arc missions, but only 5-8 missions long.3. the ships must be ""lended"" to the pilot, the time of the assignment, ready to fly (and die), fully fitted with *faction* modules. soldiers use the weaponry they are assigned to, not a ragtag army of ships arbitrarily fitted.did you see an ""armored brigade pvt"" buy a tank in a shop and say ""and i'll take a box of depleted uranium shells, and two packs of smokes"", irl ? 4. the soldier in a tour of duty should have access to unlimited jumpclones in the militia bases (to be used during during the mission itself, details to be worked out, but shouldn't be a problem), and have his standing at 8 as long as he is enrolled. the idea of ""we don't like you very much, but please help us"" is stupid"". the ""boys"" must be appreciated by their army.5. the militia channel is dangerous because of the presence of spies. solution: only characters of a race may join his own army (sorry guys), but anyone should be able to join (even outlaws). outlaws may ""rebuy a life"" by joining the ""legion"", as the french do. alts on the same account should not be able to join another milicia.to be continued in part 2."
12/27/2009,"(part 2 about the mail concerninig fw)6. last idea: in missions deep into ennemy territory (more than 3 jumps), the player should be assigned into an npc fleet, as fleet commander. option a: for the npc fleet/squadron: normal ai for lvls 1 - 3, and sleeper ai for levels 4 & 5.option b: give orders to the fleet/squad like orders for drones, but more tactical (""regroup"", ""defend me"", assign primary targets, ""stay in position"", ""patrol and broadcast when ennemy spotted"", etc...). man, that would be ossom ! a *real* pvp school, and a *real* fleet commanding school. ccp can create a skill ""command fleet"", and create two certificates: ""fleet commanding"" (based on skills) and ""militia fleet command"" based on a number of pvp-type missions succeeded (maybe one pvp-type mission at the end of each tour of duty).7. very last idea: a soldier should be able to take a ""permission period"" (i think it's balled ""rest and relaxation"" in the us, but i'm not sure).implement that, and you have a better fw aspect of the game.8: the most important. once the tour of duty is finished, at home (the army ""barracks"" or ""presidios"") with comrade npc's , after a short ""burial"" ceremony (game-engine cutscenes, a short voices instead of 1pt font text), we go to the bar, iceland-style, or to the red quarter, international style. oh what ??? no ""walk in stations"" yet ??? we'll wait. but some cutscenes would be so easy to implement, and would be an important attractiveness for the game.by the way, in fw, agents should not be called agents, but should be called captains - colonels - general, depending on the rank of the soldier.by the way, raising in ranks should be automatic, depending on the number of tour of duties realized.star trek online and jumpgate evolution are cometh, and the csm should help ccp to ""warp-jump"" eve-online into a next generation game. factional warfare is the perfect first step for that.could it be possible to implement all this for last week ? it's *that* important."

12/28/2009,i think allowing covert cynos into high sec will make them more useful as that will allow for a more surprise warfare in high sec space. this was suggested to ccp by csm3 and ccp was favourable towards the idea.

12/28/2009,"blackops?need more damage, flexability and ew to make up for poor tanks. they are deployed for hit and run in gangs and all offer heavy duty gunnary dps and some ew (not quite in the same class as recons) as well as command abilities: redeemer: 7.5% to large energy damage, 7.5% to large energy tracking, 10% to neut amount per levelsin: 7.5% to large hybrid damage, 7.5% to large hybrid tracking, 10% to warp disruption per level (screw drones give it 6 guns)panther: 7.5% to large projectile damage, 20% to large projectile falloff, 10% to webifier range per level widow: 5% to hybrid optimal, 5% to hybrid damage per level, 30% bonus to ecm target jammer strength all of these ships should have 6 gun slots and 2 utility slots, they should also require command skills and be able to fit command modules (fitting usage reduction as per command ships).new penalty to even things up -20% to active tank repair/boost (not sure if this should include remote repping too, probably) this in addition to their poor natural tank means that deploying them means weighing up the odds!i also think the jump portal should give 100% more range but the whole fleet must jump through, including the black ops, if you are going to engage, do it and do it together and risk it, then jump out together if it lives!"
12/28/2009,"yeah, that would only make sense if the bo could turn itself inside out and jump through the bridge it made. if black ops had to, titans would also have to. in both cases, i think the pilots of said ships would not like this idea."
12/28/2009,"hi bagehi, i'll talk to you on vent tonight with my main :)i think titans should also have to use the jb when it is activated and move the whole fleet in one basicly it would open up a oversized wormhole and pull all fleet ships into it within a certain range. the idea of having a ship that basicly just sits around bridging people is annoying to me. in terms of physics.. creating wormholes basicly are turning yourself and space time inside out punching a hole in it and so going through the short way. so it is no more bizarre or unrealistic then that.if you are in a fleet and are moving the fleet you should move with it, this would give more consequences tactics and basicly fun and risk to using this.plus the epicness of having a titan drop on you with a fleet. same goes for black ops to a lesser extent.besides i digress. black ops need to be the core of any black ops group not just sitting at a pos bridging stuff a pitiful distance and (rarely) failing in combat when actually used at the right time."
12/28/2009,"loloops; wrong quote. i wanted to quote the player that said: ""i'd imagine this is less difficult than wormholes"" or something similar.larger text font option, pretty please.you would think this could be addressed rather easily and quickly.over a year i have repeatedly asked for the text (fonts) to be upgraded (option for larger font size most needed), these old eyes (even with newly prescribed glasses) can't see some of the text (esp. the map features).do you (ccp) see that players need more font features!!!please give us the font options and include larger text."
12/28/2009,"i don't think the fix goes far enough.i think remote reppers should be treated as if they attacked everyone who has aggression to the pilot he is repping. yes concord should come (high sec) and gcc should happen (low sec). one exception to this rule: if the repper is at war with at least one of the pilots who is aggressed to the ship he is repping then no concord or gcc sanction should happen. but in every other way it should be like the repper attacked everyone attacking the pilot receiving the reps. fix the killmails to show reppers. if you used two ships to kill a target, its not a solo kill and shouldn't show up as one. either stop using killmails or make them accurate.if there are insurmountable problems with what i propose then this proposal is better than nothing."

12/28/2009,"don't take this as a personal attack, but i think that perfectly proves the point that there is a problem. you and presumably others are able to make what amounts to free money. your research accounts buy a gtc and come online twice a year (or however often) and dump their datacores. your primaries get the benefit. i don't have a problem with making enough profit to buy gtc's per se. its that my research alt (which i don't actually have) costs me $5/month (monthly rate/3 for 3 characters on one account) since its on my primary account and yours costs you $10 a year (same formula but only active for two months of the year) for exactly the same benefits."
12/28/2009,"since the inception of the game, the longer you remain in the game, the more metagaming tricks you learn. the metagaming tricks are, more than anything else, why older players have fat passive income, while newer players struggle. it is also why (i think) newer players get frustrated by the game. if players make it long enough in the game to get into corps/alliances, they eventually ask ""how do you make so much money?"" the answer is usually met with stunned silence or complaints about how it breaks the game. whether it is 20 mining alts sucking on veld afk, or pos tricks that magically create moon mins, or inactive training characters to sell, or inactive research, and anything else... they really do not help the market as a whole as only a small portion of people are actually involved in these activities.when income disparity comes from manipulating the game, not playing it, the game is broken."

12/28/2009,"drones in general are in need of a serious overhaul regarding their ai and general user friendliness. almost all ships in new eden are drone-capable, so lets give them some love!for implementationdrone tactical interfacethis is a ui/ai improvement that i believe would add a degree of depth and functionality to drones. the drone tactical interface (dti) is an overview box (screenshot below.)""target priority"" and then a number, 1 to 10. in sequence, 1 being the highest priority and 10 being the lowest, your drones will aggress these targets. 1, 2, 3, and so on. once a target has been destroyed, the numbers refresh and 2 becomes 1 and so forth, allowing a tenth target to be added and given target priority 10. ""ignore"" the target will not be attacked by drones under any circumstance.pve functionality : a drone user may warp into a mission, lock the spawn trigger for the next wave, add it to the dti and then select ""ignore"". this npc will now not be aggressed by drones under any circumstances. pvp functionality : a drone user can warp in, lock a variety of targets, add the interceptor going at 12km/s that your drones can never possibly catch, and select ""ignore"". your drones will no longer chase a target they can never hit! pve (mining) functionality : a miner can target 10 asteroids (with skill listed below at v) and add them to the dti with sequential target priority. the drones will mine the first asteroid, then the second and so forth. new skill : ""drone tactical interfacing""introduction of a new skill : ""drone tactical interfacing"". total sp : 256,000. in line with drones, drone navigation and drone sharpshooting. description : allows 2 more targets per level to be added to the drone tactical interface.new drone settingsthese settings are made available via the drop down on your drone tactical interface. new drone setting screen is here, at the bottom of the screenshot : linkagedrone range settings : ""engage close range"" - drones will attack the closest object first, and move outwards. ""engage long range"" - drones will attack the furthest object first, and move inwards.""engage optimal first"" - drones engage targets around their optimal ranges first. (sentries, does nothing for non-sentry drones.)""engage any"" - drones will not prefer any distance. drone aggression settings : ""engage ewar vessels"" - drones will wipe out vessels performing ewar first. ""ignore capsuleer vessels"" - drones will not, under any circumstance, engage player vessels.""ignore pirate vessels"" - drones will not, under any circumstances, engage npc's. pve functionality : allows drone users to actually set what they want their drones to do! also prevents the destruction of players whom are unfortunate enough for their drons to autoaggro a player attacker. pvp functionality : ever been in a fleet fight and your drones go after the npc's who have spawned on a gate? also : allows easy destruction of ewar vessels when coupled with the fleet functionality.edit: ability to see drone damage via the drone tactical interface while in drone bay. (as to not overcomplicate dronebay.) overallimproves drones for everyone!"
12/28/2009,"don't forget to check the ""i support this."" box when you post! edit : ""ignore player vessels"" changed to ""ignore capsuleer vessels"" (not in screenshot) and ""ignore npc vessels"" to ""ignore pirate vessels"" (in screenshot).edit : i had considered this, but i feel that it is a little overpowered for just clicking a box and then wandering off, hence the idea of having a limit to what ships you can assign priority to via the drone tactical interface. also : i believe that the assignment of drones to a particular character via fleet mechanics exists already with ""assist"", this would just be an alteration that makes the system work. admittedly, it could be balanced, but first we need the changes listed above to even consider implementing anything else. thanks for posting!second edit : right. priority overrides the ""attack ewar vessels first"". so, if you have ten ships, from 1 - 10, and say, number 7 and 4 are ewar, the drones will attack down the list in sequence. however, if you remove all targets from the priority listings, the drones will engage ewar first. it's essentially a preference that is entirely secondary. the drones have orders to attack ewar as primaries, except where the pilot has specified, manually, more important targets. also, target priority of things not in the dti is considered to be 11. otherwise the ""ignore"" order would essentially be a rating of 5 or lower. drones kill 1 - 10 and then everything else with preset settings. edit : very true, however, the core ideas here are both very functional and not too complicated. at the least i'd say this is well worth being passed around ccp to see what they like and what they can implement.edit again due to general rethinking the fleet mechanics side of this post has been removed. however i'm leaving the quotes regarding it up on the basis that later reader may want to know wtf they were on about :pwell, drones auto attack regardless. it bears logical analysis that they can be ordered to attack only certain things. also, there is a distinction between automated attack robots and ""guns"". one can attack on it's own, one needs someone to pull the trigger kinda like friend or foe missiles? yup, need to lock to add to dti + drone control range is the limit!"

12/28/2009,"awesome idea, as long as each person can select whether or not to display it (if for some reason the alliance logo looks horrid on a certain hull)."
12/28/2009,"this works if something provides stability to the mineral price from manipulations. probably something along the lines of the median price paid over the last 7 days throughout all of new eden (can be computed during downtime / offline). payout and premium would become static as off when the policy was subscribed. so if bs prices went up 30% then net payout would become something like ~66%. if price went down significantly, you could strip the ship, blow it up and buy a replacement for a small one-time profit.another thing is that with insurance ""guaranteed"" to pay less then replacement cost, daily or weekly premiums would make sense improving the affordability of insurance to new chars (while being mostly irrelevant for old chars)."
12/28/2009,"i disagree. even if pegging insurance to mineral costs were not subject to manipulation, the cost of ships would likely hang around the current insurance value. so now it would be not only profitable to make suicide ships, it would be profitable to make speculative suicide ships and hold tham until their insurance value goes up. also note that the amount by which individual minerals are below their base value does not bear out the theory that suicide ships are the problem. the higher the base value of a given mineral the greater the percentage deflation. in other words tritanium and pyerite are produced in quantities closer to demand than megacyte. since the total value of a constructed ship remains the same (because of insurance) you would expect that the most expensive (as a percentage of base cost) minerals would be those that are produced in the least quantity. the numbers show that, for whatever reason, the less experienced players are actually getting a better deal than the lowsec miners."
12/28/2009,"recently made about 100m while watching a movie using this insurance fraud method. pretty silly if you ask me, but i can't really complain as it benefits me. like many real world corporations, insurance should be handled by the corporations (or maybe on an alliance level). if ccp wanted to be nice about it, they could do most of the maths for us so ceos don't fly to iceland and go postal. allow corps/alliances to set reimbursement levels - a percentage of risk burden the corp/alliance takes for a ship. this could be set negative to dissuade players from flying certain ships (or to create income for the corp/alliance).the cost of insurance would then be calculated by the risk of ship loss for that ship type for that player, minus/plus the risk taken on (or added) by the corp/alliance - this should easily be able to be calculated when a player opens the insurance window for that ship. it shouldn't take much computing for the servers (especially if the average market values for ships were tabulated daily at downtime).let's be honest, many alliances/corps are already doing something along these lines already (as insurance for t2 ships is a joke and insurance barely covers the cost of caps, let alone the piles of much more expensive mods required to fly them). along those lines, it might be best if there was a ""fit check"" that reimbursed based on specific fittings.of course, all of this would leave the npc corp players without insurance. so something would need to be in place for them, such as insurance with an across the board loss per ship.it wouldn't be an easy or quick fix to the system, but it would be a true fix."
12/28/2009,"have you any idea how much isk it would take to move the whole mineral market by more than 10%? trillions wouldn't be enough. and you'd need to move it rather more than 10% to actually make a profit, and do it quite fast as well. that kind of manipulation would not only require vast capital, it would also be fantastically susceptible to outside interference. if the dynamic insurance price is based on market sales, that means you can only change the mineral basket price by actually buying or selling minerals. unfilled buy/sell orders wont affect the insurance price. even if you're just selling them back and forth to an alt, the quantities involved would rack up inconceivable broker fees, and people would start to notice long before you'd moved the basket price 2%, let alone 20%."

12/28/2009,"banning character sales is a really weird solution to account hacking because it doesnt address the actual problem and it causes a ton of other problems. i dont know why you would think this is any sort of good change.1. it takes away a revenue stream from ccp and puts it back in the hands of the black market(this alone will make it not happen)2. doesnt address the other consequences of account hacking(empty corp, personal hangars, deleted characters, banned accounts)3. makes things overall less safe for players now that a service for which there is a demand is now in the hands of the black market. character and account scams will be back.i dont see any good thing coming from banning character sales or transfers. some sort of protection to prevent hacked character sales would be best- outright bans, no."
12/28/2009,not supported only idiots have their accounts hacked.i have recieved these emails too and frankly i have never actually fallen for it. tell me how anyone who is not a complete idiot can fail to notice that when the url is spelled incorrectly or ends in some strange domain like .it or .tk it is clearly not the official website. also for my password i use latin characters these are easily entered on any standard keyboard by holding alt and typing the 4 digit ascii code before releasing the alt key not only do most people use alphaneumeric passwords but they make them way too simple. simply adding non english characters will make your account unhackable as most brute force engines and keyloggers only support alphaneumeric and special characters not latin and forign symbols. also using a simple free antivirus such as avira will detect and neutralize about 90% of active keyloggers out there

12/28/2009,"with the release of the 2 most recent patches, it seems that ccp has unintentionally broke the killmail system.1. apocrypha and new bays - with the apocrypha, ccp added new bays to ships. well in doing so they forgot to add what was dropped from these new bays if the ship is destroyed. for example, if you pop a orca in low-sec that was carrying hulks in its ship-maintenance bay you would have no idea that you did so. furthermore, any ore that he was carrying in his ore hold would not show up as well. this is also true for other capital ships and there fuel bays. something needs to be done so that loss values reflect true loss value 2. dominion patch - after the dominion it seems that the killmail system just went to hell. i have witnessed kills that killmails were not generated for. i have also witnessed pos kills that do not show everyone on the kill that was shooting at the target. this is unacceptable, most low-sec pvp alliances/corporations live and breathe killmails. in most organizations it is considered taboo to tamper with killmails at all, thus cheating people out of hard earned kills.ccp needs to address this issue in the next patch. if a total rework of the system has to take place, so be it. however, to continue on with the status quo is unacceptable to the majority of low-sec alliances/corporations that live for killmails."
12/28/2009,it's threads like these which reinforce the notion that forum moderators are inappropriately overcensoring everything. who watches the watchers?apparently nobody and that's troubling. forum moderators should know better. there needs to be oversight.

12/28/2009,you are aware that the drake can hold over 3000 missiles right?
12/28/2009,"i was unaware of this information possum. thanks for posting it. it does not change my view that the drake needs a look, but we can agree to disagree."
12/28/2009,could you tell us why you need more than 3hours constant firing worth of missiles in your ship?
12/28/2009,"vheri kai'or you should re-read my post. i did not make a generalization that the minmatar ships listed are split weapon in the way a phoon is. you read that implication into my text on your own. talk about seeing what you want to see.i did however compare drake to:1.other missile ships in the battle cruiser and cruiser hulls. this to show that despite having the most missile hard points in the medium weapon range it has less cargo hold than all others except the curse.2. minmatar battle cruiser and cruiser hulls. why? (pay attention this time) because they use projectiles which are commonly (although erroneously) considered the largest charges. i wanted to show that because projectiles take up less m3 than missiles, almost every dedicated missile ship in the same hull class has a larger cargo hold than a projectile ship in the same class. except the drake! it just so happens those minmatar ships also have missile hard points. no where in my post do i state that they are meant to be a split weapon platform.i hope that clears it up for you."
12/28/2009,"only if you bring one type of missiles with you , which is prety lame in most situations. i usually bring 5+types of missiles with me ,then running out of one type during ops is more than possible.oh wait missiles werent desingned to be able to choose dmg types ...."
12/28/2009,"patri, you are replying to many people point-by-point who are making senseless arguments against your proposal... but you are failing to respond to those who are telling you why the drake doesn't need more cargo space. please read all the replies if you haven't already."
12/28/2009,well you can still choose the dmg type for quite some time (before running out) and even if you have to use a less optimal dmg type it isnt like you are not contributing to kills anymore.
12/28/2009,"i think you missed the point of my post. you said; ""generally the same number of missile and turret hard points."" this is a generalisation (as is any statement beginning with the word ""generally"") regarding the nature of minmatar highslot configuration. it is an incorrect one. i am genuinly not fussed about whether the drake needs more cargo space, ive not used one enough to care...what im fussed about is inconsistency and bad logic; you want ccp to increase the size of the drakes cargo hold, you need to give them good and logically consistent reasons that maintain its balance with other battlecruisers."
12/28/2009,"assuming you divide your space evenly among missile types, if you bring six types and fill your cargo with just missiles, then you're bringing approximately 1900 missiles of each type. (11,500 / 6 = 1916.67, rounded down)for this calculation, again i'm going to assume the use of the best faction launchers with a base rate of fire of 10.50s, then add bonuses to an arbitrary rate of 8.0s. (note: i'm going to round numbers down to account for fractions of missiles)to go through 1900 missiles of one type, using seven launchers, you would use 1900 / 7 = ~270 per launcher. for 8.0s, that takes 270 x 8.0s = 2160 seconds; divide by 60s and you've got exactly 36 minutes. this gives us a minimum of 36 minutes for every missile type brought along for the operation--not accounting for reloading time--to run out of that missile type. in my opinion, that's reasonable, because you still have three hours worth of missiles left, even if they aren't optimized for the target.i think part of the challenge of being a missile pilot is the decision on what damage type you bring; and i think the drake's cargohold gives plenty of space for this."
12/28/2009,"this, it's like comparing the raven's cargo to the paladin's cargo."
12/28/2009,"i want to have the same option as most other ships to run a cap booster on a drake. now of course this will draw every possible flame to the topic, but it should not. because of the limited cargo in relation to the charge size, cap booster charges are not a viable option.""why do you want cap boosters on a drake?"" will be the question. it requires no answer. it is a sand box right? i should have the option, but it is not available because heavy missiles and cap charges do not mix well in a 345 m3 hold. but let me try any way.i put together a build on sisi to try and test the viability of fitting a drake similar to the rocket wizard nighthawk made famous by fon revedhort. you know what? it works! well kinda. you see i can not fit enough cap charges to make it viable even with a can.i think i should be allowed to explore non-conventional fits on this ship. the moronic question has been asked, ""why do you need more than three hours worth of missiles?"" can we therefore determine that any ship with the ability to fit 3 hours worth of charges should have its cargo hold reduced? cargo hold size provides options for different fittings. ships with large charges should have larger bays or their options are limited unfairly. imagine the sacrilege trying to run the common dual armor rep set up with a 345 m3 cargo hold. it has 615 m3 and it is meant as a ham platform (smaller charges).heavy missiles are big. missile ships have bigger cargo holds than any ship in their class. except the drake."
12/28/2009,go away please
12/28/2009,"so missile ships should only fill the hold with missiles? what if i do not only ant to have missiles in my hold? nighthawk, raven, typhoon, sacrilege builds are viable with cap chargers just like practically every other ship. why? because they have a hold that takes into account the size of their charges. why should the drake not have this option.drake has more limits on setups and choices for pvp than any other ship because of its limited hold. it has plenty of space only if you limit it to carrying only missiles. sandbox?"
12/28/2009,"so you want a cap boosting drake? ok fit it the hell out. take less missiles, maybe 1000 into the fight, the rest of your hold going to '800's. at 64m3 as memory serves you should be able to fit 3 or 4 in the thing. i personally have never been in a fight long enough that needing more than 3 or 4 charges happens. we either win, run or die before that point. capacitor stability is irrelevant for any pvp fit not a capital ship (unseiged and untriaged) and i doubt you would be able to fit a drake in such away that you need more than 1 charge in any 5 minute period.and citing battleships and amarr ships when your making an argument for a caldari battlecruiser is dumb, cos battleships will always have more cargo then bc, and ammarr will almost never need what cargo space they have for anything but cap boosters, i mean seriously, laser crystals of any size take up what? 1m3 p/u at most?"
12/28/2009,"sticking to t1 ships, here's what i've found.raven: 665m3apocalypse: 675m3megathron: 675m3tempest: 600m3the other ships in the raven's class are within 10% of its capacity. it, oddly enough, as the missile ship, has slightly less cargo space than the apoc and mega.caracal: 450m3maller: 280m3vexor: 480m3stabber: 420m3the oddball here is the maller. the vexor and stabber are both within 7% of the caracal's capacity (30m3), with it falling in the middle.kestrel: 305m3inquisitor: 315m3incursus: 165m3breacher: 175m3the kestrel, inquisitor, and breacher all have bonuses and hardpoints favoring missiles, and they do have the most capacity of the four. the idea applies in some order here, but the breacher for some reason has 40% less space than the kestrel.the evidence here, i submit, does not support the supposition that missile ships as a rule have greater capacity relative to the ships in their class. at the frigate level, i think there's enough to warrant a correlation, but not a generalization."
12/28/2009,"i have made the case for the considerations which seem to go into determining proper m3 of cargo holds. you have refuted none of them. the fact that you only fly with a gank crew where 1000 rounds and 3-4 cap boosters is enough is great for your play style. obviously you do not kite with a burning mwd. but tell me, what other bc is limited to 1000 rounds and 3-4 cap charges when fitting cap boosters? so you are saying cap boosters should only be fit on cap ships? i cited missile ships you tool. to show that all of them, bc hull and bs hull have bigger holds then any other ship in their own class, except the drake. i cited no amarr ships. i did compare some khanid ships which use missiles. so wth are you on about crystals? missile ships tend to have a larger hold than most non missile ships a class above them. the exception being projectile ships.frig: kestrel @305 m3 > cruiser cruiser moa @ 250 m3 >cruiser: caracal @ 450 > bc ferox @ 345 (and all other bcs)bc hull: damnation @ 645 > all battleships except raven @ 665bc hull: nighthawk @ 700 > all battleships i use nighthawk and damnation because there is no other missile battle cruiser to compare the drake to and because those ships have sensible holds compared to their missile hard points. imo this is where the drake hold should be."
12/28/2009,"i wanted to show that the drake's cargo space can hold enough missiles to support it firing for well over three hours. how the pilot uses that capability is, of course, up to the pilot. sometimes i add exotic dancers to my cargo just because i have enough missiles for whatever i'm doing and i have plenty of leftover space.i submit that the drake does actually have this option. if you take 5000 missiles, then you're using (5000*.03m3) 150m3 of space for missiles. that's enough firepower for at least an hour and leaves you 195m3 for other contraband (six cap booster 800s is 192m3).again, i disagree that the drake ""has plenty of space only if you limit it to carrying only missiles."" i'm not sure where this arbitrary idea came from; apologies if it was inferred from any of my previous posts.the drake has enough space to give the pilot the option to take enough ammo to fire for up to three or more hours at a very considerable rate of fire. the pilot can then designate that cargo space as he sees fit with what i believe is plenty of room for creative use of the ship."

12/28/2009,in features and ideas - jump clone changesbasically make jump clones only work if you are in the same station as them and/or if you within range of a rorqual with a jump clone. you could even decrease the 24 hour grace period to hours instead of a day. you could then get jump clones into wormhole space with rorquals and the clone bays they can have. you should be able to destroy any jump clones you have and enemies who capture an outpost should be able to destroy any jump clones inside.
12/28/2009,"supported. ""eve is too small already"" (guess they never have flown a freighter :p ) is _the_ most heard argument against shortening the time between jumps (in fact, i think it's about the only one, as ""defending your home territory becomes too easy"" amounts to the same thing), and (considerably) shortening the period between jumps within the same constellation or even station will cater to both sides: eve won't get smaller, and you can pvp with your empty pod and then go back to normal on your +4's (or mine ice first, and then ore, or whatever reason you might have to 'swap' implants).it shouldn't be instant, but the 24h-creep is just annoying. ""oh, today i've jumped to pod x, when i start playing tomorrow i can't jump yet so the day after tomorrow i can jump again"". for the working class a 24h cooldown might just as well be replaced with an 36 or 40h one, we wouldn't notice the difference."
12/28/2009,"ah, i see the cloaked trolls have found another thread to plug their ""i want an i-win-button and be even more invisible"" 'remove local' junk.'boo-hoo my fragile ship will blow up if the gate i go through is camped' tears won't help you, as just about every ship will blow up if the gate is (properly) camped, and after that you're home free to pick your risk-free targets, warp off unseen if there happens to be more support than you initially thought and generally disrupt the system.why so vehemently against cloaks? i've seen cloakers misguidedly thinking they are no worse than ships that are not cloaked. well, you're wrong. uncloaked ships can be scanned down and removed from the system. you can't do that to cloaked ships. as for the one making a lemming of the op with cloaks replaced by logging out: are you really that dense? logged of you don't have intel, you are no threat, you can't shoot anyting and indeed, i'll grant you that, you don't risk anything. you can log on and hope in the meantime some ratter appeared in the belt you logged off in, but that's about it."
12/28/2009,"i hope you're just acting ******ed. you're accusing miners of wanting to afk mine? how ironic, considering the ones that can afford to go afk under the current system are cloakers themsleves . seriously, you'll need to think of better excuses to hang on to your i-don't-want-to-pvp flag."
12/28/2009,"you don<U+FFFD>t have to use gates even, after you get one guy with covert cyno in system. beautiful isn<U+FFFD>t it?"
12/28/2009,the problem is not cloaking. the problem is having a local to begin with. remove local from 0.0 and then people will not cry about people being in their system. this is one of the first games i have seen that claims to be a pvp game that also warns you when people are around for free.take cloaks away from ratting battleships that cloak up as soon as someone comes into local if you really want to change cloaks.
12/28/2009,"are you really that dense? afk cloaked you don't have intel, you are no threat, you can't shoot anyting and indeed, i'll grant you that, you don't risk anything. you can come back to your keyboard and hope in the meantime some ratter appeared in the belt you cloaked afk in, but that's about it."
12/28/2009,absolutely agree with this--except that i think it would work to remove it from low-sec as well. the problem is that we automatically know someone is there when we should have to do something to discover them. i believe local is the root of this; not cloak functionality.
12/28/2009,"first i lived in wh's for a while and had no problem with detecting cloakers cause they had to use probes to find the sites i was mining at, so i could detect their probes before they found me, however in 0.0 the belts are clearly able to be warped to at will by covert ops and they dont need to use probes to find you. even the grav sites in 0.0 aren't really that secure because once a red has the bm he can find you at will just like a belt, but in wh's the enemy tends to never stay more than a day cause they dont want to lose their precious link to their home system so tomorrow i'll probably be completely safe again. wh's don't have a local like 0.0 because it's unexplored territory and its link to familiar territory is constantly changing. 0.0 is explored territory and its link to familiar territory is constant. those are the differences that make them unique and a different gameplay, if you dont like local in 0.0 then move to wh space where it is like that. i will never understand the complaints of those who hate local so much but refuse to go live in wh space where local is perfect for them.second i too am a cloaker and i know that most gatecamps i've flown through in my covert ops had no chance of finding me unless they were very experienced or just got lucky. however as a miner and ratter i hate it when some cloaker just afks in system and there is nothing you can do about it, truly imo this needs to be changed, having a cloaker lock up a system is very frustrating when he can be there for hours and not even at home to play the game. if not implementing a fuel for cloaking devices then simply implement a timer where if your character does nothing at all (ie type, move around, use eve voice, anything) then he is auto logged out of the game. that by the way would also lessen the lag on the servers from players afk'ing all over the universe. tbh if you aren't at your computer for 30minutes then you really have no business taking up server bandwidth anyhow."
12/28/2009,"nice lemming. too bad you didn't quote, i almost missed it.you're only leaving a tiny bitsy little problem out of it: how do you know the cloaker is afk? there is no way an offline account can gather intel or approach a prey, or make descisions when it would be best to log in, and when he would get a free kill by decloa, euhm, logging in.unlike cloakers though, there is no way to tell if they are afk or not, they could very well be only 15km away, ready to blast you to smithereens, or they could be miles away from their computer cloaked on some safespot.that's why a system shuts down when there is a cloaker (or actually, just any red, but unlike normal decent pvpers you cannot hunt down the cloaker) in system."
12/28/2009,"this. thank god there are people that see the big picture rather than the narrow-minded ""in 0.0 u should be ready for an attack 24/7 but i dont have to be"" bllsht.cloaking in 0.0 is in essence clicking your pvp flag off while making everybody else be vigilant and prepared, even if the cloaker may be having ice cream with his buddies at the local store ."
12/28/2009,several modules in eve are fairly useless. i'm going to list two that i would like to be changed. if people agree please vote yes 1 or yes 2 and i will try to keep this post updated. if you want to add a module to the list with a suggested fix please do so.1) shield flux coil - suggested change....#1 dramatically increase shield recharge rate & slightly increase shield capacity drawback#2 reduce capacitor need of shield boosters and reduce recharge rate of shield2) capacitor flux coil - suggested change... dramatically increase capacitor recharge rate & slightly increase capacitor capacity drawback3) capacitor batteries - suggested change... increase of capacitor capacity bonus introduction of cap recharge rate drawback
12/28/2009,"shield flux coils (sfc) seem to be a redundent module. their drawbacks completly ruin their bonus. a shield power relay is a far better option. trading cap recharge rate for a passive shield recharge rate is far far more appealing than than removing a fair ammount of shield buffer.i suggest that the sfc be given a very large boost to shield recharge rate but also a larger drawback to shield capacity. this would give people the option of ""do i fit very high recharge rate with very little buffer (weak vs high alpha damage) or do i fit moderate recharge rate with good buffer""i just feel the sfc is totally outclassed by the spr and a change in how they work would giving some diversity to the passive fits out theresfc i fitting and parameters-cpu .....................20shield recharge time ....-25%shield...................-15%spr i fitting and parameters-cpu ...................20shield recharge time...-20%cap recharge time......+35%sfc i suggested change-cpu ...................20shield recharge time...-40%shield.................-20%"
12/28/2009,capacitor flux coils (cfc) which are harder to fit than capacitor power relays (cpr)give a much smaller overall bonus to cap recharge rate. losing some of your cap capacity with an underpowered bonus to cap recharge rates makes this module obselete.i would like to see the cfc recharge rate bonus increased significantly with a small increase to cap capacity drawback. this will give the pilot an option to fit for very high capacitor recharge rate but very low capacitor reserve. so you would be very vulnerable to heavy energy neuting but can pulse certain high cap usage modules relying on you very high cap recharge rate to recover sufficiant cap in a very short time.
12/28/2009,capacitor batteries which are harder to fit than cap boosters i believe are underpowered. i would like to see a change in the way they operate. i would like to see them given a larger boost to cap capacity but also a balanced drawback which removes any recharge rate bonus from having a larger capacitor.this would create a module that gives a pilot the option to have a very large capacitor but a normal recharge rate.
12/28/2009,i think what is needed for the capacitor batteries is to change from static values to precentages. the smaller ones have higher precentages but a significantly higher drawback tha way if you fit it on a friggate dealing with generally lower numbers the drawback isn't noticable but if you fit it onto say a battleship the drawback becomes overwhelming. that way the benifits change based more on your skills than just clunking down an extra chunk of cap
12/28/2009,"these are useless items i agree:more capacity buffer means more effective recharge naturally over time so this counters the point of the changes you suggest.you need to be a bit more inventive i think. 1) shield flux coil - reduces the cap use of local shield boosters, reduces passive shield regen.2) capacitor flux coil - more cap recharge, reduces ships power grid (higher fitting cost).3) capacitor batteries - increase capacitor capacity reduce effectiveness of capacitor neutralization."
12/28/2009,"capacitor flux coils are fine, i think. the fact that they are harder to fit and have drawbacks is balanced against the fact that active shield tankers can make use of them without nerfing their boost amount, unlike a cpr. cfc's also give a better effective recharge increase than pdu ii's.capacitor batteries need to be looked at, however."

12/28/2009,"i haven't found any disscusions on this, and if there were, i apoligize now for bringing it up again.dominion has introduced 3 new items into the game world into making systems better, claiming systems, and taking over systems. sovereignty blockade unitterritorial claim unitinfrastructure huband has had player owned stations for as long as i can remember. i have been sold on the idea, and i have sold other people onto the idea, that eve, has a player driven economy and just about everything in the game, that is meaningful, is bulit and sold by players. however, they are sold by npc's at a set price.why were bpo's not introduced?why also are they not avaliable for pos's? i can build an egg for a space station from a bpo but i can't for pos's or sbu's, tcu's, and ih's? i don't see the reason for this. is it to make sure smaller alliances/corps can not build them to cause havoc to the larger alliances? this, imho, puts the smaller corps/alliances at a disadvantage when they want to branch out into 0.0. alliances in 0.0 have access to higher dividend items - ore/rats/plex's/etc... so the price fixing does not faze them as much as the smaller ones. you take away from the industrialist feeding the war machine and making a profit from it, and also from them saving, and building items without paying for them. let eve be a truly free economy and let us build and sell what is in the game. if this can't be done, then please explain as to why not. in my short field of vision, i can not understand without explanation why this is not feasible."
12/28/2009,"wait... you think having bpo/bpcs for the sov structures will benefit small alliances more than large alliances? review your logic here...big alliances have more isk. big alliances have more mining capability.so... they have more ability to buy bpos and be the ones who sell the sov structures (and they probably would jack the prices as it is in their best interest that no one outside their alliance has them).small alliances have less isk. they have less mining capability.so... they are less likely to drop billions for a bpo to build something like that, instead relying on the available structures seeded by the big alliances at jacked prices. no, no. if you want smaller alliances to have a shot, the existing (npc driven) method is better."
12/28/2009,"i tend to disagree here. just because someone has more mining capabilities and/or isk, is that a reason to deny having a player driven economy? i, in my carebearish land, can buy a carrier bpo and build the ship, which btw cost way more than any pos, tcu, ih, or sbu's, and mine the ore with a smaller outfit than any alliance, and compete in price with the big boys.they, large corps/alliances, can purchase and build these massive ships and are not npc price set. so what makes these items any different? let the players build and compete for the business. or please make a better arguement as to why not."
12/28/2009,two words:game balance
12/28/2009,"please, could you be more clear? how does it affect game balance in a negative way. i am assuming it's negative because you did not say you agree with me. how can anyone buy a bpo for a carrier or titan, which costs far exceed that of the items discussed up above, yet these items you can not. they are npc/ccp price controlled, and almost all other game moduals/ships are not. please define how it ruins the game balance."
12/28/2009,/support
12/28/2009,"doubt it. caps require a dozen bpos, each around 1b, plus months of efficiency research to build at market prices. based on this, the structure bpos would either be billions each or require sub-assembly bpos (like caps) totaling billions. a small alliance would probably be aiming to control and develop one system (~2b in structures). they would have no need to manufacture more than 1 claim and 1 infrastructure unit.additionally, requiring these to be built would have led to a huge run on the mineral market as well as a much longer limbo period for the new sov system to be fully implemented. at this point, demand has significantly slackened for these structures (and will probably remain fairly low). the most important thing, however, is that manufacturing/buying these would be a huge *flashing* red light that would serve as week(s) of warning that an alliance was gearing up for war."
12/28/2009,"very good point and arguement. however, now that sov is fully implemented, there should be no reason not to. as for my example of carrier's and titans, it is just to show that we build it not npc's. we dictate what we think it's worth and how much we are willing to sell/buy it for (although i do build/sell my own carriers). as far as the warning goes to others that war is coming, i believe that is a bad excuse and here is why. every ship sold can be said that it is going to be used of war, i doubt people buy dreads and carriers to rat. and if the buying individual wanted to keep his identidy secret, he just needs to buy the item with an alt. and if he didn't and bought with his main, nowhere does it state who or when he's attaking.the point here is just letting the players of the industry trade (or anyone else) get in on this action even though they don't live in 0.0. let the free economy thrive."
12/28/2009,"i agree here with the op. and even though the demand has dropped, if they could be sold for less or the alliances themselves makes the items, then that could lead towards more aggression, which in turn makes the industry workers more isk. another income source, if you will./supported"
12/28/2009,"/supporti remember when you could buy shuttles (pre-built) via npc's. they took that away because of the cap it put on trit and it let players then really decide what trit should be bought/sold for. i agree that players should be able to build and sell these items.also on that note, let us remember ccp can still somewhat control (push towards) what they should sell for as they decide what minerals or components are needed to build the items."
12/28/2009,"hello!the strategic cruiser is a wonderful ship in terms of customization! you can make a lot of combinations to fill different roles you feel nessecary. one problem i see is that each time you want to do something different, you need to throw away your rigs and replace them with new (unless you can afford owning multiple).when you can refit subsystems anytime you please, why not create a subsystem for rigs that will hold a unique set that you can swap along with the other subsystems. the subsystem itself could cost a lot to make for all i care, i just think it is a flaw that can be corrected with the otherwise wonderful ship class."
12/28/2009,"don't kill the rigs. make war, not new rigs.read ftw. apparently this is not an issue."
12/28/2009,knowledgebase on tech 3
12/28/2009,"i don't think the op made himself clear, but i'm sure i understand what he wants:since i don't use t3's, i'm going to generalize:he has t3 ship with subsystems set up for pvp, his hull has 3 trimarks on it.he then decides he wants to switch subsystems around so his ship can be used for mining. unfortunately, his ship is stuck with trimarks, and he would have to destroy them to use cargo opts.what he's asking for is a subsystem slot especially for rigs, so the rigs can be switched out with the appropriate subsystem settings.unfortunately, that's a crappy idea and i don't support it. everyone has to deal with this. if i want my domi to be a fleet rr bs one day, neut domi the next, and a lvl 4 runner the third, i have to decide what rigs to permanently keep on my ship. or i can destroy and re-rig everytime i switch occupations, or i can just buy and rig 3 domis.there is nothing (except price) stopping you from purchasing more than one t3 hull and rigging each as you see fit. at least you only need one of each type of subsystem, and can play lego's all you like."

12/28/2009,"i like the concept, but i'd prefer at least seven days to be fair to the owners.i come across abandoned pos's all the time while exploring wormholes. i can't do anything to or with them. i can't destroy them because even in offline status without any fuel left, they're still hella difficult to kill.the vast majority of the time whenever i contact the owner, they're too lazy to go pick it up. they'd prefer to write it off as a 100% loss instead of paying a small locators fee.pos's that run out of fuel should auto unanchor in seven days."
12/28/2009,"this here is a mind-numbingly awful concept. so i log in, join fleet, and then i can go afk for 8 hours while my squad leader flies my ship around for me in a pretty formation?ahahahahahahaha. no. hilariously abusable, absurd, nonsense.how does a player 'break formation' exactly when the squad leader is doing the flying for them? this does nothing to prevent abuse because the whole concept is an abuse. we already have leadership bonuses and ganglinks doing these things passed down through the fleet, we already have the ability to set different bonuses for different squads/wings and segregate shiptypes accordingly, we don't need another layer of it tagged on randomly and we certainly don't need it to be enabled through what is effectively a sanctioned account-sharing scheme that you're proposing. you don't see the harm here? ok, imagine goonswarm fielding 3000-ship fleets 23/7 because we all logged in, handed our ships over to formation control of whichever squad leaders happened to be online at the time and then went off to work/class/sleep while a few active players multi-boxed us to glorious victory!no.and now, a more general point: the whole concept of formations, even in its generally used sense where the fc can use it to position his fleet elements in pre-defined gridpoints, still seems to be a buzzword, a solution in search of a problem.manouevering ships into the correct positions using multiple covops warpins, prepared bookmarks, clear orders, etc, is one of the most important abilities an fc requires. it creates opportunities for fleet members and commanders to make errors, and fleet command in eve is often about taking advantage when your opponent makes errors (for example: ""oh wow those idiots, they just gangwarped all their snipers into the gate-bubble, everyone jump go go go go go!"").giving the fc the hand of god where he presses a button and everyone in his fleet warps to exactly where he wants them to doesn't do anything to make eve a better game, instead it removes a layer of opportunism and human error from the process and takes players another step towards becoming mere passengers."
12/28/2009,...unless the squad leader only controls movement and the pilots still have to do the shooting. heh.

12/28/2009,"hello,some of you playing recently when the servers suddenly crashed would have been browsing around to figure out what was going on like myself. i went to this website first, but it was also down it seemed. and to be honest i was out of immediate options. i hear eve radio is good place to go in these cases but alas, its not official information.i actually did go to twitter, since im a follower of ccpgames and other game development companies fyi.but there was never a single mention about the dt, what happened, wether ccp was aware of it, or even working on it. nothing.and i got to say, by todays standards - considering other game companies ability to inform via twitter - this is hard to accept. why didnt ccp announce something to inform us eegerly - some frantically :) - awaiting players. i think ccp should start considering ways to communicate to us what happens and when servers will be back etc. when things like what happened yesterday happens. ie. server + official website down. twitter would be a good place to start. its a very good way to get in touch quickly and effectively with your clientelle regarding any issue really. it will also help portray a more serious side of ccp, because most of whats currently being posted there is immature to be honest. but thats for a different topic.ccp, my request is for you to improve on your communications toward us. and my suggestion is to use twitter for this.kind regards,wesf"
12/28/2009,imho ... make the main website more stable and use that for informing about outages. using a 3rd party site should be the last possible option.
12/28/2009,ok wormholes and more rare ore wooptie do go ahead and raise prices of hulks to capatilize on corperations going out on expiditions into uncharted space. it has been about a month since dominion came out and the prices have stayed at around 200 mil nearly double what the ship costs to manufacture. you have already cashed in on the boom now can you please return the damn prices to normal so the low sec miners dont go ****ing broke. mining has never been as profitable as missioning and cashing in on corperations is fine but enough gouging the solo's already. and people always wonder why there arent more mining chars sheesh.
12/28/2009,"delicious tears. in dominion the build requirements have been changed for hulks. this has lead directly to a hefty increase in the cost of building hulks. see many, many threads discussing the issue in market discussions.whinging about it won't lower prices, so htfu.(also, this thread doesn't belong in assembly hall. gtfo. )"
12/28/2009,"you obviously were not around for the 500 mil pre-invention hulk prices.180-200 mil prices are cheap, so your whine is baseless.and this thread belongs in science and industry."
12/28/2009,"if hulks are too pricey, use a covetor.edit: and what the hell does this have to do with the csm? shouldn't it go in market discussion or something?"
12/28/2009,get used to it. 200m is normal now and producers aren't making any more money from them than they were when hulks were 100m each. say thank you to the new build requirements and the technetium bottleneck pushing nanotransistors to about 4 times their pre-dominion price.
12/28/2009,"looked around, couldnt find anything, so here goes:for a multitude of obvious reasons i dont really want to list, docking-games is one of the most ridiculous and hilariously lame things that go in low-sec/empire wars.my suggestion is simple and easy (and shamelessly stolen from somewhere else)make the ""no-docking allowed"" timer from engaging in pvp last for 10 minutes if you're on-grid with a station when you fight (only for the station you're on-grid with). imo, it makes sense as far as game mechanics go as well as fluffwise and might even take some of the smack out of the docking-range heroes. basically, if you dont want to risk your ship, you shouldnt be fighting in it.edit:doh, of course i found another proposal regarding docking-games 30 seconds after i posted this... ("
12/28/2009,"i completely agree to a freezing of the fw map (reset, where sovereignty equals occupancy) either by ccp or by the players. if we wanted to hold a pilot's boycott on plexing, to make a point, i would be in favour of negotiating this on the minmatar/amarr front."
12/28/2009,"i would like to see all ships scaled down a touch, and then rebalance their size relative to each other. i think some of the larger ships are too small compared to bs. so i would be perfectly happy if they just made everything smaller and made the big ships look bigger.also, ccp please fix the bm locations for some stations. a lot of minmatar stations have you warping to the lower superstructure of the station yet the docking bays are at the top! wtf???"
12/28/2009,"so, for those of you discussing the warp through planet theory, and the slow down trajectory change, etc. if you're going to get technical about it. a warp drive warps space around a warp bubble, the ship itself doesn't move at all, while the space around it moves at faster than light speed. explained here:"
12/28/2009,"i agree, the art dept needs to take a serious look at scale. not only planets/moons, but even between ships (as has been mentioned before). the ship size chart is definitely not reflected in-game."
12/28/2009,"i see people posting ideas to reform insurance as a bandaid for the current market situation, everything is so cheap due to cheap minerals that there is practically no loss after insurance payout. changing the insurance policy would be complicated and would only be a temporary fix until the market swung around later due to other game fluctuations.i propose keeping the current insurance values, they are there for a good reason.the fix for the market should come via inflation in the amount of minerals to build a ship. it is quite simple really, lets say as pod pilots grow in number, the complexity of their ships increase meaning more minerals are needed for their hulls.by increasing the amount of minerals needed across the board for all ships by 5-10-30-50% or whatever the dev's feel appropriate the cost of ships will go back to normal. they can always reduce this inflation as the market gets unbalanced depending on carebear to pvp activity. it is simple because it is percentage based inflation affecting all ships, and is long term because it can be adjusted back and forth just as easily. it would also preserve insurance on ships to make t1 ships affordable for those who do not have 10 hours a day to play and make isk in a not so insanely deflated economy.market control through mineral requirements for ships, that is my idea."
12/28/2009,"i think this is one of those ideas that seems good at first. i can see plenty of issues, though. all of them accept as a given that self destructing ships for insurance is a rampant, market moving practice. i don't accept that myself but it seems to be what leads to this sort of post.1. if mineral use moves on a sliding scale, you have a new variable beyond insurance. large operators can increase production to drive up the cost of each individual ship not just for themselves but everyone else. this raises the insurance payout. then they pop their less expensive ships for the payout of the now more expensive same ship made today.2. speculation on ships will increase. people will buy when they're low production value and sell when they get high. what you'd have is spurts of building and selling. this won't change market swings, it will make them wilder. this will go out to the mineral market as well, as the demand for minerals will be based on whether ships are in a build cycle or a sell cycle.3. the potential exists to build a ship, wait for the mineral requirements to go up and reprocess it for more minerals than you started with.right now there is a single major market control, insurance payouts. every ship i've seen at market is within about 1% of its payout. anyone who goes too much above this will find themselves undercut. the value of ships is actually stable. in fact if more people built them for insurance fraud, the demand for minerals would go up.if you look at the mineral costs to build a t1 ship compared to the base values used to determine insurance you'll see that the higher end minerals are vastly more expensive than their base value. its the low ones like tritanium and pyerite that are the problem. there is so much supply that even with the massive amounts needed, the price has dropped to half or less of the base value. the best way to raise it would be to decrease supply and increase supply of higher end minerals. in other words more miners need to start spending an hour or two a day in lowsec instead of 10 or more macro mining in highsec."

12/29/2009,supported. what gets me is that privateer alliance are the ones asking for this yet there the ones i see use this the most.
12/29/2009,"spas i see the point you made and would be open to the idea that if you are repping someone in your corp or alliance the rules should be different. i mean from a scouting perspective the enemy could see you had those reppers before engaging. however, i still think repping someone who is engaged in combat should be counted as aggression. maybe there could be a rule that would say that repping someone that is not aggressing (other than by repping) would not trigger a new agression countdown. in other words make it so reppers are in the fight at least as much as the guy they are repping but not necessarily more than that. there are various ways they could work that out. but i'm not sure its necessary or good. i'm just saying there are other options.heres an example of how it might work. you and your corpmates are in a rr bs gang on a gate. some sniping bses come and hit one of your gang. as long as he doesn't attack them you guys would all be able to rep him and still jump through the gate. but if he starts firing back and then you all rep him you are all then agressed. your situation could have various rules that apply. i would suggest that repping itself does not trigger a new aggression countdown *unless* the person you repped still had an aggression countdown based on the current agro rules. so if you rep someone who has 2 seconds left on their aggro pursuant to the current rules you would earn yourself a whole new timer. but when you rep that person in your next cycle say 10 seconds later that rep would not add to your timer at all. if someone repped you and you were only repping then they would inherit the same countdown you have - no more no less. the current mechanic is so bad anything would be an improvement. however, i think if they are going to fix this they should just get it right."
12/29/2009,well since i see lots of support for the idea that 20 is too many ill add a note of possibly being only 10....we just figure 20 was the max u can fit b4 it gets so big that u can fit a niddy in there lol

12/29/2009,"not supported, for the reasons already cited.what i think should be looked at is the fact that after jumping with the fleet you will have lost the bonus, then reapplied, so there is shield missing. this could be solved by adding a grace timer to bridge the jumping period, 10 seconds or so.this is lame, armor tanking has its own problems and there are shield mods without armor equivalents as well"
12/29/2009,"fully supported , lets remove instant armor hp gain, they can still rep them back to the bonused maximum."
12/29/2009,gang shield tanks need a looking at.further issues are the stupid req's for shield transfer arrays+ shield transfer arrays should boost more than there armor equivs to make up for lower base resists in the same fashion that solo shield boosters can boost more hp than armor equivs.currently 90% of rr gangs using armor shows us that shield rr is broken.when gang bonuses are applied the shield charged % should remain the same imo.so 100% shield before is 100% after gang bonuses applied90% shield before is 90% after gang bonuses applied etc.
12/29/2009,awesome so you're arguing in this thread but you don't understand what ehp is (hint: it's not the same as raw hp).

12/29/2009,regen and repair rate is also ehp as they are also hp that the incoming dps has to defeat.
12/29/2009,"i agree and yet not.regen and repair rate are better compared to dps. essentially, ehp is a more informative number when considering an alpha strike or enough firepower which will easily overcome regeneration rates--i.e. you've been called primary, so your regen doesn't matter--it's your ehp that sits between you and a lost ship. attackers have to deal approximately the ehp damage in order to rapidly kill a target. however, in a fight where that's not possible, they instead must overcome the regeneration to get the kill."

12/29/2009,it seems like this should be a fairly easy thing for ccp to do. hopefully the csm can squeeze this into a meeting.
12/29/2009,"going to have to support malcanis on this one. i understand that prices on ships will go down, but i can't help but think that when/if there were *no* insurance payout, a lot of people would do much less pvp.if, in effect your making isk when a ship is blown up, taking insurance right out (as fillius wants) would up the cost to *me* to where i would really step back and either fly something much smaller, or stop flying pvp at all... vovi still support modding/removing insurance because insurance fraud as an industry is wrong!"
12/29/2009,"so you want to base it on. . .let's say 90% of the mean price of completed orders for a given mineral in the last. . .week (month, six months, year)? the basic problem is the same one as pegging it to actual ship price. i may not be able to manipulate the real sell price, the price that someone else pays for minerals, i grant. two operators with a few billion between them can drive the value of completed orders of tritanium up pretty quickly, though. depending on the calculations, you might be able to throw them off by having one sell many units to the other at slightly higher than market value or by selling a very few units at an insanely high value. no matter what the system is, static or dynamic, someone will find a way to game it. i consider most of this immaterial, though, after looking at actual price vs base price of minerals. the entire argument that insurance is a problem is based on two assumptions:demand for minerals exceeds non-fraud supply.mineral prices are artificially high as a result of this.its also taken as a given that the amount of low skill highsec mining taking place vastly exceeds high skill lowsec. i agree with that.based on these givens, one would expect that higher base price (ie rarer) minerals would be more inflated above their base price while low end minerals would be less inflated or deflated. since all of them together have to add up to the price of one ship, the adjustments have to balance out somewhere. if you look at the actual numbers, tritanium actually sells for more than its base price while megacyte sells for about a third. this is not a result that supports the two fundamental arguments."
12/29/2009,how about having in the graphics options show custom palette (shows customized palette of ships)show corp logo (shows the corp logo somewhere standard on the ship)show alliance logo (shows the alliance logo instead of the corp logo in the same place on the ship)like that people can chose to turn it on/off depending if they want quality or performance.
12/29/2009,"the fact is ccp is devoting an entire part of it's company to walking in stations which is pointless graphical fluff.if they are going to do these types of things, they should include a relatively small option <- option to have custom ship colors. i will never agree with decals, as thats custom data to load as opposed to rgb numbers client side.a simply rgb paint job would suit me nicely, and allow me to tolerate more functional ships because i can pretty them up a tad. also, no one has been able to give me a technical example of how this would impact a fleet fight. most large fleets turn all their graphics all the way down and zoom out anyway. this would simply be an extra option for those of us on max shaders and textures in high sec. tl;dr. yes ccp is going to make pointless graphical fluff, so at least give us the pointless fluff we ask for."
12/29/2009,"i think the following are all good ideas and valid points.however i can understand why, for a lot of reasons from server load to preserving the look of eve, there will be those that are against.i say, at least give the option to have your corp and alliance logo on your ship, maybe even automaticaly assigned fleet, squadron and wing logos/numbers on the ships. that was the original skin isn't changed, just added to :)"

12/29/2009,free **********!by banning the name of a character (i typed above) instrumental in uncovering the whole nasty bob related events a while ago it's made ccp reek of a quasi fascist stance on controlling their customers' voices. unfortunately this still goes on.when the player base rises en masse against a single topic instead of responding quickly and openly they are more likely to mass delete every post and thread concerning the issue in the hope it will simply go away. it's sometimes pretty scary/depressing seeing it go on.

12/29/2009,"agreed, i'd support this with more, but i currently an unable to for replicating a thread of mine that was deemed permissible 3 month prior."
12/29/2009,"thought i would respond my my main for the lulz here. the first bolded part is the primary problem here. you have made a case for what you think are the considerations that go into determining cargohold size. hypothetically speaking its as likely as anything that the other; that is to say gun-battlecruisers, get a larger cargohold because they are capable of more varied tasks than the drake, such as mining, afterall not all miners use cans. i wont deny its viable options in either pvp or pve are limited, but thats not the issue. the fact you think the cargoholds are designed a certain way does not mean they are, for all we know they may be completely arbitrary numbers. the fact that i ""have refuted none of them"" is again because you dont understand what im doing. i am trying to get you to refine your argument properly here, since in this instance i see no reason to grief you like i am doing to other proposals atm.as to the second part i bolded....well thats the reason im using my main. you see, anyone who is aware of the current political enrironment in eve might be aware that there is something of a kerfuffle going on in pure blind and geminate atm, both region being controlled by norther coalition alliances. i happen to belong to one of them. this kerfuffle is burning through ships and ammunition rather quickly. awesome thing is, i figured i only need to bring 1k or 1.5k ammo and a few boosters with me on an op because 1) it stops me being wasteful with the boosters, 2)it saves me money when my ship dies, and i barely operate hand to mouth in eve, and 3) taking less boosters might theoreticall mean less cap stability, but as i say cap stability is unimportant in subcapital warfare. if you need to run an mwd for long enough to burn through more than 1 booster youve already screwed up, and chances are your fleets burning all around you aswell. lastly, i dont know where you get your capital fits from, but last i checked cap boosters werent exactly considered ""standard"" or even ""sane"" fittings, you might want to hit the killboards to see what kinda stuff you should be fitting"
12/29/2009,"yes, it is based on what i think are the considerations. it is anecdotal and circumstantial. is also based on and correlated to facts. in every single class of ship, from titan to frig, missile ships have the largest hold in their class. projectile ships have the second largest. there are only two times when this is not true. 1. mining/industial bonused ships (because of their role) and the drake. every........... single ............class.anecdotal and circumstantial? yes, but also compelling. it is one thing to call my evidence circumstantial. problem is a mountain of anecdotal and circumstantial evidence can send a man to death row if it is uncountered. they teach that in even online law schools. now if you really want to help me ""refine"" my post, how about you get to work showing how charge m3 is not correlated to hold size. that's how adults debate. ad hominem and obfuscation worked well in the frat house, but i find that boring now.so your play style > all others. got it. i mentioned cap charges without any mention of capital ships. then you said:you brought up cap ships. i did not. i did not understand what you meant, but it seems to imply that no one should be fitting boosters on any ship as cap only matters in capital ships. perhaps that is not what you meant. next time be clearer. i do not fly caps and do not care to. i do know however that many setups for ships from frig to bb call for cap boosters. 0.0 is not the only place pvp happens."

12/29/2009,"i always have been and still am a very strong proponent for some sort of cloak-finding method. and as i've mentioned in the past, as necessity, it should be far more skill intensive (both sp and player skill) to find a cloaker, especially in covert-ops type ships, but it should still be possible somehow, to require the cloakers still be attentive.perhaps something like a specialized probe with a severely limited range, and perhaps even require more than simple triangulation. (say, for example, eight of these probes must all intersect on the cloaker's location to finally get a 100% fix... y'know, give astrometrics 5 some real use other than just as a pre-req for other skills).in any case, it's not how it's done that's so important as the fact that there should be some way to do it."
12/29/2009,"you know, i was utterly sure this was a horrible horrible troll about people who cry about intel gathering, but i'll bite. see my earlier post for my opinion that still stands.for one, the few hulls that can use cloaks to any advantage are not the omfgsodangerouzsz you're thinking about here. since i'll assume you're not completely ******ed, i'll say you're talking about covert ops cloaks here. so lets break down what vessels can actually use these, and what they do.covert ops - scout ship. functionally no weapons at all, and all it would be used for is intel and probing. stealth bombers - the one ship you are specifically targeting in this. torpedoes are not exactly functional on anything below a battleship, unless you screw over what little tank you have for target painters. even then, you need at least 3-4 sb's to do anything significant. sidenote: bombs are a one trick pony. you have a specific amount of damage vs one resist. the only time these will actually kill something is when you have an enormous sig radius (frigates with mwd on being a specific example). most of the time, if you're in a moving cruiser with no mwd on you really don't have a problem. your specific examples (which i find personally hilarious) are hulks. considering the type of tank you can stick on a hulk, if you get killed by a single bomber either your skills suck incredibly or you're a ******. if you're standing still and multiple bombers bomb you, you're going to die. get over it. trying to cry nerf on dying to bombs due to cloak is barking up the wrong tree.recons - one recon per race, and the recons that can use a cloak aren't exactly dps machines. very much hoping you're not complaining about these.your entire argument is based on two things: 1. cloakers being able to gather intel in a system with no consequences, and 2. bombers being able to gank lone ships. if a cloaker is gathering intel, so be it. covops are specifically designed for this. if you're keeping your eyes open while mining, you shouldn't be having a problem with avoiding a gank. if you don't know what to do when you see local spike up, or you're not keeping your eye on d-scan, get the hell out of my 0.0 and stop trying to dumb down my game. bombers can gather intel and have an offensive punch, but they are hardly the invincible powerhouses you're crying like children over. if you aren't aligned to a celestial while mining, and just sit there while the bomber makes a bombing run (and the bomb travels the distance to get to you), you deserve to die. as stated, it's 0.0... and it's called nullsec for a reason. no stations to run to, no police to help you... you have to keep your eyes and wits about you.can't do that? stop playing my game."
12/29/2009,directional scan can not pick up cloaked ships only their probes which no one needs to use when every single belt is easily accessible from the right click menu. how about you learn how to play the game before you talk.
12/29/2009,"there's usually more than enough reds in total around, and with cov-ops cynos they can gank your freighter in seconds.and you are right we are (or at least i am) quite specifically targeting stealth bombers, as that has become the de facto ship to fly. if every red, their kitchen sink and their grandmothers are flying sb's instead of the previous mix of other ships, i'd say there is some kind of unbalance there.sb's are even brave enough to lob a bomb at industrials that jumped through a jb at a deathstar with several other (active!) ships there as well. i've no idea how much damage it would've done as i hit warp before the bomb arrived, but they have to derive their sense of invincibility from somewhere ;) i didn't spot him on the killboard afterwards, so he got away with it..."
12/29/2009,last night i spent over ten minutes slowing and painfully killing a brutix.in my arazu.i then cloaked and chuckled at this thread and the zillion other fails just like it.btw op...i note you have yet to kill anything in your pilgrim.
12/29/2009,"that's the thing though, every red and their mother aren't flying sbs. in actuality, if you see a multitude of reds in local, that usually points to a gang... which will have a mixed group of ships. at most, you may have 2-4 sbs in a large gang. you're generalizing in saying that everyone is flying an sb, and you'll see why i say that below.the point remains, a gang of sbs have a very select group of targets to pick from. they can't tackle, they have very little tank to begin with, and to gank anything below bs you need 2-3 of them with no tank at all and nothing but tps. slow targets like freighters and industrials along with bs and above are the only targets an all sb gang can feasibly kill. anything else, and their dead. sbs and cloaks have plenty of weaknesses (can't cloak while being targeted, limited target range, paper thin tank) that it is balanced as is.i'm having trouble comprehending the intelligence you would need to have to formulate this response from my diatribe. you yourself even answered your own stupidity in the same paragraph.you are whining about covert ops gathering intel. gathering intel for what? a gank of course. if you keep an eye on your d-scan, guess wut? ohai i can see probes and other ships close by that may be warping to me! i can even warp out before they get to me if i'm aligned like a smart person! whheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!.you have no idea the drop my iq took just posting half that answer in caps. you've proven you have no reason to be in lowsec, let alone nullsec. please get out now."
12/29/2009,"in a gang, you're absolutely right. the proposal itself however was about ""are they afk or not?""-solo reds, and those are more often than not in a sb or something else with a cloak.i for one am not against cloaks per se (and neither was the original proposal, we seem to be straying a bit), i am however against a single person being able to put an entire system on edge for hours and hours while being totally free from risk, so much so he might as well be out watching a movie or something.the very first thing the forum trolls as they are so lovingly called shout when someone proposes something to make eve simpler or less tedious is ""your [sic] supposed to _play_ the game, not [get free (money|kills|bonusses)|let the game do everything for you|whatever]"" and i'd say that school of thought applies here as well."
12/29/2009,let the carebearification of 0.0 begin.the whole essence of a sovereignty holding alliances existence in 0.0 is just this - to provide a secure environment from which to power the economy and political wellbeing of said alliance.if an alliance does its job in 0.0 then its reasonably safe for an aware pilot to rat or mine providing they follow intel. the rewards of industrial 0.0 are completely off the scale compared to any hi-sec or low-sec endeavor. if you want the rewards you have to take the risk. this is why alliances exist and why people join them.changing cloaking in any way removes an incredible portion of that risk. flying a lone cloaked ship in 0.0 being something i've done a good deal of i can tell you the bomber pilot who moves through hostile 0.0 is in more danger than anyone ratting or mining in their alliances' held space.
12/29/2009,"well, insofar as being afk cloaked... there's not much you can do about it. introducing some sort of bay for fuel wouldn't work, as you would have to do it for all cloakers... not just sbs. and you would have to do it in such a way that it doesn't limit anything else on the ship. most roams i go in last longer than 4 hours, and in 0.0 you basically have nowhere to go to refuel a bay or something of the sort so a bay would limit and hinder active cloakers and not just supposedly afk ones.i wouldn't be adverse to the ""afk x amount of minutes, kick offline"", but you would have to extend it to everyone, not just cloakers. if someone is afk at a pos, or afk outside a station in high-sec or even afk in a station... they should be booted just the same as an afk cloaker. you can't pinpoint one specific ship for something that would be as big as making a timer for afking. there's also the problem of ccp defining what is afk. is afk sitting in space not moving at all? is afk being cloaked, but moving in one direction? cloaked while orbiting for x minutes? all these things have to be taken into account, because if you're scouting in a cloaked ship... chances are you will be doing one of those three things listed (stationary, orbitting a fixed point or moving in one direction)."
12/29/2009,"this is why i suggested having a balanced drawback of capacitor recharge rate with the battery to prevent getting a much higher recharge rate from a larger capacitor buffer.a capacitor ""buffer"" is how i would like to see these modules operate but not give the pilot a hidden bonus of recharge rate like the lse's give you right now."
12/29/2009,"cfc's are harder to fit however give a smaller boost to capacitor recharge rate after removing a chunk of the ships cap. a pdu gives you 5 bonuses to your ship (pg, cap, cap recharge, shield, shield recharge) which is why the bonus is smaller. its more of a ""jack of all engineering modules, master of none"" kind of module.what i'm suggesting is that the cfc become more of an option for other people than active shield tankers to fit it. however i do also see your point that it is the shield tankers module and the cpr is the armour tankers module (i'm an armour tanker and i missed that point all together )"
12/29/2009,"3 different mods in 1 post makes it difficult to support anything.i woulda supported changes to sfc's and cap batteries, although not neccessarilly the changes you advocate.cfc's are fine imo they have there uses.cap batteries could do with lower fittings. there use over cap rechargers is a vary rare occurance , well at least with fits i've made."

12/29/2009,"by game balance i mean isk sink. currently all alliances have to pay isk as a hard cost outside the alliance to claim and maintain sov in an area. they can't write it off as a soft cost of just making something internally. it's much the same reason that many of the fuel components for pos's aren't available anywhere except via npc's. a large alliance with deep pockets could buy the bpo's and then manufacture all of these items they want/need which could, depending on research levels and other factors, significantly reduce the amount they pay to claim and maintain sov over their areas. the intention of the sov changes was not to reduce the cost of sov, according to the dev blogs that were published on the changes prior to dominion's release."
12/29/2009,op is a ridiculous lil cryin babby
12/29/2009,"hmmm... i agree. with the op, that is. of course, rt training is one of eves strongpoints but is needed because the skills' training time often spans multiple days making out-of-game-training absolutely necessary. but as my favourite game reviewer once said: ""seriously, why am i being rewarded for not playing the game?""i think all players should have a 1.05-1.10 training time multiplier by default which drops by 0.01 for every week the character does not do xxx (maybe modify his trade orders?) until 1.00 is reached. i'd even go there and suggest giving an additional *permanent* 1% for every year of active subscriptions.edit: explanation: when real-time-training is due to long training times, the burden of tedious skilling is lifted with faster training, making the game more fun to play."

(maxed at 5 installed fleet drone tactician modules (1 per level in fleet drone commandships?), as a fleet cannot be larger than 250 to begin with)furthermore, as these specialised fleet drone tactician ships can use fleet drone tactician modules, they will now also be able to fit drone control units on a sub-capital class hull."

12/30/2009,"finding clocked ships is a whole other subject, but as you mentioned it.* finding ships with a prototype/improved cloak fitted - fine, come up with some sensible mechanism.* finding ships with a covert ops cloak fitted - nope that would break them utterly.i like how it is now cowardly to lurk in a system and watch for targets, some would say it is a valid form of intel that people have been able to avoid doing because of local if you are that scared of an afk covops/recon in your system then you'll love the no local idea because then they won't show up there to frighten you to answer some of the other comments. removing character info (unless you speak) from local will not change how you find targets if you are in hostile space. you'll have a local beacon count to show there are people in system but you won't get free intel on the corp/alliance etc.it is by design that you won't know how many of those people in local are friendly, you have to decide on talking in local to get friendlies to reply (and give free intel) or being slightly paranoid. perhaps there could be an option to transmit a ""friend or foe"" so you show up in local as now, but then it becomes your choice (and you give free intel to lurking spys )this proposed change is for 0.0 only because it would make empire a very lonely place. you could say the empires require all ships in their space to transmit a friend or foe beacon. this type of system upgrade might be available to sov 0.0 space too.the actual mechanisms are up for discussion (we're looking at the bigger picture not the minutiae of implementation) but the concept is one i think worth pursuing."
12/30/2009,"you don't see a blob because of the fear of trapping a fleet in wh space with the only exit dropping them 40+ jumps (partially through high sec where some pilots in any fleet wouldn't be able to travel) from their home systems. worse, the fleet might end up having to break up and travel multiple separate 40+ jump routes as whs have been known to collapse after only some of the pilots go through. it has more to do with the unpleasant flight back than anything else. no fc in their right mind would risk this."
12/30/2009,"the people who complain about local being a super tool for pve and preventing pvp have not run a roam, been a scout, or simply just been on a pvp roam.why ""local"" is an even more important tool for pvp than pve:1. local allows a roaming gang to quickly find targets (pvp fleets usually fly through a dozen empty systems before a scout finds targets in local to kill).2. local let's pvpers know if their prey has fled the system/logged off.3. local spikes let pvpers know that another gang (usually a defense fleet) has arrived to drive them off or kill them.4. local lets a roaming gang know where a defense fleet is so they can escape.in short, if local was removed, roaming pvp gangs would cease to exist. they would be forced to move a lot slower - as the scouts would have to spend a lot more time searching each system to find out if there are potential targets. hours of boredom while looking for something to kill wouldn't be balanced out by that random raven kill. when the roaming gang is discovered (as they always are), the defense fleet would have a significant advantage over the roaming gang. roaming gangs would die.most gate camps would also cease to exist. generally, they have a network of alts in various systems near the camp to find incoming targets so the camp can be at the appropriate gate to kill them (otherwise, they will slip through). also, those alts let the camp know when a fleet is coming to break up the camp (as usually ends up happening). if they didn't have local, those alts would be near impossible to use. camps would rarely catch people, so pvpers would stop willingly sitting in a single system with others, waiting for something to kill.in short, you need a different intel system if you want to get rid of local. this is why i came up with this idea. it would fulfill the same function as the existing ""local as intel"" while penalizing both pvp and pve blobs (the bigger they are, the less local intel they would have)."

12/30/2009,"you're right, most drone boats have perfectly viable fits... what does that have to do with not giving players the option of enhancing a drone's damage just like missiles and turrets?as i do not use missiles, i have no idea if this is true or not. however, my loldari alt is training up at this moment to be my primary isk source. if there's anything that needs changing, then start a thread. if its a reasonably thought out post, i'll have no problem supporting it.curse/pilgrim?there's lots of viable fits, sure, but sometimes people don't use them. most of my pvp time in a domi is in a fleet rr/neut setup, with zero guns. that leaves me with 2 implant slots which would be best served with drone damage implants.the rest of my pvp time is in cruisers/bc's, so i have hybrid damage implants (all/medium) in my head.then of course, there's domi mission runners. i know some use guns, i know some don't. i'm one that doesn't. its slower, but i don't have to worry about rails vs blasters, ammo/range types, grid for the guns, and cargo for the ammo.why shouldn't i have the option of having a clone with drone damage implants?"

12/30/2009,"there must be some stronger penalties for team killers in faction war.i understand that individuals who do this get a massive faction hit when killing other militia members. however, there are corporations in militia who make team killing a policy and when their faction standings get too low they repair them so they can keep team killing, even under the current penalty system. they seem to do this over and over again and remain in militia to continue to team kill.the militia is a defacto alliance between corporations and members of a given militia. members should not be allowed to continue to team kill and repair their faction standings. this goes against the very nature of faction war designed by ccp, otherwise there would not be faction militias or the need to install some degree of penalty for team killing to begin with.ccp allows for militia corporations to wardeck each other and it should be left at that. however, these team killing corporations prey on the fact that people dont see them in their overviews which are 99% of the time set to only see neutrals or opposing militia war targets, and when they are set to see everyone do not expect members of the same militia (who they are not at war with) to make an organized effort to kill them.i propose that the penalties be increased so great that after a couple times of doing this the memeber cannot recover their faction standings which will go towards corporation faction standings.corporations who wish to engage fellow militia members should rely on the wardec system, not be allowed to team kill and repair their faction standings to team kill again."
12/30/2009,i support this idea as it is one of the reasons that i am hesitant to join fw.
12/30/2009,i presume that when you say team killing you mean friendly fire from corp to corp?
12/30/2009,"yes, when both corps are in the same militia and no wardec exists."
12/30/2009,that's not good....and the war-dec thing imho shouldn't be possible if your in the same militia.
12/30/2009,"the only reason the ""team killing"" mechanic is allowed in corporations and alliances which is why the mechanic hasn't been questioned before is because in corporations and alliances, players have the ability of policing such behavior (i.e. kicking offending players/corporations). as fw factions function similar to alliances, make it a 24 hour vote to kick a player from the faction (initiated by a friendly kill). additionally, just having a system in place to vote to kick people/corps from a faction would probably take care of several other annoyances i've heard people mention about the fw mechanics. this is a sandbox, players are supposed to have control."
12/30/2009,1
12/30/2009,"needs to be applied to corporation as well. you can have a corp with good standing and a few -10 pilots in it that can essentially kill at will with no hit whatsoever since their contribution to corp standings is already maxed out.while at it, sort the embarrassing standings hit for actions in null-sec!"
12/30/2009,"this is something i have thought much about. i agree. however, it is an idea that i dont see that ccp will entertain."
12/30/2009,"this gets my vote too. it does not make any sense that a corp in an fw militia can wardec another corp in the same militia. in a normal alliance such an action would result in you being expelled. i don't like the idea of corps (or pilots) being expelled from militia by some sort of a vote, that would bring all sorts of risks of misuse, so why not just change the game mechanics to prevent wardecs inside militia?"
12/30/2009,this is not about alliances.this is about militias... and while i do not play fw... i whole heartedly disagree with anyone making a comparison as such.the alliance does not answer to any empire or any faction as they are indipendent to themselves aside from paying dues to concord.the militia is essentially an extension of said empire... therefore the empire would enforce certain stipulations... forcing a non-friendly fire mechanic to take place inducing war-dec makes the most logical sense.if you want to war-dec... you should leave the militia and then war-dec.if you want to team kill... the penalty should be severe.... if not resulting instant sec-loss likening to getting a concord penalty.either way the current system is not something i call balanced.tldr - the militia is nothing like an alliance. mechanic shouldn't apply here.
12/30/2009,"perhaps among other things, the ability to ""lock"" a character, and a two-week delay to unlock them for sale or deletion. after all, people seldom sell a character on the spur of the moment."
12/30/2009,"i agree that something needs to be done, but stopping character transfers i don't feel is the correct solution.the issue is how to ensure that the owner of the account is agreeing to transfer the character. at the moment this is done simply by username, password and also the credit card used to provide the transfer.the first part is easily circumvented by various techniques (keylogers, phishing, hacking forums where people have the same username and password as their game account) etc.the second part is circumvented by using a stolen credit card.so the current attack will be something like the following (assuming ccp check the address on the account with that of the credit card).obtain login details via email scam etcchange the account's user details to match the stolen credit card details and the email addressstrip any assets worth selling by repeatedly undocking and ejecting so an alt can board (watch for people doing this and report them asap).post a character sale threadsell the character paying with the stolen credit cardlaunder the iski suggest that the character transfer system be modified asap to do something like the following.lock all transfers by defaultto unlock a character you must confirm via an email linkchanging email address locks the transfers for 3 months (for example), emails the old address to say that it was changed and flags the account to the gms. the old address will also remain on the account and be notified of changes until the 3 months are up or an email address change confirmation is clicked.changing account owner, address or billing details should send a notification to the email address(es) assigned to the account and also flag the account in some waythis is just a quick look and i might have missed something out. hopefully this would allow transfers to be initiated by legitimate parties but make it very hard to do so maliciously. there might be things to tweak a bit such as sending confirmations more than once in case the email doesn't get though but that is still better than the current system.i am aware however that more official emails from ccp with links to click might have the undesirable effect of allowing scammers to send something similar. perhaps no link but instructions to type eveonline.com into their browser and cut and paste a key into a special page there.ccp also need to retain logs related to people ejecting from ships and track who is taking them to facilitate recovery of assets from hacked accounts.one final thing.ccp should run a query over the user database looking for any accounts where the account name is the same as a character on that account. those (active) people should be contacted and given the option to have their account login renamed to something else.the first step in avoiding these kinds of scams is to have a different account name from your character. if you see an email addressed to charname not accountname then you might be more suspicious (though i believe ccp send out emails with the charname instead for special reactivation offers - bad ccp )"

12/30/2009,"while it's not a major flaw, there's no reason why it can't be fixed with a very simple solution: when you are first scrambled (or, if you have stabs, when scram strength exceeds your warp strength) you should get an aura announcement ""your warp drive is disabled."" when you have cleared all the scrambling you should get another clear announcement ""your warp drive is online again."" even better, this should also apply when you're in a bubble, so you get notified the instant you're clear of it."

12/30/2009,"actually...1) i was implying that pilots should not need large amounts of cap boosters because cap stability is not an issue in sub capital fights. i passed no comments regarding cap boosters being used by capitals, that was you either mis reading or attempting to obfuscate the situation.2) im simply stating my play style=/=your assertion of what my play style is, not my play style=the best play style. again this is either your misunderstanding or an attempt to make me look the fool.and responding to your first point last...3)you are ignoring multiplicity of roles, which is something i did infact imply might be a possible cause. it is entirely possible (however unlikely i consider it personally) that ships such as the cyclone have a larger cargohold than the drake because given their preference for turrets they are able to do one thing the drake cannot; mine. as such it is possible that the drake, as a dedicated missile-dps boat, was not thought to need a cargohold as large as ships which can be used in small scale mining operations. as i say, i do not argue the point on the drake having limited roles, i am infact arguing that this limitation might be the cause, not the result, of its smaller cargohold."

12/31/2009,"dude, chill. telling me to shut up and that i've been proved wrong several times doesn't help you at all. i could say the same exact thing to you.missiles are all damage weapons, they can use all types of damage, but that does not mean you have to. that also does not mean they should get bonused to all 4 types. missiles always hit, always hit within their (usually pretty large) range, and depending on what types of missiles, tend to do very good dps. also, they are capless, have the option of using any type of damage. that is alot of good things about missiles. is it really too much to just accept some of caldari's ships only get bonused to kinetic, which is what your race's flavor is anyways? yes other races get multiple damage types, but for gallente and amarr, those are the only two damage types, so it can't really be viewed as a tactical advantage cause they would be shooting those damages all the time no matter what...i personally think it's balanced how it is."
12/31/2009,i agree with this guy the hawk needs a boost. but rockets? well ok a small boost would be good. but the thing is rockets have low fitting requirements and can hit from much further out than blasters. they definitely have purpose. they are essentially a damage boost mod for most ships. the ships that have them as an intended primary weapon need the boost but not so much rockets in general. a rocket kestrel is a strong frig and can put out very good damage if you fit a web. the problem is if you fit a web you have no prop mod.rockets:very good rangevery good fitting low damageno capalways hitlook at fitting rockets like they are just a damage mod then i think you will see they arent so bad. i fit rockets on most of my pvp frigs.i never use standard missiles for pvp though. imo they really suck.

12/31/2009,single best drone overhaul proposal i have ever seen.
12/31/2009,nice!
12/31/2009,"good lord! sir, that is a brilliant idea would the drone aggression settings possibly include going after other drones?"
12/31/2009,"i'm not sure i like this proposal quite as it is but i agree, prioritizing targets (and ignoring targets) would be hugely beneficial to drone users."
12/31/2009,no way.lag is pretty bad as it is. forcing computers and servers to deal with aditional load will only make it much worse. player generated content while nice feature in theory dosent go well with the scale of this game. not to mention that due to crap like discriminations and players being offended by diffrent words or images everything that is player generated must be checked. and there's a whole new world of trouble that way.
12/31/2009,"well no one said anything about ""forcing"" it, it would seem easy enough to add a little graphical option to turn them on or off, like showing turrets or drone models. although i honestly doubt that lag is going to be affected by a few tiny alliance pictures which have already been downloaded and the tagging data is already there...and as for your second point, (which is mostly moot by making it an optional graphical setting) you clearly have no idea how the alliance logo approval process works. or looked at local recently."
12/31/2009,"i had an amazing idea on this subject tonight and i apologize for not reading everything before posting this so if its already been mentioned ""my bad"" but here goes *bit deeper than just the pc version problem since the debate has widened as far as i have been reading on the interwebs*in my opinion ccp were dipping their toes in the water with an out of pod experience when they came up with incarna, it seems to me that the idea has swept them away to create something more bold on this level without properly tweaking their first objective. in the past ccp have been meticulous in their scrutiny of every detail and aspect of the game and creating the perfect balanced environment but maybe they're trying to run before they can walk (bad pun but what the hell) but maybe we are looking at dust at the wrong angle a pc version would be expected due to the loyal followers so far but the idea that players will control a ""grunt"" in a corp within the alliance their eve char is in is an interesting integration, we know pc gamers are superior to console gamers so let them be our grunts. think about it console gamers inevitably create clans or in this case a corp whats to say that your characters progression in dust wouldn't be rated on something such as a kd ratio with a ranking system possibly in the same fashion as merc corp being hired for a sov battle they say they want to integrate the battlefield pay the grunts with alliance/corp isk and they could improve their characters with better gear etc... take on the mission of the sov battles or to capture planets maybe even capuring a base station linked to a moon miner/pos orbiting in space etc as well as interstellar defenses this would bring about conflicts simultaniously taking place around the plants and moons of a system with eve players assaulting pos's/planetary facilities from orbit and providing tactical analysis on very large battlegrounds(which will hopefully be a feature of dust one thing eve got right was the scale of the systems) whilst the dust battle also rages on down below this would bring about a much bigger feel to every system with fleets able to hide within systems rather than just camping stargates and much more intense experience for all partiesthese are just a few ideas sorry for the epic post. but to answer the simple question clearly,ofc dust should be on the pc...."
12/31/2009,"this thread still generating tears? like it has been said many times, console only is the best way. pc = hackersbut please keep the tears rolling in though, they taste the best."
12/31/2009,this is a business decision of a rl company.you may agree with it or not.imho it's out of scope for the csm.
12/31/2009,"fine, make it a console game, get the new market, but make a pc version too."
12/31/2009,"i love this huge drama about dust.do you people think alot according to the diffrences in console and pc games?hacking a pc game is easy, using programs to do everything for you is easy.hacking a console game, now that is hard and you cant write programs to help you.and making the game on multiplatforms will force them to make 2 diffrent servers. 1 for console, 1 for pc.as people have said, yes you can hook up a mouse and keyboard to a xbox or ps3 but the performance is not close to hooking the same equipment up to a pc. making it console only is a excellent starting point. and people that dont want to pay monthly subscriptions for a game that has a insane learning curve dont have to worry. they can just toss in a few coins from now and then to buy new stuff to kill and blow sh*t up with.but these are just my thoughts"

12/31/2009,"i seriously doubt that they would be able to do this. those broker fees will add up fast, for one thing. and basing the basket price off of market sales means that this toing and froing with minerals is susceptible to other players ninjaing in their own orders. one tiny slip by the would-be market manipulators would leave them with billions of units of someone else's 25 isk trit.have a look at the weekly mineral sales volume over the whole of eve, and work out how much you'd have to spend to raise the aggregate mineral price by, say, 20% using the methods you outline. the sums involved are almost inconceivable. and there's no way you can do it stealthily, and there's no way you can prevent other people profiting by at least as much as you but without spending all that isk."

12/31/2009,"supported.local wins in wh space, why not 0.0?"
12/31/2009,"because 0.0 isn't w-space.- a lot less players, so you won't have to pos/cloak up every 30 seconds- you know up front there will be no local, you can choose to go there or not. ofcourse you can choose to go to 0.0 or not, but unlike w-space when it was introduced, a lot of ppl are already in 0.0- no gates, so there's a rp explanation why you don't know who's there- risk/reward, you take a higher risk (and you cannot possibly think removing local will lower any kind of risk, and there's the shifting way back home) for higher gains (lots of sites, lots of sleepers etc)and imo local doesn't 'win' in w-space, it's f-ing annoying to be forced to grind some buttonclicking for basic survival (directional, 9999999999 km, 360 degrees, spam button, see probes? pos up...) which is a major reason i left there."
12/31/2009,"not entierly sure i support it but i'm inclined to. changing local to a number in system (and comms if anyone breaks radio silence) would make the covops/recon ships more suited to their purpose. as it is anyone can drop into a system and have a decent idea of the number of targets, at least in a red vs blue vs neutral way. the current probing system will give you an idea of what is in a system, but to find out who safely will require specific recon ships. the obvious choice is covops cloaked vessels but other fast movers can zip in, get a quick look and zip out. this turns covert warfare and scouting into more than just looking at local."
12/31/2009,"you dont get it. if you actually live in w-space system and you are more then solo farmer , you have poeple scanning doing sites minning travelling etc. there is really no need to spam button ever 2 seconds , if theres a lot of active people your chances of spotting someone increases dramaticly.now adding static gates to the equation that can be camped by alt with sound turned on it really ist that hard."
12/31/2009,"not supported.this will drive alot of people out of 0.0 as it will effectivly stop any resource gathering op from out of empire space. it will become echonomically unviable to have such ops, either by having to take an unreasonable ammount of precautions.if you compare 0.0 to wh space you will find that wh space has alot more rewards in it. 0.0 does not. most 0.0 allianceses need an industrial backbone, and most members in those allianceses need isk for various things. this will break all that. remember this is a game, and there should be a reasonable ammount of effort involved in playing it.i will also remind ""agony empire"" representative that not all eve pilots like to fly t1 inshured ships with t1 fitting. they might be fun and cheap and lot alot of resources needed for them but most players prefer the t2 ships. i say that corelated to the effort gathering enough resources to fly them in 0.0. as it is now it just dosent support it with the added risk that you propose.and pvp will jsut become one big blind game. you should remember that there are still deep ss'es made so no matter what you do you cant scan averything. if you try to realistically predict what will happen you will see a huge drop in engagements in 0.0 space. various pirates and all the people that have highsec mining / missioning alts will be ofc enchanted by this. not so the people that moved alltogeather in 0.0. what this will do is to force them move partially or complete to empire. 2 cents ..."
12/31/2009,"actually, i think i do get it, sometimes better than others. not everyone is in some huge alliance with a gazillion alts for every conceivable purpose working at it like eve is some kind of job, some are just friends playing a game together.i did actually live in w-space, thank you. not solo, but not with a very large group either (3 persons, 5 accounts). we were usually all in the same belt mining. now, why would we be 'scanning down sites'? you seem to be in a large group, assign everyone one if the sigs, in 5 minutes you've got bookmarks of all of them? travel? whereto? the w-sector next door when there's enough to do back home without the added hauling and risk of the wh collapsing?if there are more ppl then yes, the chance of finding (or probably, being found by) someone get a lot better. too bad most of the time you're found the other party in some gank ship, obliterating your mining op before those aligned (but for obvious reasons at 0 m/s) barges or exhumers have accelerated enough to enter warp.i rather spam the d-scanner than rely on the off-chance i spot them before they come out of warp at their optimal range.local is perfect the way it is, the roaming pirates don't have to work hard just to determine if there are targets near but can just start warping to belts ready to put a point on whoever is in them, and those peaceful targets get a moderate chance at safety, without some forced buttonclicking all the time because some vocal minority is bleating their targets are trying their hardest not to get ganked. guess what, that's life, zebras run from lions as well. you're the lion, i'm the zebra, and we both have racially different points of view."
12/31/2009,"firstly 0.0 is supposed to be dangerous and you should have to take precautions to protect any resource gathering operation. that said with a local count it wouldn't drive people out, it would just mean people in the same alliance would have to talk to each other when moving around so as not to spook the ratters/miners etc when local count goes up. an mmo encouraging people to interact - shocking 0.0 has higher end resources not available in empire, your point?if your isk generation will be destroyed by the removal of free intel on who is in local when it only shows a count of active pilots then it is time to evaluate what you are doing in 0.0 allow me to correct a misconception or three.agony empire is not pvp basic. we live in 0.0, we fly t2 ships, we fly faction ships, we even t2 fit our t1 ships yes sometimes flying a t2 fitted t1 ship is even more fun than flying t2 - like when you kill a faction fitted t2 ship with a rifter i won't speak for ""most players"", only the players i fly with.when not killing other people (or teaching how to avoid being killed) we make isk in 0.0 by ninja ratting, running plexs and even go into wormholes. thus i can say with confidence that the retaining local count proposal for 0.0 is easy mode compared to w-space.risk vs rewardcurrently you can ninja rat in a 0.0 system with a pve fitted ship (with a cloak) and when a hostile comes into local you just ss and cloak. not much risk for potentially huge reward.with the proposed change you can ninja rat in a 0.0 system with a pve fitted ship (with a cloak) and when local count goes up you can just ss and cloak. oh no the end of life as we know it!difference is that you don't know who that is, it could be a friendly or a hostile and you can't tell without taking some action. the advantage for you is they don't know who you are either - it cuts both ways i disagree, it will allow better tactics and allow covops to provide intel more effectively.deep safes are useful, but that doesn't matter. if somebody isn't in scan range of you then you are not in scan range of them. yes they might put out probes - no different to now. it will not force them back to empire. if anything it might mean more people fleet up instead of being solo in an mmo"
12/31/2009,"i don't have all that many experience in mmo's, some 2 years of eve and a month in wow (shocking, an eve player playing both ) and both have its merit (heathen, burn at the stake! how dare you compare eve to wow).i've never once felt the need in wow (yet? lvl 35 atm) to interact with others much, sure some pick up groups for some mission or other, but beyond that? solo grinding the instant gratification npcs mostly. worse yet, playing together with a friend is nearly imposible as you both have to be about the same level, preferably be on the same quest so it won't get boring as i'm a few levels higher than the mission or w/e.nowhere near eve online, where i have friend in my corporation or alliance and beyond, where we're very actively chatting and interacting, scouting for each other running missions together, tanking/scouting/mining together and (though i'm a carebear myself) pvping together.i'd say eve doesn't lack social interaction, so no need to 'patch' that with a pirate-buff/friendly-inhabitant-nerf disguised as some answer to a nonexisting social problem.0.0 _is_ dangerous, and we _are_ taking precautions, telling us we should do so in a manner suggesting we aren't already is a straw man argument, one revealing you want easier kills at that."
12/31/2009,"i am not per se against the local nerf/change. the problem is that every proposal i've seen so far has far reaching consequences with too many unadressed downsides, does not suggest how to compensate or is generally vague. and agreeing with a previous poster: ccp would either lack the balls to make bigger changes, or screw up.for that reason i'd rather suggest smaller changes, like making covops not appear in local unless they talk, delay people/identity showing in local until they brake cloak or after a small fixed time. this could be tuned and enhanced over time.not supporting this proposal for being vague."

12/31/2009,"in october 2006, i was introduced to eve online. my four (now teenage) children and i have always held a high personal standard for games.1. no witchcraft or magic,2. no excessive blood or gore,3. and no games that force you to do wrong or commit evil acts.these are our personal standards, and as a family, we hold to them even to today.when we were introduced to eve online, all of us were excited. we found a game that was truly a ""sandbox"" which allowed us to explore and prosper without violating personal standards. though there are a few fellow players who have demonstrated a ""less than mature"" attitude, on the most part eve online players have exhibited an intellect and maturity not always found on other games.for the first couple of years, we have played the role of ""carebears"". the missions are fun and my two daughters thinks it's great to go asteroid mining. then you brought out factional warfare.fw is great, because it helped us break from our fears and get involved with aspects of the game that we never knew too much about. all of which never forced us to do wrong.when i joined fw, i wanted to find a fleet/ corp that held high standards. i remember looking for months, and my initial choice came down to a few. in the end i decided to join vfor (later to merge into 1st praetorian guard), because their standards were high and their demand for focus and discipline are second to none. the benchmark, they have asked from me and my peers makes your game a lot of fun.over the next year, we worked hard on fw. the game mechanics is simple and appeared to be fair and balanced. capture plexes and you contest a system. capture enough plexes in a system and it becomes vulnerable. when a system goes vulnerable, our faction can capture it. over the course of the year, the amarrian/ minmatar combat zone seemed balanced. sure, the matari could speed tank (most if not all) of amarrian plexes, but this didn't discourage us. 1st praetorian guard worked hard.then we started noticing bugs.because 1pg holds each other to high standards, we unanimously agreed not to exploit any bugs, even if it would be to our advantage.one bug is where a pilot can warp off a timer, and keep the complex running while not in the plex.another bug is to use non-amarrian players to bring down systems, since the repubic fleet won't attack them.when these bugs came into full ""bloom"" many of our enemies were outraged. the caldari were coming in and taking down systems and even pilots like sasawong or indra nithil couldn't keep up with the load. when it became known that 1pg refused to use these exploits, even our enemies applauded our position, and expressed their respect for our standards.now, with christmas and new years on, the tide is turning. many minmatar are using exploits to take down amarrian systems. we repeatedly find plexes running in amarrian systems where no enemy is on the timer.and i find myself more ashamed of ccp than i am for those pilots who cannot succeed without cheating.ccp, i love this game, because it has always appeared to be balanced. eve online never required me to become some zombie king to defeat the game. you never had the game designed to allow and promote cheating... until now.am i crying over the loss of amarrian systems? no. it's part of the game. what i am crying over is that known exploits are being used that are violating the gaming universe, and ccp has not responded.from the perspective of a player, you've allowed cheats to go uncorrected, and for this i am ashamed."
12/31/2009,"/agreedalthough i don't think most players use the exploits enough of them on all sides of the conflict do.until this problem is fixed just report the ones you catch cheating, and try to stay above the pettiness."
12/31/2009,unfortunately computer-games are often riddled by people seeking to circumvent game mechanics or use flaws. at least in eve it's possible to petition pilots that try to bug the timer.
12/31/2009,"fw has been getting worse treatment than a red headed stepchild.ccp, think of the stepchildren! /voice echo returns, giving a sense of huge empty space and loneliness"
12/31/2009,i'm one of the pilots who applauded 1pg and now i run offensive plexes in the bleaks and devoid. none of the fleets i run knowingly use a bug to capture a complex. we do on occasion warp out due to too much damage or wt pressense or the call to assist in an adjacent system and return to find that the bug closed the plex in our absence. this is an unfortunate side effect of the bug: it can be triggered even when the act is not intentional. so please don't be too quick to judge every self-running timer. while i have no doubt that some pilots are exploting this it's not always entirely under our control. continue to petition those abusing the mechanic as i do and will. and we will see you on the battlefield. i would say that the caldari situation had the added effect that there are many more minmatar pilots running plexes than there used to be. the gloating and chest beating on the igs forums over captured minmatar systems made a lot of people rather upset and this is part of what's going on... some of it may be related to the bugs but most is related to a lot of hard work...the csm has voted to take fw up with ccp which is good as it is broken on many fairly deep levels. it does behoove us to keep this in the fore of the conversation here though. as well as the other threads around. squeaky wheels get the grease as they say.-no
12/31/2009,"i stand in awe of your puritanism. never the less, i support the op's complaint."
12/31/2009,"you know you are responsable for your own computer security.if a hacker/cracker got in wtf do you want from ccp ? you are not paying ccp to do security in your computer. most security systems ccp would employ would be simple defeated by an atacker that gained remote access to your computer. plain and simple. token based auth would be a way but clumbersome and not cost effective. maybe an option for it for people that desire it would be welcome.as far as char trades, in every major mmo there is the black market account trading. and along with it comes alot of legal issues and so on and so forth. problems for users and for developers. ccp made a bold and smart move by allowing char trades and givem the years needed to develop a char i say it's one of their best moves.removing char trades will do nothing to help security. it will be only replaced by account trading and stealing for rmt traders , and will just only fend off players that wants to enjoy the game a bit more w/o playing it for 4 years."
12/31/2009,"agreeing with helen, malcanis, mazz(!), tea and others that are against the shutting down of char sales, but pro increased account security. sorry verone, your proposal does not fix the problem in any way.edit: shameless plug to an account security proposal."

12/31/2009,is that the one with the arrow on it?
12/31/2009,"i have to agree with the others dennis, in a few years time you will be able to appreciate it for yourself, the way its always intended to be. i don't think eve is going to disappear before you turn 18 and if any of the previous fest's are anything to go by, they wont be stopping them any time soon.good things come to those who wait, patience is a hard skill to learn but it will serve you well."
12/31/2009,"at least this year fanfest was pretty much a 3-day drinking binge with occasional mentions of internet spaceships.i realise that the typical mancunian 16 year old is no stranger to such things, but ccp probably doesn't want to be seen as sanctioning it."
12/31/2009,actually i cannot understand why eve is only rated as 12+. raise it to 18 and we can get rid of the profanity filter on forums (ironically the game itself does not filter) and other limitations.
12/31/2009,"ccp should post live petition statistics. these statistics should include number of petitions presently unanswered, petitions pending and petitions completed for each category.average response time should also be included for each category, this would allow a player to very roughly predict an expected time until their petition would normally be answered. these average response times should clearly only be used as a very rough guide for players but it would be more information than we have at the moment.slow petition responses are annoying for everyone (to ccp aswell i think), and i think the situation needs improving. even if response times cannot be improved, perhaps providing more information to players would at least show them progress is being made.anyone have any thoughts on this?"
12/31/2009,"i think the elephant in the room here is how badly petitions are dealt with at times and how stubborn/infuriating/ignorant gm responses can be. except for the more obvious and easy to fix player problems like stuck character, it seems the petition system is designed to be a series of hurdles intended to make the highest possible number of players give up, as to reduce the amount of work for gms/ccp. to get something done for them, players need to show a lot of endurance, exchanging multiple mails with gms until the petition gets escalated to a senior gm, exchange multiple mails with him, annoy him to get him to do something, endure ban threats and in return threaten with canceling subscription of all your accounts as protest. with much luck you might get your issue solved at this point.so yes, i'm favor of any measure that sheds light on this mess. ultimately something needs to be done."
12/31/2009,"everyone know's it would take 5 months for a reply and even then its allways ""this does not show in our logs"" :p"
12/31/2009,with the dominion patch the cosmic anomalies have gotten more popularity. currently the only 2 cosmic anomalies that are giving a bit of a challange are the haven's and the sanctums. my proposal is to make them and the other cosmic anomalies more challenging by increasing the spawn volumes. this will enhance teamwork becasue remote rep will be needed on the toughest anomalies. my idea is to reduce the 8 spawns in 2 or 3 massive spawns.
12/31/2009,"yes, the anomalies are lame, being easier than lvl 4's. even after doubling to tripling the spawn size they would be soloable with a decent pve ship. but, in keeping with the risk/reward formula, if you make them harder, they must pay more."
12/31/2009,let us research negative me/pe blc's.certainly this simple mechanic change would help out all those struggling with invention profitability and reduce the strain on moon mineral supplies.
12/31/2009,"this has been brought up zillions of times.there are better proposal like carrying over a fraction of the research levels on the t1 bpc used in the invention over to the invented t2 bpc.also, don't confuse actual moon min demand with speculation."
12/31/2009,"post dominion this is even less true. doing anomalies/plexes matches mission income, you have indices to keep up and with moon gold mostly gone the, 0.0 corps have to make isk from diffuse sources, i.e. you pve-ing in their space.further, most 0.0 people who still do empire missioning use alts for it, not jcs, same goes for empire trading (which is only practiced by a minority anyway).and calling jcs the culprit for people not settling into space is just lol. there are a hundred other issues or game mechanics that have greater impact on that. dominion failed at reducing the space held by alliances and even if it was reduced, it still doesn't stop the big players from just stomping the small trying to conquer space."

12/31/2009,"you're confusing cause and effect here. the skills training time spans multiple days because of the rt training, not the other way around. nothing ""requires"" ccp to make skills take weeks of training time. they chose to do so because of their belief in their system of real-time training. it's unique (as far as i know, anyway) and as i stated before, a huge draw to the game. not everyone has the time to grind out levels.despite the fact i am very active right now, i'm sure if ccp were to back out from one of the fundamental features of their game and require you to be online to train (or be penalized if you're offline), i'd leave. i like the idea that i can advance, however insignificantly, without requiring to think of eve as a second job. i like the idea that even if i hypothetically couldn't play for a month, my subscription fee wouldn't be going to waste.you're arguing about something that makes eve the game that it is. you may as well ask for a carebear no-pvp server, or hell, multiple regional servers. for that matter, we should replace spaceships with knights and wizards."
