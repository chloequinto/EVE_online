5/1/2009,apparently the old effect was incompatible with the new graphic engine or something. so they had to lose that. they then were lazy and decided not to do a jumpdrive effect and just go with jumping through a gate effect.support this topic if you feel ccp being lazy is a bad thing. unfortunately already commented with all chars :(

5/1/2009,"this makes no sence why do many other proffessions like mining and missioning get this, but the pvp field is completely left out. i dont agree with how a 3 day old newb in a velator has as much right to the wreak as the person who killed the ship. it makes no sence and needs to be fixed, i agree with what pitboss proposses for fixes."
5/1/2009,fw fleets encounter this a lot and we are typically not set up to tank gate guns in low sec so there is nothing we can do about it.
5/1/2009,support
5/1/2009,"why is a cynojammer so hard to kill, when a mothership and even titans can get ganked?also, i dream of supcaps with siege an area effect capabilites, other than dd ofcause -.-"
5/1/2009,"as a 2+ year nyx pilot, i earnestly believe that motherships need a significant change. it's simply too easy to lose 20b isk.the proposals to motherships that i thought most viable were the ones affecting super capitals ability to spider-tank more effectively, and the proposal to manipulate transversal on sieged turret dreads more effectively. whatever the result, super capitals (motherships especially) need something to make them worth their cost and building effort."
5/1/2009,technically they do exist heh.thing is... oh gawd. marauder + large. wow i can just imagine.
5/1/2009,"no, this is silly. this is what destroyers are for."
5/1/2009,this is what destroyer alts are for.
5/1/2009,"i would support this, but i think it would be even cooler to have a ship with a salvaging bonus. some sort of dedicated salvager ship. it could get bonuses in salvaging chance, tractor beam range, and cargo capacity.however, if this were implemented, i could continue to use my salvagecane with a longer range. :)"
5/1/2009,yeah fix phoenix give it 3 turret slots and hybrid bonuses. it even does less dmg than the naglfar by far.
5/1/2009,okay so after a lot of ~math~ the new capital artillery proposals means that with dread v capital artillery will out damage unbonused lasers on the nag by about 5%. this still means that with dread iv capital beams will do ~5% more than capital artillery. guess i'll have to update the op.
5/1/2009,just give it 4 turret slots and swich quad 3500 gun to dual 4900 gun so they can keep the awesome model same (still 8 guns on each side but 4 turrets instead of 2).
5/1/2009,i like this.
5/1/2009,or add this so that you can if u wish add a password to a single pos to allow neuts/or be a spy ect. but have the standings option set and used for the most part.
5/1/2009,"oh hell no,i always get ****ing ****ed about unimportant and useless websites/games/whatever forcing password changes.if it doesn't directly involve my rl money and or income, then i don't really give a **** about passwords.i hate password templates just as much. if i want a simple password, it means i don't give a **** if it gets guessed.just like lavista thingie earlier, i change my passwords regulary. but damnit, don't force it..."
5/1/2009,but didn't you hear?the pandemic legion guys are suggesting that internet spaceships is serious business.
5/1/2009,"'hackers' get the passes from eve accounts either by key loggers or because the user is stupid and told them (or someone else somewhere) their pass. against both a difficult pass with numbers wont help much. difficult passes are usefull when someone can bruteforce the pass (or even more with dictionary attack), but i think ccp will notice when someone tries to bruteforce your pass."
5/1/2009,"or from hacked third-party forums.but that's why you should never use the same username on eve-o. nobody knows my username. hence, they would have to figure out my username and password."
5/1/2009,that's because your exercising common sense.this proposal is like telling ccp to outlaw scamming.it's not there fault you gave your password away.which is why its pointless to force changes.... who gives a damn if you change your password.you'd have to change it 50 some odd times a day to make it worth while..and that's insane.if you really where that bloody worried... you would issue a smart card/key with a randomized decryption/encryption algorithm that would transmit your account information.god help you if you lose the damn thing... and all that over a ####ing game?and they call me crazy!it is a video game right?
5/1/2009,"number of passwords/pins i need to remember in real life or for work (not for entertainment) - over 15number of those that make me change my password frequently - 6chances that i am going to start changing my entertainment passwords frequently and try to remember them because some internet company that i give money to decides that i am too stupid to protect my password to my internet spaceship - 0 /not supported/and to save me time, count this post as 6 opposed and pretend my 5 alts logged on too"
5/1/2009,"1. most of the time even if there's a password being changed etc. keyloggers are going to bypass all that.the issue is that people give away their account details and such. it's the most moronic thing ever.people go away from the game for awhile... so they give their friends the account details. they come back to the game and get their account back in good condition. they dont bother changing the password. they do something moronic... **** everyone off. they log him in and basically lead them into being screwed up badly. etc etc.that's what happens with all these ""hacked accounts"""
5/1/2009,"no, it's not. what happens is outlined in post #32 of this thread in about the middle. most of you don't even understand how the mass attack on accounts works, or just how many people this attack really works on.(hint: there are no mass trojans deployed just to steal eve accounts. it just doesn't make sense, they would not be bothering with game accounts if they had credit card details)anyways, i'm probably going to re-word this idea to just be a popup warning when a password is a certain age, or an e-mailed warning to active accounts with an old enough password, because i dont think ccp would implement something that could potentially get people to lock themselves out of their accounts."
5/1/2009,so jason edwards is smarter than miss alt posts alot?wow.... who woulda thunk it.
5/1/2009,i really like the idea of a truly passive armor faction torp boat.8-5-7 seems pretty overkill in my opinion.essentially make it like an overtanked abaddon with less dps.
5/1/2009,would this do?
5/1/2009,maybe a raven like slot layout would do. with swapped low/mid slots
5/1/2009,as long as i get my sansha mothership. but yes personally i would like to see a gallente/amarr hybrid ship line up or a special khanid fleet lineup in conjunction with other sub factions gettgin thier own expensive but different line of faction ships.
5/1/2009,"i'll point out that there is no equivalent of a wardec for the market i.e., an embargo.economic alliances would be interesting-- attack us physically, and we'll cut off the cheap flow of goods to you. this would be interesting.in normal warfare, asymmetric (or guerrilla) warfare makes it much more expensive for the agressor (cost/damage dealt is significantly higher). for instance, in reality, one person can take out a substantial part of the other party's economic base, making it prohibitively expensive to continue indefinitely. this is in addition to the readiness cost of making war in the first place! making war prohibitively expensive can be simulated, and should. thus, at a minimum, increasing the cost of the war is interesting. despite the fact that the attackers generally have a superior force, the defenders often have the advantage in terms of terrain, etc. no such equivalent exists in eve, but perhaps it should."
5/1/2009,geddon-apoc-abaddoncarriersyou can set all these up to deal 1000 dps with absolutely no ammo cost. yaaay free easy killmails.
5/1/2009,"caldari control tower: 50 million shields with 50% thermal resistance, then 4 million armor after that.gallente: 35 million shields, 25% thermal resist. then 8 million armor.minmatar: 45 million shields with 25% thermal resistance and 50% em. then 6 million armor.i'm not sure if you have to burn through the shields if the tower is offline, and i can't find the amount of structure for each tower. so lets look at the armor only. weakest armor is on the caldari tower with 4 million points. at 1000dps, that will take you 66 minutes, 40 seconds. then you start work on the structure.even worse, this is assuming that they didn't use the 24 hours warning* to online their tower so you would have to take out the shields.so how do you plan to keep bordem at bay for that long ?*last i heard concord would protect high sec towers, so you will need to war dec them."
5/1/2009,"very nice idea but i still think cov ops, recon ships, black ops and this cloak transporter should be able to pass such gates without a warning.about the cov ops cloak: you can't warp with activated normal cloak so you're forced to be in local for some seconds every time you warp.ps: sorry for my bad english"
5/1/2009,wormspace for 1 is understandable. whatever.creating a 5-10 second delay just to lower lag a bit wouldnt hurt at all. it would at least keep you on your toes slightly more.but local itself just cant change. sorry.in my interceptor there are many systems which i go through where the 30 second session timer from jumping into the new system. jumping into the next one is still in effect; after warping to the next gate.if local got delayed beyond that. where it would be legitimately possible for pilots to not make it on the list at all. then that would be horrible.
5/1/2009,right that's why delayed local would suck
5/1/2009,delayed local would suck. recent speakers local would rock.
5/1/2009,maybe but i would like recent speakers local for cloaks only.
5/1/2009,i support this idea couse using local as intel is bad. as soon as someone hostile jumps to a system anybody in war with the target using local can imdiately dock in station evading any possible causalities.
5/1/2009,this.no support until then.
5/1/2009,i fully endorse this product and/or service.
5/1/2009,"i definately agree with this idea, having >90% of my skills at level 5 it means scrolling through far more than i should have to to find the skill i want to queue. actually posted a thread about this exact idea in features and ideas a week ago before i saw this proposal."
5/1/2009,"although i'd like to see the issue of spamming getting addressed over the scamming issue, in this case it appears to be one and the same lately. this should slow down at least the 999 scam, although it wouldn't adress mineral contract scams. thumbs up at any rate, a written amount, however it is determined, would make a bit of sense to my red weary eyes."
5/1/2009,1. yes they are sooo annoying.2. the fix is simple but doesnt really cause trouble. simply spell it out kind of deal.how can you oppose this? it doesnt really hurt the situation.
5/1/2009,supported because it's getting ridiculous in market hubs.

5/1/2009,support thisthe scam spam is just too much
5/1/2009,never fallen for this one either but idiots spamming local is annoying as ****.
5/1/2009,"i agree with scamming, but i don't agree with the contract spam. supported."
5/1/2009,i have a ton of contracts of stupid or pointless stuff. i have a contract where i contract like 120 light missiles to my alt. does anyone seriously care about this?how about the option for contract cleaning? where if both parties agree. the contract history gets cleaned from those ships.1. person gets scammed. doesnt agree to clean it. then the world can see the scammer's history.2. person is a legit trader. doesnt agree to clean it. then the world can see the trader is legit.3. person contract to alt and does agree to clean it. then nobody gets to see stupid contracts.wouldnt this feature be an improvement at least?
5/1/2009,"i'd be okay with cleaning private contracts by agreement, since only the two of you can see it anyways. it's a ridiculously low priority, but it'd have some use. public contracts should be permanent, though - cleaning intel sources off yourself isn't something that should be that easy."
5/1/2009,"private contracts are only visible to the involved parties, i think that is enough of a fix for your ""problem""tl:dr = no"
5/1/2009,i don't get what the deal is. they go away after some time anyway.
5/1/2009,if a fw fleet jumps into 0.0 and a hic pilot activates a bubble. the hic pilot gets a standings hit from any person in the fleet who attempts to warp while in his bubble.the standings hit is great enough if you fly with a larger (and not so disciplined) militia fleet that eve will eject the hic player from the militia because of a drop in standings.this effectively means that fw fleets can not use bubbles while in 0.0.please change the code so that bubble aggression on pilots in your own fleet does not affect standings for fw.it may even be better to not get aggression at all for players in your own fleet attempting to warp in you bubble.
5/1/2009,i dont see this implemented so soon as militia is not supposed to fly in 0.0 and using warp bubles.
5/1/2009,do not tell us what we are supposed to do. this is a sandbox game.
5/1/2009,"i'm not in fw, but i agree. your fleet shouldn't cause aggression period."
5/1/2009,"uh... last i heard... 0.0 is lawless... so how the hell are you getting a standings hit in a non-patrolled let alone ""we don't give a rip unless you kill rats"" 0.0 space?"
5/1/2009,i'd revise this to say that agression results should be suppressed in nullsec entirely.
5/1/2009,this. i fly in 0.0 and don't participate in fw. the entire reason i like 0.0 is the lack of rules and the freedom from the mess of standings and sec status issues that exist in empire.
5/1/2009,"sounds like a pretty silly oversight to me. i can't raise this anymore but erik can. so, supported!"
5/1/2009,this is bizarre. nothing you do in 0.0 should count by the laws of empire space. supported.
5/1/2009,makes a lot of sense
5/1/2009,"i have been soo busy though lately. havent put a great deal of thought in my erm ""ideas""so supporting."
5/1/2009,actually it makes complete sense as war decing allows the parties to attack each other in 0.5 space as well as low sec instead of just 0.0.
5/1/2009,because it's 0.0 and there's no law to prevent it. that's kinda the whole point of 0.0 space.
5/1/2009,err... let me think... no.
5/1/2009,"when i first read this i wasn't sure if perhaps it was a joke or not.very, very not supported. sorry."
5/1/2009,i travel a lot as trader during my playtime and nearly in all major systems isk sellers post their scams directly to local. this an improvement from prevoious mailing to mailbox. they have grown bolder and spam several sites of text till they get banned but another character is created again to take a place.i propose that local has filter that disables web links from to be posted if you are a newbie in trial. if someone wants to send a guide or funny picture he should do it per private mail or public chat.many new players dont know its illegal to buy isk and when explained its too late and get account banned or are in deep red numbers. so please in terms of new friendly game experience look at it.
5/1/2009,"flogging the dead horse (again).i agree with you, but there's no easy way. making it known that buying isk is illegal is a better idea. it needs to be outlined more clearly for the newbies."
5/1/2009,the only way i could think of to stop them is one of the 2 methods1: new accounts restricted from local chat and only allowed in rookie chat (which makes rookie chat worse but it's always watched by a mod or a gm and they can ban them quicker)2: new trial accounts prevented from leaving rookie systems or 2 jump radius or something.odds are they are not paid accounts.... and they always have random name generators.perhaps they should prevent jdslfkjaslk;geupouw names : o p or at least red flag them.and why the hell aren't they banning the freaking ip for the account?
5/1/2009,"no links from trials is one of the less-bad ideas, but i'm still a bit worried about it. i'll give this one a firm ""maybe"". this is exactly the wrong approach. make it known that isk buying is legal if you do it the right way. people are willing to break the rules, but they'd much prefer to follow them. who would be bothered buying isk from dirty spammers when the plex market exists? make sure every newbie sees ""if you want to buy isk, do this:"" early in their career, and the spammers will get nowhere."
5/1/2009,anda few neutral logistics pilots also. sit right on the gate. even if they aggro the logistics and the tank is breaking... they can easily jump thru the gate and gtfo. dont even need to deagress.want to win empire war... dont show up. get in low sec at least.we had wartargets. we got into fairly deep 0.0 and used alt corps to move capitals and stuff for logistics.at least i acknowledge that our wartargets tried to get to us in 0.0... but empire war griefers dont have what it takes for 0.0 pvp. so they basically died long before getting to us. unfortunately we dont even bother spying so we dont even know when they are trying to goto 0.0
5/1/2009,"ah, true. okay, i guess i'm supporting this."
5/1/2009,"i think that when you wardeck someone, all of their ships should be forced out of station and their engines and shields disabled so that it's easier to kill them. also, they shouldn't be able to dock or shoot back until the war is over.seriously, guys, this game has a well thought-out mechanic. yes, people can undock, repair and re-dock. yes alt players in npc corps can use logistics boats. however, you can do the same thing, so why doesn't that make it even? my corp manages to get plenty of kills with all these other provisions in place. we're just crafty, i guess."
5/1/2009,moon idea is bad. really bad. i mean really bad.
5/1/2009,"hang on a minute! you're saying you don't want to be forced to do something, and yet you think it's fine for you to force other's to pvp via random grief wardec's?ok then, how about this:since it's possible to force others in to a combat based war, how about industry corps can force the wardecers to mine? yes, when you declare war, the defender can now choose method of engagement. mining, manufacture, mission running, trade or combat:1. mining, both corps have to mine as much minerals as possible, and hand over to an npc. no combat is allowed between involved parties. the corp that mines the most wins, and the looser has to pay a fine of 100mil isk to the winner.2. manufacture, both corps have to build as many different items as possible, and hand them over to an npc. no more than one of each item can be used. market value or mineral content has no meaning, only the total number of different items count towards victory. who ever produces the most wins. again, the looser has to pay a fine of 100mil isk to the winner.3. trade, both corps have to make isk from buying and selling items on the market. who ever makes the most isk wins. again, the looser has to pay a fine of 100mil isk to the looser.4. mission running, both corps have to complete as many missions as they can. who ever completes the most missions wins. looser has to pay a fine of 100mil to the winner.5. combat, same as before.all wardec fees are removed. if the looser can not pay the fee within one week, the corp is disbanded, and the ceo is banned from forming a new corp until the fine has been payed in full. there we go, no one is forced to do anything they don't want to do. after all, nobody is forcing you to declare war.sounds like fair game to me."
5/1/2009,bad idea so far.in my opinion alliances with sovereignty shouldnt be wardeccable. you should be forced to go into 0.0 and attack them that way if you have a gripe. having this be the same thing for empire is just a bad idea.sure it would kind of good idea... but wardecs are supposed to be simple and petty and griefy. that's the whole point.
5/1/2009,that would only add to the cost of war deccing someone. not supported.i'd rather see an increase in the price to war dec a corp though. 1 mil is laughable at best.
5/1/2009,this is silly. if anything just makes war deccing smaller corps more expensive and have the cost increase over time. easier fix and make maintaining a war indefinitely very expensive on the aggressors.
5/1/2009,well the thing is. they wanted to make something tradeable.for example. gallente freighter is only seeded in gallente space. people then can buy those and bring them to amarr space or stain for all it matters. it also gets people moving around. i might be a mission runner in amarr space. i then goto gallente space for some skillbooks.in reality though. it is far moreso a hassle and a pain to do. not to mention a 0.0 nerf as you basically have to goto empire to get the skillbooks.what i would like instead would be a skillbook transferance tower or something. this way. people in empire still have to go collect the books. while people in 0.0 for example could literally goto charsheet. goto a tab or window or something. which brings you to something like the training queue. except it shows you all the skills you can learn. it gives you the seeded price.on top of that. this only works so long as there's a communication network using pos modules connecting you to the schools with seeded skillbooks. so perhaps you connect only to 1 school. it is a gallente one. you then dont have the amarr skills and such. also. the is a lightyear range kind of mechanic also.

5/1/2009,"so how many glasses of orange juice does your rl company sell a day, in front of your parents house?"
5/1/2009,"my industrial ship was blown into itty-bitty pieces today in a suicide gank attack in hi-sec space. i understand why the pirates did it, but dont understand why ccp encourages this kind of activity. the attack was economical solely because insurance covered the loss of the hostiles ship. in the real world you cant burn down your own house and collect insurance. you cant kill someone and then collect on their insurance. somali pirates cant collect insurance if the navy blows up their ship. so why can criminals collect insurance in eve. it makes a mockery of the concord mechanic, if there is no real loss and no real risk (pirates seem to laugh at the security hit.) i know some will argue that sometimes people accidentally trigger concord, but i am not buying that argument, so dont even try.my question for the csm candidates is: do you support the elimination of insurance payouts on concord kills?also, i would like to know your thoughts on life insurance to cover the loss of implants when podded."
5/1/2009,"suicide ganking is a valid tactic in eve, but there should be consequences for the gankers.if you put a cargo-expanded hauler full with goodies on autopilot, you are asking for trouble. there isn't much that can be done about that, as even with removing insurance it will remain lucrative to gank careless players."
5/1/2009,"if you haul around expensive items in gankable ships, then gankers will hit you. if you don't learn the lesson the first time (ie, don't haul expensive stuff in gankable ships on autopilot), and take risky routes as shortcuts, you'll continue to get ganked.ccp have clearly changed the sec hit to balance this activity somewhat (ie, characters and have to get sec back before they can enter higher security systems again after a few ganks). this is the penalty a ganker pays.no insurance for implants!xavier"
5/1/2009,i intend to vote! i am an opportunistic silly-billy.
5/1/2009,voting for mazzilliu because he'll never be a woman to me... <3
5/1/2009,"hey pluto! nice to see you again man. look me up in game some time for a chat about how things are going! sorry for the late reply. my initial thoughts on the subject are that if you remove ice from empire entirely, i.e. both high and low sec. the cost of ice will rise dramatically. this will see a rise in the cost of running poses in empire and therefore probably see an increase in costs for people in certain areas. i think it would have a minor effect on the 0.0 spaceholders apart from an increase in the recruitment of those ice miners currently residing in empire. having seen enough ice mining operations in 0.0 progressing quite happily without interference for day to day i suspect we will just see an increase in this activity. without a closer analysis being done by myself, i.e. the sort of close analysis i would do if it were a proposal with a lot of support, i can't say for sure but i suspect the ones who will suffer from this idea would be the empire pos owners specifically, and people who buy from the market directly in a general sense, as the cost of research goes up. whilst i am all for increasing the tactical and strategic options for players i don't really think that, in the main, this will give the ability to hamstring one's opponents unless you end up permanently in control of all the ice belts in the region and then people may well just ship it in from other 0.0 regions. thanks for the suggestion and i hope it helps you make up your mind."
5/1/2009,"sort of a follow up to the above;what do you think in general about the presence and use of empire resources (from ore/mineral acquistion to research & manufacturing, to mission running) by large 0.0 holding alliances?should the game's mechanics make supporting a 0.0 empire based on high sec resources more difficult?"

5/1/2009,"i haven't heard any indication that a moddable ui is in the works, and while i do approve of the way ccp has been improving the ui over the last few expansions, i think that there's still plenty of room for player input on the topic. i'm not trying to step on too many toes here, but it's an important issue, and, despite effort on ccp's part, still one that needs a lot of work. i think that there's plenty of room for the csm to influence how they go about this in future. some of them are more feasible than others, i agree. moving the debate to an open forum may be impractical for nda reasons, but holding meetings on a closed forum and publishing logs should be no more of a problem than holding meetings in a closed chat channel and publishing logs. i haven't read the nda, so i don't know exactly how far we can take it, but that's the sort of thing i'd like to see happen. if i have to compromise to keep the lawyers happy, i will, but i'm going to at least try for the best solution rather than declaring a compromise before i know where the limits actually are. as for the csm's processes, they work, mostly, and i don't want to interfere too much with them, but i think that there's still some room for improvement. for example, the adoption of genuine rules of order would streamline many things - csm 2 didn't have as much bickering as csm 1, so the issue has moved to the back burner, but it's still an improvement that can be made without upsetting the applecart. similarly, creating better reference stickies is hardly going to turn the world upside-down, but it will hopefully let players access csm information more quickly and easily. thank you."

5/1/2009,"that pretty much sums it up for me, too"
5/1/2009,"taken from a different forum (scrapheap challenge):i have a lot of experience running small gangs-- i was the main fc for the dara cothrom alliance for the last 6 months, and have run small roaming ops (ie 5-20 people, mostly hacs > recon > ldictor > logi gangs) through cloud ring, fountain, dek, outer ring, fade, and pureblind. i basically ran one a day, and ran defense ops against them as well. i now fly with triumvirate, which has a reputation for running some of the toughest roaming gangs in eve. some of the issues i find with the small gang is that the amount of targets you can get is limited by your gang size, and therefore your accomplishments are limited to what you bring. you are relegated to the role of either gankee, taking out smaller targets and gangs, or the ganked-- where you get blobbed by a significantly larger gang set up on a gate and have to run away. a lot of times, your roam will end as soon as u run into a gang camping a pipe system, and you will have to turn around and go find something else to do. so basically, you are limited in your engagements by having a very small fleet whereas it should be the opposite-- smaller fleet should mean greater mobility and a broader range of tactics.as an fc, its always really obnoxious to find that you make 30 jumps to try to get a fight, and when you get to your destination, you find a gatecamp with 15 falcons and 30 rr battleships blocking your route. how would i like to fix this? give a small gang more options to get through camps-- fix black ops, make bubbles have a smaller radius, nerf warp scrams (arazu with a 30km scram makes baby jesus cry), increase cruiser sized ship's resistance to ecm, and generally just make improvements to the ability to circumvent some of the blobtastic elements of eve. fast ships should be able to burn away from gatecamps... and clear advantage should not be given to whoever sets up on a gate first."
5/1/2009,can someone tell me who the three oldest candidates are in real life years?tia
5/1/2009,duno abotu the oldest but sokratesz is the youngest at 21
5/1/2009,i'm 38 =)
5/1/2009,i'm jus' a likkle one at 22.
5/1/2009,"1) ring mining. - i would love to see this!2) renegade concord. - interestinting. i would be more inclined to support the idea of some more logical random spawn of pain and doom.3) player habitats. - love it! sign me up!4) rare materials in loot drops. - worth consideration.5) reducing loot drops - nope. i am not a fan of reducing drops.6) q-ships. - needs to be explored. could be a great new element in the eve experience.more input about how ""i roll"" to let folks know how to voe,issler"
5/1/2009,"hey guido,i'm not running, but i thought i'd throw my .02 isk worth for this subject, as it has a lot of appeal to me.1) not really. what i would like to see though is comet mining. imagine your ship trailing the comet while repairing itself from the debris and ice chunks all to get at the juicy mineral goodness at the comet's heart. this could fit in your concept of ring mining as far as the rewards, but just in a different light.2) maybe, as i have heard there are some missions where you fight against concord (for the pirate factions). if we have a weaker concord renegade spawn with non-insta-kill ships, i'd be all for it. after all, everybody knows that the space pigs are corrupt.3) this is one issue i fought for during my term as csm, and would love to see implemented. something weaker but more hidden than a pos - kind of a home away from home.4) this is a good idea to reduce the amount of pre-manufactured goods, another issue i fought for in my term (no meta 0 rat loot), and would help to balance the rarity of moon minerals. it would have to be balanced carefully, but i don't see why not.5) see #4 above.6) yet again, something i fought for during my term (holographic imagers). it wouldn't really work for normal ships, but i could see a special type of ship like a t2 hauler that has a lot of armor and some ew but no weapons, to create a decoy ship for fleet ops."
5/1/2009,"hey folks:garthran: re: 1), indeed, sir, just looking for a new (additional) location, with some more very cool graphics and artwork, for miners to find currently existing types of raw materials. as i see it, a mineable ring around a ring planet (aka, ""saturn"") might be a hybrid kind of mining area, with perhaps, (as an example) both ore and ice mixed together. how cool would that be? very. issler: indeed, i just think even concord has a few ""bad asses"" that are just on the verge of ""going pirate"". i mean, in terms of storyline, the moment a concord commander finally says ""frag this, i've had enough of crap pay and no recognition from hq"" is the moment they go renegade. ccp devs should have a field day with this kind of fluff. bunyip: good to hear from you! i agree, there are any number of ways that the actual graphical deception for q-ships could be implemented into the game. i'm not a programmer so i won't pretend to say it's easy -- but given how fast this kind of game evolves, i'm sure some rising star in ccp will enjoy a moment over coffee one morning and scream ""eureka"" for the benefit of all capsuleers everywhere. and thank you all for stopping by to reply. much appreciated. o7"
5/1/2009,"i think its an idea but they would also need to vreate with it items that would use them... i agree a good thought but atm inpravtivcal until they make items thats require the components you would gain from it.well like real life you always get ""bad apples"" so it could be an interesting thing for some ""events"" or something and having people trying to find out the location's of the heads of the rebellions with maybe rewards of isk or even officer mods etc if you take them down.i think to much is left in space and cusing lag as it is .. yes it would be a nice added extra but i feel the amount pf player and structures there already are i can see this working.. but would love my own ""home in space"" even if they were to be destroyable etc... to many problems i can forsee with this.this could work it would just need an adjustment of the loot tables and another tiwst on it could be to put containers that if you have the hacking skill etc could gain you other loots too. as in all systems etc you have chances of finding a hauler spawn and in a mission maybe a spawn come into drop off supplies at the ""base"" where you are....i agree in total with you statement here .. considering 0.0 is less that 15% of the total player base and most small allainces dont have access to 0.0 when you have large ones taking up alot of space but no people residing there. you sometimes get lucky with high sec grav belts that can gain you lower sec ores . if you can find them and since wh's came in gravametric sigs outside of wh's are becoming less and less.interesting is all i can say on this.. i will give this some more thought and will post on it once i am done"
5/1/2009,"true, however, it wouldn't bother me in the slightest if ""personal habitats"" had a timer on them that works in exactly the same way as the timer on anchored cans.once the fuel ran out, the timer would kick in. once the time expired -- <insert ""popping"" noise here>. on the other hand, ""personal habitats"" would not be nearly as difficult to gank as a pos so i'm pretty sure there would be plenty of volunteers looking for target practice, too. thanks very much for your response!"
5/1/2009,grrr don't want to create an account in order to edit that page. please count this instead. #1) supercapitals#2) cyno effectthe rest are all equal to me.
5/1/2009,"for what? so his accent is laughed at? or perhaps to hear yet another eloquent remark about his lack of ""manhood"" in the pvp department?"
5/1/2009,toe-curling stuff.
5/1/2009,perhaps erik and his masters should spend more time debating issues of interest and import to the game and its community than making tourism videos.
5/1/2009,"tell me then, why should we 'debate' anything with you and your friends when the interest of you lot isn't to debate anything at all?erik, me and take care stand for professionalism, and we have a vision: to reach out and represent the silent majority of eve players and anyone else that can identify themself with our balanced stance and our transparant nature.it is very clear from this thread, that a lot of you don't have any interest to discuss anything in detail but instead just go for cheap shots to flame, troll and slander us. anything of importance which we say, gets ignored. what is the point debating with entities such as you, when you use every tactic at your disposal to sabotage the very core of the debate structure?all of your rabble and that of certain other people in this thread doesn't say anything about our movie or our willingness to discuss important issues. it just is a blatant display of your senseless confrontational nature, immatureness and unprofessionalism. qualities that are not desired on a csm, as we all saw on csm1 what that kind of attitude leads to.if you want us to reply, perhaps it would be time to show some genuine interest instead of looking for opportunities to flame."
5/1/2009,"is this the sum total of your contributions, and by default the contributions of take care that erik is using as evidence for his 'experience' and advantage he has as a candidate?by the way, that reply you sent ccp first time...is that the reply regarding their responses to the first formal submission of csm issues? i have a copy kicking about if you want me to post it?xavier"
5/1/2009,"are you just being deliberately stupid, trolling, or are you just putting your ignorance on past csm activities on display here? if you would know anything about the csm, you'd know where to find a nice index of all the topics every csm raised, and also who set up this whole system to improve transparency for the players.ccp basically said the first time that ""ccp strongly believes that switching skill training is an activity that encourages players to log into the game and play"". in summery, i wrote a reply how switching skills often does not promote players to actually play the game, challenging their perception. one of the obvious reasonings was that people do not want to play the game at 3 in the morning. another was analysing how the players planned their skills, and the findings were that people wanted to train skill x and y but instead picked skill z they didn't want as much, just because it finished training at a more convenient time."
5/1/2009,"you'd have to acknowledge though that they already were considering skill training queue, but couldn't implement it due to ghost training. also, there were countless requests for ccp to implement one even before the formation of the csm.as for my knowledge of the csm and past issues, i know where to find them, and have prior experience of the csm. you really need to do a little research before making such statements.nice plug for your wiki though, but i'm afraid to say it doesn't help me play eve in the slightest.i'm still trying to figure out why you seem to be doing all the campaigning for erik etc, given that you have done 2 terms in the csm already, meetings are closed to csm only (hence you can't possibly assist during the meetings) and erik will need to reply/debate/engage with players directly himself if he is successful in gaining a place on the csm. alternatively, is he going to be the public face of the take care party, with the founder pulling the strings in the background?"
5/1/2009,"ghost training? okay if you say so... err wait, you're just pulling that out of your ass, and it can be easily disproven by the following:ghost training = train battleship 5.ghost training + skill queue = train <24h worth of minor skills + battleship 5.yeah i'm sure ghost training was the big evil culprit. 1) it does make people find issues more easily, hopefully not raising them again on the assembly hall.2) it does make the life of a csm a lot easier.3) ccp demanded continuity and documentation that can be handed over to the future csms. without the wiki, things would be spread allover the forums and mailboxes, a problem that plagued csm1. like it or not, but it is the duty of a csm to write structured issue documents and keep them organized, and inform the players of what they are up to.1) erik has real life obligations right now but will be available later as the election draws closer.2) erik has done a great job replying in his candidate thread. there is just no point arguing with trolls that do not belong to our potential electorate and clearly are not interested in what he has to say, so instead he spends his time more productively.3) i think erik will do a more productive and professional job in the live discussions than you, and that he doesn't need me behind the curtain for that."
5/1/2009,"do i really need to refresh your memory?ccp said no the first time around because of ghost training. simple fact.hence why we use the evelopedia, and not your wiki, like xavier states.eh, it has been just about only you who has repsonded for him.he has yet to prove that he can talk for himself without you speaking for him."
5/1/2009,"i]i think erik will do a more productive and professional job in the live discussions than you[/i]actually, you can't really comment on how professional or productive i'll be in live meetings. i'm sure erik is capable of being professional in meetings, should he get the opportunity.i've also seen how you are in meetings and replying to ccp etc. if you are hoping to bolster the take credit party, i hope erik begins to engage with voters very quickly. if he is that busy and doesn't have the time to campaign, how will he be an effective csm member?xavier"
5/1/2009,"blatantly false, re-read the minutes. and i'd like to point you to the above equasion that disproves the theory, as the skill queue could have been implemented without being affected by ghost training.while omber's efforts to copy-paste my wiki into the evelopedia are admirable, it's still based on my work, and we reverted back to my wiki due to technical problems with ccp's. of course i hope that we can use evelopedia in the future, but you're quite easily dismissing my hard work here.then you can't read.he already did admirably in his campaign thread."
5/1/2009,"well, i see how you act on the forums, and i see how erik acts on the forums. you can learn some things from him. such as sticking to your own thread and not making all these silly attacks.if he is busy now that doesn't mean he doesn't have time in the future, eh? another one of your silly attacks, you really should stop that."
5/1/2009,"nuff said.your work was to set up a wiki. it was always clear that we wanted to use ccps, due to the very reasons you state: continuity.while i can appreciate that you put effort into it, it's hardly rocket science. i know. i'm clearly blind, ******ed and spread falsehoods, too!that's not what i hear from people, not can see. i can see a whole lot of you responding to people and then erik talking after your mouth."
5/1/2009,"writing things off as attacks is a bit easy, isn't it? especially when you started the attack."
5/1/2009,welcome to politics.
5/1/2009,"i think its fine that erik's campaign is being run by someone else... but then again, i never considered voting for him anyway.if people were pleased by ankh's contribution to the csm and are willing to take her word for which candidate to vote for, thats fine. should he actually forum troll and put in the work-- probably. however, you do have to worry about any politician who relies on their friends rather than their actual merits.edit-- vote weazy z :p"
5/1/2009,"silly me, i thought the forums were public?anyway, you earlier stated that erik, you and take credit stood for professionalism? is it your contention that cheap shots, name calling and insinuations are professional?given that csm candidates are campaigning, why should they stick to their own threads? this thread wasn't started by erik, so i'm hardly damaging your campaign or followers. i just will point out inconsistencies in other candidates 'cv's', as per political campaigning. i'd rather engage with erik though, since he is the candidate."
5/1/2009,i think this about sums it up. i don't have anything else to say to you for today.
5/1/2009,"so far 99% of that is done by other candidates or their troll friends. just look through this thread.our cv is perfectly consistant and if you want to discuss something of serious nature, perhaps you should refrain from making cheap shots and insinuations."
5/1/2009,"ideally, politics should have no place in the csm as the csm exists to serve the players."
5/1/2009,so the whole part about voting and campaigning is irrelevant?
5/1/2009,"you can have elections without politics based on actual qualifications, without candidates stumbling over eachother to slander some opponent."
5/1/2009,how about without political parties?i'd be interested to hear what you think constitute qualifications also.
5/1/2009,"concerted efforts have been made by myself and others whom feel your puppet erik and by extension take care are severely lacking in policy on certain issues.on your part, on erik's, the multitude of faceless sycophantic alts that spring up anywhere take care is criticized and that of take care as a lobbyist entity, you have evaded questioning on those issues that might be construed as controversial and specifically neglected policy in areas that might favor a pvp dynamic or pvp based platform for the csm.you continued assertion that take care represents a balanced and impartial body of individuals from a myriad of different backgrounds and play styles is patently farcical in view of your actions.this poses an unsurprising counterpart and equal to the roles and backgrounds take care members represent in game and the limited interaction you have with the broad spectrum of playstyles in game- this is reflecting in take care policy.to top it all off, the actual meat of what erik aims to do in his term is decidedly lacking in those areas you have seen fit to address. specifics please.on my part, i was not attempting to troll.i genuinely feel take care- specifically erik, needs to concentrate on the issues at hand and engage with the community:all of the community.we all want a better eve. you are caught up in myths of your own importance and sovereign value of your ideas and viewpoint. put down that magic mirror and begin proper discussion on issues that take care has avoided."
5/1/2009,"i created my own party. later today, im going to make a video. unfortunatly i do not have a cute, tiny fuel efficient car so i'm calling the pta to see if they will let me drive around one of their buses. after that i will string together a collection of urban landscape shots, maybe some close ups of some birds....."
5/1/2009,"seconded, if you can't handle the heat get out of the kitchen."
5/1/2009,"take care is not a political party. perhaps you should watch the movie again and do your homework.as for qualifications, how about being mature, dedicated, able to work with others, able to represent other views than your own, being able to format your issues in a neutral way, communicating your issues clearly with ccp, writing clear documents, being on time and present for meetings, just to name a few important qualities for a council member.unfortunately, this has already been disproven countless of times in several threads. take care will look after the interests of all playstyles, including 0.0, lowsec and factional warfare in addition to industry, roleplaying, mining, exploration, mission running and everything else out there. there has been a proven track record with issues in these categories, and we have a pvp player on the board, while i am an experienced fw player. erik hangs out in lowsec. this has been proven many times over, so i wonder why i have to keep repeating myself.if you criticize us on not engaging with all aspects of the community, then think about this: can these noisy pvp candidates really represent, say, the interests of casual npc corp players just as well as we can represent factional warfare players? i severely doubt that."
5/1/2009,"that's ironic. your dear friend erik, stated otherwise here."
5/1/2009,"you may not like to call it a political party, but its a party running in a political contest.i'd say i meet all those qualifications listed above. i was hoping you'd bring up communicating with ccp in a clear way and writing clear documents. i have, sitting in my mail folder, an interesting document you wrote and sent to ccp as a csm response to the second lot of issues sent in for consideration. it makes interesting reading, and in it you are not professional, mature or formatting issues in a neutral way. above that, and much more seriously, you send it in a position as secretary of the csm; hardly a way to gain the respect of ccp, or a way to represent the csm in a professional manner. it is of concern to me that you may in some way be associated with another member of the next csm via your take credit party. rather than viewing players that pull you up on inconsistencies, overstatement of fact and clear fabrication, wouldn't it be better to actually engage in some meaningful discussion on issues. i see that facebook and ambulation are stated as major issues for erik in the next csm (one's he'll be pushing). how does this make the gaming experience of eve better and how will it affect players in-game? what proportion of the playerbase will it affect?xavier"
5/1/2009,lol.
5/1/2009,"that is kinda outdated, don't you think?"
5/1/2009,"i disagree. it exists to hear and consult people from different playstyles, and allows me to hand over my valuable csm experience to others, instead of letting it go to waste. we all know what happened when inexperienced csm took office at the start of csm2. i learned from that experience and will do whatever i can to make sure that it doesn't happen again. oh more slandering eh? and it interests me tremendously who gave you that particular document, which was sent on personal title by the way, not on csm title. of course you wouldn't know the circumstances and context that doc was sent in, or ccps reaction to it. so you're just ripping things out of context and out of proportion in order to spread your message of hate.i won't bother making any further comments regarding this document, as you're just spreading more falsehoods anyway.feel free to start a mature discussion without fabrications and personal attacks any time you like, i'm waiting on you here.i think more networking stuff would be great in eve and that there is a clear demand for this based on the repeated player requests to have a larger character bio and more (corp) standing slots and ways for alliances to distribute standings. ambulation was received well at the fanfest, i'm sure it will not appeal to all players, but it would be a boon for roleplayers and other people that just want to socialize a bit more. being able to hold corp meetings in an actual office is a positive thing. one may of course ask if it is a good thing that ccp dedicates so many resources to developing these features instead of putting them into improving existing aspects of eve, but as far as i understand, the walking in stations engine would be developed anyway for that vampire game they're making, do it's not resources being diverted from eve, but resources from the vampire game being diverted into eve. win-win situation if ask me."
5/1/2009,"oh more slandering eh? and it interests me tremendously who gave you that particular document, which was sent on personal title by the way, not on csm title. of course you wouldn't know the circumstances and context that doc was sent in, or ccps reaction to it. so you're just ripping things out of context and out of proportion in order to spread your message of hate.i won't bother making any further comments regarding this document, as you're just spreading more falsehoods anyway.actually, falsehoods and slandering implies that i am making something up. of course, it's in your interests for players to think this. however, you gave me the document concerned, and i'm fully aware of the context and circumstances the document was sent in.you were a csm member at the time, you were secretary, and you sent an initial response to ccp, copied to all csm members (ie, it's hard to see how you sent a personal response). i quote your statement to ccp (main body of letter, document was attached);hardly a professional start. it's interesting that you view questions, statements of fact and the highlighting of incosistencies as personal attacks and fabrications. xavier"
5/1/2009,"thank you for your clear display that you are unable to engage in mature discussion as you yourself proposed. you are clearly ignoring my answers, so there is no further point in debating with you. so much for your own inconstancy in your claimed credentials.rather than wasting any more time with you, you can consider yourself ignored from now on."
5/1/2009,"""was geht mich mein dummes geschw<U+FFFD>tz von gestern an?"" (what do i have to do with the stupid things i said yesterday?) seriously though, i have no problem with your ""party"", but i can<U+FFFD>t stop thinking of you as some kind of middle-asian president changing the law to be allowed to get elected another 4 years. and while you and erik both state that it<U+FFFD>s okay that you answer all questions in his thread while he is occupied, i still think we *should* vote for the person we want to represent us, and i can<U+FFFD>t stop wondering if erik will find much time to work on csm-issues himself if he is so bussy in rl. on a final note, posting stuff likeorand then asking for a mature diskussion does not exactly make you (or your candidate) look qualified, and while you may think it<U+FFFD>s all pvpers crying about a, the fact that your candidate has no experience when it comes to big fleet battles, capfleets, sov etc. remains.what i would really like to know is this:what would you do if erik and you have a disagreement about some really serious csm-stuff? whose opinion would prevail? judging by erik<U+FFFD>s thread, it looks as if you are ""in charge"" of ""take care"", but (as you stated) we are not voting a politicall party and its agenda, but a single person.while i am sure that you have put a lot of work into the csm, i think you should just let go and try not to become some kind of kazhakstan-style backseat-csmler, which is exactly what you do look like when you post twice as much as the ""real"" candidate."
5/1/2009,the mature thing would be to admit you're wrong.
5/1/2009,"as already repeated for a hundred times now, just because he is busy now doesn't mean he'll be busy later. the elections haven't even started and he's not a csm yet, so what's the problem? he'll have plenty of time later.and answering the forum rabble is hardly the most important job of a csm, there have been many that have not shown much if any forum activity at all during their term.i'll be busy with my graduation (master of science in game design and development) this year and finding a job in the games industry, so i certainly don't have time to play erik like a puppet as some of the people like to think. take care exists to represent all playstyles and allows me to hand over my valuable knowledge, as already stated. i'll just be an advisor, and only when asked for. the most important part of my job is already done, travelling to berlin to talk erik through all the issues and procedures of the past csms in detail. if erik wants to do something i disagree with, then it's not my business to interfere.i'm more than happy to let go of the csm, but i will close this chapter in a proper fashion and that includes passing on my experience so others may benefit."
5/1/2009,"you have to keep repeating yourself as no-one with an iota of insight into pvp centric aspects of this game actually buys into what you are saying.since you brought it up. ank, your fw exploits are infamous. namely your use of cloaks to remain in fw plexes and time down buttons and continued abuse of a standings exploit where the opposing faction rats that your militia is supposed to be at war with wont attack you.people remain unconvinced as to the validity of the experience you and other take care candidates claim when it comes to pvp and an understanding of the appropriate game mechanics and community.being in faction warfare is not an appropriate pedigree yes. please outline why you don't think this is the case, for specific individuals."
5/1/2009,"i wouldn't call it interesting, everyone goes through a phase in life where that is the default response to such obstacles that rear their heads."
5/1/2009,"1. there should always be a way for a person to play eve solo, but it should not be the major focus. mission running, mining, etc should all be at a point where it can be done efficiently solo, but more efficiently with a friend or two dozen. solo pvp, on the other hand, should be at the pilots discretion (see ridiculous fit nightmares) and should not be instituted as a ccp goal. 2. yes, i agree. ccp should focus most of their time on improving the interface and making things run smoothly, and having storyline and immersion elements on the backburner. the obligatory eve has sound? quote really fitsa majority of people who play eve do not play for the story, and ccp needs to try to appeal to both but with different amounts of care. 3. everyone likes new ships and toysccp just needs to stop releasing them pre nerfed to the point where they arent worth the initial cost, and used very seldomly until they are fixed. good examples of thisblack ops, t3, electronic attack frigs. all of these are good ideas, just came out nerfed to the point where they arent very useful and therefore do not quench the users thirst for new content. 4. i agree. although i do not roleplay, they should be allowed certain rights (within reason, not bob rights) to help their play style. i think ccp will be trying to do this more in the future with ambulation and so on. 5. i dont think insurance is that bad. you still end up losing a lot of mods, perhaps even your implants, and rigs. when i lose a t2 fit battleship, im out 100m isk anyway from fittings and rigs alone and also have to spend the next few days fitting a new one out and getting it moved to my home system. insurance just takes away a little bit of the sting. 6. there will always be people who talk about the good ol days but to be quite honest, were currently living in a very healthy age for eve. just go and get in a 100v100 battle and see how much better the lag is than a year ago even. even without requesting a reinforced node, its not bat at all. i remember having lag in a 10v10 fight when i first joinedso this is a golden age. 7. yes, i want a hot yellow vagabond with rims. everyone does. if elected, ill push ccp to try to make the game have a more customizable feel to it so every raven is not grey and every thorax does not look like a you know. 8. yeah, same as above. would be nice, but isnt exactly a high issue issue to memore of a nice feature that would be cool but is not that important. 9. if youve ever read npc corp chat, youll know why it is not a haven :p. but seriously, i dont see a significant problem with it. people should be allowed to abstain from pvp if they really do not want to, and npc corps provide that. if it is a place where isk farmers like to hide, so be it. the problem isnt npc corps, its the isk farmers and the inability for ccp to fix the issue. 10. as long as it doesnt introduce a ton of lag, im all for it. i would like to see more npc involvement with the markets and the npc trade system. it would be very nice if the background commodity trading was not all bring something from high sec to low sec. 11. i think eves history and heroes defently illustrate this. the great wars and battles are written in the history books the stories written by ccp are just interesting background for an already incredibly in-depth political structure. should ccp report more news/fleet battles? yes! should ccp stop publishing stories? no, not at all."
5/1/2009,dj tempest3k will be running a brief on air interview of my between 1900 and 2200 gmt today. you can tune in via links on new eden radio websiteand join us in the ingame channel - neweden-radio i hope to see you all there
5/1/2009,"i would tend to think of myself as a all-round candidate - as my pvp knowledge isn't the best, but i am open to all aspects of eve, and dabbled in almost all of them at some point"
5/1/2009,"i am defenatly pvp mad i am defnatly more indusry based and most of the activites involve mining hauling and building of most types of ships and mods... atm the only things i dont build are ms, titans and tech 3"
5/1/2009,"oh look, take care alts!"
5/1/2009,"well, if u pay 15$ a month to not shoot at things, i sorta feel sorry for you.like it or not, pvp is the main reason a lot of us are interested in eve. everything else, for me, is filler and/or ways to pay for the toys we get blown up. why am i interested in pushing changes to pvp rather than pve/invention/the market/etc? because combat needs to be balanced more than any aspect in any game-- everything else is either opinion or interface improvements."
5/1/2009,"combat can be balanced and expanded by making more and different ships available. don't you think combat would be very different if t3 cruisers only cost 50 million isk to field? that's a pve balancing issue.frankly, even if combat pvp (the market is pvp, too) is your endgoal, the people that produce the ships you fly and the guns you shoot might not be so bloodthirsty. its a very diverse game, and saying that one aspect of it is most important is a little naive."
5/1/2009,"i don't know about not having an agenda. i don't know if i specifically stated if i had one or not, but i've posted a few times and answered questions about how i feel i would bring idea's to the table regarding aspects that were put forward to me. i think that even if some candidates don' specificaly state an agenda, we all have ideas that we want to put forth once the election is done and gone. i think the best way to get views on how the candidates stand is to ask them questions, get a feel for who they are, where they stand on certain ideas ect..."
5/1/2009,"i know for a fact that i do have an agenda:i want to help improve evei don't really think that i would go out of my way to institute ideas that are obviously benefiting one group over another, but i wont shoot down ideas because they dont adhere to my ideas about how eve should be played. any good idea that will make eve more fun is a good idea i will endorse."
5/1/2009,"i think its a conscious decision to distance oneself from other csm candidates that clearly do have an agenda-in the same fashion as a politician pushed into office by a third party has an agenda, namely that of his backers or an oligarchy that stand to benefit from his election; instead of having policy dictated by what he thinks is best for the electorate.hardly a servant of the people.so, i can see why some people might state 'i have no agenda', besides that which their own personal views and conscience dictate.alternatively, they might just be applying to the csm on a whim and have bought into the idea that it is a waste of time, commissioned by ccp to do a job that should be carried out by a salaried employee, so ccp can maintain the illusion that customer relations are getting better.in this case, they may just be after a free trip to iceland, or a hug from mitnal. you cant really say until after they are elected."
5/1/2009,"i would love to be able to skill up my alt characters, i have three accounts but have alts on them that i quite like to ""muck around with"" trying out new features and stuff. the ability to train these characters up would be awesome. i also don't think the argument against, that it would get rid of peoples additional accounts really stacks up. this is an rpg and the ability to try lots of things out with different chartacters is very appealing."
5/1/2009,"i run 3 accounts personally, and i don't think this is all that big of an issue. true, i would really enjoy being able to train 3 toons (hell, i'd settle with 2) on the same account, but from ccp's perspective it doesn't make sense to implement it. i use the extra slots on my accounts for research and cyno alts-- pilots with very low sp who do only one task. i probably lost a few days training them, but they are incredibly useful. also, i know people who buy characters using in game currency and park them on accounts that they dont plan on training due to the specialized role they fill (ie trade alts, hauler/freighter alts, exploration alts, and pos gunners in specific) so these extra toons are being used.i think, also, that the skill training queue was a buff to these characters, since you can queue up all the skills you need them to do (ie skills to pop cynos, for example) with more efficiency than previously. you no longer have to babysit the toon while you spec for its purpose.so... yes, i agree it would be nice but i also agree that ccp needs to make rl isk :pedit-- vote for me :p"

5/2/2009,"tbh, throwing the sensitive elements of motherships and titans together in one topic is a bad idea, it makes it too easy to go overboard with one and forget the other, or even punch through changes which make sense for one type but not the other.vuk, best split it up, since both types are not only very different, but also serve different roles in game, heck they even rely on very different mechanics. maybe then there will be more unilateral crunch for getting the troubles tackled. besides that, you know ccp never likes overall changes, but prefers to handle matters to the point and in specific."

5/2/2009,supported
5/2/2009,"it's a good idea, but only at it's wider level.there aren't any alliance levels roles/abilities yet, so why not start there to include things like the same corp based roles but at an alliance level that crosses all corporations and can be audited by all directors and above.addressing the whole issue of alliance mechanics and allowing it to be an entitiy in it's own right instead of a vague collection of corporations would only make alliances more important to the rank and file player who logs on a few hours a day but doesn't get involved with alliance stuff as to them it's just people telling the corporation what to do and when."
5/2/2009,"i like the idea, but i can see where others might not.how about the option to switch to standings instead of a universal change?"

5/2/2009,supporting a 'moar proper ships' thread.none of this t3/faction bull****. moar proper ships kthx.
5/2/2009,"hell's yes,... i take my ships like i take my coffee and my minmatar!!"
5/2/2009,"if you mean as a faction bs, only if there are thukker and intaki ones (not sure what one caldari could have as an equivalent. achura maybe?)unless ofc, it is a t2 bs, then definitely, just make the khanid one the amarr one."
5/2/2009,"caldari control tower: 50 million shields with 50% thermal resistance, then 4 million armor after that.gallente: 35 million shields, 25% thermal resist. then 8 million armor.minmatar: 45 million shields with 25% thermal resistance and 50% em. then 6 million armor.i'm not sure if you have to burn through the shields if the tower is offline, and i can't find the amount of structure for each tower. so lets look at the armor only. weakest armor is on the caldari tower with 4 million points. at 1000dps, that will take you 66 minutes, 40 seconds. then you start work on the structure.even worse, this is assuming that they didn't use the 24 hours warning* to online their tower so you would have to take out the shields.so how do you plan to keep bordem at bay for that long ?*last i heard concord would protect high sec towers, so you will need to war dec them.shows how much you know.... 1) offline towers do not have shields. 2) offline tower can be killed in less than 30 minutes by 3 bss3) concord does not protect the towers. and, if they do put it online in the 24 hrs. then the tower is technically not inactive. someone is monitoring the corp. mails and corporation is active. i thought this whole proposal was to try and remove the ""defunct"" corporate towers of people who left the game and so forth."
5/2/2009,/me facepalm
5/2/2009,yes. blowing up an unshielded tower is quite easy. you should try to shoot something other than your ill informed mouth off.windjammer

5/2/2009,sorry.. wasted all of my ammo blowing your pathetic argument up.unless you got a cap fleet in your pocket... your full of crap.
5/2/2009,like i've said... sounds like a new sport in the making.
5/2/2009,"instead, how about a set of high slot modules which you can use on towers in space to make them go away if they bother you.you could set it up to be different for each race, eg. amarr ships might have some kind of device that shoots some form of radiation at towers; caldari could have 'launchers' for a form of self propelled munition (we could call them miss-les); maybe gallente could use a guns based on massive magnetic fields flinging objects at towers; matar would obv just have the usual barely functional ****.ccp could even make it so that these ""weapons"" could be used on other types of space object aside from towers, we could have huge internet spaceship fights... oh wait."
5/2/2009,"\o/*edit* sweet, first on p2, oh wait, this isnt caod"
5/2/2009,definitely do not support this idea.go to w-hole space if you want a nerfed local.
5/2/2009,"fixed for ya.having deyaled local, wont be more realistic (wait we have stargates in real life?), it has already been said that the stargates provide the local list (lore wise/techincal).most pvp i have done has been done with the help of local, to actually know theres targets in the system, instead of using a probe launcher (to lower my dps, which already is quite pathetic)."
5/2/2009,it has already been discredited that the stargates provide the local list as pilots who arrive in-system via wormholes and cynos - not the gates - show up in the local list.
5/2/2009,right! and if you fly into a wh system you read something about a beacon for the local chat.
5/2/2009,"this needs to be done, all the scam spam makes eve look trashy to new players. (gold sellers are pretty rampant as well)"
5/2/2009,surely this was fixed long ago?i'm certain this was fixed shortly after empyrean age?if not... it does need a fix.then again... fail warfare guys in 0.0. lawwl. fail warfare is for people who dont have what it takes to make it in 0.0. every single time i've seen them goto 0.0... they got obliterated.
5/2/2009,does seem a little silly tbh
5/2/2009,how is this meant to make sense?
5/2/2009,"i'm told by people in the programming industry that there are other ways by which ccp could, if it wished, detect and thus ban macro users.afaik, none of the methods these guys so patiently try to explain to me [with limited results] have been used by ccp.i can't believe it is because ccp isn't smart enough to implement them [or can't find someone to hire who already knows], so i suspect that outing macro users is a strategic low priority task at ccp."
5/2/2009,omg we have to worry about bot miners and now ppl who cant name a jet can with the eve timer showing on their screen? maybe we can develop a game that is 90% afk just alot of rewards and medals for time served in training
5/2/2009,you necro'd a thread for a troll?you really need a break from this game.
5/2/2009,"today i'm in amarr space but doing missions for a gallente agent at quafe in order to improve my minmatar standing indirectly.so this quafe agent asks me to pop some amarr ships on the intercept the saboteurs mission. umm ... logic error -- in amarr space, amarr ships aren't saboteurs; they're the home team. so they wouldn't be smuggling a virus in to attack an amarr world, now would they?it seems that the mission generation system doesn't check for the sovereignty of the system(s) where the mission will take place. it should, and then generate only those missions that make sense in the context where the job will be located.intercept the saboteurs (blood raiders) would work fine. so would (sansha) or any other pirate faction.**i suspect that this sort of error is possible any time the targets are one of the empire factions and the station is located within an 'opposing' empire.[fairly obviously, since the empires are not formally at war with each other, the stations of their 'opponents' are still functioning. further, to stay functioning, no gallente agent who is in amarr space will be giving out any assignments to whack amarr military units -- or his station would be seized by the local empire [amarr in this case].thanks for your time,"
5/2/2009,"it has been far too long since this topic was brought up. i think mainly due to the fact that there has been little response until now. as we speak the csm is meeting to discuss many new revamps and this is one of them, until then i have to ask. just how do you remove all the old corpmail so new members don't get a billion messages to sort through on day one?"
5/2/2009,you highlight each message and delete them.have to be ceo/director/or communications officer or something.
5/2/2009,"the ceo/director deletes them - which, let me tell you, is a bad mechanic when the ceo thinks he's just deleting them from his own inbox. i assume this is one of the many things that will change when the new mail client comes in soon(tm), though."
5/2/2009,didn't say it was good just to make sure i wasn't observed to be trolling : o pthey need to allow the sorting of those eve-mails or they need to adopt a forum board attitude.like gmail's convo chains....
5/2/2009,"the mail system will be revamped as a part of the cosmos project, as far as i understand."
5/2/2009,"""and why the hell aren't they banning the freaking ip for the account?""because ccp can't. there are way many isps that assign ip numbers temporarily only when a user is connected. i had this with my almost always on dsl service through the teleco -- they gave me a new ip number every time the system kicked me off and i got back on.btw, ""blocking"" a character should made the local client omit his nonsense from all chat. i thought it used to do this, but i keep seeing the dang spam."
5/2/2009,"i have been scanning posts looking for intelligent conversations on why i should be pushed into low sec or 0.0 if i am comfortable playing my type of game in high sec? is eve player driven or not? the manipulation of nerfing the rock size and regeneration of belts is the same as evercraft making manufacturing limited. that is steering the game not allowing natural progression.. there is a huge portion of players who enjoy research , manufacture , missioning ect and not losing a ship a day in low sec. our corp and alliance have not enough players who can gather at the same time to run in packs as an earlier post suggests. why do i have to play a pvp or pirate game so you can get better rewards when you are suggesting limiting my game play is that not very one sided. many ppl in hs are squeling about the game being run to please the pvp see there are two sides to every story. thanks for reading all the way thru"
5/2/2009,"no simple incentive would ever work.because if low-sec becomes more profitable, then people who don't fear it already are going to monopolize and farm it (pirates and large farming alliances learn to blob).because pirates will go back to low-sec to hunt you that much harder. whatever the reward, if you die everytime you set foot out of high-sec, then you don't profit.so you still woudn't go to low-sec. either you learn to love pvp and join a pvp first oriented corp or you fail."
5/2/2009,incentives won't work - but not for this reason. non-pirates and non-blob pilots can do very well in low sec and 0.0. those who want the freedom of living outside high-sec don't need incentives. those who need incentives will never move.
5/2/2009,"exactly.i will go to low-sec when the profits from going there exceed the value of the expensive ships and implants i will lose because i went there.i'd love to try mining low-sec ore just to see the stuff. even at the isk/hour loss, i'd rather mine an itty 3 full of zydrine and/or megacyte in one go than spend half a day each week picking up buy orders at 30 different stations. but if people perceive doing mining as boring they perceive watching someone else mine as even more boring -- thus the difficulty of enlisting enough people to make sure that my retriever and my iteron get into and back out of low sec intact.some people like pvp -- they think being shot at is fun and don't care about being broke. that's fine. i'll sell them ammo, modules, ships, etc.but i'm not going to provide them with a fat, helpless target if i don't have reasonable confidence that being a target in low-sec is going to turn a much greater profit than mining veld in high-sec, building stuff i know i can sell for at least 50% profit, and turning that 50% profit into 500% profit on the market with buy and sell orders."
5/2/2009,"there are multiple avenues that could be taken to support this outcome [more players in low sec and even deep space]:the one that immediately leaps to mind is to move the mission agents so that [example] 2 times the agent level, plus one times the sign of the agent quality, plus the security status of the system may not exceed some fixed value [12, perhaps].if something like this was done, all those lvl 4, +19 and +20 agents could not be found in any space of higher security than 03. this would cause the mission running guys to vacate high sec, form into bands and groups [or even corps!] and invade low sec in order to get the very profitable missions.and out there, they'd have many a battle with the player pirates -- both because the pirates might try to gate camp a low sec route and because the pirates use probes to find the mission sites and invade them to gank the mission runners and steal their mods.your thoughts?"
5/2/2009,troll.
5/2/2009,it's called sarcasim... look it up.
5/2/2009,a better solution would be to flag the gang-linker for aiding an enemy when they turn the links on.
5/2/2009,implants are a luxury for those who can afford it so i don't think there should be insurance for it.suicide ganking well i enjoy it sometimes.
5/2/2009,"sometimes you die... its a part of this game. if you think that concord should protect you 24/7, maybe you should try to find something else to play.suicide ganking is fine. infact, its more than fine-- its good. you think that grinding plexes to get faction loot is any more taxing or difficult than finding a good target to gank? no, and you need to realize that everyone in eve wants a piece of the lewt pie."
5/2/2009,"i would first like to ask why ankh replies to posts asking questions of the csm candidates?</snark>i think that the insurance system is inherently flawed. it needs work. this is something i'd like to explore and expand upon as a csm. however, if you say that concord kills should not be viable for payouts, then what about kills by empire npcs in missions? if i take the enemies abound mission versus gallente, and get killed, should i get a payout even though i was technically engaging empire npcs? what about faction warfare fighters destroyed by enemy police npcs?i agree with les brains that implants are a luxury, not a necessity to eve. i think that if module insurance comes about (i haven't decided how i feel about this yet) implant insurance will certainly follow, but i feel that the premiums should be higher. if you're taking a risk with a head full of snakes, you should pay good money to protect that investment. of course, establishing insurance values on many implants will require an overhaul of the ship insurance system, insuring based on market averages rather than npc build costs.tl;dr- for now, concord kills should still get payouts. no implant insurance."
5/2/2009,"i think when it is an act of piracy for money gain on a ship concord should cofiscate the insuranse payout as a fine for ""crimes against the empire"" it wouldnt cut down on piracy altogether as there are some people ingame who like to play that role but insurance fraud ingame should be the same as real life"
5/2/2009,oh look more anonymous alts voicing support.
5/2/2009,"your alts, you mean."
5/2/2009,"i don't use posting alts.that said, it seems clear someone does and that someone wants to display take care in a positive light- or rather is just interested in misrepresenting the community response to everything take care does."
5/2/2009,"look, i'm not going into discussion with you any more as it's totally pointless and you're not listening to what we have to say, and you're not going to consider voting for erik anyway.i don't care what the pro and contra alts do, there are alts on both sides of the fence it seems, they do not belong to take care so erik is not responsible for them and no attention should be paid to it.end of discussion."
5/2/2009,"incidentally my shortlist would be lark, omber and erik. would be.i'd say you've successfully poisoned quite some number of votes he would have had.then again, if erik actually makes an effort i'm sure he can reverse the damage you've done and may tunr out to be a good csm candidate, albeit on limited issues and not on the broad spectrum of topics you claim."
5/2/2009,"here's my problem.ank is answering most of the questions, thats fine, they think alike i'm sure.but the ""take care"" party isnt going to iceland, erik is. and as far as i can tell he'll have serious problems expressing his opinions on his own, no handholding outside of the forums."
5/2/2009,"i'm a candidate that doesn't champion one issue in particular.i have my pet peeves, as everyone does. industry is a chore, 0.0 warfare sucks, missions are repetitive and unvaried, features are incomplete and frequently broken, to name a few.my first interest is in making sure all play styles are available to everyone. wether you want to mission, produce stuff, moonmine, rat, plex, engage in fw, lowsec pvp, 0.0 warfare or, god forbid, piracy.as part of the csm, for every vote i cast, i examined the impact every change request had on each playing style, and made sure that the changes were balanced. that's what i'm about."
5/2/2009,"on a note unrelated to my current campaign, i would like to compliment sencnes and the folks at rebellion against big irreversible dinks [rab1d] on their good humor, sportsmanship, and understanding. my hat's off to you, guys."
5/2/2009,i'm finding this quite disturbing too. especially since you're still posting as cat (and not in the rp section of the forums) even though your csm campaign has begun...and instead of updating your campaign site as was promised by yesterday.
5/2/2009,"yeah...this is a bit too much on the weird-side of weird for me. pretending to be a young girl to annoy people...?seriously, dude?"
5/2/2009,"well that would have been my vote ya hadsome very nice sounding proposals there,especially better destruction effects.better sound to go with it could be nice,the groaning sound cap ships made in hw2 as the internal bulkheads blew out was awsome,added to the whole feel of carnage."
5/2/2009,"hi,as a long time friend of weazy, and after being through many corps and/or alliances with him, i can honestly say that he does have a firm grasp on game mechanics, because i know he used to be the biggest carebear in eve, and now he's hungry for pvp just the same way, so he has the knowhow to make 0.0 a better place since he's been on both sides of the fence so to speak.being in his roams when he was fcing was a learning experience, and was a good time, regardless of how rich he is, what alliance or corp he's in, he never stops enjoying the game, and he's a real standup honest guy - although this will seem as a biased post, it's not.cheers,whoochec"
5/2/2009,im 21
5/2/2009,well it's impolite to ask a woman her age .. but i am 34 :p
5/2/2009,"damn - 2 days late. considering there were just 5 people voting you might want to add a couple extra days to your deadline, though. if you do, please add:priority issue1 charter missions2 smuggling for pirate factions3 alliances in fw4 look at 100+km5 repair at right-click16 epic mission standing recoveryi don't care everything elsestanding recovery is way down on my list since i am strongly opposed to it."
5/2/2009,"i'm not trying to start another arguement (its apparent this thread doesn't need another one), but in your video, you state that take care represents the people in small corporations and npc corps. doesn't this refute your statement of all playstyles? alliance management does seem to be a style of play that attracts people to the political dynamic of eve."
5/2/2009,i thought my ego is inflated...
5/2/2009,"it's 6 months old, that's hardly outdated.and even then, are you suggesting that take care used to be a political party? because if you think it's outdated, then the only logical conclusion is that you acknowledge that take care was political party."
5/2/2009,"there's no difference between when you are being you and when you are being a csm member. whenever you engage with ccp, you engage as a csm member. i also seem to recall that you state on your take care site that you are all about engaging with ccp in a professional manner. if you can't separate your own opinion from your ""csm opinion"", then you shouldn't be doing any kind of talking.and let me refresh your mind:when you send that response to ccp, a majority of the csm was quite angry with you over it. why? for the very same reason that it's now being used against you: it's unprofessional and it's not something which the csm should be doing."
5/2/2009,"1) i never used the cloaking exploit, actually i was the one making phone calls to ccp and urging them to get it fixed. get your facts straight.2) the standing system is not an exploit and working as intended. once again, get your facts straight.3) anyone with an iota of insight would call you a liar and a troll.and please outline how you would represent casual npc corp players that just want to run missions and mine in highsec."
5/2/2009,"it doesn't say npc corps anywhere, and take care represents all playstyles as said over and over.take care is not a political party."
5/2/2009,but it does say that take care is for individualists and small corporations.you aren't answering my the question now either.but nice try at avoiding what your candidate said during last csm election period.
5/2/2009,"not true, the majority of the csm was quite pleased with it as i said exactly what most people where thinking. at least i'm not ccps *****, as the answers we got were less than satisfactory and accepting them would have harmed ccps and the csms credibility in the long run. ccp laughed about it, the csm laughed about it, and the only one griping about it is you. most importantly, we got the answers we and the player base deserved, answers which we probably wouldn't have gotten if the csm had remained docile and quiet. so yes, you can thank me now.don't pull more fabrications out of your ass, your credibility has already taken a few dents in this thread."
5/2/2009,"amongst others, yes. you might want to listen to the sentence we speak before that one, which you conveniently choose to ignore.""take care is representing all playstyles in eve"".fact is that i don't know why he said that and neither do you.fact is that i have said that take care is not a political party. you can repeat whatever you like as many times you want, but that doesn't make it true."
5/2/2009,fabrications which can be backed up by mails and chat logs. but wtf.
5/2/2009,"but seeing as you claim 2 entirely different things, which one should we trust?it's like a communistic government saying ""we represent everybody"" and then a few seconds later saying ""we represent the elite"".edit: and reading your website:what's up with that?but your own candidate stated otherwise. who should we trust? you or erik?"
5/2/2009,funny as i got a lot of mails and chatlogs proving the contrary. you're clearly talking out of your ass.what part of amongst other things did you miss? are you even capable of reading what i say?more examples on how we represent all playstyles in eve.how about a recent statement?
5/2/2009,"no, i'm clearly not able to read. actually, it's an example of how you don't represent all playstyles in eve.6 months old statement is a recent statement."
5/2/2009,clearly.take care represents all playstyles in eve. well except trolls maybe.there are far more recent statements. how about this for recent: take care is not a political party.
5/2/2009,"yeah that must be why i've raised so many factional warfare issues and some 0.0 issues.way to rip a comment over a year old out of context, way to go."
5/2/2009,"i don't see any 0.0 issues but the issue by darius johnson, which somehow is listed as your issue."
5/2/2009,"perhaps you should read why exactly it's listed as my issue, for the same reason it's also listed as vuk's issue."
5/2/2009,"i really liked the video, nice work."
5/2/2009,"my dear, i am not running for csm nor am i proposing a puppet to do so for me.you really should stop dismissing people that disagree with you and take care's policy as liars, trolls and idiots. i understand that your personal convictions might leave you to believe this is the case, just as they have lead you to take credit for the work of other csm members and earned the delightful moniker 'take credit', but as a former csm member and someone whom is pushing and 'apprentice' into the csm that has more in common with a hand puppet or catspaw than a free thinking individual-this is not acceptable behavior for anyone that intends to stand for a democratic body.when you (and by this i mean take care, through the medium of erik) are ready to start taking this seriously, as the process it is and actually engage properly with the people you want to vote for erik rather than dancing around issues, spreading misinformation and attempting to discredit opposing opinions through any means necessary- then, perhaps some progress will be made.until then take care remains a partisan political party in the community pursuing its own agenda rather than one born of discussion and compromise with the playerbase."
5/2/2009,"fw is not a appropriate sample of the pvp play styles in eve.especially when your personal efforts in factional warfare have been to avoid pvp whenever possible. you are infamous in your own militia for such and the lengths to whch you have gone to do so.your continued assumption of credit for the work of and input of others on issues raised to the csm not only further damages trust in take care but is an insult to your fellow csm members of your term and thier work, time and effort.out of context? hardly.you are campaigning with the same mindset you did originally, and take care mirrors that. your continued attempts to misrepresent this become increasingly transparent as do your personal motivations and the imposition of ego.you are not representative of all play styles. take care is not representative of all play styles.it is not reasonable to assume erik's term on the csm will be a fair and unbiased, balanced period of development based on your assertions and the composition of take care and erik's own personal experience."
5/2/2009,"that worry that i'm erik's so-called puppet master has already been answered and simply is not the case. i'm not taking credit for any of the other csm member's work, what has been claimed in the video and the campaign text is the bare truth, as has already been proven. i'm not going to repeat myself every page or two, and it would be nice if people would not ask the same silly 'questions' repeatedly. oh but we're already engaging properly with the people that are going to vote for us or have done so in the past elections, keeping up our promise to represent players instead of personal agendas. the thing is, that most of these questions are not coming from people that would ever consider voting for erik, nor do the people that ask them have any interest in our answers unless they can find some other things to twist for their own purposes and use in their next series personal attacks.same thing with xavier asking for my view on walking in stations. me spending time on an answer for him, which promptly got ignored in favor of more slander. yeah, really constructive and a great display of desire to have a productive debate. we're taking this very serious and i've personally had hundreds of emails with feedback and concerns which i all answered, which i think is dozens of times more productive than arguing with some people on the forums that are only out for blood, wouldn't you agree?"
5/2/2009,"thanks for the compliment, as that mindset is one that a lot of players want to see, based on past election results.if you don't like it, then take your vote somewhere else. plenty of l33t pvp candidates out there for you. problem solved."
5/2/2009,"*clears throat*lavista and ankhe, please take 10 steps backwards and shut the hell up.i didn't post this thread so it could be burned to the ground by a hundred derails. i posted it because like everyone, interest should be pursued and viewed.ankhe was csm. she is not running now. erik now needs to come forward with some delivery of his own and this incessant bantering needs to stop. i'm serious. if it doesn't i'll pod both of you just because i am a very very bored eve player right now and i have nothing better to do.i mean it. i want to hear less out of you two and more out of the general public."
5/2/2009,why are you still allowed to post?
5/2/2009,"to try to answer on your original question then, although it may be a bit difficult after all that racketi liked the movie, although erik seemed a bit ""shy"".however, i also interpret his demeanor as cautions and considerate. in my humble opinion the fact that he doesn't engage in pointless arguments with every challenger is a good sign. i think erik is a restrained type. a very good qualification for a csm i think, and in that sense a complete opposite from ankhe, who has a much more fiery temperament she seems like a kind of crusader, and provoked, she uses passionate words to get her point across. unfortunately, people like that are easily misinterpreted, misquoted, and soon the mob is shouting: witch, witch, burn, burn - objectivity goes out of the window. this tread so far is a real p..sing contest. its sad."
5/2/2009,"look, while somewhat entertainingly sad, this whole banter has gotten out of hand with the questions and verbatim responses. it makes me think the players are talking to gms about the party that isn't, and they're responding with 'i'm sorry, our logs show nothing of the sort.'i of all people know what rl is like, but we haven't hardly heard a peep from erik since he was announced as a candidate. therefore, i would like to throw down the gauntlet.erik, if you're still around and still care about this election, please drop by and answer a few questions for us:1) this representation by your mentor has gotten out of hand. what are your thoughts about some of the comments that have been posted in this thread?2) is this lack of response indicative of your term in the csm, and if not, why haven't you stopped by a computer for 5 minutes to say 'hi' to the people and maybe even answer a question from your voting pool?thank you, and i look forward to getting some opinions 'straight from the horse's mouth', as it were, and none of this (mis)representation."
5/2/2009,"this is not slander. slander is when someone makes something up. i don't make anything up and have the documents and chatlogs to prove it. however, accusing me of slander, lies and fabrications will not change the factual reality, and won't convince intelligent players that you are correct. also, i asked the question to see if it really is a serious aim of take credit, as i find it incredulous that someone running for csm is pushing a: issues about a feature that isn't even in-game yet (nor may be for the next csm term) and b; facebook crap and the like as something that csm and ccp should be spending their time and resources on, despite numerous other features and improvements that should have a much higher priority.when someone campaigns on the basis of 'past experience' of one of the party members, it should be expected that questions are asked of assertions/claims and performance of that member (and by default the party). that's politics. erik, i believe, is running for the csm as the spokesperson (and csm candidate), so voters would logically expect him to answer questions and clear up inconsistencies in claims etc. as erik will be subject to the csm disclosure rules, presumably there are topics and issues he can not discuss with anyone outside of csm, including party members/founders. hence, its right and proper that voters learn of his stances/views/politics before voting for him. other csm candidates, who may be working with him, also wish to get to know erik.in short, you are now one of the has-been politicians of eve. we aren't really interested in you (if we ever were). please put erik on.xaviery"
5/2/2009,thanks to everyone who tuned in and asked questions. i hope it was informative
5/2/2009,"market pvp can be more frustrating than combat pvp, but the variables that affect combat pvp are magnitudes more complex. i actually run a high sec research and t2 production alt corp, but if making items was the main reason i played eve then i would just quit right off the bat. in a game where you have the opportunity to go out and kill things at will, why would you want to do anything else?frankly where my post was going is that killing npcs is easy and predictable.. and boring. killing real life humans is difficult and should be balanced well or the players will find ways to exploit the flavor of the month. i want to help make sure that pvp is fair and fun, not boring and predictable."
5/2/2009,"people are often mistaking by dividing candidates by their type of play. i can say that i am 0.0 player but i will wholeheartedly support any empire, carebear or fw issue which is valid. you can have all 9 councelors focused on f.e. fw or mining or whateva but if they are stupid, egoistic, without general knowledge of all aspects of game or all of that together be sure that none of the issues related to their play style will be pushed further.the thing i really respected in csm 2.0 is that councelors who didnt have much experience with 0.0, sov mechanics or supercaps (my main area of interest) showed really big wish to actualy understand what were the issues and constructively participated in discussion. at same time couple of us who were not so into ""carebear"" side of the game also tried to give our best to understand the issues they brought. diversity is what csm really makes so great.on top of that i disagree that majority of candidates are exclusively for pvp. for the end, i as a voter would never vote for someone cause of his prefferable area of interest but because of my impression of him as person, and his general knowledge about the game."
5/2/2009,"in this regard, then, i agree with you. pvp is full of flavor of the month. variety is the spice of life. with this in mind, i would love to encourage new eden to take a bite out of a jalapeno and run with it."
5/3/2009,/signedalthough im not a cap pilot i do have to agree. theres nothing i loved more then seeing our cap fleet hotdrop an enemy support fleet.
5/3/2009,supported.
5/3/2009,"this post is sooooo needed. a simple flagging will make it fair....being able to sit in an npc corp and loot battles like that """"without"""" any risk...is bad form...and imho an exploit of the intended game."

5/3/2009,i fully endorse said product and/or service.
5/3/2009,allow a choice between the two methods.simple check boxwonderful idea.
5/3/2009,"as much as i like the idea, it is one deterrent to having 40 million alliances nap each other for every fight possible. it's small, but i've seen people on both sides hold out of fights because of pos pw leaks."
5/3/2009,supporting this idea.
5/3/2009,there's also caldari/minmatar missing as a faction. i wonder if they'll ever implement them along with gallente/amarr. they'd have to get their own space like the other pirate factions. some mordus ships would be cool too.
5/3/2009,"might be just a teeeeeny bit op as you describe it, but yeah, missile using armour bs plx."
5/3/2009,eom ships please!we need more npc 0.0 space anyway.
5/3/2009,"nice, supported.they look cool. the models are ingame, maybe some day we get these shiny black amarr hulls."
5/3/2009,"for the record, it took 2 hours on sisi to blow up a large caldari tower that was offline. this was with 4-5 dreads and a few bs. i could only imagine the horror of trying to with bs and lower. of course, i believe a majority of towers in high-sec are smalls anyway.amarr + unlimited ammo = free stuff. of course, time + effort = i support some sort of cleanup though...but there's no half thumbs-up, so i guess, /signed"
5/3/2009,i would like all anchored structures to unanchor after an idle period. cans included. unanchored objects would then be subject to trash cleanup after a period of time being unanchored. this basically means that you can let the players have a chance at the trash cleanup before it is removed to oblivion.
5/3/2009,"towers that go off line losing being swept up by a 'salvage crew' makes a ton of sense and creates:a) profitable careerb) forces owners to properly manage their resourcesc) avoids having to potentially 'war dec goonswarm' so you can do this.i support this as its a career i really want to get into ;0 buying stuff is for the mission runners, hard core people steal / explode other people's gear and sell it!"
5/3/2009,this.
5/3/2009,"my turn:instant local:- makes the game safer for players who want to avoid pvp giving them a real chance of survival when paying attention by giving them a time window to escape certain death.- already in game, so no development time needed and been working for years and the game is still a success.- helps all pvpers to find each other. you warp into system and instantly know if there is something to kill and don't need to spend time finding out if the ships on scanner are targets.- helps alliances to effectivelly defend their space from invaders and protecting vulnerable carebear operations vital for their survval. recent speakers local:- eve is a game with its own rules. every rule and mechanic in game is ccps decision even if they are not realistic.- allows cloaking ships to actually be invisible and gang carebears easier.- introduces more opportunities to gank people- you can not compare w-space with k-space. - with current probing system you anyway can only find someone if he is long enough on 1 spot (carebear/camp/afk) which introduces more static pvp.- makes scouting actually require some skill- dramatically increasing the risk for carebears with no reward as compensation.- no way to know for sure if the ships on scanner is friend or foe till on same grid."
5/3/2009,simple. good idea

5/3/2009,"stop the spam. it's everywhere, it's annoying and it's always the same thing. fixing the decimal display will make local readable again outside trade hubs."
5/3/2009,"supported. nobody's even dumb enough to fall for them anyway, so you're only really nerfing spam."
5/3/2009,"i spotted a new variant of this scam today (in rens, albeit the spam was nowhere near as bad as jita spam). the difference was that a contract now reads ""800,000,001.00""... i've added an amendment to the proposals to compensate, although this certainly makes suggestion 1) more valid."
5/3/2009,"this has probably been discussed before, however since it isn't implemented, here it is again.fleet commanders should, through the fleet ui, be able to discern all fleet member ship types by size (f - frigate c - cruiser bs - battleship etc. next to the pilots name) without asking players to spam chat channels with their ship type. this would also help with squad composition to see whether people were in the correct squads because organization requires too much time, especially when fleets reach obscene sizes of 100+. ___another related ease-of-use for fleet ui is automatic squad watch lists aka group ui in other games. add a button to the fleet ui that will toggle your squad's watch list (hopefully with the ship type size addition listed above). now when people enter your squad, program it such that they are automatically entered into that squad's watch list and removed when they change squad. manually entering players into a watch list and spamming chat for ship types or wondering if squads are setup correctly feels a bit silly when all you want to do is get to the action."
5/3/2009,"yeah, it needs a lot of work. problem is, but the level of data involved in a large fleet is fairly monumental. there are certainly better ways to present it than the status quo, but i'm not wholly convinced that there exists a way to do it that everyone would consider to be any good. things like this are why i'm such a moddable-ui enthusiast. still, supported - this would certainly be a good start."

5/3/2009,"so here we are today... i can order a bicycle, a new wardrobe, and a high def big screen. they can be mailed to my front door, and i don't even have to change out of my pajamas.i can do a quick search, and come across someone's cookie jar that sings elvis tunes when you open the lid. that too gets delivered.i can even apply for a job at the target in tokyo, without setting foot outside my house.now fast forward, what... 40,000 years. i'm wetwired into a pod, which is integrated with a massive spaceship. i can twitch my nose, and bullets the size of a sedan will streak through space for kilometers.but if i want to apply to a corporation, i have to travel lightyears to visit their headquarters offices? it would make sense if i had to personally interact with the ceo themselves, but i don't. i just leave a message with the automated receptionist, and they get back with me later.if i want to buy something off the market, i have to travel lightyears to pick it up, despite the constant flow of npc ""convoys"" in and out.i'm more than able to view contracts from around the universe... but i can't bid on them until i get within some imaginary political boundaries.where in the 40,000 year span did the internet grow incompetent?why can't we do more things at a distance?"
5/3/2009,signed.all of these problems have annoyed me
5/3/2009,having to pick up items i can understand. it adds risk when travelling and creates a niche for players to fill with courrier contracts. but in general i agree with you.

5/3/2009,"might as well make the game install software on our pc that detects macro programs and disables them. that's not done in any other games. oh wait....i don't see that happening, but it's a possibility...although that would completely break the current wine-based eve for linux and make me a sad panda. either way, not supported. i get annoyed with captchas on other sites as it is (and sometimes even fail them on occasion)."
5/3/2009,"hehe, i don't see a problem with this. don't really need it, but just because people are against it i'll support it i mean, c'mon, it's not game breaking is it?"
5/3/2009,well it has been awhile since the carrier nerf which disallowed anything which isnt ammo/charges in the cargo of ships in the ship maint bay.i would like reasonable stuff to be allowed in now.liquid ozone for cyno ships(which can be all ships)isotopes for black ops(even the blockade runners)i would also like assembled cans to be allowed in cargos. with the same rules. only ammo and charges. if ur flying something capboosted... a can of some size is advisable.
5/3/2009,reasonable.
5/3/2009,"not worth it, absolutely no benefit (apart from removing some good missions within specific parts of space), and i doubt the system has the functionality to implement this anyway.you could make the same argument for e.g. finding serps/angels in amarr space instead of blood raiders/sanshas too."
5/3/2009,"angels attacking amarr space would at least make a slight amount of sense. an amarr fleet attacking amarr space makes none. supported, though at a very low priority."
5/3/2009,"supported, but i'd put it low on the old priority list.i'd also like to see more missions (or rather a wider variety of available missions) at some point as well."

5/3/2009,"i personally feel that the interconnectivity between the 0.0 space-holding alliance and the high sec market is essential to the delicate balance of risk vs. reward for the 0.0 entity. to remove this dependence on the high security core systems would make it too easy to bottle up in your space and never leave it. something that i feel isn't a good direction for ccp and doesn't sit well with their game overview of a harsh and dangerous universe. it is no secret that i think that the balance of risk vs. reward is somewhat in favor of the space-holding alliance but some of the recent changes have addressed this issue and until it is seen how these pan out in the medium to long term i don't think there should be any dramatic changes to further destabilise what is, for many players and ccp a core part of the game. that isn't to say ideas shouldn't be looked at in the meantime based on the hypothetical outcomes we expect. in regards to making it more difficult for the 0.0 space-holding alliance to obtain the items they need for running of their poses, supplying their members etc. this would be very difficult to do due to the number of alts employed in the business of out of corp/alliance logistics and without a dramatic change to the way in which alts work i cannot honesty see a way possible to prevent it from happening. thanks for your question dex. hope it helps."
5/3/2009,"let's give ankh some credit tbh. aside from some <U+FFFD>ber cheesy video productions, i think ankh has proven an able csm member. she never pretended to be a hardcore pvp'er but has certainly championed some important issues, notably factional warfare. from what i've read of the csm logs she's definitely been more up to the task than some... ffs some people in csm - who a lot of people thought would be great in the role - haven't attended any recent meetings, which is a ****in disgrace imo.here comes the problem though. you never see a representative, in any walks of life, having their predecessor talk for them. erik is sitting back and letting ankh speak for him... he should be leading the charge with a fresh face and new ways of tackling issues important to 'take care'. it's clear to most who read the thread that ankh has chosen a dud who doesn't deserve and will not win a place in the next csm."

5/3/2009,"politics is pragmatic action for a moral purpose.everyone, who wants to make herself a picture of my position as a csm candidate is invited to watch the movie, read our website, and on top of that read all my posts on the forum. and may she and he, after reading, think about what i wrote for as long as i took for writing those articles. for i take quite some time and put a lot of thought into my writing, as a courtesy to the presumed reader.whether or not frequency as well as content of my publications are high enough and sufficiently elaborate to make me a good csm representative, shall be decided by the voters. my voters, by the way, have not yet complained about my unavailability nor lack of responsiveness. much to the contrary as to what forum regulars here are stating, when they have to wait here for a few days. this is a forum, guys - it is a-syncronous, and it is for 1-to-many communication. for my voters, i have answered to interviews and questionnaires. and with my voters i have exchanged e(ve)-mails, and i have chatted. quite personal and effective. i tend to believe, my voters are rather not among the regular forum flamers, who sketch a post in five minutes or bloat a five-minute-thought into pompous words.in this thread, my partner ankhesentapemkah got carried away by the heat of the moment. you can see, she is taking this very personal, and replies swiftly to every post. it is an ardour, which is not always helpful in keeping the greater picture in sight. while i might not post as many times, you surely do not want to imply that has any implication on the contents of my posts. hence, we like to see us as a team in take care. of course, all team work will be compliant with the nda between csm representatives and ccp. that is self-understood. her experience, as well as her vigour in pushing issues, are and will be most helpful for my work, which is after all representing players who come to us and ask if we would adopt their idea.diverging thoughts about priorities and the evolution of the game are intended and welcome. my posts convey the profile which i stand for. it is by having a profile, that i can also discuss matters, which i am not particularly fond of or an expert in. we can have a civil discussion about them during csm meetings; these will be online, and i will immediately answer."
5/3/2009,"fair enough, let's be civil and brutally blunt.i am going to ask you what i think is a important question, but do forgive me, should i phrase myself in a brutal manner:what makes you different from, as you identify yourself to be, your predecessor's successor, should you be elected?in other words, you got any material, ideas and/or concepts of your own, that ankhesentapemkah had no part in, as i am sure many would be shocked and amazed (i would) as many critics (me among them) seems to define you as ankhesentapemkah's obedient servant than a individual with ideas of your own?"

5/3/2009,"wormholes- i've been talking to friends and allies who have more experience than i do with wormholes (sadly, i just can't make myself live there just yet) and the consensus i'm getting is that spawns need fixing. initially, wormholes were overpopulated with spawns and a single pilot could happen across one, clear it out, and live like a fat cat on exotic dancers and spiced wine for days. ccp reduced the number of spawns per wormhole, but left the respawn at the initial value, which i'm told is 72 hours. in general, i understand that the number of spawns is not what these wormhole residents argue against, but rather the respawn rate. instead of producing 20 encounter spawns every 72 hours, produce 2-4 spawns every 12 hours. in this way, a single group could not reap ridiculous profit from a single venture, but multiple groups could, over the course of the day, all engage in encounters in the same wormhole. if elected to the csm i will push to improve wormholes so that all of eve can enjoy tech 3."
5/3/2009,"oh, so you'd like to get rid of the nda?i really don't understand this. please explain why it should be easier to live on the frontier. also, do you have any experience with sovereignty or pos mechanics?"
5/3/2009,thanks guys. any more questions or ideas?something i would love to see that i don't believe is possible is a fleet cloaker. a ship which can lay a cloak on all the ships within x km. in fleet combat this would be invaluable due to keeping your ship composition but they still know your numbers.
5/3/2009,"1) ring mining. - yes, mining needs work. ccp does not seem to like the way mining is right now according to january's csm meeting, and is looking for ways to to overhaul the belts and the mining mechanics itself. i am sure they have pondered with this idea of enormous belts before, and it is really one of the things i would like to see. ccp also stated the intention to have variable rewards and this could indeed come in the form of rare materials.2) renegade concord. - disagreed. just killing random players that happen to be at the wrong place at the wrong time is silly. eve favours the bold and this would not be any different from just running random database queries deleting people's stuff. if it is not avoidable by being bold, then it would just lead to frustration. so, please elaborate this idea by adding counter measures.3) player habitats. - small anchorables and colonies were already brought up by the csm, and ccp looked interested. mmos should always have a strong sense of player ownership, and any houses or other structures would give more opportunities for the individuals to build stuff in space too. i do not believe that building stuff in space should be limited to corporations and alliances, there should be smaller privately owned installations, too.4) rare materials in loot drops. - while it might spice up missioning, we should be very careful here. anything introduced through small quantities will explode due to the sheer volume of mission runners. a huge part of the mineral market comes from reprocessing mission loot, and the last thing we want is to devaluate other resources, ruining different carreers, by flooding the market with rare goodies. either the drop rate will be so low that the individual has more chances of winning a lottery in real life, or the tens of thousands of mission runners will flood the market. i like where you are coming from, but it should be handled with extreme caution.5) reducing loot drops. - i believe something should be done about the flow of minerals coming from mission runners. mission runners should still get enough to produce their own ammo in the middle of nowhere, but the mindless steady stream of minerals should be reduced. i would prefer to see other uses for dogtags for example, and a shift to other types of loot.6) q-ships. - this surely makes the game more interesting. i forsee some technical difficulties here, but if this is possible to implement, i'm all for it !"

5/3/2009,"thanks for everyone's participation in my previous questionnaire thread, the results of which i hope to be able to present as a easy-to-read spreadsheet soon(tm).naturally, my curiousity has not abated. here's a couple more absurd statements designed to ignite candidates' righteous ire and make them respond thoughtlessly, letting everyone see their true colours ;) again, please not only state your (dis-)agreement, but also rate how vehemently you would fight for your stance on the issue in a csm meeting.choices should have consequences. depending on the choice, the consequence may well be irreversible. that applies to the choice of race and attributes at the beginning (re-skilling? this is not wow!) as much as to the decision to make enemies of factions or to go outlaw entirely. trust takes a lifetime to earn and a heart-beat to give away. it makes sense to lose standings much quicker through certain actions (attacking factions, pirating, murder, etc.) than they can ever be gained. factions may still have some dealings with a known mass murderer of their own civilians, but they will not likely become best friends after he did some of the same to that faction's enemies.warp to zero may have seemed a boon to some, but it has turned out to be a blight in the long term. travelling the length and breadth of the galaxy should take considerable time not just for the feeling of travelling in endless space, but more importantly to spread apart the population. make warp have a certain random deviation, with modules, rigs and skills to increase precision.collosion detection is already in the game. it's only logical to cause structure and module damage. also, no more shooting through asteroids and other ships.ships jumping and docking from anywhere within the vicinity of a gate/station are somewhat embarassing. define some cone of space where a structure's tractor beams pulls ships in and docks/jumps them in one nifty animation.for no apparent reason a ship is set onto a grid before the client has finished loading said grid.factions would not offer jumps and docking to wealthy capsuleers for free. make us pay.both fuels and crews would offer exciting new depth to capsuleers as well as extra consistency.the local channel is just silly. if you want to find out what lurks in a system, make some effort and use a scanner deception is a good thing. think of modules that deny or even misguide scanners, turning my battleship into a freighter and vice versa until i'm at close range. to improve things for industrialists, ships and other items should list their manufacturers in their name or at least on their info tabs, while blueprints ought to have some random variation between them, however slight.instead of just randomly creating missions on the spot when an agent is contacted, missions should be drawn from a pool that reflects the needs of the corresponding agent/station/faction and may change according to player actions and global developments. missions in overrun areas would become scarce and yield lower rewards, while neglected agents may become desperate.the current system of shoving missions down the throat of inquiring capsuleers could be complemented by an open 'market' for missions where players could choose from missions offered at particular stations. the old system could still serve for loyalty point focused missions as well as starting or resumption points for certain mission arcs.when the bounty system is overhauled with transferable kill rights, npc factions, too, should be able to offer missions with kill rights against players that have really low standings with them.thank you for reading and commenting."
5/3/2009,"1.) agree/important. as stated elsewhere i feel one of the key things about eve over any other mmo out there is that your actions have repercussions pretty much for as long as you play. although remapping can be explained easily enough with the level of technology we are at in the game. 2.) agree/important. basically same concept as 1.3.) disagree/unimportant. i've played before warp to zero and after it. space felt much larger before warp to zero. it was also a right pain int he behind when you wanted to spend time with people you know in game. it was a huge timesink and the lag caused by the trillions of bms everyone seemed to have (which i was guilty in part for as i used to sell the sets of bm over the escrow system) was simply a pain. these days the issue isn't so much one of wtz being a problem than it is agility making it impossible outside of 0.0 to effect someone else's ship if they are smaller than a battlecruiser. apart from smartbombs on gates. 4.) undecided/unimportant. needs analysis of the possible repercussions to know if it would be possible to implement without causing huge issues for people as well as the lag caused by the number of additional computations. off the top of my head i would say it would be too easy to ""exploit"" this for harassing people. from a rp perspective if my ship was that fragile i'd want my isk back. 5.) disagree/important. the background prime fiction about the gates makes this proposition a bit nonsensical. with stations you have more of a point but there is nothing to say there should be one single docking or undocking port on a station so therefore if this was enacted it would be likely that many multiple vectors of approach in and out of a station. 6.) agree/important. akin to a lag discussion though. 7.) disagree/unimportant. capusleer craft provide much more in the way of benefits for stations they dock at than they cost to sit a ship in it. the crew of a battleship number in the thousands and with their shore leave they are spending money. you are using the market in the stations sometimes you are using the facilities you do have to pay for occasionally such as the repair facilities in some stations. all in all stations have more to gain from a capsuleer by making berthing free than they would if they charged us. gates are the same thing but on a macro scale. 8.) disagree/unimportant. crews would be nice. fuel wouldn't work as our drives are meant to be self perpetuating. 9.) disagree/important. whilst i love w space and the delayed local mode in it i think the tools available to us for finding out the sort of information we need is currently lacking and therefore would only support this kind of thing once there was tools already in place to allow us to decide how much information we need to know. personally i like the idea of hacking stargate's information banks as was proposed by one of my alliance mates a while ago with penalties if you mess it up. 10.) agree/unimportant. would be nice if a counter device was intorduced but hardly something to spend much time over. 11.) agree & disagree/unimportant. names of manufacturers is a bit of fluff which i suppose someone would like but i have yet to see the attraction myself despite being a large scale producer on my alt. blueprints are already variable by their me and pe levels. 12.) agree/important. i would love to see this sort of thing introduced. dynamics of mission running would be much more interesting with this in place. if you extend it out to include variable quality based on how much agents are used i would sign on for it straight away. 13.) ?/?. not sure i really get what you are meaning with this one. if you mean you select whichever mission you want to do for lower rewards or something then no way. 14.) disagree/important. just no. seriously. transferable kill rights should be something a player choses to accept not be forced to do by an npc unless it outside of the general missions arc."
5/3/2009,"1 (consequences) i believe that a certain amount of leniency should be observed in the area of attributes, allowing a 1-time reassignment. the fact is that many older players making their first characters had no idea what attributes did. when i created garthran, i put most of my points in memory, intelligence, and charisma. the reassignment of attributes allowed me to create a training profile that was more in line with the skills i'm interested in. as far as outlaws, poor faction standings, etc., i think that the game has to be slightly more lenient than, say, real life, in order to still be fun to all those involved. this is an issue of minor importance to me.2 (standings) i agree. positive standings, and security status, should be more difficult to gain than to lose. further, if you have previously had poor standings with a particular group, it should be more difficult to recover those standings. i think this relates to the previous question, and i'll reiterate that i believe that choices should not be permenantly game-altering, but they should have significant consequences. this is an issue of minor importance to me.3 (warp to zero) i tend to agree. i was pleased that ccp chose to keep the autopilot warp-to distance at 15km to leave afk player vulnerable. however, warp-to-zero still allows players to escape pursuers at gates and stations with minimal risk. a certain amount of deviation (say, up to 10km, adjustable by basic navigation skills) would be an acceptable solution to me. i'm primarily a carebear, but gankers need love too, especially in lowsec where they can't use bubbles to their advantage. this is an issue of moderate importance to me.4 (collision) on the whole i agree. i know several friends who would return to eve if ramming was a viable kill tactic. however, i'm sure this would bring about nothing more than a generation of nano battleships bumping capitals to death. also, the shooting through objects continues to be a source of annoyance to me from an immersion standpoint, but i imagine the implementation of obstruction would be fairly difficult as the game currently stands, and furthermore ship facing would have to become a concern as not all turrets can actually face all targets, but they continue to all fire regardless. so while in theory i agree, in application i believe i disagree. this is an issue of minor importance to me.5 (dock points) this is similar to point 4 in that i agree in theory, but think the implementation would be more trouble than it's worth. also, unless there was a specific autopilot function to pilot your ship into the dock/jump point, this kind of interaction would be too precise of a navigational exercise for eve's current piloting system. this is an issue of minor importance to me.6 (grids) i'm afraid i don't quite understand the situation, perhaps because i have never encountered it as a problem. ships are given lock protection while undocking to allow the client to catch up, and similarly have an initial cloak when they jump through gates. this doesn't seem to be a problem to me. this is an issue of minor importance until someone can convince me otherwise.7 (docking fees) i agree. fees would be nominal, but they would create an isk sink in much the same way that missions create a source of isk. this could help to drive down inflation, in all honesty, and i'm a fan of giving people more bang for their buck. this is an issue of moderate importance to me.8 (crew/fuel) propose a rational system to me and i'll agree to it. thus far, in browsing the ideas forums, i've found few propositions that i agree with. most involve ""leveling"" your crew, which i'm against. however, crew and fuel management would increase immersion for me, which i am in favor of. this is an issue of moderate importance to me."
5/3/2009,"9 (local) the more i play, the more i agree. leave local in place, but make the channel list speakers only. however, i agree with heartstone that before local can be removed, certain tools to ascertain a system's capuleer population in a general way must be introduced. this is an issue of moderate importance to me.10 (disguises) i think that a sensor deception would be simpler to implement than a physical deception, and i agree with it more. a high slot device of some kind to have a ship scan as something else, with scripts to modify what it scans as. i would be agreeable to assisting such a module into implementation. but ship disguises, q-ships, decoy ships, anything that would make a ship literally appear to be something else, i am not in favor of. this is an issue of moderate importance to me.11 (blueprints) with the namestamps, i know some industrialists produce with one character and sell with another, keeping the producer anonymous. the attachment of namestamps would make such anonymity difficult. honestly, the only purpose i can see it serving is epeen, and while i'm all for occasionally epeen reinforcement, its hardly a priority for me. in terms of the variation in blueprints, i'm all for variety, but some things are expected to be consistent. blueprint variations in such a technical time would be unlikely at best. this is an issue of no importance to me.12 (mission pools) this could be an interesting means of dispersing mission hubs. a more detailed description of implementation would help me support this issue. however, while i agree that level 4s are grossly profitable, it will take more than dispersion to counter the massive influx of isk via mission runners. tthis is an issue of moderate importance to me.13 (mission market) would most likely increase the isk flow from mission runners into the market, and would reward people that camp the market looking for the best missions, and hurt the casual mission runners, in my opinion. could honestly encourage isk farming. i disagree with this idea. this is an issue of moderate importance to me.14 (npc bounty assignment) in any other game but eve, i would support this. but one of eve's big selling points is that it's player-driven. allowing players to become enemies of the game, rather than enemies of other players, is in direct conflict with this. i disagree with this idea. this is an issue of moderate importance to me."
5/3/2009,"to clear this up:the idea about 13 is that there would be a mission board on every station where agents/stations/factions would offer jobs they need to done by capsuleers. those missions would yield regular isk rewards but strongly reduced loyalty points. once a player signed up for it, the mission would be stricken from the board, preventing overuse much as 12 above. instead, a counter mission *might* be spawned at an opposing faction's station. conventional missions from agents would be reserved for actually 'serving' the corp as a loyalist, giving access to those special rewards corps only hand out to them.npc bounty missions as suggested in 14, of course, would only be made available as described in 13, not forced upon players to keep milking that agent."
5/3/2009,more controversy this way.
5/3/2009,"1.) disagree/not applicable - as a csm rep our primary responsibility will be to be the relay for as much of the playerbase as possible. as it is this would preclude us from worrying about the solo player assuming solo play in eve is something not many people do. two things however work against this idea. primarily the idea of solo play being a minor part of eve is an erroneous one. a large percent of the playerbase occasionally run a mission, or rat in belts or produce things to sell on the market. all of these can be solo activities. just because a player doesn't define him or herself as a solo player this doesn't mean he spends no time using content that could be classed as solo. indeed most of the so called ""solo"" activity occurs either in groups or in the framework of a joint effort of some sort. in short i don't believe there is a clear distinction between solo content and multiplayer content. the second reason why this should not be the case is that the csm rep also has a secondary duty of care for those people who are less vocal than others but are part of our community. much of the analysis for this group will have to come from secondary data of course but this doesn't mean these people should be ignored. 2.) agreeish sorta but not in the way you think/important. eve is a game. let's get this straight from the offset. no matter who you are or how invested in it you are it is a game. for a large minority of people however part of the fun of the game comes from the immersion in the lore of the game therefore attempting to disconnect the fun from the immersion side of the game is a false concept. in regards to them taking a backseat to a streamlined game this is again a false concept as one of the primary ways to introduce increased immersion in the game is to make the game more seamless to reduce the number of breaks from the immersion it causes. in other words focusing on making the gameplay more efficent and streamlined benefits everyone so therefore it should be one of the primary focuses. 3.) disagree/important. maintenance, improvements on what is already in the game and balancing of what is in the game is quite important to allow the previous point to happen. whilst there is something to be said for new shiny things (i loved the last patch for example) and definitely something to be said for keeping the game alive through balancing the player dropout rate with new players these things will also be helped by streamlinign the game by keeping everything that is already int he game running as best it can. 4.) agree/unimportant. whilst i think roleplaying is an important aspect of eve it is enjoyed by a minority of people within the game (myself included). currently there are many ways in which we can use existing and already planned mechanics (such as wis) to roleplay with. would i like to see more done for ""my people""? yes. do i think it should be given a priority over other issues that affect all players (such as point 2)? no.5.) disagree/unimportant. insurance mechanics in eve work fine as they are in my opinion. sure there are things that don't make sense from a real world perspective but the majority of them are there to benefit the mechanics rather than the immersion aspect. as for ships becoming better with age... well that seems to me to harp to a secondary xp gain ala. wow or any other levellign based system. 6.) disagree/important. like much of what i said for point two i don't believe new player content and other content can be as clearly delineated as the proposition suggests. yes there are things such as the introduction missions and the new startup content that are for new players only but in general much of what we use is used by the new players as well. besides there has been a great deal of content for the more mature player recently as well. i general i think the balance is just about right."
5/3/2009,"6 cont.) additonally i think the new player content is a key part of player retention which, if we wish to keep playing this game for a while is kind of important. 7.) disagree/unimportant. customizable ships. ergh. pink thoraxes with purple heads... i think not. aliiance/corp logo-ed ships... maybe if it can be shown it will cause not lag which i have yet to believe has been shown fully despite what the proposition here suggests. 8.) agree/low importance but not unimportant. an increase in the amount of background and feel in the universe we fly through in will be immensely welcome by a number of players however there are more important things to consider. i think some resources might be allocated to this is i were in charge (which even as csm if i get voted in i won't be) but the majority of resources should be put to the aforementioned streamlining process. 9.) disagree/important. npc corporations serve a purpose for those players not yet ready or not yet willing to dip thier toes into the world of player corporations. they are somewhere when someone can take a break from them as well. leave them alone. 10.) see 8.11.) again same basic proposition as number 4."

5/4/2009,a boost for all of them would be nice--especially the vengeance.
5/4/2009,"so very true.out of interest, aside from the massive failure that is rockets, do you think that there are any other issues with the veng, for example, lack of grid/cpu? i only ask because it seems that rockets are high up on the big ccp list of ""stuff we really need to fix"". if they were to get a boost and bring the veng/hawk dps up to a reasonable standard with the existing damage bonus, what would you guys suggest for the 4th bonus for the vengeance?"
5/4/2009,"i could not agree more with this post. frankly, whoever thought it was a good idea to implement the system this way should be fired."
5/4/2009,fantastic idea - sort it out ccp. i don't care how long you take over it.
5/4/2009,"while i am certain that supercaps could be improved/changed i am also pretty certain that that alone isnt enough.one major promlem imo is that in the large scale of things they are built way to easily ...just look at the numbers of titans .... their cost and necessary effort was maybe balanced back when they were introduced in 2005/6 but these days they are far to easy to obtain.that starts with logistical changes, ranging from jfs to jump bridges, sovereignity 4 which decreases risk, and the simple matter of 0.0 income being way higher than back then :panyway, in summary ... ms as well as titans should be way harder to build and cost more ! :p(especially if buffed)"

5/4/2009,"post in need of extra bumpage above all the "" i want new ships"" threds o_o"
5/4/2009,nice idea.
5/4/2009,this can't be bad.
5/4/2009,"i don't really understand what you're proposing here tbh.are you asking there to be a khanid faction battleship? therefore becoming the 6th ""race"" of faction battleships, alongside the ones that are currently in the game (machariel, rattlesnake, nightmare, vindicator and bhaalgorn.or are you asking for there to be another t2 battleship in the game, but ""built"" by khanid innovations? just like in the ship descriptions of many t2 ships, they state which corporation (developer) built the ship - for example the curse and vengeance are khanid ships.if you are asking for the former, then your proposal should state the need to add a khanid cruiser and frigate as well. i think that would be a nice idea, as i've noticed khanid appear to be the 6th pirate faction, but not really, heh. it would also be good to see some more original hulls and shiptypes for the faction ship users, as well as seeing what bonuses or role they could fill.if you're suggesting the want or need for another t2 battleship, then again, you need to think about the other races. firstly what role would this t2 battleship fill? is it neccessary? how would it affect the dynamics of pvp and pve?it sounds to me like you would just like to see a cool looking black amarr battleship, which isn't a good enough reason to introduce a new ship class.the armour tanking missile boat would be decent, but how is it much different from the numerous shield tanking missile ships, aside from variety?"
5/4/2009,"look at the nightmare and the amarr battleships, they function very differently.+1 for more faction ships."
5/4/2009,i like idea but there wil only bring this if they can bring a new t2/faction bs for all races not just amarr/caldaribut othernews i support as it may make em do the other faction
5/4/2009,khanid faction geddon with torp and maybe also cruise rof bonus please.
5/4/2009,"this.none of you are considering the bigger picture.....what would the caldari, minmatar, gallente get?this isnt an eve ship wishlist.....thalane you need to expand on the topicthumbs down from me, sorry."
5/4/2009,"booo hoooo... it wouldn't be faaiir! does ford check in with honda to make sure honda has a new model comming out at the same time as ford's next model? ship makers should be in competition. nowhere is it written that everyone has to get cookies at the same time. (note: i don't actually care very much if this proposal ever happens as i just don't like the ""if i can't have a cookie nobody can have a cookie"" positions)"
5/4/2009,"it's already unbalanced because of sansha ships, so who cares? but i wouldn't mind a faction drone battleship for gallentes. :)"
5/4/2009,infested tentacle-domi plx!
5/4/2009,"my point here is that if you're going to ask for a new tech 2 bs, you cant say ""ccp we'd like a new tech 2 amarr battleship pls because i like black ships but dont bother making ones for the caldari, gallente or minmatar, because i dont care about them"".....you have to give thought to balance issues and follow the trend the game currently takes. and im not saying that thalane has this attitude but she obviously hasnt thought her proposal through.at the moment for every tech 2 ship that comes out every race has one and they are balanced somewhat fairly.....please state an example of when a tech 2 ship has been released and there has been no counterpart for the other races? struggling? that's because there isnt such a case.....so i am not saying ""if i can't have a cookie nobody can have a cookie"" like you seem to think.also your statement about ship makers being in competition is invalid.....in this game, ship makers are limited to what ccp allow them to make. there is no scope for us to build something unique therefore it does not follow the rl example you have given.....that ""competition"" for ship makers comes at the market where there are price wars."
5/4/2009,the op said nothing about tech 2 ships.i have a question for you lyra. faction ships that use gallente skills:-navy ships.-serpentis-angel-guristastotal: 4and for amarr:-navy-sansha-blood raiderstotal: 3how is that for fair?????????? :((((((
5/4/2009,"i need a reason to start learning caldari dread skill , pls make phoenix an usefull ship. currently you are better off in a torp raven wich will do much more dps than this huge crap, during any op, even if it is pos shooting."
5/4/2009,"i'll make my point with an example - small milita fleet of arbitrators engages a dominix. if everyone in the fleet is from a different corp, there is no easy way to quickly differentiate between purple, blue, and target drones (unless you're lucky enough to have the drone aggro)drones already inherit corp ownership, as well as wt ownership, from the launching vessel. all we need is to inherit fleet and milita and this infuriating issue disappears."
5/4/2009,because i'm that vain i want at least 1 support
5/4/2009,"supported.if i want to be popping hostile drones, i don't need to be searching through a list of every drone on the battlefield in order to find them. just show me the relevant ones."

5/4/2009,"wrong. that is how it is technically handled by the game. it is a mechanism. don't confuse that with what actually happens in the gameworld. what actually happens may be far more complex and complicated, but most of it is of no interest to you as a player, which is why it is not mentioned. one more hint: the pod pilots in eve don't ever log off, disappearing for hours into thin air."
5/4/2009,and lag.anyhow it would be good to hire npcs to move the stuff to one station.
5/4/2009,"your first misstake was making the argument about realism instead of gameplay. we're actually not 40k years into the future, we're in the present playing an game.zones for the market make that part of the game more interesting aswell as reducing lag.picking up things is anoying but part of gameplay.the only point i agree with you on is the apply to a corporation which really doesen't provide much in the way of gameplay but it's not really a huge thing and probably gets defended with arguments like ""we need timesinks"" and ""it makes the gameworld seem like an actual world not just a browser""."
5/4/2009,i like and second this
5/4/2009,"i agree with applying for a corp, and bidding on a contract. picking up stuff, well yes. i would rather say you should be able to set up a courier contract remotely, but no npc deliveries."
5/4/2009,"i agree with what op said.for the market, make another filter that says universe (all regions in other owrds) since we have it for contracts, we should for the market. you could also use the current filter for how many jumps for an item on market."
5/4/2009,"the kronos is usually considered to be third best of the marauders. it is quite similar to the paladin, but because of the superiority of tachyon beams, the paladin does much more damage.a simple solution to fix this balance issue, would be to increase the drone bandwidth of the kronos to 100. then a pilot could field a flight of 4 garde ii and would do only a bit less dps then a paladin with tachyons. this change would also make the ship more gallentean style."
5/4/2009,"speaking as a kronos pilot, i would still use 5 hammerhead ii. killing small fry in missions is useful, and 425s are crap at it. the kronos already has the best drone bay of the marauders(since it has room for spares and/or the 2 heavies needed to max out 75 bandwidth's dps), and it's not a bad enough ship that it needs a buff. if you want to buff a marauder, make it the vargur."
5/4/2009,"i really don't see the need for this change. lets face it, a ship is always going to be ""on top"". buffing a ship simply because its considered ""the lesser ship"" is not a good enough reason to change it. no support--isaac"
5/4/2009,"naw. it gets an extra turret over the mega remember, the other marauders don't. hence the drone bandwith."
5/4/2009,"i think it is not the right approach to compare them with their base class in mind.at the moment we have two marauders, who are considered on par (golem and paladin), one who is a bit behind (kronos) and one who is quite far behind (vargur).increasing the drone bandwidth of the kronos, would balance 3 of 4 marauders out. it's only a minor change and i guess would only take a few minutes of developer time. fixing the vargur on the other hand, well, i think this needs a lot more work and shouldn't be the topic of this proposal."

5/4/2009,"i have a character with 73 million sp in all caldari ships and missiles. i literally cannot train any missile skill any higher. despite having perfect skills and solid set ups with all my ships, they still ...well they fail against other races.for example. i am in a cnr with its 7th launcher, rigged, all tech 2, and i duel an armageddon. i win, but its close. why is it even close at all? geddon is 50mil isk ship. how embarrassing. cerberus, even with ham, gets ****d up close by other hacs.recons...you made the falcon have to get so close its likely going to die, and doesnt have enough grid to really defend itself. i can put a plate to give it a little staying time, or i could put some medium hybrids (how lame) which wont even kill anything anyway. thanks for the options.the scorpion...what are you doing there? horrible ecm strength. pathetic locking speed. cant really tank the thing except for plates, then its slow in every way imaginable.hawk, no need to go there. phoenix, cant even do damage against a carrier without having ten webs on it. youre better off in a raven most of the time.tengu - the ecm set up tengu only does around 10 jam strength...my falcon does 13 or 14. i cant really justify training the stuff and spending the isk on a ship that really doesnt do anything impressive damage, or ecm wise.why do just about all the caldari ships suck? every other race has some great 1v1 ships and will just about always wipe the floor with caldari. in fleets i always hear ""shoot -insert caldari ship here- first because it will blow apart like tissue""please give caldari a needed rework. fix citadels. they need to be able to hit carriers/ms that are moving.make the battleships, hacs, recons, more tough, more effective, and able to stand up to their counterparts without hilarity ensuing afterwards."
5/4/2009,i don't agree about the cerb. it's not supposed to be as good as the other hacs up close because it's better at range. but caldari do have some problems right that should be looked into.
5/4/2009,"just because you bought a fancy faction battleship does not give you the power to wtfpwn other battleships with ease. that is a primary principle of eve battle mechanics, bigger and more expensive ships can be beaten by ""inferior"" ships at times. a geddon shooting em damage vs a cnr is a prime example.caldari is the range race. if you are too blind and stupid to use this advantage and insist on throwing your cerb at the enemy at point blank range then you deserve to die. range, jamming and tackle, while the missile ships stand off at range and pound the enemy into dust. if you do not wish to play in this manner then don't train caldari. a lot of good caldari pvp ships. they aren't good at 1v1 or solo roaming this is true, but that does not mean they are a broken pvp race."
5/4/2009,hawk. raptor. moa. citadels. need i say more?fake edit: fix the other races problems too.
5/4/2009,"rokh, moa, ferox. moar grid please. these are supposed to work as snipers, and yet they can't fit the guns without gimping the whole setup. gr8! people say that shield tanks have make sacrifices in other areas, because they can boost damage with the low slots. how does this work when i need to use those slots to boost my grid? and they run out of cpu as well. i thought caldari ships where supposed to be advanced.supportededit: cpu"
5/4/2009,the issue is that most pvp situations favor closer ranges (<24km) and caldari are (were in the case of ew) with mid to long range in mind (24-50+ km). caldari ships lack the comparable dps at <24km that the other races can bring to bear and beyond that range can not provide even secondary tackling capability.changes to 'what is important' in terms of objectives in space (beyond killing the other guy) may provide more opportunities for caldari ships/design to show its stuff.caldari are defensive (as in defending an objective) in nature; but when the only objective is attrition against the enemy.so sure look at it; what is the intention of caldari design and how does it fit into the game currently?
5/4/2009,"yes, crapdari aren't a good pvp race, but they aren't that bad either. i don't think they're necessarily designed for pvp, except as in an ew role.lets look at what they are good at - mining, missions, freighters...i think you see the point i'm trying to make here. if not, i'll explain each entry better:mining: the osprey is comparable to the scythe of the minmatar, but the bantam far outweighs the burst (the only mining frigate with no defensive capabilities).missions: cnrs fill the mission hubs, and make an excellent route for running missions fast. afaik, no other racial ships can run a mission faster than the crapdari.freighters: everybody knows the charon is the biggest hauler in the game. their industrials (the badgers) are also renown for their ability to operate successfully as a decoy, and make a very decent hauler as well.honestly, i don't see a problem here. yes, their forte is not pvp, but look at the mining ability of the amarr - they only have one ship with a bonus to mining laser yield (the tormentor). the crapdari don't need a buff...they're great at what they do."
5/4/2009,9/10 quality troll would read again.
5/4/2009,"you have 73 million sp, and your just now coming to the realization that caldari aren't strong pvpers??? ignoring that, i have to say i have no support for this topic at all. missiles are no longer meant to kill every ship that they run into, making most caldari boats have to think before going into pvp. also, you completely discount the use of hybrids, which are supposed to be the last the short range caldari option.point is you just sound whiny here, and i cannot support an issue that doesn't have any merit."
5/4/2009,"yes i have 73m sp. when i began training the character (as caldari racial purist missiles/shields only) caldari were still pretty good. now its just laughable. what does it matter if caldari have the ability to have good range if i cant tackle and actually score the kill? the enemy will just fly away. as 1v1 ships, they simply suck. tell me i am wrong. for instance the megathron can fit a tackle set up mwd/web/scram and still deal great damage and have an insane buffer tank.the cnr has to fit a full buffer tank just to survive an engagement with non faction bs and has no ability to tank, cant web/paint anything else to help shoot smaller ships either. it can hit bs hard but cant catch anything. it sucks solo, whereas every other race can do decent solo with their mega/domi/geddon/abaddon/mealstrom/phooncaldari have the worst battleships in the game. their ships are just a joke, and its not funny. skills and set up are not an issue. it is the ships themselves.i know minmatar complain about their ships sucking, but really its caldari ships that need a serious look too.raven - needs to be able to slug it out 1v1 and not get taken apart like a tissue. maybe if you made missile reloading time much faster i could switch damage types in combat much faster, which would help a lot. or give missiles a mixture of damage? really, why not, where is the logic? you can put anything on a missile.scorpion - pathetic firepower / pathetic ecm power / pathetic tank - if you tank it then it has no ecm, if you ecm it up, it still has crap tank.falcon - the only ship i fly caldari because it hasnt been so horribly nerfed yet. sure ecm is powerful, but when i have zero missiles/guns and no tank and only ecm...it had been do the trick. now i am forced to get close enough for many dangerous ship classes to be all over me in 1 ecm cycle time.ferox? lame. i went for a period of about 2 years without seeing one person pvp in a ferox, i am not even kidding.you ruined my time honored kestrel as well. it is now basically a rocket only boat. id like to see an af version of it to replace the hawk. just do a paintjob on it and give it more grid and more missile bonuses. anyway. give me some cheese, because i have a lot of whine.one last thing... citadels need help so they can hit a moving ms!!!"
5/4/2009,"caldari are mostly fine. they are long range specialists. citadel explosion velocity in seige (~3 m/s) is slower than an electric golf cart, and i agree that it needs to be boosted."
5/4/2009,i support this topic whole heartedly. i train mostly minmitar now cause caldari ships are not good for much other than npc. yet when you read their description when you make your char they sound like the biggest badasses around. what a bunch of bull
5/4/2009,"i agree regarding citadels, and maybe a couple of the other complaints too. however, ""the race is broken"" is going way too far. yeah, they're bad at solo pvp. this is why gangs exist. they're not in need of a general rebalance."
5/4/2009,"the caldari are the zerg, i doubt they will be strengthened until they stop being so completely over populated, recently i went on a tour of caldari space looking for a way to increase my faction with the caldari state, i didn't find a single .5 system with less than 40 ships in it, it would appear that all the nerfs the caldari have received are a ccp population control method."
5/4/2009,"im sure this has been whinged about at one point or other, but i couldnt find it. in short, i miss the old effects, ive seen specific ones mentioned (cap jumps anyone?) but i think a broad re-assesment of what new effects people like and which ones should be rolled back is in order.some of my personal thoughts on effect choices or whatever:-turrets in general; no recoil that i can see, what happened to this?-hybrids; old railgun and blaster effects were much preffered imo, i can hardly see the new ones caue theyre here and gone so fast. the old effects had almost... a dramatic flair to them.-lasers; overall lasers are still good, with the eception of capital pulse lasers, that needs to be re-worked a bit-projectiles; the artillery seems a bit forced if anything and the tracers too cloudy and vague, perhaps the old atillery tracers w/ the new impacts cleaned up some?general effects... these i definitely have an issue with. the old effects everyone knew what they meant and they were distinguishable. now i cant tell whats going on around me; am i webbed? scrammed? did i just jump? and what am i listening to, the audio from someones rectal ultrasound? -energy mods; the difference in nos/neut/cap transfers has become so... small, its hard to tell what people are doing to you till youre dead (once again with the ""identifyability being really important"" thing)-warp scrams; pre apoc i could tell what was scrambling me without looking at my overview, what happened there?-jumping; now, i actually like the new jump effect, although it does look alot like the webbing one. but the capitals need their tunnel thing back, as everyone and their dogs have already said im sure.theres alot more that i could think of in time, but perhaps other people can add theirs to the list so its easy to read for the csm and ccp...aaaaaaand... go!"
5/4/2009,i support this
5/4/2009,the info is already there. this would only make it easier to access. so... support.
5/4/2009,"just put in the mechanic which you have in wow that automatically catch any excat repeated pattern and keep track on it, thereby banning the macro's in this way.i know from a friend that testet the timer with some friends that a simple macro is cought and banned in about 8-9minutes.the best bot in wow have been cought and just removed.soo it is possible"
5/4/2009,this is eve online... not wow.
5/4/2009,"in wormhole space ccp have delayed local channels as something of an experiment to see how players react and adapt.what are your thoughts on how this has worked out, and how do you feel about keeping or entirely removing the local channel from eve?"

5/4/2009,bobbechk is every sort of awesome<3
5/4/2009,vote for mazz!!!
5/4/2009,the girl gets the vote!
5/4/2009,"kind of a ""mechanic at odds with good sense"" question:do you feel the current dock/undock timer mechanics are the best of a bad situation or are in serious need of an overhaul?personally, i reckon the last thing a dock manager would do is grant a docking request to a ship which has lots of high powered ordnance battering it to a pulp. that fella is answerable and i doubt he enjoys submitting a damage report to his bosses at the end of a shift.thoughts?"
5/4/2009,i heartily endorse this product and/or service
5/4/2009,imho vuk has been a great csm leader and i hope he get continued trust from the playerbase!
5/4/2009,"bumping because i need something off vuk and this is my payment.seriously, the best candidate, vote vuk or dont vote."
5/4/2009,"vuk - as a great leader you are..., i do have questions...as a staunch opponent of the csm in it's entirety, what can you promise that will actually happen? this is not meant to be a troll in no way at all. for the upcoming winter expansion, 1) will it actually be fiscally incentive for small corporations / alliances to actually move out into 0.0?2) what measures will there be to allow these small corporations / alliances to defend themselves from attack from bigger alliances?3) what are your proposed changes to the customer support? in what way can you make them faster at response time other then them having to hire / train new employee's?"
5/4/2009,ermm....sir....your roles are removed...i said only bumping and no tough questions.
5/4/2009,"and now on more serious note.with hopefully upcoming rework of sov system, general idea (atleast mine) is that you shouldnt be able just to plant 6 med towers and to fuel them once per month and to hold f.e. one constelation. with adding dynamics into sov system big alliances will not be ""able"" to hold vast space with just, as mentioned above, few towers. also with adding small raidable structures it will add more ""headache"" to the holders of big chunk of 0.0 cause they will not be able to effectively defend it. all of this changes will open ""room"" for smaller entities. also stuff like personal habitats (still dont have a clue how to implement it tbh) will push more ppl into 0.0now from the other side we shouldnt fool general population that there will be huge political changes mapwise cause its not realistic that small entities can at the end of the day hurt bigger ones but they could find their portion of 0.0 without being simple pets/renters. i was giving some ideas about ""coalitions"" as ingame structures. some people were against it cause its encouraging blobing but!, we already have blobing. current existing coalitions already have implemented oog comms like irc, jabber, sms alerters, facebook groups etc. something smaller and new entities can only dream about. introducing ingame mechanics for coalitions, as integrating more alliances into one bigger entity could give smaller entities critical mass for something bigger. as i said eventualy it comes to blobing, but we have same situation in rl so we shouldnt dream about 1 man army pwning the new eden. also as we can see from current delve campaign which involves more or less kitchen sinks from both sides there was not so many massive blobs, and all the 1k+ in local fights (tho on reinforced nodes) were epic and something to remember for a long long time.when it comes to customer support, i will remain silent for now until i gather all the informations i need for this issue. but yes everyone knows it will be adressed to most fail ccp department - gm team. hi grimmi and nova, you are cool guys really, but if you were my employees......."
5/4/2009,"also just a little warning to all morsus mihi members. next one who ask me anything semiserious will be kicked from alliance.as i said, only bumping and words of praise.thank you"
5/4/2009,vote vuk!
5/4/2009,vote! (first post on this forum ever :p )
5/4/2009,vote for the man!
5/4/2009,garthran is a cool d00d apart from the whole cinder industrials thing. vote for him instead of erik finnegan if you're into indy stuff cos that guy is plain thick as ****
5/4/2009,"thanks for the support.at this point in the thread that only i and someone's alt have posted in, i'd like to tell you more about myself as a person.my name is alex bond. i'm a 22 year old male from north carolina, usa. i work at a subway, and i if i may say so myself i'm damn good at my job. its not glorious and its not financially liberating, but it pays the bills and i enjoy it. about a month ago, i married the girl i've been dating since i was 16 years old. i'm a big fan of science fiction in general, from star trek (all except ds9 and enterprise. i mean seriously.) to seaquest, from farscape to firefly, star wars to space balls. eve appeals to me because it is unlike any other game i have ever played, and my fellow players are more interesting than those in most other mmos i've tried. i attended college for 3 years, and realized i had no idea what i was doing there. i withdrew and am figuring out exactly what i want to do with my life before i go back to get a degree."
5/4/2009,"garthran is pretty relaxed when certian people ninja salvage his missions.... hes willing to talk about the profession and doesnt get upset by the intrusion...i think hes a level headed guy, after haveing several discussions with him. hes a mission runner, but he accepts the fact that some of us unsavory types may bust the misson and steal his loot. as a primarily solo player myself i would say that a vote for garth is well placed as he understands that even solo play will eventually generate social interaction that may end up with a little pvp.garth .... i would like to see a position statement from you with regards to us ninja types busting missionsi would also like to see a statement on suicide ganking as i have expanded my business plan recently and this is now part of my portfolio."
5/4/2009,"garthran ""polled"" me for our activities in w-space, was respectful of our situation and encounter. some of the wormholes issues mentioned in here are a result of a conversation between garthran and myself.after speaking to him, i get the impression he really wants to listen to the people and get their opinions. i would only warn him of a couple of things being that way is you can't make everyone happy, so be careful of what you choose to go with. also keep in mind people have agendas, and a csm is a nice ear to have listen to agendas. :)"
5/4/2009,"thanks for your support, ebolak.with regards to ninja salvaging... i don't like it. but that doesn't mean it should be removed from the game. i feel that in a situation where i am killing npcs with the intention of returning and looting/salvaging them, someone else taking that salvage feels like theft. however, its not theft. its aggressive debris-clearing. and, whether i like it or not, it is a valid, and as i understand, profitable profession. it also requires a very specialized skillset. this means that while, from time to time, mission hubs might flood with wannabe ninja salvagers, few of them will be good at it... and even some of those who are good at it will get bored before too long. ninja salvagers tend to primarily harass mission hubs in my experience, so perhaps their continued existence will help to decentralize eve, spreading our players out across the universe, instead of clumping most of the players into a dozen or so systems. i will likely never be a ninja salvager, but i will not move to change the game to prevent ninja salvagers from working in the game. however, i would ask that all of them take a page from ebolak's book. being eloquent, polite, and friendly goes a long way. offering to split the salvage, being willing to withdraw if asked to do so... i know players who have said they'd be more than willing to give their salvage to ninjas, if only the ninjas would ask for it.with regards to suicide ganking... there is sufficient npc protection to prevent the freighter-ganks of yore. the game doesn't need to be idiot-proof. even in high-sec, there should be consequences. if you load a bunch of valuable merchandise into a tech 1 industrial and set it on a 20-jump autopilot... you are accepting the fact that you might get shot at between here and there. there are many ways to avoid dying, all they take is a little effort. furthermore, suicide ganking is not restricted to autopiloting haulers. many players sacrifice their isk, their standings, and their ships in order to remove macroers from the game. this is a very respectable occupation, in my opinion, and to introduce mechanics to make it literally impossible would allow macroers to exist unharassed, which is something none of us want. increasing the consequences for suicide ganking would make sense. increased security status loss, local faction standings loss, voided insurance when killed by concord... in this situation we need a pound of cure, not a drop of prevention."
5/4/2009,"thanks for the support, sencnes. wormholes are of great interest and importance to me, and i think they will become more and more important to eve as the game progresses through the years. making sure they work properly now is a high priority for me.and i would like to point out that while my ear is open to any suggestion, i am not in favor of every suggestion i'm given. pleasing everyone is not my goal. doing what i think is right for eve, however, is very important to me. if you have an idea, tell me about it. i'll give it my attention, and try to understand it. but just because you told me about it doesn't mean i'll support it."
5/4/2009,how do you feel about trade hub scammers like us?
5/4/2009,"trade scammer tbh i think are worng... i know it is in the rules that it can be done but i belive there could be a way of giving a security penalty for doing it in such trade hubs like jita, dodixie, amarr and hekor an alternative is an ebay like system with a player adjusted rating like ebay does fir its customers to rate the seller/scammer that is about in the game and when their rep gets ot a certain point they can no longet place contract items etc up on contract"
5/4/2009,"no. i speak here of public materials - meeting minutes, past topics raised to ccp, and the like. right now they're a pain to look up for me, and i've been involved since the csm started, so i know where to look. i think that they can be made far more accessible for players. lowsec has all the danger of 0.0 space, with none of the profit. depending on your profession, it tends to be worth the same as, sometimes less than, highsec, but it's just as inhospitable as 0.0 to smaller corps, the sort who might be interested in getting their feet wet. at present, they either have to play with the big boys in 0.0, or they have to earn less profit by moving to lowsec. lowsec is supposed to be a middle ground, but at present it's a place where pirates gank other pirates, the odd fw fleet fights, and not much else happens. those two points made are to make lowsec more profitable than highsec for more professions(miners, most notably, are in desperate need of a boost to lowsec), and to establish a mechanism to let corps make lowsec space their own and reduce the problem of not being able to enter highsec if you defend your lowsec space too often. also, 0.0 is ""the frontier"", not lowsec. no, i don't have any personal experience with sovereignty mechanics, though i have read enough about them that i consider myself at least somewhat knowledgeable. i do have some experiences with poses, though only the industry side, not the whole moon mineral/sovereignty/deathstar side, but still some. i can keep up with the discussions, but there's a reason there's no 0.0 policy in my platform. i'll leave that stuff up to the actual 0.0 players, for the most part."
5/4/2009,"i had some problem with the earlier posts by herschel and some strong debate with him but i have seen him grow very quickly in knowledge and experience in eve. now his posts are some of the best you can find. this year i am voting for omber, already decided before his candidature, but he is on my list for next year. so, good luck herschel. get a seat."
5/4/2009,cheers bro
5/4/2009,i'm convinced!
5/4/2009,darth solo told me he's not available to post atm but he said he's voting for iceblock. he said his pvp experience will best suit the fixing of arty and un****ting missiles.
5/4/2009,"i forgot to say, i am also voting for iceblock, because he knows people like me."
5/4/2009,"poasting to confirm my vote for istvaan. :]all the other csm take this way to freaking seriously.edit: except the chick candidate, i'll vote for her on my alt :b"
5/4/2009,thanks whooch!
5/4/2009,"happy,i run a small research corp and have had numerous issues in the past. i would like to ask this question of you since i think you're closest to my perspectives in age and experience.i have a lot of difficulty understanding ""roles"" and properly securing corp assets and especially my research poses. i would like to know how you feel about the current structure for corp security and whether ccp could improve on the layout and functionality of ""roles"". i would also like to know if this is something that you would feel strongly enough to push for in discussions with ccp.a second concern i've had during my playtime in eve and especially one that concerns younger players is recruiting. personally, i feel that starting a new corp is far too easy. it is my opinion that this ease of creation is one of the worst problems in eve. the new player experience is severely hampered by the number of ""corps without a clue"" and that new player quits eve without realizing what a quality corp can offer. while my opinions and the subject are highly debateable, i would like to know if the csm is interested in these kinds of changes.sincerely,mrs reaction"
5/4/2009,"thank you for reminding us about this channel, herschel."
5/4/2009,"hello all,i have been monitoring this forum every day, and have noticed quite a few trends in the elections as well as other indicators. therefore, i would like peoples' opinions on who they think will be a part of the csm and in what ranking they'll place. i would ask that you please be rational - if you're running for the csm, please do not list yourself nine times on the list. if you feel like listing the alts too, you can, but it is by no means necessary.anyways, to get things started, i've composed my list for who gets elected and their rank in the election:1) mazzilliu - her knowledge of all sides of eve and ability to think of feasible new ideas has been demonstrated admirably.2) avalloc - has a good grasp of the mechanics of eve, and having a major alliance behind you always helps.3) omber zombie - another omni-capable candidate, his job on the current csm term has been phenomenal.4) dierdra vaal - her experience from the first csm term will be very valuable in this one, as well as her ideas.5) vuk lau - he's shown the availability and capability to lead the council. while i don't see him in a leadership role this time, he will nonetheless be a valued delegate.6) dj hijak - having the ear of many players makes him a valuable pr tool, and he has some good ideas about the game's destination.7) larkonis trassler - an outsider, so to speak, of major movers in the game, i see him gathering some votes with his good ideas as well as gaining a chunk of the pirate vote.8) heartstone - a candidate with good ideas and the enthusiasm to endure the constant flames of the forums.9) herschel yamamoto - a late entry in the running, i believe his forum posts will gather him the votes necessary for the role of delegate.i would like to see how other people think the players of eve will vote. i realize that it's a small prize, but i will award the person who comes closest to the final score on the day of voting a sisters core probe launcher and a full load (8) of the sisters core probes. best of luck to all the participants."
5/4/2009,i see myself winning by a considerable margin (cause i have a lot of alts)
5/4/2009,"right-o:avalloc - goon candidate, i don't know if he won the goon primaries but he's probably best of their bunch and doesn't seem too bad - certainly an improvement on darius.dierdra vaal - excellent candidate, with good ideas and a strong platform. did well in csm1 - wish him all the best.erik finnegan - successor of ankhesentapemkah and the take care party. slightly contentious choice and i understand there are doubts about erik's ability to function on his own in the role but i understand ank has a pretty serious electorial machine going and it would be wise not to count this candidate out too early.heartstone - excellent choice with a knowledge of the roleplay community, faction-warfare, small-unit pvp and committee decision making. his first time running and if he can energize the interest groups and focus he's running on should have a good chance of success.mazzilliu - gets in on through the pandemic/goon block vote and the fact she's a girl on the internets some of the ideas are okay - some are terrible. but she's a shoo-in due to her support base.omber zombie - another good candidate, was a great alternate during my term and went on to pick up a lot of workload as secretary in csm2. i gave him one of my votes last time and wasn't disappointed.serenity steele - excellent candidate, was my deputy during csm1 and was supportive and constructive and i have no hesitation in commending him for a 2nd term as a strong administrative choice to protect the institution.vuk lau - gets in on the northern block vote. seemed decent enough last time and deserves a second shot. zastrow j - may well be the 2/3rd goon candidate on csm3. seemed relatively well spoken on the application text though all the talk about barrier for entry seemed to cloak more ""make it easier to run huge space empires"" rhetoric that is currently the problem not the solution for 0.0. regardless if the goons get their block vote out this guy may be there."
5/4/2009,mazzilliu omber zombie larkonis trassler vuk lau herschel yamamotoavallocdj hijak in a rough order of likelihood of election.i'm not too sure about placing avalloc there.
5/4/2009,"here's my dream-team:- dierdra vaal- serenity steele- omber zombie- vuk lau- herschel yamamoto- heartstoneand then the people who i don't know, but is quite certain will get on:-mazzilliu- erik- generic goon candidate"
5/4/2009,"i think you may all be overestimating how many votes i can muster up.i'll be surprised if 7 of the nine seats aren't held by alliance/nationality power bloc's, the other 2 being erik and larkonis."
5/4/2009,"in the past two csms, 2 of 9 have been held by big alliances - dj/bane and dj/vuk. it might be as high as 3 here, but 7? seems unlikely. which 7 are out there who can draw from separate support blocs, and who are serious enough candidates to get even the internal votes? and while i have my theories on who will win, and my wishes on who i'd like to win, it's bad form to speculate too much on an election you're in. will be interesting to see if my guesses are better this time than they were last time, though."
5/4/2009,"i agree with herschel, i see a power bloc dominated council as somewhat unlikely. i'm also withholding predictions, though i know who i'd like to win.in conclusion, vote garthran for csm."
5/4/2009,i will give you atleast one vote :d i dont want to risk not having anyone for webcam sessions during meetings with ccp.
5/4/2009,unless i'm missing someone it looks more like 3 guaranteed and maybe another.
5/4/2009,"every moment in the eve experience is a moment of dread. there is always someones ship destroyed somewhere. every heartbeat is filled by someones regret at the impending-yet-inevitable loss of their space frame, their cargo, their fitting and rigging, their pod and their implants. life in eve is the relentless exacting of the price that comes with the search for fame, fortune and glory. some rant, some rage, some weep and some whine. some beg for mercy, the ultimate prize, the deepest cut of all, total humiliation, the draining of the very life-blood of the soul. some remain stoic, some are annoyed, some leave never to return.to the winner go the spoils. ores and refined minerals, weapons and ammunitions, modules and rigs. all manner of useful and often valuable loot is wrested from the vanquished.but never, not once, a picture frame. nobody loots a wardrobe, a case of beer, an entertainment system, books [you know, the quaint habit of gluing paper together in sequence as reading material?]. there are no toothbrushes, no slippers, not a single bar of soap. nobody ever took home a sink, a lavatory, a crate of personal belongings, stowed away for the duration. in all the eve universe there is no bedding, there is no pantry full of food, no furniture, no stash of gold or sundry fortune. no capsuleer brings anything along on board that reminds them of home, those they left behind, their particular interests. the celestial flotsam never carries a guitar, there are no quaint trinkets, no valuable antiques, no prized possessions, not even a box of make-up, an exquisite carving or a painting, grabbed from the interstellar medium.the eve capsuleer is but a slave to their ambition, focussing solely on the acquisition of isk and the means to make more, or defend what they have. there appears to be no use for aught else, not even a rack of space suits. nothing drives the lives of the modern capsuleer, not burdened is he by the myriad paraphernalia that travelers throughout history have carried along on their voyages, each according to their tastes and fortunes to destinations ancient and forgotten. no varied voices, ephemeral, singing in the night, their fragile possessions intimate witnesses of lives lived among the stars, of ambitions burning, loved ones cherished, duties fulfilled, success remembered, failures rued.ours is the barren life, strife without end, the fleeting whim of fortune, the basking glow of victory or the burning afterglow of failure, the resentment of the clone renewed. our silent masters whims we are destined to obey, to sail among the stars and empty space, without that very token that is you, without the comfort of your very essence to take along through the endless void.in a market full of prices, there are never any prizes worthy of the cause, there are no keep-sakes, no trophies, not a single memento of that time where your path crossed theirs and you carried the day. we do not cherish the cuisine, we are but carrion eaters, our universe an 8000 solar system junk yard. and all of it for sale.abulurd bonifaceme meceo"

5/4/2009,"my dear herschel, when will we see that chart? as a csm candidate, i'm sure you will want to show that your statements are more than just idle banter. ;)"
5/4/2009,"it will be rather contentious given the propensity of candidates to mis-represent themselves. i do however think it is an interesting idea, in that it will certainly promote focused discussion about specific qualities individuals possess that will make them of value to the csm."
5/4/2009,"it slipped by the wayside when i was finishing up my own platform, answering other people's questionnaires, and the like. that said, i think i just about have the right list of questions, so i'll probably be sending it out tonight, and post it when i have a dozen or so back. voting doesn't start for better than a week yet, so i've still got some time.update: the jita park thread is here, and the chart itself is here."
5/4/2009,"1) ring mining  an interesting concept, one idea that could definetly work if/when mining is looked at again, and redone.2) renegade concord  could be interesting, but they would need to be toned down slightly since concord currently is really powerful for policing empire space.3) player habitats  also an interesting idea. i like the idea, but doesnt serve a big purpose with poss, and since you have the personal hangars on stations, and soon a bunch of space with wis, would this become obsolete?4) rare materials in loot drops  most definitely agree  harder battles could have loot tables modified to offer moon minerals instead of always modules5) reducing loot drops - modules dropped as loot could be modified with a wastage factor to be included should the module be reprocessed. kind of like it is damaged because it came from a destroyed ship, so only 65% of the minerals would be received when you melt it down ect6) q-ships - an interesting idea, but would be difficult to implement. if you think about this though, the same could possibly be achieved with a cloaked stealth bomber waiting nearby as escort ecti dont want to discount any ideas though, as with some thought, all would work nicely."
5/4/2009,"so, what were the final issue priorities? also, when is the meeting actually going to take place?"

5/5/2009,"would not mind seeing both options, but yea, me likes idea a lot."
5/5/2009,any ceo who doesn't support this is ether a do-nothing or a masochist.
5/5/2009,"supported, but then we should also get t2 versions of the other tier 3 bss."
5/5/2009,"supported, khanid region and faction needs some love and a khanid bs , bc and frigate would be great to be able to fly and get maybe make them available through royal khanid navy missions as bpc's."
5/5/2009,"since part of the charm of t3 ships is the ability to strategically reconfigure a ship, i propose that t3 ships have a 6th rigging subsystem. this module would be like a tray that housed three rigs. once the rigs were placed in the subsystem module, they could not be removed without destroying them, but the trays themselves could be interchanged to facilitate multiple configurations (and be a inexpensive subsystem relative to others).what is the use of having, for example, an armor tanking and shield tanking subsystem on the loki, if i basically have to have a different hull for each set of applicable rigs."
5/5/2009,i like this idea.
5/5/2009,"something of this nature could be very interesting. i worry about effects on overall ship cost and t3 component demand, and on working backwards to give everyone with a t3 ship one of these, but other than that, sure. could also be interesting to see variants on the system - say, one with 2 slots and 200 calibration, but doubled effects. either that or just say that t3 ships allow rigs to be removed without destroying them, though that could get powerful. in any case, some solution to allow t3 ships to swap rigs more easily is supported."
5/5/2009,i like the idea of rig trays to allow you to customize the rigs to fit the new role of the ship based on the new ship modules.
5/5/2009,"not a bad idea, seems to work with the overall idea of t3 ships.--isaac"
5/5/2009,this just sounds like a fun idea.
5/5/2009,as long as prices go up up up for t3 and t2 goes down down down.i'm game.
5/5/2009,"while i'm tempted to support this one just because it's cool... it seems to me to contradict the idea of rigging something. jury rigging is kind of like hotwiring, it's not a factory modification, it's a custom job done by some dudes in a ""garage"" with welding torches. it's not something that can be undone, at least not without involving the blowtorches again."
5/5/2009,this. 'nuff said.
5/5/2009,this idea makes sense.
5/5/2009,"agreed, this has always annoyed me"
5/5/2009,"not supported. crawl back under your bridge, troll.if you can't catch people now, it's not local's fault- you are just bad. having no local, or 'recent speakers' local (which is functionally the same as no local) would make everything in the game more arduous and time-consuming than it is already, and chain people to their directional scanners. happily, idiots have been arguing that we should get rid of local for ages, and for just as long the community has reviled and ignored them. edit: added more vitriol"
5/5/2009,agree... 100%def need to stop the 999 scamming.i use the contracts on a daily basis. and hunting down n keepingand eye out for scammers who want my iskies. isnt a past time.. i enjoy..the isk.. on the contracts need to be displayed by eve. and not the user'sno option shud be given to show or not show decimals. everything shud be shown.in full currency.or as suggested in wordings...no short cuts.!!penguin ftw!

5/5/2009,"namely, the fact that at the moment fw members get a faction standing hit for attacking any militia member anywhere. never thought of this, but it should be fixed."
5/5/2009,"derp, guess ccp dropped the ball on this one... should be a pretty high priority. although i do wonder how many fw players actually venture into 0.0 in large enough fleets to warrent this concern..."
5/5/2009,maybe more would if it didn't wreck their standings. :p
5/5/2009,wow what a bug
5/5/2009,"yes, you can order a bicycle online and have it shipped to you, but the fedex truck doesn't need to cross a warzone to complete the delivery. plus, these are really game balance issues more than anything else.npc shipping could seriously unbalance the game. join a group of enterprising pilots who want to form a shipping company, and see if there's a viable business model.for contract bids and corporation applications, i can see that the other party might like to know that you are physically nearby. but in some cases it doesn't matter. i'd support the contract originator or corporation ceo having the option to allow remote action.semi-supported."
5/5/2009,"i agree with the contracts and corp applying ideas, but not the item hauling due to balance issues."
5/5/2009,tachyons in a paladin...don't be silly.
5/5/2009,"thing is, they don't just make balance changes in ten minutes. they test them, usually a lot. this would take far more time than you seem to think."
5/5/2009,"it takes more than a few minutes to do changes to the game. it needs to be tested and retested to make sure it falls in-line. and to be blunt, just because you think its a good idea doesn't necessarily means ccp does. --isaac"

5/5/2009,i am not a pvper.. but..no.. very very bad idea. that would make it a virtual care bear game!
5/5/2009,"it makes me laugh when people say caldari are long range specialists. well one thing about having range is the ability to keep the range. maybe if the raven could move like a typhoon we could have something nice there, but as it stands, its slow as hell and basically waiting for a megathron to fly in its face and shred it.i am going to make a long list of proposed fixes for many of the problems i see with different caldari ships and post in a new thread. i hope everyone will give feedback to that."
5/5/2009,"caldari + pvp + missiles = lol. any sort of dps output by a caldari ship in a pvp situation is pretty much negated completely if the ships at long range in a small fleet or at just about any range in a large fleet. the target will probably die before the missiles reach there.falcon/rook needs tons of help, the ecm nerf went way overboard and even putting on plates wont help much if the enemy fleet is of any decent size. in practice, falcon/rook used to be able to reliably disable about 2-4 battleships(or 5 frigates/cruisers!) on average against a subcap fleet at range pre-patch. it should have just had jammer strength reduced so it could only reliably disable 1-3 ships on average, or jammer maths re-worked so its jamming chances are balanced between frigates and capital ships. close range isnt going to work for this ship.citadel torp boost seems to be in the pipeline, finallycaldari are the best race for pve though. any given 0.0 ratter picked at random is probably in a raven. you can pick your damage type, the slot layouts generally favor midslots which have more utility in general then lowslots, so you can fit tank and damage mods. shield tanking is instantaneous unlike armor tanking. caldari have all that unlike all the other races(minmatar split weapon system garbage cans dont count). i really dont think caldari need much of a boost except some specific ships. and i dont understand why the op thinks ravens have an awful tank or feroxes are never used.probably more because of the achura and their 3 charisma then anything else."

5/5/2009,"you are supposed to have a friend in a onyx do the tackling. face facts eve is not a solo game, especially not in battleships. your megathron comment just shows your lack of experience for all your 73m sp."
5/5/2009,"caldari have a lot of great pvp ships. a slight boost to bs-size missile explosion velocity, medium boost to cruiser-size, and large boost to frigate-size exp velocity might be in order however. they could also bring citadel torp exp velocity back up to the pre-apocrypha value; even then it would still do poor damage to a carrier moving at half speed."
5/5/2009,pebkac.
5/5/2009,agreed.. some of the ships do need abit of tweaking!
5/5/2009,"the caldari ships are great, but missile explosion velocity took too large of a hit from the nerf bat. the nerf to explosion velocity should have scaled with how much slower ships became after the ""speed-rebalanced"" changes. i.e. if battleships lost on average 30% velocity, then torpedos and cruise missiles should have received a 30% reduction in explosion velocity."
5/5/2009,"this issue has been brought up in the past csm, passed unanimously and met with no ccp responce.link to original forum threadcsm-wiki page on the history of the proposalsince that proposal, nothing has been done and the problem has only gotten worse. ded mails are now sent in duplicate or sometimes triplicate to directors. any corp that has poses attacked or applications made to the corp with any regularity would benefit from an evemail improvement. any user that wants to have a ""save box"" for important evemails so they can delete the trash with a nice convenient ""select all-> delete"" will benefit from this.i don't really have anything to add to the original proposal. i want to get this presented to ccp again in the hopes they will choose to act on the idea this time. evemail is an integral system of communication in this game and the interface is still ancient and needs a lot of work.edit: well, i do sort of have something to add to it, since the original was mainly concerned with auto generated eve-mails. give us different boxes to store evemail in and make it function more like regular e-mail. there's probably enough changes listed below to warrant a complete overhaul of the system- it's long overdue anyways.-we need a ""sent"" box so we can look up mails we already sent-we need a ""saved"" box so we dont accidentally delete mails we want to save-we need a ""spam"" box for evemails sent automatically from npc corporations like ded, and owners of npc stations corps rent offices from. after those evemails have sat in there for maybe a month, they can be deleted saving server space.-increase character limit, very often we have to break evemails into two or three, and evemail is not a viable way for people to share whole copies of killmails due to this limit-for people with inboxes with mixed read and unread evemails, make the ui less annoying when using the ""sort by unread"" feature. after clicking the user and reading the mail the user disappears from the visible portion of the list. it can be worked around but its annoying as hell.-stop sending directors duplicate ded mails !!!"

5/5/2009,"i suggest that you learn what meeting minutes are. said project is likely the cosmos project, as was showed off at fanfest.known bug, as was discussed at the qa talk at fanfest."
5/5/2009,"this is from the minutes of the meeting where it was discussed, and it wasnt included in the minutes on eveo forums.well now i have a better source for csm history **** then the eveo forums. we still need to bring the issue up again at the next csm to make sure ccp know its a priority, as theres no indication ive seen that ccp have made any actual progress on it, it would be worth at least finding out.are all these fanfest things archived and indexed somewhere or do i just have to wish for the good fortune of attending one so i can know things have already been talked about :o"
5/5/2009,"it was submitted late, and as such, it was briefly discussed, however it was re-discussed officially during the second meeting.minutes.no. when a new csm goes to fanfest, all old issues are taken a look at again and the csm is given any update there is.as such, having the csm re-raise an issue every 6 months because the new csm is impatient, is lame. but just because there's no indication that cpc have made any progress on cosmos, doesn't mean that they haven't. my guess is that they will have an announcement about it at fanfest.yeah. if you actually payed attention, you would realize that all talks at fanfest were recorded and is available on ccp's youtube thingy."

5/5/2009,"prior to the last suicide gank nerf suspension of insurance payouts was one of the other options in addition to boosting response times... ccp chose to boost response times, thus making all but the easiest of ganks more player (or shipsize) intensive. the reasons? i don't know, but i'm guessing it's more to do with the numbers of noobs going around concording their first bs accidently. suicide ganking is not a big problem. if you play smart and at your keyboard then it won't affect you. as much as i hate to make rl analogies i wouldn't go cutting around even the most affluent parts of london in a drunken daze with an i-pod blaring in my ears and my pockets overflowing with cash. the current system is fine.ref implants... with the addition on jumpclones (standings are no issue, many people offer them either through joining corps for a day, saying hello to their rorquals and making happy time etc) implant loss shouldn't be an issue. plus you have to be pretty brain dead to lose your pod outside of 0.0. in the past 13 months or so i've had 154 losses. 5 of which have been pods. of those... 3 were in 0.0 (bubbled) and two were in lowsec (1 i was afk and got decloaked at a hostile pos, the other, well, i was in stiches laughing at something else which i was observing in my pod). but i digress... treat implants like rigs for your head. you kid's don't know your born, back in the day when isk was harder to come by implants were 4-5x more expensive. it's quite affordable to pop in a pair of +3s to a jumpclone and go and have a blast."

5/5/2009,"i've looked at all the candidates, and none of them seem to even recognize other peoples play styles. apart from erik. i too thought that he was merely representing ankhe, so i figured a good way to get an answer was to convo him directly in game. granted, erik is good at keeping his personal opinions to himself, all though i did manage to get some answers in the end. but i then realized something: i was hoping to get someone to represent my views! i was hoping that erik's views would mirror my own. this is not what the csm is all about.because of erik's ability to remain neutral, he is the best person to represent any player base. be it a carebear or a die hard pirate. his own opinions don't matter, it's the collective opinions of the player base as a whole that matter. that is what erik wants to represent. even though i might not agree with all the opinions that he might represent, i'm guaranteed that my side will also be given fair representation.this is why erik gets my vote, and why i will promote erik for csm. i am not part of ""take care"", and i'm not an alt of either ankhe or erik (lol, erik doesn't even have alts). i like to pew pew, and i like to carebear. but some of the other pvp aspects of the game bore me to death (market pvp? omg plz, somebody shoot me), but if no one represents these players, things get out of balance, and suddenly we can't buy anything of the market because it's too expensive. or, the other extreme, prices drop, but you have to travel 30 jumps for everything you buy, because nobody can be bothered to buy and sell it.all the different play styles is what makes eve it's own world, nay, universe. it's what really makes eve different. not the because you are free to shoot anybody you want at any time, because you have the freedom to play the game the way you want to play. let's keep it that way! vote erik finnegan for csm!"

5/5/2009,"first time candidate but long time fan.i've been racking my brain since i put my name in to make a list of things that i want to put forward if i get onto the council. not that i couldn't come up with a list because the list i have is huge. it was trying to shorten it to something that could be dealt within the term period for council.at this point i see several issues that need immediate addressing.my main focus will be the upcoming changes to 0.0. making it more accessible for small to medium sized corps and alliance to exist in 0.0 profitable is my primary goal. trying to make it something more then just all about pos's and dreadnoughts. eve developers had repeatedly stated they want more people out in 0.0 but the fact that less then 10% of players live in 0.0 under the domination of a couple of dozen large alliances while more then 75% of players never leave highsec shows they have failed. other issues.scammers: they have existed as long as i've played the game but recently they've become a lot more annoying. they clog up the contract system with useless contracts stealing space and server activity from legitimate sales. and they spam the hell out of local far more then isk sellers. and i suspect that customer service time is wasted with people complaining. delaying legitimate problems.i think a simple solution would be to provide a warning message to any purchaser when the selling price of an item is way out of wack with the current market. either with a contract or market purchase. this is not something completely new. eve does this for sellers when you place a market sell order that is way out of align with current market conditions. why shouldn't buyers get the same treatment? this solution would not make ccp the market police while giving buyers a more fair playing field.drones: they've been ignored for too long. one immediate change i would like to see made is how npc's treat drones when you dc. i don't think its fair to players that your drones become sitting ducks while you warp off. if everyone risked loosing missiles and ammo every time they dc'd in a mission they would understand how drone boat users feel. though suggestions have been made to allow players to be to reconnect to wayward drones when they log back in, developers seem to have a problem with that. probably why they never implemented it. this doesn't solve the problem either when you dc in the last room of ae and have to fly back through 5 gates to retrieve them. simple solution would be have npc's ignore drones that belong to a player who's offline. that would also reduce the server work as it doesn't have to work trying to calculate hits on wayward drones. especially when a bs can spend hours trying to kill a small drone.interface: i can't even big to start listing whats wrong with the interfaces in eve. but a major problem i have is when i waste time fighting the interface instead of fighting roids, npcs and other players. some small changes would go a long way in making people's lives a little more pleasant. on that list would be scanning, drones, emails, overview, market, contracts, pos's, etc."
5/5/2009,"a look into run-off voting may be worthwhile. i, too, found that having only one vote was less than satisfactory.perhaps second votes could be granted to those who's candidates did not make the first cut or perhaps the electorate could be given the option of a first and second choice."

5/5/2009,"your definition of a ""bloc"" is insanely loose. star fraction has about 150 members, jade got better than 2400 votes. he was not elected by sf, though it probably did let him edge out hardin for the chair. i can't speak to 0.0 alliance politics, but it seems unlikely to me that the gbc would choose the head of a 13-man alliance as their candidate. eve university has a lot of members, but how many of them are 90 days old and can vote? you put jade down as winning the ""roleplay bloc"", but then attribute the #2 candidate's success to probably the single most notable roleplay alliance. i don't think there are more votes in the roleplay community than there are in goon plus allies. also, seriously, if hungary and serbia count as blocs, who doesn't? was talking to vuk earlier, he said best guess is 400 serbians in game. it took over 600 votes to get a seat last time - even with perfect turnout among the base, you can't win a seat on serbia. given that no country in the world had more than a 20% turnout, you can't even come close. i don't know the numbers for hungary or romania, but they can't be much more impressive, certainly not enough to win a seat off of. yes, dj, bane, and vuk are the candidates of clearly-defined blocs, fairly obviously. i'll grant you tusko and dierdra too, for the sake of argument. going forward, i can't see more than one goon getting on, and i'm pretty sure that both chip and a sf candidate competed last time and lost badly. also, just because someone is a member of a big group doesn't mean that they'll draw that group's votes. i doubt big alliances have any better turnout than small corps, unless someone notable in that corp is running. vuk can draw mm votes, but some random nobody in the same corp who decides to run probably can't. 6000 goons looks a lot less impressive when it's worth 400 votes split 3 ways."
5/5/2009,i got mh voting for me
5/5/2009,"please visit your user settings to re-enable images.i guess i should get around to making a thread here:why should i vote trzzbk?my sitei'll outline my platform in the following posts, curse this character limit!"
5/5/2009,"here are a few of the specific issues that i have: - as always, assault frigates are still by and large useless. they're relegated to gimmick ships for rich people to **** around in, and maybe it's just the goonfleet in me, but i like to see frigates out there doing useful things. they should at least get a clearly defined role. if they're meant for pve give them some kind of tanking bonuses aside from the resistances, etc. - every race should get a sniping battleship. i would propose it be the megathron for gallente and either the maelstrom or tempest for minmatar. i'd like to see the mega lose the tracking and tempest lose the rof bonuses in favor of 10% optimal. you can already see that t2 sniping fleets are going very, very hard towards being pretty much only apocs and rokhs, and as ccp constantly says, that's boring and boring is the enemy of good gaming. at the very least the tempest needs something, which brings me to... - minmatar battleships need a very serious looking over. i'm not a minmatar bs pilot, but there's a reason for that. the typhoon is probably alright, although i think it should be given a little more focus in terms of weapons and slots and whatnot. the tempest and maelstrom need serious reconsidering though. if the tempest got an optimal bonus, i'd like to see the maelstrom get a little bit of a mass reduction or speed increase to make it a more viable ac boat, bringing it more in line with the hyperion. if the maelstrom got an optimal bonus in lieu of the shield boost bonus, i think it would greatly help the minmatar bs selection with just that one simple change. - pos setup is a useless time sink that is unreasonably stupid. there is a whole plethora of logistics related stuff to bring up, but this is one that affects potentially everybody. there's no reason that you shouldn't let one person anchor/online one module each, or at least let a pos handle anchoring one mod and online another at the same time. - minmatar and gallente recon ships is one i almost forgot because i gave up on them after the speed nerf. they really need something. i'd like to see a role bonus for the minmatar ones that made them webbing death machines again, and i'd like to see the arazu/lachesis dampening bonuses turned up so that ecm isn't the only form of ew being used (which is what the ecm nerf was explicitly looking to do away with.) note: i would not push for nor accept another ecm nerf as a solution to this problem. - the eos needs another look too. right now, given the drone bandwidth it has, the drone bay size bonus is pointless. i'd like to see it turned into a heavy drone boat again, at the expense of turrets. this would bring it more in line with the other gallente t2 ships, which are split between turret-based and drone-based. - a fresh look at the bounty system. i read somewhere the idea that concord could sell ""bounty hunter licenses"" which would allow people to shoot those with bounties even in hi-sec. i think this is a fantastic idea, and the system for administering them could be borrowed from the way wardecs work. - the capital skill path is a tricky one because i understand the reasoning behind it. however, i'd like to see some of the filler skills (asc i'm looking at you) changed so that there is a reason to have it at something other than i or v. it's not something i've thought deeply about, but i'm training 2 characters into carriers (and possibly a third into dreads) and it just ****es me off how many skills i need to get to v that offer no use until they're at that level. - sov 4 bonuses should make something more of an actual capital. the least offensive idea that i've heard (which i actually really like) is upping the cap on jump bridges in the system to 3 or 4 instead of leaving it at 2 like every other system."
5/5/2009,"and i also have some little piddling issues that i'm sure some other people share with me: - asteroid hit detection is totally screwed. the bounding box for asteroids is enormous, much bigger than the actual model and it makes navigating asteroid fields almost impossible without running into an invisible wall and bouncing around until you find the magical path back out. - the zealot should be red. seriously, imagine that, it would be awesome.most of these issues aren't huge and sweeping in scope and i don't really think any are super-groundbreaking, but that leads me to my next point: i'm very good at taking input, filtering out the chaff and building on good ideas. eve has an enormous playerbase and obviously not everybody will want to be on the csm. that doesn't mean they don't have a fantastic idea that will revolutionize the way we play the game. if i were on the csm i would look at as much of the player input as i could and help to develop good ideas and give them the time and energy they require.i recently did a writeup on the naglfar which you can read here. i'm thinking i will have to write out specifics regarding ecm as it currently stands because it seems to be a hot button issue right now.edit: man the bbcode round here is finicky."
5/6/2009,the cyno effect when multiple ships jumped to a cyno was one of the best things about the whole game. mainly due to the 'oh sh*t' moment it caused for the unfortunate sods being hotdropped..please bring it back <3link
5/6/2009,this i want my epic ship back :(
5/6/2009,i am very much in support of this. it would be great if i did not have to switch out to a punisher from my retribution the second a fleet op is called.
5/6/2009,"cases where the missing 2nd bonus from the t1 ship is ideal for the assault frigate:harpy: adding the 5% resists per level bonus from the merlin here is just so face meltingly obvious. this would then bring it into line with the eagle, giving us a pair of powerful ishukone gunships.retribution: the punisher's resists bonus would help this ship become a smaller version of the absolution, another carthum conglomerate ship. on the subject of face-meltingly obvious, sort out this ships midslots so amarr af pilots have somthing to fly that isn't crippled by rockets.jaguar and wolf: a rifter without its tracking bonus would be a very sad sight indeed, yet thats what these two have become. minmatar interceptors inherit the tracking bonus from their t1 counterpart, yet the assault frigates miss out on one of the most important aspects of the rifter. af's should not have trouble hitting when in a tight orbit; fights against other frigate hulls often end up as close-range knife fight, in which case these ships are unable to bring their firepower to bear. additionally, when fighting larger ship classes they rely on their speed and size to outtrack their opponents in a tight orbit. slowing down so you can actually hit doesn't often end well for anyone at ccp reading this, i hope you can see that there isn't a whole lot of work to be done when fully half of the ships in this class can be given a cut and paste job from the t1 hulls. furthermore, using heavy assault ships bonuses as a template for how i believe assault ships (assault frigates) should be, it is the rule rather than the exception that the t2 ship does not have the 2 bonuses from its t1 sibling. it is true for all these ships:eaglecerberusishtardeimosvagabondmuninnzealotthat makes all but one, the sacriledge, which has 1 bonus changed to match its different weapon systems.moving up in size, when it comes to command ships, there is only one which doesn't receive the 2 bonuses from its t1 counterpart, the nighthawk. as with the sacriledge, this is a case of one bonuse being different to go with its use of missiles rather than hybrid turrets.it isn't sensible to take this argument any further up in size as the t2 bs are generally not regarded as pvp ships. however i hope this makes a good case for giving assault frigates their missing bonus from the t1 hull wherever sensible, keeping them in line with the other t2 ships."
5/6/2009,"signing post - giving players the ability to put stuff in the vastness of space is nice, making that stuff look like it was thought up during this millenium would be a good next step."
5/6/2009,"would like to see this, but there are other things i'd rather see done first. supported nonetheless"
5/6/2009,there are no real downsides and it would save time. supported.
5/6/2009,yes please this would make things so much easier
5/6/2009,"give both, a pw and standings and for f*ck sakes why does same alliance have to enter the pw for a jb, if the pos is allow alliance access?"
5/6/2009,"support, but someone from galactic rangers fix your damn forum sig as i'm getting popup requests for a kb pass and username.. annoying. get to work isd."

5/6/2009,"i likewould need some balancing of course, but good start"
5/6/2009,i'm a carebear. i avoid pvp. i detest local. if it's fun or useful is not relevant. it simply does not fit the game world so it needs to go.
5/6/2009,supporting this thread. it is really annoying to see all of that spam in local.
5/6/2009,end the spam

5/6/2009,"so many other things are being exploited just as much.,and no i don't think you should add in stuff for it. just declare it a exploit and ban whoever does it.that simple"
5/6/2009,"there is already a 30 ish sec timer as immunity goes, to prevent the undock -> podded eventbut good idea overall"
5/6/2009,"how about this:if you log off, instead of warping off 1 au, then warping back to the same spot you were at when you logged off, make it so that the point where you warp back to is a random distance and the location is different then where you logged off from.that will help with the login traps, but the down side is that it'll hurt those that have legit disconnects."
5/6/2009,labeling every problem an exploit and telling people to ban it is not an answer.try thinking before posting please.
5/6/2009,link below.my topic
5/6/2009,"no.... just, no."
5/6/2009,"no, nada, no way. if you're alliance is having an issue with people putting jump clones in your outpost...maybe you should fix your alliance...--isaac"
5/6/2009,"alliance #1 owns a station, members thereof create jumpclones in said station. alliance #2 boots alliance #1 from their space. members of alliance #1 can still keep their jump clones in the station without any means for alliance #2 to remove them. clearly this is a problem with the alliance that took the station. -mrc"
5/6/2009,1: is it costing the alliance to keep the jump clones there? no2: is it going to cause a slow down or a hindrance? nothen with all due respect.. wtf is the problem?guard the station and gank anyone who shows up.seriously... you people need to grow up.
5/6/2009,no support. i would however support a feature to be added to deny station market usage if there already isn't one (haven't been to a station with no rights yet).
5/6/2009,that wouldnt realy work because with trade skills u can access markets in the region without going in station.
5/6/2009,why not let them take all assets that belong to other alliances that are still in the outpost while you're at it.**** no.
5/6/2009,"yes, and all of their stuff from hangers as well. taking over stations should pay handsomely."
5/6/2009,afraid of market pvp?
5/6/2009,"it can hinder things yes. if an enemy still has access to station you control, then they can sell their assets to the enemy and pocket isk to help blow up the assets they just sold. also it gives access to spies in a system. so in a way it is costing an alliance to keep enemy jump clones there. guarding the station for every single enemy jump clone that may or may not be activated is a misnomer."
5/6/2009,you just took over an enemy station and you expect the take over to go smoothly? which game are you playing again?ever hear of private alliance contracts? works wonders i hear!look i can get the frustration of removing a rat infestation... but seriously... this is par for the course in eve.adapt or die i'm told... i think that applies here.
5/6/2009,"well it would make the corp spy/stealing stories even more amusing.... emptied the hangers, the wallet and terminated all the corps jump clones before he left....."
5/6/2009,i've always wanted take access to all those corp hangars i could view in the station. mmmm yummy
5/6/2009,this seems a reasonable request.
5/6/2009,"every day now i see the following crap on local around rens -""accidentally purchased an invulnerability field ii! buy back for 90k!""and its 90 million.yes.. scamming is a legit way of ripping off idiots. i don't have a problem with it.what i have a problem with is the ever increase size of my block list.what i propose is the following:1: take away the ability to link contracts from all chat rooms(don't scream yet and finish reading my post of you forever shall be labeled an idiot)2: make a new section in the market called ""contracts""in this market tab you would see contracts of various kinds types and deals.now i realize there is a contracts button but the contracts thing sucks.there's no effective way to search... no effective way to snipe for items.if i want a bloody bpo of said item... i want to search for it and not fiddle through a few hundred bpc's.if i wan't a nomad... i'm not interested in seeing fenrir'sthey need to rewrite or make a new contract browser so that if someone wants to shop for goods then they can do it there.9 times out of 10 the public broadcast of a contract are crap anyway.... there's nothing useful there.if i was interested in shopping i'll go look the damn thing up myself.this allows them to scam as they see fit..... but it kills the spam.if not makes it harder for them to get the word out.rough idea but its better than nerfing the scamming industry outright."
5/6/2009,kinda rough but worth supporting so it gets more attention.
5/6/2009,yes its rough but you are more than welcome to smooth it out.the point is simply this... stop the spam... but not the scam.
5/6/2009,"the above post should be striken from all records, ever.but yes, i agree, there are better ways to make the universe seem big without inconvieniancing players. also convoys should be for in empire only, and should be suicide gankable to add an element of 'too riskey? haul it yourself then nub'"
5/6/2009,"i support everything except delivery of goods; as has already been stated, if you purchase an item in a remote solar system you have to go pick it up yourself and risk your ship or put out a courier contract and pay the other guy to risk his ship."
5/6/2009,"just a request to any present or future member of the council. could someone please press the issue of downtime during australian prime time gaming hours please?every day, every night, without fail, we have to put up with almost one hour of downtime. and before the eu and us people all start saying getting over it, just put yourself in our shoes and imagine if the game you love playing got shut down during the few hours you got to play each night.you can't tell me that rotating the downtime isn't possible. make it earlier, make it later, just come to a compromise please. i have many mates very interested in the game but are turned off by this downtime every night. by the time us aussies have dinner, spend time with the family, and then get on the pc we have very little time before the game shuts down.edit: some1 got in before me, but i will leave this up.does ccp even care about us aussies (i'm sure there are other nationalities affected too) or is it just egg on our faces?"
5/6/2009,"rotating dt will just move this problem to another tz, and no offense but i think there are more europeans/americans/uk people playing then australians"
5/6/2009,"**** you, this has been explained to death. use the search."
5/6/2009,no-one at ccp works during the hours you want dt moved to.
5/6/2009,"eve servers in londonare you volunteering to pay the 4x pay for the server techs, ccp techs and everyone else to work unsociable hours that has to be around when the dt happens rather than just on call or doing their normal jobs.also, shifting dt will affect others and their playing and when the subscription was take out by myself i knew dt was 11-12 gmt so work around it (gives me chance to have lunch etc etc).its been done to death, dt will not move and has been the same since eve started (one or two have been missed before but only for a trial)"
5/6/2009,i forgot that shanghai is near bristol. stupid geography skills.
5/6/2009,maybe this will give you some insight as to why you dont get your own personilised dt.edit: fix'd link
5/6/2009,"i of course realize that we have a lot of selfish trolls around the place so it was expected to see them come out. i wonder if any of them would be so tough in real life? nah, who am i'm kidding. guess i will just have to put up with the internet cowboys from brokeback mountian.here's hoping ccp will one day take action though."
5/6/2009,the resemblance is shocking!
5/6/2009,"how about it gos down every hour, for 2 minutes, or better yet, at a random time, drawn each day by the old tech ii lottery calculatoryou can post your request in the assembly hall, to see if any reps are foolish enough to alienate themselves from the majority of the playerbase, just for us aussies tho"
5/6/2009,"bolded the most important partyou say everyone else in eve, except you are selfish for voting against moving of a dt, because you miss playtime in the evenings, you want ccp to move it for the sake of the aussies playing the game, and then shifting the problem to a tz which is more represented? i think you are the one here who thinks of nobody but himself"
5/6/2009,"you and the others of course are so right. your arguments are spot on, well constructed, and very thought out. there is of course no way possible to find any chance of a compromise. i also failed to see how unselfish you were actually being by suggesting that us aussies lump it or leave it because everyone else was happy with the arrangement.i also sincerely apologize to ccp for even thinking that at 9am, a very unreasonable working hour, or even say 4pm ,its beer o'clock one really can't work then, that they have their maintenance techs maintain the super-dooper, can't change the shutdown timer, computer. i must admit it didn't occur to me that european's only worked a few hours a day and anything over four hours was rated as overtime. bye bye."
5/6/2009,"ccp also works in iceland thier window to tweak stuff is pertty limited by another hour, they preplan thier tweaks in the morning, get the work request done and all setup, then they let dt do its thing for 15 minutes then the devs get about 30 minutes to play around and then put everything back to where it was and finish the startup all over again, then they have to have the after dt meeting to get farmed numbers and tweak results, and lately the devs have been playing quite alot with tweaks its propably in preperation for ambulation and other improved networking abilities like that explained in the second log.i get irked by it as well too, i work a shift where it does effect me, but hey im getting more sleep than usually and getting more artwork done. if you want lessen your dt woes dont start playing before dt starts play after its over, it wont be as bad."
5/6/2009,i guess the only way ccp would be able to solve this would be to remove the daily downtime. this would require a complete overhaul of how they do things currently and i think ccp is not going to do that.so while i think they do care about you aussies i am convinced that their hands are tied when it comes to this subject.
5/6/2009,"removing dt not out of the question, its possible in theory they are not prepared to do that yet and spend the massive revenue they dont have in order to acheive this at the current time."
5/6/2009,the op's request was certainly not unreasonable. a lot of the di** answers were however.
5/6/2009,"if they move the dt to 9am the devs have to get in much earlier to prep for the dt.if they move the dt to 4pm and somthing goes wrong, the devs will be in work fixing the problem and the dt will run into the primetime for the majority of the eve players.if you do not like the current downtime where you live, i would suggest changing to a country closer to gmt."
5/6/2009,whine thread is successful whine.would you like cheese with that?learn to use the search feature moron.and try reading before responding.... hypocritical troll.
5/6/2009,i believe that is known as a real life threat. ban his ass ccp!
5/6/2009,"yeah, i get that it's irritating. thing is, dt will always have to be right in someone's way. downsides of living on a round planet, really. australia is a fairly small market, and your prime play hours are ccp's prime work hours. looks like you get to bite the bullet. it's not fair - really, it sucks - but there's not really much possible in the way of a comprimise that moves it out of your tz that doesn't shaft some other big group of players and/or ccp's internal schedules."
5/6/2009,the good of the many > the good of the few.you're on the wrong side of the inequation.
5/6/2009,"i assume you are speaking of gmt times?what exactly is wrong with 9am? if they use normal work time they would have had 2 hours to prep, how much more do you need to prep for something that happens once a day? i'd say they have the process pretty streamlined after 5 years.moving it in the other direction is not very good as you say; that would affect a lot of players."
5/6/2009,"well, to be honest, that dt is most convient for ccp. its always going to tick someone off and apparently your one of them. to be honest: live with it. go eat lunch, ride a bike read a book do something other than eve online for an hour. you won't die. --isaac"
5/6/2009,"give it another few hours and it will be half way across the pacific. that could work, not meny easter islanders on here, is there?stfu hawai, go sunbathe or surf or somthing."
5/6/2009,and just what time would that be smartass?
5/6/2009,well that would be gmt -10 according to this super dooper timezone map. that would make it roughly about 4 hours sooner than what the current dt is.
5/6/2009,so what time would that be in the 4 time zones of the usa?how many players are on at the time?what time would that be in iceland and the uk?if you would use your bloody freaking brain youd realize someone somewhere is going to be ****ed off and it don't matter what time it is in hawaii or in the easter islands...they picked the time they did because they said so.end of discussion.and for the 100000000000000th time this has been raised... the answer will forever be no.
5/6/2009,"so 11 pm pacific time. i'm sure the west coast students will appreciate that. it'd probably make me go to bed sooner some nights, giving me a hard end time of 2 am, but that's not always desirable. also, 7 am british time is not exactly when you want to do some of these things if you've got anything other than the exact standard downtime happening."
5/6/2009,"well that would make it about 1 am my time, 3 am eastern, and midnight west coast. i'm not sure about the uk or iceland because i generally do not look at the clock when i play.and i'm not sure why your barking at me, i personally like my current 5 am downtime while i sleep, i just pointed you to a timezone map."
5/6/2009,sorry... just tired of seeing this stupid assed proposal for the millionth time.
5/6/2009,dont like the idea but an increase to wardec cost which is proportional to the size of corp/alliance would be handy.i mean logically it would cost more to go to war against 5000 people then 500possibly concord would look at it like bigger bribe for looking the other way as the targets get bigger
5/6/2009,hell no.then it would cost literally nothing to war-dec a 5 man group with a 50 man group.most war-decs are with smaller targets...not bigger ones.if they where bigger ones... i'd have literally no issues with it.but most war-dec'ing corps are in it for the sport of griefing and are cowards when it comes to challenging larger prey. they would rather win... not lose.
5/6/2009,you are wrong.i do not support this idea.
5/6/2009,doesn't everyone?
5/6/2009,well yeah of course... but i'm speaking in terms of context/bias/attitude.war's are never one sided... and rarely do you see an underdog situation.but people are having trouble keeping that in mind and when that happens they come up with stupid ideas like basing war-dec fee's on population.
5/6/2009,"this is an unfortunate truth.. ccp took the rout of making caldari unpopular rather than just trying to make the other races more popular. problem with trying to control population this late in the world of eve is the fact that its way too late to be effective in any reasonable length of time. too many caldari chars already exist, and that wont change soon. i've just resigned myself to dying in any pvp situation for the next few years until populations are past being balanced out and caldari are in the minority. that's what it seems it will take for the nerfs to go away. til then i'll just clutter high sec with the rest of the missile specs who are training into other things."

5/6/2009,basically you have never flown any other race and everything you know about other races is what you read on forums.gb2wow
5/6/2009,"caldari chars maybe overpoppulated, but in pvp caldari ships are nowhere near as many as amarr or matar ships at least in the region where im currently.just last roaming we had:only hacs:7 muninn10 zealot1 eagle (died)3 cerb5 deimos2 istars0 sacri3 vagaor fleet bs ops:only bs:15 mega1 domi12 apoc1 abba3 rokh12 tempest3 typho2 mael2 scorp3 ravenand usually these ratios are true for most ops."
5/6/2009,and completely worthless. because you've just said that the mega is the best sniper.
5/6/2009,"you forget about the chimera which is one of the best carriers hands down.the pheonix is epic for pos bashing (which was the primary use for dreads according to ccp)falcons and rooks have a wicked part in roams and fleets.cerbs are wicked inti snipers with precisions, good dps boats with heavys and hass. the eagle is the furthest sniping hac in the game afaiknh is a wicked command shiplevi is an awesome titanmanticore is the best stealth bomber.the caldari inties are awesome.the flycather is the fastest locking of the dictorsthe onyx is tied for first for best hicgolem is a wicked maurader for ratting in deep 0.0 and missioningthey have the best jf if im not mistaken.drake is the best mid level mission runnerhave i missed anything cause thats a lot of up sides to the race?"
5/6/2009,realy have i? i thought i said that caldari is the least used race in pvp. oh no.you must be right the raven should be the top used with its awesome dps/tank while still having 200km optimal.
5/6/2009,"bobbeh if thats all true, and caldari ships are so great, then why do nearly every fleet i fight, or fly in, only fly one caldari ship consistently...the falcon"
5/6/2009,"chimera... oh then it is only me who thinks carriers are realy balanced out.phoenix sux even at pos shootin right now. delay dmg sux they deal the least dmg durion our ops. and just not talk about fleet fights for the phoenix.falcon rook well still needs some time to decide if they are still good enough or not. i could just bring a zealot which would remove enemy permanently from the fight.cerb inti sniping with precision, do you mean assault launchers with caldari navy bloodclaw? because precision missiles are so useless. it still has no tackle gear and medicore tank/low-medicore dps. oh and missiles not good for sniping.eagle is still the worst sniper hac. muninn, zealot are much betternh is not a command ship it is a t2 price tagged drake,nothing else.levi okay althou all titans are awesome.manticore is not the best sb , that would be the hound or the much cheaper puri.caldari inties? hmm i thought there are much better inties for tackling which they should do.flycatcher... devoter>broadsword > onyx thats what i hearedgolem yep i still wouldnt use it in 0.0jf no not the best i would call the matar the best one. but all jf are the same more or lessdrake another pve related priceyes you missed the rokh/harpy which are the only usefull railships for caldari."
5/6/2009,"caldari have a lot of problems with specific ships and weapon systems. most of these issues aren't gamebreaking but they could use a fix nonetheless.and bobbeh i disagree with a lot of your points. the chimera would be great if the meta didn't favor armor so strongly. the flycatcher is actually the slowest locking dictor -not that it matters for bubbling. now having the lowest speed, that sucks.the lev has the best damage type on its dd. the bonus is inferior to the avatar's and erebus'. caldari have one great inty and the worst inty.the manticore isn't the clear cut best. the hound and purifier can fit three damage mods and are faster. wether that's worth an extra mid and more cpu comes down to personal preference. i won't comment on the pve stuff. now for problems:citadels fail in capital fights - the secondary role of dreads as stated by ccp. there's two reasons: horrible explosion velocity and slow speed. speed is getting boosted but that won't make them good in long range engagements.every capital sized weapon system has a long and short range version. except missiles which lack capital cruise.rockets. again explosion velocity.cruise missiles are lackluster in pvp.the nighthawk badly lacks grid to be worth using over any of the alternatives in pvp.the caracal lacks grid for a workable ham fit.the moa is inferior to the rupture and thorax. it should lose the worthless extra high and gain a mid. 6/4/4 is a bad layout.the ferox needs an extra turret to be on par with the brutix. the raptor needs something changed. more grid would be good, more speed would be great. currently there is no reason to use it over the other tackle inties.and then there's the hawk . enough said really.so while i don't believe the race as a whole is broken, i do think some changes are in order."
5/6/2009,"yes. you have implicitly equated ""popularity"" with ""superiority"", implying that since the mega is the most common sniper bs in your gang, it must be the best. but it's well known that the apoc and rokh are the best snipers and that the mega and tempest are distinctly inferior.but since we're talking about caldari thingies that need fixing:citadel torps: need to be more effective against moving capitals, need to be faster (being fixed).citadel cruise: needs to exist.hawk: need to do more damage than a kestrel, needs more cpu, needs shield boost bonus switched to shield resist.rockets: need to be less hilariously all-round bad.cruise: needs a role (probably impossible to fix).caracal: needs pg to fit 5x hm ii, lse ii and mwd i.raptor: needs something to make it worthwhile in a galaxy that has the ares.nighthawk: needs a cubic litre more pg.i don't think there's a fundamental problem with the moa or ferox. the brutix and thorax aren't particularly attractive ships these days, because of poor ranges.and related... guristas ships need to be not utterly worthless.nidhoggur should be shield-tanked to restore capital tank balance.shield transfers should not require all your ship's cpu, and then some more."
5/6/2009,the ferox and brutix follow the same design as rokh/hype. how would you feel if the rokh had one less gun?granted that wasn't an entirely fair comparison because the brutix cannot reach fleet engagement range while the ferox can so it does have that going for it.the moa though... if you fit it for its intended role with rails it's a mid range cruiser with low dps and no tank. it fills a niche that isn't useful in game. it lacks enough mids/lows to both shoot and lock at fleet range and if you fit it with blasters you run into all the problems a blaster thorax has with none of the pluses.it doesn't have any kind of advantage that would justify having only four mids.that said i don't consider these to be critical issues.
5/6/2009,"yeah, i agree completely about the moa ""filling a role that isn't useful"" problem. it's the same problem that cruise has - what's the use of a long-range anti-bs missile?eft suggests that the moa can be competitive in a blaster fit (lse buffer tank, full tackle, better optimal) but the lack of drone bay hinders it. the other problem with moa and ferox is to make them work in their intended sniper roles, you need good skills - but if you had good skills you'd be in an eagle."
5/6/2009,"no change ingame yet? then you have my support. no need to bludgeon op for something ""coming soon."" if anything this just shows ccp we want it ""sooner"". i think ccp needs some communication tool upgrades in general. forums/website need work ingame email needs work"
5/6/2009,"in fact in rl you have a higher chance to be robed if you dont pay attention for your assets. in eve, if you haul expensive stuff afk you asume the risk of being blown up in pieces. moreover, if you haul that in a tech i hauler with nothing else then cargo expanders even you dont need much isk to fill out your empty slots with tech i mods, you dont deserve your cargo. and there are repercusions, ship loss, most of the time someone else take the wreck's loot, you are flashing red to all players around and they can shoot you without to get a killright, and beside that you need to do lots of dmg in very short time before concord to shoot, web, scram, neutralize and jamm you. reward? sec status loss and most of the time good things are destroyed and the remained loot do not worthit. anyway is a matter of luck.in fact concord is overpowered,only the ""wise"" players that haul expensive things afk in a unfitted tech i frig or industrial should be blaimed for high sec ganking."
5/6/2009,"hello all,no, i'm not a candidate in this election. i did feel like posting a reply about this though.recently, i lost nearly all of my possessions (well over 2b isk worth) in a high-sec gank while i was tending to my kids. it hurt, but that's eve, and i recovered. eve is a dog-eat-dog world, and if you act like the lame gazelle in the bunch, expect the lions of the serengeti to feast on your remains.eliminating insurance payouts is a good idea, and it won't do a thing to stop high-security piracy, considering the profit margin is usually much more than the loss of a sacrificial vessel. implants should never be insurable....it's like asking ccp to pay for your clone if you die in faction warfare. rigs, modules, implants, buying insurance, t2 discrepancies, etc are all prices one must consider the cost of when engaging in any sort of pvp, whether high-sec or low-sec.just my 2 isk."
5/6/2009,"the topic of applying the same effect of local in wormholes is a bit of a mixed bag for me. i'm not fond of it being implemented without the addition of more game mechanics that function off of it.to give you an example, there needs to be a benefit to holding sov in a given system when hostiles come into your territory (if local were changed.) an advanced warning system that notified people friendly to the sov-holding alliance would be ideal. i would also urge the addition of a way to disable this advance warning to give crafty invaders a way to penetrate enemy territory."
5/6/2009,"i'm going to be slow to respond to further inquiries until sunday evening, the 10th since i'll be attending evevegas. if by chance you'll be there too, do not hesitate to come up and say hello. i've also updated my web site with new content and will be adding much more on monday."
5/6/2009,that flashgame has my vote
5/6/2009,"i totally agree with your view. as i have been trying to point out earlier in this thread, balance is the key word hear. some of the challengers, only pay attention to the detail personal views of the candidate, instead of focusing on his general attitude. erik has a neutral approach and a skill in diplomacy. so to add to your important voice fille, i would like to once again emphasize: those are the main qualification to get results with ccp. and as far as the take care is concerned, i think that erik'c cautions approach and ankhe's perseverance and passion makes them an excellent team. vote erik!"
5/6/2009,"so heres some more ""tough"" questions... proposed capital ship changes and future of said ships...now im not wanting the removal of cap ships so lets say thats out of it.now, with the upcoming cap changes and the proposed band-aid fix to the naglmao and the phoewho? what can i expect of you to push for and why and what about carriers / motherships, will we see a buff to their actual use rather then a ship hauler and thats it. ie: will my mom be useful? or still a over expensive pos? and i dont mean a starbase pos lol"
5/6/2009,"just to add, i am looking at voting for you but just want to make sure that my vote goes towards the right person so :|"
5/6/2009,"vuk is cool guy with good ideas for players, vote for vuk !"
5/6/2009,\o/
5/6/2009,"i like that bit. it is easy to forget sometimes. not sure who i am voting for yet, but smaller gang emphasis would be a welcome change to pvp blobfests.i am curious if you have had any experience or feelings about doomsdays and titans."
5/6/2009,"i almost experienced a titan once. got briefly involved with a failtastic alliance associated with atlas before the great retreat. was on my way to participate in a fleet battle. got podded about 2 jumps out from the jump bridge while alliance mates ignored the fight and continued on to the jump bridge.yeah, that reminded me why i love 0.0 alliances so much.so no, i have no direct experience with titans or with doomsdays. i've only seen capital ships a handful of times. most of my time is spent in highsec. i spent about 3 months living in lowsec, and now i semi-regularly venture into wormholes. they're a great source of amusement, excitement, and profit. and they're rarely blobbed to hell."
5/6/2009,"you got my vote.i like your view of 0.0 and lvl4-empire inbalance.edit: i have some questions. would be kind if you could answer.those are topics im interested in.1. what are you thinking about the current situation with supercapitals (especially titan)and do you see are problem in the increasing numbers of them. if yes do you have already ideas at hand to stop fleets being victims of multiple dds. (one titan per region, one dd per system, changing dds, etc.)2. whats your opinion to great power-blocks in eve like the nc or the anti-bob-coalition. do you see any problems there? should it be possible for big alliances to hold that big amounts of space?3. how could 0.0 be easier accessible for the medium-sized alliances without having to napevery powerblock around causing bigger&bigger blobs. is this in your mind when you are discussingthe reform of the sov-system? do you see a problem here?"
5/6/2009,"i have not really taken a standpoint on this. but i do agree that there is a problem, especially when one can field upto 10 at a time.one dd per system, region, etc. i think can be exploited. e.g. friendlies dd somewhere in system or in the region to prevent hostile dd.i am kinda fond of the idea that when a titan dd's it can not warp or jump for 10 minutes. i believe a titan should not be what we say in norwegian; ""t<U+FFFD>m og r<U+FFFD>m"", which basically means ""ejeculate and run"". you should ""ejeculate"" and stay, nowhere to run and nowhere to hide nomatter what kinda whale it might be.i see this as a problem. currently, the problem lies in the players with their nap-squad-type-of-leadership ""safety-in-numbers"" analogy and game mechanism. due to how sovreignity works with pos's, all you need is to blob the enemy to kingdom come and you'll win. that is what i am trying to achieve with a change in the sovreignity system. i really hate the numbers game and i truly hate the tedious system where one have to shoot pos's for hours and hours. this is a game, it should be challenging and fun, not boring and monotonus."

5/6/2009,"small chimp had a good idea about making a chart to tell csm candidates apart at a glance, so i've shamelessly stolen it and created a questionnaire to help people make their decision about who to vote for without having to dig through 40 campaign websites. it's not complete, obviously, but it's got a fair bit of information, and i hope it helps. more answers will be added as i get them. candidates, i've sent all of you an evemail, but if you'd prefer you can answer below. view the chartwhat is the single biggest issue you will attempt to work on if elected to the csm? what is your single biggest activity as an eve player? rate your knowledge of the following aspects of the game on a scale from 1 to 10, where 10 is high:- 0.0 warfare- piracy- pve- industryrate your general happiness with the following aspects of the game on a scale from 1 to 10, where 10 is high:- supercapital ships- sovereignty mechanics- low security space- local chat channel- minerals and t1 items in npc loot- players being allowed to join npc corps at will- the user interface"

5/6/2009,excellent chart. i hope it gets filled out so the voters can make a rational decision on where the candidates stand. thank you for taking the time to do this for the voting pool in general.
5/6/2009,reply sent
5/6/2009,"this would be of far greater import if all players were measuring from the same benchmarks and, frankly if they were making honest appraisals rather than vote grabbing."
5/6/2009,to be honest i tend to agree. whilst i appreciate the sentiment of this questionnaire/grid thingy the fact that it is self appraisal mixed with a lack of clear measurement added to the fact that everyone wants to be elected and therefore their answers may be a bit skewed from the reality makes this sort of thing a bit of an irrelevance to any voter who actually cares about the issues. i'd much rather see people questioning the candidates closely for themselves and making their judgments based upon that.
5/6/2009,sent reply
5/6/2009,"that's a problem, especially with the knowledge questions. so far the average level of knowledge exhibited by the candidates is 7.28, which is probably a little high(though i put myself down for 8.25, so who am i to talk?). the ""single biggest issue"" and ""happiness with"" questions are harder to abuse similarly, though - you can't please everyone with your answers, and we're seeing a wide variety so far. also, i'm up to 16 answers from candidates, so i'm updating the chart now."

5/7/2009,what is this doing on page 2?i know the current graphics are probably placeholders until the new epic jump graphics are finished but please at least tell us that they are indeed coming
5/7/2009,this !!
5/7/2009,yes
5/7/2009,why the hell would you change the old effect!!!
5/7/2009,"i see a discussion going on in gd with mixed results, so might as well give it a try here.we all know about the corporation wallet divisions to seperate the isk into various categories to make it easier to track. why not allow this for personal wallets as well? of course, to prevent it from using too many server resources, there would likely be only one or two additional divisions.the reasoning behind it (pros):1) makes managing income/expenses so much easier2) would fit easily into eve: why in this day and age are we restricted to one account when the average person has more than that?3) reduces the likelihood of overspending; how many of you have accidentially spent too much money when you were saving for that shiny ship/module/skillbook/whatever that you wanted?possible cons:1) nerfs scamming by making it more difficult to get people to spend lots of money on a contract2) increased server lag (?)now, i know a lot of people will jump on the fact that it will nerf scamming, but really, how many people will micromanage their money all the time? i personally would like it to keep track of how much i make doing whatever (missioning, mining), and it would help corps by allowing them to seperate and distribute income from selling minerals on a mining op (thus eliminating the pen-and-paper aspect).thoughts? if you're against it, please say why so it can be put up for discussion."
5/7/2009,i think this is sometihng that has been brought up several times and i think ccp has said that its a possibility. in any case... /signed.

5/7/2009,same.

5/7/2009,supporting this
5/7/2009,i fully support the fact that supercaps need a serious rework. many good ideas in this thread.
5/7/2009,"i agree, although, i don't think i would use this, as i generally have my second account on the second screen.... but still a very nice idea. :-)"
5/7/2009,"i support this idea. just make it so you can inject any skill if you have all the required skills already, even if they aren't at the right level. thus:you could inject cruiser once you have frig level 1.you would not be able to put a single point into cruiser until you had frig level 4.you would be able to queue cruiser to go right after frig 4.i think the issue about having to carry a skill around with you for a day, or week, before you can train it isn't something we need to worry about. but that's just me."
5/7/2009,"this is a great idea, although, maybe not so drastic range boosts. going from 20 to 30 and then 40 is plenty, going all the way to 80 is a bit excessive."
5/7/2009,yes... i thought of that before.. its really needed.its annoying typing the range in middle of combat.
5/7/2009,"though i prefer to give da bytez with lasers, i have realized that many do not choose this route. in fact, because with all other weapon systems one has to be paying attention to the game to resume firing after reloading, some people have trained into laser ships specifically for afk shooting purposes (things that are useful to take out like station services and undefended starbases). if ammo using weapons system resumed firing automatically after reloading, it would put them closer to being on par with lasers when doing this sort of afk shooting. obviously one could still run out ammo in the cargo hold, but it would go a long way toward making hybrids, projectiles and missiles more effective at shooting these kind of high-hitpoint undefended targets. also useful for my non-revelation dreadnought brethren when shooting poses .summary: make hybrids, projectiles and missiles automatically resume firing at the previous target after the guns finish reloading."
5/7/2009,posting to say i support giving da bytez for prolonged afk periods without using lasers.
5/7/2009,jumping on this for my poor non-laz0rz friends
5/7/2009,"useful for dreads, yes, but also for a lot of other things too - this would be handy for gun ships in missions. also, for that matter, lasers using faction/t2 ammo would like this too. i can't think of any real downsides offhand either. supported."
5/7/2009,ccp fix this tia
5/7/2009,i have to support this or i will get da bytez.
5/7/2009,supported
5/7/2009,"another month come and gone, and no word from ccp about this. would we be too optimistic to expect an answer that shows some evidence that ccp is in fact working on this if/when it's raised during the upcoming meeting?"
5/7/2009,awesome idea!
5/7/2009,"as a ceo of a corporation with extensive wormhole operations, this would make things a lot easier. /support"
5/7/2009,"yeah, no need for a new skill, just add to the existing one."
5/7/2009,"imo 5% isnt enough, for the normal tractor beam it would only mean a 1 km increase per levelinstead raise it to 25-50% per level or just increase the base range of the tractorbeamsor even better introduce more tractorbeam modules like medium/large"
5/7/2009,i would love to see this implemented!!!!
5/7/2009,"i like the idea, but think it should have 4 mid slots, so less likely overpowered. costs should be around 150m."
5/7/2009,the nightmare has 7 mids 5 lows. if they introduced it as a regular ship i agree it should have one less slot.
5/7/2009,"yes!for one, setting up contracts on items that are bought in quantities like ammo, and drones is ******ed in my view.i think a corp/alliance market place would be an awesome addition to the game. i'm a ceo of a corporation, and i've said many times that such a thing as this is soo needed.thank you op for posting the proposal."
5/7/2009,sigh...
5/7/2009,"number of users in local chat ruins the game.at least in 0.0.ruins all strategy. all pvp in eve is based on local chat. its the main source of information for a fleet commander.i dont have the right words to say it... but its very meta-game intel.when i play eve... i like to feel inmersed in a space ship universe and local ruins it. it dosnt have a meaning. where does this information comes to your character... jedi powers?scanner and probbing should do the work. you just need to add on the scanner if a ships has an user inside or not. thats it. dosnt have to say, who is the character or if he is friendly or not.for me, a player fully dedicated to pvp, local chat intel is the worst thing in eve."
5/7/2009,"for sure! you can't train them, so they shouldn't be listed. of course, i just drag and drop from the main skills window, i don't bother with the skill queue window, but i'm sure plenty of people do."
5/7/2009,"not one to fall for scams like this, or waste time using them (i'd just sell a time code), what irritates me is that it reduces the usefulness of the mechanic, watching contracts in local while shopping in jita.displaying the price in text in the contract is a good idea, also contract links in local could include the contract price largest denomination. ""(999m) some contract, only 1 million!"" rather than ""some contract, only 1 mil!""."
5/7/2009,"agreed. it's not the scam that's annoying, it's the channel spam and reduced signal/noise ratio when looking through contracts. spam is bad no matter what form it takes or what communication channel it infests."
5/7/2009,"i agree, having it round to the nearest thousand, million, or billion, depending on which is most appropriate.almost 150 million.over 150 million.a lot easier to read then 149999999. i mean, heck, i even had to put comma's in to make sure i was typing the right number of 9's in there...."
5/7/2009,i fully support scamming.i also support people having to put some effort into it.
5/7/2009,100% in.
5/7/2009,badly needed
5/7/2009,supporting a good idea!
5/7/2009,"the specific idea i'm not sold on, but the proposal more generally, of creating a better interface for contracts, i'm all for. tentative support."
5/7/2009,ditto marks.
5/7/2009,didn't realise that happened.obvious bug is obvious
5/7/2009,that would be why this is a bug.
5/7/2009,"support, but ""only if the pre-reqs are in the queue""excellent idea"
5/7/2009,i agree with this!
5/7/2009,isnt that allready possible? (with a courier contract maybe?)
5/7/2009,"only up to cruiser size. as a courier contract is limited to 120,000 m<U+FFFD>"
5/7/2009,"i dunno about that. just because something can fit in a room doesn't mean it can fit through the door. the loading bay doors on a freighter aren't as large as the cargo hold itself. can you put a automobile inside a room? yes - but you have to take it apart, cary the pieces in, and then put it back together. would this be much more difficult or even impossible with custom-made or welded-on ""rigged"" vehicle parts? yes. i like a tug boat style ship solution."
5/7/2009,"this is a fallacious arguement at best. they currently make cargo aircraft where the entire nose and tail swing aside allowing for a doorway with exactly the same inner dimensions as the cargo bay itself. there's no logical reason why an internet spaceship couldn't do the same.unless of course spacecraft engineers are dumber than aircraft engineers. at any rate, supported."
5/7/2009,support.
5/7/2009,"exactly. those are specially designed vehicles for transporting complete vehicles or other very large objects that can't be dis-assembled. they also make quite a few cargo aircraft that have regular loading bay doors - in fact this is far more common. your average fed-ex or ups cargo plane doesn't have the military ""flip-up and roll out a tank"" fitting."
5/7/2009,"true, but they also don't have containers that can store 30% more than their exterior volume."
5/7/2009,"it's an annoying ""feature"" that doesn't add anything to the game so supported."
5/7/2009,"the idea the op has isn't really the right way to fix the stacking issue, but i do think that there should be some kind of change. at the very least, it seems kind of odd that i can use 5 cap rechargers, and they are all fully effective. heck, the 5th one is the most effective of them all, based on current mechanics. and fitting 8 cargo hold expanders, well, there is no penalty, and again, the later ones are more effective. a single 22% cargo hold on a 600m3 hold isn't much. 8 gets it up to over 2944. 600*(1.22^8).now, take a look at armor hardeners. t2 give 55% to resists. suppose you start at 20%. that means you are taking 80% damage. a single hardener will change you to 64% resists (36% damage, 55% less then none), right now, the second takes you to 81.2% (18.8% damage, 47% less then one) the 3rd takes you to 87.1%. thats 12.9% damage. or 31% less then with two. a 4th will take you to 89.1% resists, which is 10.9%. or 15% better then with three.now, i realize that it's hard to make something that trends down towards 0 balanced, but they did it with cap rechargers, so why not resists? with fixed, static numbers, it could look like this:% damage takenone: 36%two: (36%-55%)=16.2%three: (36%-55%)-55% = 7.29%four: ((36%-55%)-55%)-55% = 3.2805% // 96.7195% actual resist.now that's clearly over powered. or is it? fitting 4 hardeners of a single type might make you almost immune to a single damage type, but the other types will suffer. for pve, yes, it's overpowered. maybe not so much for pvp, but i'm not sure.anyway, so, with no stacking, it's overpowered. with stacking, the 4th or 5th modules are rather useless. perhaps we can find some sort of balance, that lets people use a 4th module, without too much penalty, without letting it get down to such a low level?on a side note, if there was no stacking penalty, using base values for an eanm ii, 7 of them would increase a base resist of 20% to a total of 83%. that's also a bit on the high side, but if you are fitting that many omni tanks, you should get something for your money. right now fitting 7 will give you 57.1% resists. with all level 5 skills, it changes to 88.6% with no penalty, and 63.9% current.yay math! i guess taking those courses was useful after all....so, to sum up my post:the current system only puts a stacking penalty on some modules, not all.the 3rd module for stacking penalized systems is weak, 4th+ pretty much not worth having.removing the stacking altogether would be overpowered for resists, and anything else that trends from 100% to 0, or from 0 to 100%.things that have a larger scale, or scale upwards (cap scaling down from 1,000 to 0, or cargo scaling up from 600 to 3000) are currently not penalized.*shrug*i do support that there should be a change. i don't support the change the op put forth, because it's broken."
5/7/2009,"maybe that just isnt true? while i think the idea is bad, there are certainly games which do everything from the base stats."
5/7/2009,pity support.
5/7/2009,/supportcan we please play the game instead of ccp treating us like carnies that have to jump through our daily quota of flaming hoops?only complete masochists who find themselves well invested in drudgery will think anyone's getting away with anything if the game isn't so demanding.one of the cool factors of a persistent universe is having lots of player interaction all over the place. confining the reach of players within this persistent universe is the same as lowering the player density.
5/7/2009,i agree with most of the stuff being said here:either more range and tracking or higher damage multiplier to compensate the poor damage from bad tracking.
5/7/2009,bumping allowed in here?
5/7/2009,"i could see this as working, if you had to take from the top first (untrain bs before you can untrain cruiser, etc.) and could only untrain one at a time.put the points into a pool, and then have a second queue that trains out of that pool.you can't put any skills in the ""bonus"" queue that are in the normal queue, and the bonus queue trains at half speed.so no skill points would be lost, they would lose the skill and have to buy it again, but changing out a 30 day cruiser 5 skill would take 60 days to empty the pool into other skills.make it so they have to be the same attributes, to prevent exploits, and that you can't untrain a skill while there are skill points in the bonus pool.how's that for an idea? much better then the op's idea?"
5/7/2009,"paladin loses the main characteristic of the apoc, the optimal range bonus."
5/7/2009,the golem loses a low.the paladin loses the range bonus.the vargur is the worst marauder but that's neither here nor there.
5/7/2009,"i find that the current dss probes are sort of useful, in that you can drop a single one, set it to 256, raise it high above the system, and then hit scan, and you will get a listing of every sig and it's relitive scan strength, because the probe is like 100au away from everything, so the distance effect is low.you won't know where anything is, but then you can decide if you want to start scanning the strong ones (in wormhole space, likely to be grav/ladar sites) or the weak ones (likely to be radar/mag). now that we have the id's in place we can just pick the top/bottom id off the list, scan it down with cores, and then start over again with the dss for the next on the list.i do still think the dss's should get a bit of a boost, or that there should be an advanced core probe that can't scan ships, but is stronger. maybe 10% stronger then the normal core probe, but also allow it to expand all the way from 0.25 to 256au. that gives people the choice between dss, which can pick up ships, and something a bit stronger and more useful for exploration.and of course, allowing more then just four probes to be used is huge! since the main exploration skill gives you extra probes, and you start with four, having both the minimum and maximum useful number be four is rather stupid. keep the check on where they are, so that you still have to be careful about where you place them, although, with more skills, you could be a bit sloppy without too much of a hit, but you can't just throw them at it and expect it to work.on a side note... sometimes when we have 3 probes touching a spot, we get a ""sensor echo"" where we get two results for the same sig. the second result is hidden though. could we have that fixed, so it's visible again? the echo should be kept, we just need to be able to see both results..."
5/7/2009,"i tried reading the comments here but they degraded into useless flaming far too quickly, so i'll just state my opinion and move on.i posted a petition about 2 years ago regarding this problem, and was told ccp were working to address it, australia *is not* the only country that has dt at an inconvenient time, so all of you that are saying we, (yes i'm australian) are not important enough, can go take a look at your tz map.i think everyone needs to take 5, and have a look at what you're all arguiing about. for instance, one person makes the point that by moving dt you would just inconvenience another country, well obviously, but that's the issue isnt it? that one group of countries are being inconvenienced.i suggest now, as i did 2 years ago, that dt be cycled. let us all take turns at dealing with having eve shut down during our prime time, heck you could do something as simple as swapping it by 12 hours every second day.i support this thread, and i am highly disapointed at the childish, selfish and many arrogant comments i was forced to wade through.:edit: to the person who linked this image ("

5/7/2009,"ninja salvage, can flipping, contract scams are fine the way they are. the contract scam spam is a bit annoying though for people who aren't going to fall for it anyways and just want to buy their stuff and get out of jita.edit: and while you didnt mention it, suicide ganking is fine as well. just be conscious of how much value you put into your ship and keep it below a certain level, then you don't really have to worry about suicide gankers."
5/7/2009,"high sec is exactly that... high security, not total security. i think right now the balance is pretty good. keep your wits about you (or even blunder about like a blind spastic in most cases) and you're pretty much guarenteed safety. can flipping was implemented at the behest of miners who wanted a way to combat ore thieves and now look at them bemoaning the mechanics... i can see similar apoplectic whines from mission runners should changes be made to salvaging. leave the system as is. for every carebear that scores a touchdown for democracy as he one volleys a salvaging destroyer with his golem another four or five will lose them. tbh the fallout from this, though hilarious and profitable probably won't be worth it. one could make all sorts of rl paralels 'salvage rights' etc etc. leave it as is to save a lot of carebear butthurt (see, i'm helping you guys out here).contract scams... unless you're completely brain dead you're not going to fall for one. it's good that eve has means of equalizing one's iq and wallet balance in such ways (contract scams being one of many)."
5/7/2009,"as lark said hi sec is just that high security not absolute security. there are way to protect yourself against ninja salvaging, can flipping, contract scams etc. that people chose not to use them is their choice and they must accept the consequences. whether this is the popular answer or not is irrelevant the important thing is that at a fundamental level the lack of complete security and accepting consequences of your choices is what eve is really about."
5/7/2009,"high sec was never meant to be 100% safe. if you are stupid (eg, hauling 1 bil of stuff in iteron v) you will probably attract unwanted attention whereever you go. ninja salvaging, can flipping etc fine as it is. pirating fine as it is. i've read all the posts regarding dropping insurance for pirates on their ships- frankly, this is a poor idea and shows little understanding of pirating. a good pirate can afford to lose a few mil in ships...since s/he will be targeting far juicier prey!contract scams are annoying, waste everyone's time and clog up contracts. however, if players want to waste time doing such things (rather than get out and about and enjoy the more active part of eve), let em'. just one less idiot to shoot...of course, not allowing contract links to be posted in local might make local a bit easier to follow!xavier"
5/7/2009,short and simple; no!
5/7/2009,"i agree with everyone else thus far- high security does not mean complete security. you want a world with no consequences and no risks, go play wow."

5/8/2009,"as someone who's considering acquiring afs, i fully support this motion, especially because i want to be able to fly a hawk."
5/8/2009,"this i don't get - the retribution is explicitly a fleet ship imo and it's great at it. the ability to project solid dps to 20km and melt faces at point blank whilst at the same time eating damage - that's what the more ganky af's are for, surely!the point about the vengence weapons is spot on - it is completely insane that the majority of fits (mine included) opt for projectile weapons as opposed to rockets, but that's an inherent problem with rockets. if they fix them, then i'm still not sure i see where the extra bonus comes from without making it overpowered. 100-120 dps (hopefully - let's see what ccp come up with though) and the ability to tank like a beast is more than enough, isn't it.mind you i rather like the afterburner idea.more discussions! af's are far from perfect, but they do now rock a little at least. the trick is to chart a course that doesn't attract the nerf bat, and i'm still not sold that 4th bonuses are the way to go. i'm willing to be convinced though, so get to it!"
5/8/2009,"well, the thing with a retribution is, you can fit an omen or even a prophecy to do better dps and tank better for less isk. the advantage of an af in fleets is its speed and agility; in fleets this means it serves best as heavy tackle. i'm not saying its totally useless, and i can see why people would still choose to fly it, but in terms of balance, an uninsurable 20+ mil isk ship should have some utility over an insurable 5 mil isk ship.as for the second point, its pretty simple to me; all other t2 ships get 4 bonus, with the majority getting the 2 bonus from the t1 version. i understand your point about not making them a prime target for a swing of the nerbat, but they will simply be in line with all the other t2, its just a case of ensuring the bonus are balanced. hence i've tried to provoke a bit of discussion as to what the bonuses could be"
5/8/2009,"frankly, assault ships need to either have a fourth bonus or have one of their bonuses changed to a role bonus and then be reassigned as faction frigates with the resistance bonuses left in place, or slightly modified, as a prelude to faction ships in general being boosted."
5/8/2009,supported.titans role totally should be revamped and dd removed as it's ruining 0.0 warfare.
5/8/2009,"49- 2 nights ago is a perfect example of why dd need to be removed. 2 titans logged in, were in warp in under 3 min, 40 bs and more support killed, relatively equal matched fleet jumps in, and goes balistic b/c they now have a large advantage with all those ships killed ahead of time.titans removed a massive amount of our firepower in the blink of an eye before the fight could even begin... i'd have rather had a disabled fleet with half their mods heat damaged than dead ships, so we could have had a better alternative to fight it out."

5/8/2009,there's a browser?
5/8/2009,"oh, come on, eve's browser is great. sure, you have to hit alt-tab before you use it, and if you click on a link without doing that it opens in some godawful piece of crap instead of trusty firefox, but firefox itself works just great. more seriously, i proposed a topic that touched on this a year ago, and the response back was that a fully new igb was in the works. i assume this is part of the same project that will fix evemail as well(the whole ""eve facebook"" thing). yeah, we all want it, but it's coming, and i'm not sure how much we need to ask for it again."

5/8/2009,"seems like most people are stuck on the lag part.i don't see it being a huge issue myself, and, if you give the option to turn it off, i _really_ don't see the problem.-skan"
5/8/2009,1: look harder2: excuse isaac's slightly foul mood : o) but he is right.3: lag is a valid concern because ships load once you arrive within the local area of wherever your warping too... each one would invovle textures for each variant and paint jobs would number in the thousands of if not millions depending on how much freedom you have in painting it.at this point i would say no... whether you can turn them on or not.i would say paint corp logos instead....
5/8/2009,"corp logo's would be nice.how about... and i think this will go ahead and beat most of the naysayers.... a set of options?say... iono... 5 different paint jobs you could pick from?would still let you make it your own, at least a bit... and they are already loaded, so the game doesn't have to load up a paint job someone spent 9 hours on.honestly, i don't think it would make a whole lot of lag... it would have to be tested to see for sure.-skan"
5/8/2009,"fewer options means lighter load...let's to a bit of math.lets say you have a picture... and the picture is 50kb (that's killobytes)1000 kb is 1 mb (megabytes) and 1000 mb is 1 gb (gigabytes) and so forth.with that in mind... each ship has a different size... bigger the ship... bigger the picture.for kicks lets say a frigate is 1 picture.... and a cruiser is 2 pictures... and a battleship is 5 pictures....now multiply that by 1 to 200.multiply that yet again by the number of high sec systems currnetly busy.getting the ""picture""?^_^;"
5/8/2009,"eve could give predefined hull patches for each and every player to color any rgb (or hsb...) way he likes and it would still not create any relevant amount of load at all.the textures are already all without coloration. most don't seem to know that. the colours and hull-patch data is all shaders and alpha channels. apoc, eom apoc, khanid apoc, paladin... all the same texture. just different shader-presets. this data is already handled by your client. the only change would be that instead of telling the client which preset it should use, it would transmit a variable. in the mass of transmitted data, that would no make any relevant difference.it would be different if all ships were prerendered instances of one universal archetype, but they are not.adding corp logos to the hulls would be no impressive calculation either. that is just a prerendered texture with an alpha channel, slapped onto the hull texture. would cause a helluva lot less load than the calculation of avatar images, when you meet someone for the first time. since most of all that is handled on the client side, it could easily be load adjusted, fit with a low priority, so that it is not loaded when other factors put a lot of strain on the client.the possibility to do it is not worth any discussion, really. it is possible. easily. the only true question that remains is, whether or not ccp wants to do it. if they want it, it is a cakewalk to put it in.as long as it is subtle and as long as there will be no ships with 8-bit schlongs on the hull, i am in favour of any such flavour addition."
5/8/2009,"i'm all for allowing selection of a a pre-set group of design patterns and primary and secondary colors. i'm not for custom paint jobs proudly displaying billy's e-member in full color.i'm even okay with it costing isk to apply a new paint job to a ship -- heck, i'd pay it.my only concern is that we won't be able to tell t2 ships apart from their t1 counterparts; but that's what the overview is for anyway."
5/8/2009,"sometimes there are connection problems, sometimes there are other things that cause this, for example loosing electricity for 1 second and having your computer auto-restart or some few hundred people jumping into the region and lagging you out - lost drones.so, you've been missioning, ratting or whatever. if at this point you loose connection to server then npc's will most likely kill those drones. sometimes these connection issues last only a few seconds and you are able to log-in right after. but you still loose your drones because your dominix or carrier takes 10 minutes to drive all the way to your drones. (my bad, fighters not affected, removed that part)this issue is fairly old and it serves no practical purpose.this same issue used to plague probes, but now we have a button ""reconnect to probes."" therefore i propose adding a similar button for drones or simply have them never be lost, perhaps set a ""drone loss timer"" for 1 or 2 hours like wrecks have it so that once you log-in your drones are still controllable."

5/8/2009,"hello shardow,ccp knows about this problem, and has been working with eva to find a solution. fw is a great concept that was never implemented fully for fear of workarounds or other issues. right now, although fw does occupy a portion of the population, ccp has things that are in dire need of a fix that affect a lot more people (ie mining, wardec mechanics, 0.0 space, just to name a few).i'd expect them to fix it, but not soon. they have a full workload, and are cranking through it very well imho. patience is a virtue."
5/8/2009,as much as it pains me to have to agree with someone from morsus mihi i have to support this idea.
5/8/2009,thats a great idea. however i do object to supporting your own thread.
5/8/2009,"ok, so most will agree the current sov rules are out dated, cause lag blobs and mean that there is quite a lot of luck involved in pos warfare i.e. stronting to the right level, kiting pos's to try and get the end of rf in your alliances prime etc etc etc.therefore how about this as a proposal for candidates to mull over. have a game mechanic based upon the fps domination game system. where you have points in the system you have to capture but once to have captured them (through whatever the decided mechanic is) the sov begins to turn to you. once you have sov at level 1 then small gate guns are onlined automatically in your favour and small pos's can be placed, sov 2 medium gate guns plus medium pos's can be placed, sov 3 large gate guns plus ewar and large towers can be placed plus the cyno jammers etc.etc. i this way you need to conquer a system in order to benefit from it. you can't just kill an enemy r64 and place your own in their territory. however when you have conquered it you get greater benefit than now. it also mean to conquer a system you need to get past the border posts. but also if you have a system that an enemy can block off you need to defend to sov 3 to get the ability to jf past the blockade.constructive comments please"
5/8/2009,"my opinion on these types of ""fixes"" to sov has always been ""if you want to play factional warfare, go play it.""and i don't see how this will cut down on ""lag blobs"" since it still behooves you to stack the system so you can defend the control point more easily."
5/8/2009,"i think sov. needs fixing (from what i hear, anyway. haven't experienced much of it myself) however, i don't think this is the way to do it. sorry."
5/8/2009,"to be honest, pos and sovreignity should be split."
5/8/2009,"the reality is moving to another model will be difficult without disrupting artificially what tens of thousands of pilots and years have built. nothing should be done lightly or with a broad brush.i am of the camp that the sov-model needs to be fixed with a scalpel not a battle-axe.i do however think our current pos model lends itself far more to manufacturing and storage facilities than as the focus point for 0.0 warfare. something needs to be done but we have to be careful how it is handled. fw/occupancy rules could theoretically be blended with the sov model (after all its that way in low-sec) and should be on the table, but not as an outright replacement. ammath for csm"
5/8/2009,"in a realistic situation a large ship with 6 or 8 gums shooting at a smaller fast moving manouverable ship would not fire all shots to exactly the same spot as happens in eve but spread them out to give a greater chance of hitting the target, and doing much more damage. with the weapon grouping such a skill, should be possible. i would expect it to be a high level skill, needing tracking and large gun,s to l5 and possibly advanced to l3 or 4, but it would help give a battleship pilot at least a chance of killing a few ships when attacked by a nano type gang. so a volly skill for guns and salvo for missiles is what i prepose"
5/8/2009,"wow, no support for a topic i can't seem to figure out the problem of. please lock.--isaac"
5/8/2009,"he's proposing the ability to aim your guns parallel to each other (so it's not possible for all of them to hit a small moving target, but more likely that at least one will hit the target), rather than focused, when aiming at a very hard-to-hit target. approximately that means more successful hits but a lot less potential damage per hit, with any kind of gun. which is handy for a battleship trying to damage a ship that it's nearly impossible to score a hit on.hmmm. maybe. it's potentially very unbalancing to the game if the effect is significant, but if the effect isn't significant, no one will bother to train such a high-level skill.i give this a provisional thumbs-up. creative and realistic idea. ccp might well reject it out of hand if it even gets that far though."
5/8/2009,"think flak cannons isaac.it's a fun idea for sure.but it has its draw backs.the odds of nailing a target with that kind of setup are even worse than my maelstrom nailing a frigate at 10km with 8 1400mm's thundering away.however.... if you had the skills to do a ""shotgun"" type of shot... with the damage ratings be balanced enough to say... oh... maybe only 1 to 8 of the shots nailing its target....and the skills increasing the probability of nailing a bulls-eye with all cannons?would be a fun way of using heavy firepower in a close range aspect.long range doesn't make sense as the laws of physcis (granted eve breaks them frequently) would say the further the shot the farther apart the spread making it rather useless.im not going to support this until its refined... but i'll be watching. :o)"
5/8/2009,"i like the general idea. (i also like the idea of flak cannons, but that's another subject.)i'd like to see some refinement of the proposal around the idea of making it acceptable while not overpowered.one potential problem is how would you turn it off? there are, after all times, when i want them to all fire at one place, not bracket my target."
5/8/2009,"thus the title says (proposal) not (issue).that wasn't hard to figure out, huh?"
5/8/2009,"well put simply.... treat it like a smart bomb.you don't necessarily have to target... you just need a general direction.so you target a ship in a general direction so the cannons point at the target... and open fire.and god help anyone between you and your target.as for turning it on or off... slave it to grouping controls. or a on off switch for ""shotgun"" mode or something."
5/8/2009,"howdy,i've been asking about flying in amarr t2 frigates, especially the malediction but every time i do, someone says that rockets are an awful weapon with serious problems. i'm not experienced enough to do the number crunching with this but the sheer number of replies suggest that something is wrong. perhaps someone with more experience could explain in detail what is wrong with them and why they sub-par compared with other light weapon systems such as lasers and auto cannons?"
5/8/2009,"i haven't used rockets in a long time, but i think that the main issue is the terrible dps. i think they need less range and more damage to fit with the 'unguided' missile group (rockets, hams, torps). to my knowledge rockets haven't been changed despite the introduction of hams and the changes to torps ages ago. not everyone wants to see their range nerfed, but without it i don't think they're going to add 'enough' damage to them because of balance."
5/8/2009,"for current fleets to move around numerous amounts of rigged and unpackaged ships in today's eve is highly annoying.a simple way to fix this would be to buff carriers... but that is unlikely as far as i see.i also support the transportation of rigged ships in cargo, but i believe this is an alternative if ccp doesn't like that option carriers today are too inefficient at this job, only able to hold 2 battleships at a time at mostwhat i purpose is a modified version of a jump freighter.this ship would not have any fitting slots, would warp & jump just as far as a jf, warp just as fast, and would even have the same hull as a jf.what would be unique about this ship is that all it can hold is ships, unpackaged only, in a special hold, called a ship bay, with a 15k general purpose cargo gold for modules and fuel. its ship bay capacity would be about 2.5 million m3, amd would only allow unpacked ships. capitals would not be allowed. also, since this ship would not be as versatile as a normal jf, it would have it's cost reduced to about 1.5b - 2b. the ship would require a new skill, capital transport ships, which would have the exact same prereq's as the jump frieghter skill, and would cost equally as much.unlike a carrier, it would not have a ship maintenance bay, and would therefore not allow fittings to be changed near it. also, it would not contain a corp hanger array inside either.this ship would enable nomadic use of fleets, without an overpowered ability to move entire fleets in one jump.it would also shift the emphasis of carriers to not be used as logistic vehicles, and instead the battle-centric ships that they are. with that in mind, however, it would still make carriers necessary for a good logistic team, and a viable option for those who cannot fly or afford a capital transport ship. it would also still give jf's and frieghters superiority for carrying conventional supplies, and packaged ships.overall, i believe this ship will enable logistic pilots the ability to move what is needed in a timely fashion, and a lot less fuel."
5/8/2009,you might consider looking at this thread:proposal to move rigged ships in cargo
5/8/2009,i like the idea of a specialized ship for transporting assembled smaller ships. i do not think it should have a jump drive. there are way too many jumping ships already. we need the risk of good old fashioned frieghter runs back.
5/8/2009,no.it would be better to allow the transportation of unpackaged ships in a freighter.with.. or without jump drive.unpackaged ships take up alot of space as it is.we don't need a new ship to do that when we have on already.
5/8/2009,"umm, last i checked a carrier does the same thing easily...or for high-sec orca. no reason for change.--isaac"
5/8/2009,"i'm of mixed opinions about rigged ships in cargo holds. they shouldn't be packagable. but i think a specialized ship that can haul rigged ships makes better sense.here's an extension of your idea: instead of a freighter with an internal ""ship bay,"" how about a tugboat? it hauls other ships on its exterior, dragging them in a line behind it. instead of calculating its hauling capacity in volume, it has a limit on the number of ships it can haul and the combined mass of ships it can haul. the tug's speed and maneuverability change depending on how much mass it is towing.the ships being towed must be vacant (so no hauling afk pilots this way). vacant ships can be placed in tow in stations only. the tug and all the ships it is hauling are each individually visible and targetable in space. if the tug is destroyed while hauling other ships, the other ships are left intact and adrift by the wreck.kralin, what do you think?"
5/8/2009,"the carrier can acomplish this task, yes, but not easily. for small to medium sized alliances that only have a few carriers at their disposal, but a numerous amount of battleships and support ships, attempting to relocate can take many jump and hundreds of millions in jump fuel as at most they can only hold 2 battleships at a time."
5/8/2009,"i have read and i swear i posted and supported it.. anyways, i agree with that topic, but this is not a duplicate thread, i am simply offering an alternativean interesting idea. while i like it in theory, i can also see it as a vast change to current hauling methods, and thus could be confusing. also, if the ui for this was anything less the awesome, i feel it could become quite frustrating in operation."
5/8/2009,"the current disparity between loading times of lasers and other weapon types is far from ideal.i understand the instant switch of crystals is intended as one of the benefits to the weapons system, but it is one of several factors that has lead to a a prevalent feeling that lasers are overpowered in direct comparisons with other weapons systems; taking into account cap use on bonus'd ships, t2 base damage and t2 cystals (the phrase 'scorch crystals online' ring any bells?)i don't want to nerf lasers, but i do want to shave the reloading times down from ten seconds to something better suited to the current environment of buffer tanks. in a hypothetical situation, where you have two bs doing each aprox. 1000dp/s, but one has to spend a 10 second reload time every 1.5 minutes it is easy to see that there is a huge disparity in damage output over time.at the extreme, the damage loss over time from reloading large artillery (tiny clip sizes) has contributed significantly to the weapon class consistently under performing against other long range weapons.i propose the introduction of a rank 1 mechanics skill, call it 'munitions logistics' or whatever. the skill reduces reload times for turrets and missiles (and alternative launchers), such that at lvl 5 it takes 5 seconds to reload.is this an issue of interest?"
5/8/2009,why is this constantly coming up? lasers are fine how they are. all other weapons are fine. (i play caldari too) its necessary. no support. no reason to change current mechanics.
5/8/2009,"you cannot compare a 1000 dps em/therm laser setup with a 1000 dps kin/therm railgun setup and neither is clearly better than the other, unless a lot of secondary effects are factored in. reload is not the only variable."
5/8/2009,bump.... remove the needless and arbitrary restriction on what ships can carry in the sma and just limit them to their base hold size before skills and expander mods to prevent maxed out industrials being used to haul.
5/8/2009,"yea, if you are taking a standing hit for anything you do in 0.0 it is a bug and should be reported as such."
5/8/2009,sup
5/8/2009,why? what was in the video?
5/8/2009,"the thing is, he seems to sacrifice so much for the sake of maintaining said neutrality that, in the final analysis, it is fairly unclear as to what erik finnegan actually purports to represent. given i) his reticence in posting here, his official campaign thread and ii) the monstrous heavy-handedness with which his partner ankhesempatankah operates on his behalf, i am of the opinion that he might well turn out to have the viability (once in office) and intra-council member charisma of a wet paper bag. i mean no disrespect, i merely use that example as an analogy, with no value judgements. i might be wide off the mark here, and if so - i apologise. however, given the fact that the poster above has had no answer from her questions (despite having to quote herself yet again), doesn't bode too well, in my mind."

5/8/2009,"this is my idea for faction warfare to make it more dynamic on basis-level. this is all of ideas i have to offer for faction warfare i'm afraid.note1: station and gate sentry guns should have no effect in faction warfare nor have anything to do with faction standings. they are for concord use only!note2: this is just a draft of what i was thinking. maybe not all makes sense etc. but it is just an idea!each faction has one region or constellation of no more than 10-15 systems. these systems are so called ""safe"" systems with 1,0 security status and are newbeginner system. basicly, the 10-15 systems consists of 1,0 which can not be taken. these systems are sovreignity 4 by default and can not be changed.each faction should have a number of statistics that can be influenced by the players; income, size, strength and systems.each system has a faction sovreignity (unsure of timeframe accomplish each level):sovreignity 0 means that the system is contested. each of the contesting factions has small to large miltia npc presens around their appropriate gates with the size (and strength) of the miltia dependent on faction treasury.sovreignity 1 means small militia npc presense around the system.sovreignity 2 means medium miltia npc presense around the system.sovreigntiy 3 means large miltia npc presense around the system aswell as enabling faction income from said system.sovreingity 4 means large milita npc presens around the system, militia npc commanders (those we hear about in the chronicles etc. etc.) and provides standard faction income.the income of each faction should be from player run agent missions aswell as additional systems owned/conquered by said faction. each system has an income modifier depending on their security status, the higher security status the higher income, 0,9 giving best income.the size of each faction should be from the players currently in the militia. the size determins an extra income multipler to compensate for the large size difference between the factions.e.g. random thingcaldari = 1000 = 2000/1000 = 2amarr = 250 = 2000/250 = 8minmatar = 250 = 2000/250 = 8gallente = 500 = 2000/500 = 4the strength of eact faction is dependent on income, size and systems in control.the income of said faction is used to determind the size and strength of militia npc. each militia npc lost drains the faction treasury by x amount. so for the players to weaken the other faction one can destroy their npc presense. when said faction has 0 treasury, npc's are weak and consist mainly of frigate squadrons.the sovreignity of said system is gained by player presense aswell as ""mini-plexes"" on each planet. these ""mini-plexes"" are just something to show that you are ""invading/conquering the planet"". max attainable sovreignity is 3. one can only contest a system which is next to a system said faction already owns, this due to faction logistics. -_-the ""mini-plexes"" are complexes on each planet in said system. these complexes contains ""planetery defense"" and ""planetary platforms"" in orbit. you are suppose to destroy these to be able to take the planet."

5/8/2009,"fw = pvplowsec=pvp0.0=pvpempire wardec=pvp i want that up there to start. the reason is that many people look at fw and say ""thats not real pvp"". others turn and say ""its not meant to be permanent pvp,its a stepping stone."". i feel both are extremely wrong. also any ccp worker that says anything along those lines needs to reexamine how eve works. i thought eve was about pvp of all sorts. not just lowsec or 0.0. not just jita market on certain items. not just in certain highsec systems. i thought pvp meant it was a long term feature. imagine if ccp announced that 0.0 is not meant to be long term pvp, instead you were all supposed to go into wormhole space and finally reach the pvp promised land? if fw is meant to be temporary pvp, at what point does it shut off? what is the planned date and time? clearly this limited pvp is not based upon sp as i have far more sp then new players. yet there are players in fw that have far more sp then i do. it is not based on isk, the same is true as the previous line. its not based on standings or any other form of measurement of some type of progress. at what point is pvp long term and valid and when does it become short term and invalid? why is lowsec valid pvp if 0.0 is ""better""? will we have people come out and say that lowsec is in fact invalid ,short term pvp? the same with empire wardecs. i know ccp nerfed the system to prevent alliance p from shooting up the damn place but at what point is their pvp completely invalid and meant to be short term? i was always under the impression that eve was a ""sandbox"". last time i was ever in a sandbox i never had anyone say ""hey rhino its time to move to the other corner of the sandbox, you've been here to long, we won't support your sand anymore."". if fw is meant to be a temporary thing then the idea of the ""sandbox"" is destroyed. if you scoff at such a thing, imagine if they decided that 0.0 regions were ""temporary"". what if it was your pvp that was crapped on? fw is valid. fw fills the gap in pvp that existed due to the differences in the other forms of pvp available. not everyone wants to be in 0.0, not everyone wants to pirate, not everyone is looking to start fights in empire. not everyone wants to be in a corp that tells them what to do but at the same time didn't want to be completely alone. not everyone wants to pick on targets that didn't want to be shot at. within fw you will find a range of players. from brand new players who just got the game to people that have done the 0.0 thing as well as former pirates. they all have their own reasons to be in fw and reasons why they are not looking to participate in the other forms of pvp. so while people say that only new players are in fw, they are wrong. those that say fw is dead, check the numbers. in the end fw is pvp. pvp is supposedly what eve is about. eve is also supposed to be about choice, not being shoved to another area of the sandbox or be berated for your choice of where you play. fw is also unique within pvp because we are working on behalf of the npc empires, not other players. i understand that ""unique"" means ""extra work"". personally i would expect ccp to be up to the challenge to offer us a really unique experience within each type of pvp style. saying one style of pvp is meant to be temporary sounds like an excuse to not do some work, aka, taking the easy way out. i thought that was for mmo clones?"
5/8/2009,"actually i did mention continued development and support for old content as my primary concern. this includes, but isn't limited to fw. as for your other questions yes i have and still do participate in fw in an ancillary way on my main and fully on my alt. as a director of star fraction and as an active fc and combat pilot within that organisation i have participated on the fringes of fw for almost as long as it has existed. whilst not being directly involved in fw on heartstone i have a factional warfare alt in one of the militias who i use to gain a better understanding of the mechanics. as a sf pilot i also fly alongside factional warfare pilots quite often and have a good relationship with many of you. i think that this relationship is the key to unlocking factional warfare further for you.i would like for you to consider voting for me in the upcoming elections for one simple reason. that reason is you. whilst i absolutely will not be biased towards one militia or another in my deliberations as a csm member should i be voted on my main source of information in regards to the problems and possible advances in fw that could be implements would, in all likelihood, come from my daily interaction with the militis. a few people have already given me their thoughts both from the minmatar militia and from the amarr militia but those are just a few. i will be immersed in the issues i am trying to solve for you.factional warfare is one area that ccp announced and then seemingly let stagnate. if you chose not to vote for me then fair enough i'm not the only good candidate out there that deserves votes but any that come my way would be appreciated."
5/8/2009,"i guess i am one of those that has faction warfare on my ""very bottom of the pile of things"". however, i still have some views and ideas. check my csm thread to see."
5/8/2009,you could list both: the raw numbers and seperately the normalized ones. what do you think?
5/8/2009,"that could work, but the whole point of this is to be stripped-down. to normalize 4 numbers from 1-10 is something players can do themselves, i think it adds more clutter than information. also, i've got a couple more answers - fully half the candidates have gotten back to me now - so i'm updating the chart."
5/8/2009,"nice, but you forgot to add roleplay."
5/8/2009,"ccp seems to like to promote that in eve, this ever changing universe, is influenced and changed by the players, and our actions. this is true for o.o, but unfortunatly, from what i see, this is not the case for low sec or high sec. as an example. in faction warfare, we have many corperations, 1000's of pilots all fighting for their respective factions, but in the end, if even one faction ever conquers the enemies turf, nothing will respectively happen.as a csm what will you guys do to try to change this so ccp can stand true to their word that the players do in fact change the course of the game in all situations."
5/8/2009,"tough question and no real good way of answering without hurting your popularity with someone.ccp owns the game and has a strategic vision of the game and how it should evolve. factored into that is how the game is played by the players, but sometimes ccp has to make hard, unpopular choices to balance the game or bring it back to their vision to keep it a growing and successful game that we can all play for years to come.basically having all the different play-styles of eve represented, powerblocks, pirates, empire folks, small-alliances, etc is the most important piece to make sure ccp hears from all groups in how the game is played so they do not get a skewed perception.ammath for csm"
5/8/2009,as ammath said it is a tough question but not because one might loose some popularity but because of the question of balance and the role of the csm. in regards to factional warfare it is one area i am very interested in ccp spending some time and resources in developing along with other projects they have seemed to have released and then let drop by the wayside in favor of more shiny things. the lack of material benefits for the capture of a system seems a little bit out of balance with other activities in eve. if i was elected though it is important to realise however that as a csm rep i would not become a junior games designer so some such equivalent for ccp but an advocate of the what the players would like to see. as such i have my own ideas as to what benefit you could theoretically get from capturing systems (personally i would like for it to make logistics harder for the enemy faction by denying or limiting docking rights and associated costs going up in the enemy captured systems) but as a csm rep i would putting forward those ideas from the community of players that seem both balanced and appropriate to solve the issues at hand. so what would i do for you? i would support you. i would bring your ideas to the table and see that ccp took note of them. heartstone (p.s. nice to see out outside of igs invelious ;) )
5/8/2009,"they want the game to still be playable for everyone. and the fact is, faction warfare only represents capsuleer combat. the empires still have their respective npc navies that we hear about only in chronicles and storyline events; however, don't you think that if a gallente fw fleet tried to take jita, the caldari would bring the hammer down with great prejudice?there are some of us who are, by standings, kos in certain empires. if 1 or 2 empires suddenly conquered all of eve, what would happen to those people who are kos?this kind of system works in games like pirates of the burning sea because a) the maps reset once one team has obtained victory and b) there are no serious consequences for docking at a 'hostile' port. a map reset would completely break the immersion in eve, and the removal of personal consequences would eliminate whatever was left of the originality of eve. and even in pirates of the burning sea, there are some ports that are simply uncapturable, specifically national capitals, newb towns, and market hubs.the fact is, when you get down to it (and i've said this before in relation to npc interaction), we are capsuleers. revered. immortal. elite. there are, comparatively speaking, not very many of us. no matter how fabulously wealthy or insanely influential we are... we cannot, alone, define the direction of empires of trillions of people. influence? yes. define? no. faction warfare is an interesting mechanic that offers game-supported roleplay pvp. but it will never be a mechanism to support full-on conquest."
5/8/2009,"ok, so most will agree the current sov rules are out dated, cause lag blobs and mean that there is quite a lot of luck involved in pos warfare i.e. stronting to the right level, kiting pos's to try and get the end of rf in your alliances prime etc etc etc.therefore how about this as a proposal for candidates to mull over. have a game mechanic based upon the fps domination game system. where you have points in the system you have to capture but once to have captured them (through whatever the decided mechanic is) the sov begins to turn to you. once you have sov at level 1 then small gate guns are onlined automatically in your favour and small pos's can be placed, sov 2 medium gate guns plus medium pos's can be placed, sov 3 large gate guns plus ewar and large towers can be placed plus the cyno jammers etc.etc. i this way you need to conquer a system in order to benefit from it. you can't just kill an enemy r64 and place your own in their territory. however when you have conquered it you get greater benefit than now. it also mean to conquer a system you need to get past the border posts. but also if you have a system that an enemy can block off you need to defend to sov 3 to get the ability to jf past the blockade.constructive comments please"
5/8/2009,"my opinion on these types of ""fixes"" to sov has always been ""if you want to play factional warfare, go play it.""and i don't see how this will cut down on ""lag blobs"" since it still behooves you to stack the system so you can defend the control point more easily."
5/8/2009,"i think sov. needs fixing (from what i hear, anyway. haven't experienced much of it myself) however, i don't think this is the way to do it. sorry."
5/8/2009,"to be honest, pos and sovreignity should be split."
5/8/2009,"the reality is moving to another model will be difficult without disrupting artificially what tens of thousands of pilots and years have built. nothing should be done lightly or with a broad brush.i am of the camp that the sov-model needs to be fixed with a scalpel not a battle-axe.i do however think our current pos model lends itself far more to manufacturing and storage facilities than as the focus point for 0.0 warfare. something needs to be done but we have to be careful how it is handled. fw/occupancy rules could theoretically be blended with the sov model (after all its that way in low-sec) and should be on the table, but not as an outright replacement. ammath for csm"
5/8/2009,there are a lot of independent non-powerblock voters in eve... really if you want your voices heard and your votes to count... you should vote for the people with the best chance of actually supporting your enjoyment of the game.silly and idealistic i know. but that's how i roll.ammath for csm
5/8/2009,"my answer is no, but i would like to know how you would propose to make contract scamming impossible."
5/9/2009,"not much needs to be said, everything have been said already"
5/9/2009,i support the 4th bonus
5/9/2009,"you're absolutely not wrong about the omen - my shield omen hits harder, aligns faster and has more ehp than my buffered retri. coming from fw though, there is a key point about them (and similar af's) that makes me nervous about having another bonus.against cruisers and higher - the other day part of my fleet that i was with caught a rupture at a gate. the pilot either realised that his chances of escape were slim or thought to make a fight of it, but either way turned his attention to my little retribution - which sat there and laughed as his guns nibbled fitfully at my buffer. had i been in my omen i'd have been a mite more concerned. battleships are the same story.against frigs and destroyers - this is the main bonus in my view - good dps and more than twice the scan res of the omen means that frigs, and even inties melt almost as soon as a few of these appear on the field. when warping a fleet into battle, i often give the order for weapons free on small ships before we consolidate on a primary a) because seeing 4-5 enemy ship simultaneously detonate 5 seconds after you've loaded grid is very very cool and b) nothing demoralises a fleet like having a quarter of their number in pods before their fc has finished saying what the primary target isretributions work especially well in this kind of role because of the advantages of scorch ammo, and if they are hit first, they last a lot longer than, say, a thrasher in the same role.in small-medium gang knife fights like this then, when paired with interceptors, assault frigs of all flavours (except maybe the caldari ones) really shine, and i'm concerned that any bonus you could add would make them a little blinding. consider the options for boosting:ehprepdpsspeedsig radspeed first. yes there is a case for making ab's more effective on af's, but either the boost is insubstantial or we're in the realms of reaching the speed of an ab inty, and we justify that?sig rad. af's are already a bugger to hit for solo targets. i'm not sure we can argue that one.dps. yes i know - the vengence. still let's wait for the rockets boost for that one. the others though all do good solid (and in some cases insane) dps. i don't think we have a case for making them even more potent in this department.rep. my instinct is that the vengence is probably as good as we want to go on this. making the other tackle af's match that is probably the best we can do, and that can best be done by tweaking existing bonuses rather than adding new onesehp. most af can already almost field the ehp of a light cruiser, with the aforementioned buggerness to hit. i don't think we can justify any more.there framework for discussion laid out."
5/9/2009,"excellent post foolish bob! i've seen you flying around in your vengeance btw i'll say hello next time.ok, so, you have perfectly valid concers, and i think to be honest the only way to address them is on a case by case basis. please forgive the eft warrioring here first of all, i'm basing this on the idea that assault ships/frigates should be to cruisers as heavy assault ships/hacs are to battlecruisers. smaller and faster but with similar dps and tank, in exchange for a lot more isk. given the popularity of hacs in guerilla warfare style attacks, this is definitly worth the isk. however when people want to do the same thing in frigate hulls, it seems taranises and stealth bombers are the way to go (for further reading join the channel ""garmonism"" ). note i've used fits from shc/battleclinic to try and keep all examples used reasonable.with that established, i'm going to compare assault frigs as the are now to cruisers, and do the same with hacs and battlecruisers. i want to look at the harpy first. as already stated, i believe it should get the %5 resists per level in common with every other caldari railboat. this would give it the same 4 bonus as the eagle.[harpy, blaster ]damage control iimagnetic field stabilizer ii1mn afterburner iifaint epsilon warp scrambler ipatterned stasis web imedium f-s9 regolith shield inductionlight ion blaster ii, caldari navy antimatter charge slight ion blaster ii, caldari navy antimatter charge slight ion blaster ii, caldari navy antimatter charge slight ion blaster ii, caldari navy antimatter charge s[empty high slot]anti-em screen reinforcer ianti-em screen reinforcer iusing all level 5 we get 210 dps, just under 10k ehp and a cost of 47 mil isk according to eft.[moa, blaster]damage control iimagnetic field stabilizer iimagnetic field stabilizer iimagnetic field stabilizer ii10mn microwarpdrive ij5b phased prototype warp scrambler ilarge shield extender iiinvulnerability field iiheavy electron blaster ii, caldari navy antimatter charge mheavy electron blaster ii, caldari navy antimatter charge mheavy electron blaster ii, caldari navy antimatter charge mheavy electron blaster ii, caldari navy antimatter charge mheavy electron blaster ii, caldari navy antimatter charge mmedium nosferatu ii[empty rig slot][empty rig slot][empty rig slot]hobgoblin ii x3this gives 410 dps, 25k ehp and a cost of around 24 mil isk, after insurance.so for twice the price, you're getting 51% of the dps, and 39% of the ehp. this seems ok, but now lets look at the eagle and ferox:[eagle, blaster]damage control iimagnetic field stabilizer iimagnetic field stabilizer iimagnetic field stabilizer iiy-t8 overcharged hydrocarbon i microwarpdrivej5b phased prototype warp scrambler ilarge shield extender iilarge shield extender iiinvulnerability field iiheavy electron blaster ii, caldari navy antimatter charge mheavy electron blaster ii, caldari navy antimatter charge mheavy electron blaster ii, caldari navy antimatter charge mheavy electron blaster ii, caldari navy antimatter charge mheavy electron blaster ii, caldari navy antimatter charge mmedium nosferatu iianti-em screen reinforcer ianti-em screen reinforcer i438 dps and 58k ehp for a cool 143 mil isk.i'll continue in another post with the ferox.."

5/9/2009,give them their 4th bonus
5/9/2009,"i don't accept your comparison: hac's and bc's are both anti-cruiser platforms, with an option to providing dps on other targets. a cruiser is not an anti-frig platform - that's the role of destroyers, inties and af (and ofc frigs), so whereas hac's and bc's operating in a similar battlespace (if we can coin that term) should be equivalent, i would argue that there's no such requirement for af's wrt cruisers.in those terms then i think that any boost has to be made on its own merit for the role an af has - which is not to say that 5% resists on the caldari af wouldn't go amiss - indeed anything that makes them more worthwhile would be welcome. but we can't use cruisers as justification imo."
5/9/2009,"i fully understand what you're saying. it is very hard to discuss balance for afs when there is nothing to really compare them against. in my mind the question is this: i have 100 mil isk to spend, should i spend it on 2 afs or 4 cruisers? take the example of a well setup and flown rupture. you could take on any other cruiser frigate or af and kill it. on the other hand, when you're flying an af, you first of all can forget about taking on a decent drone boat. then anytime you engage something, you're rolling the dice. if they start dropping ecm drones, or hit you with a neut or two, thats it. game over.i accept this. no ship should be unbeatable in every circumstance. far from it. but the range of situations where an af can be used without getting laughed at and blown to pieces is quite limited. because of this, i want them to shine in their niche role. vagabond, deimos, these ships are absolutely awesome at what they do, are they overpowered? no, they're t2 ships, thats how they should be. why are afs not? they're ok at their job. butwhen you pay 40+ mil isk for a frigate hull, ok isn't really enough."
5/9/2009,"i would like to see this happen along with more wallet divisions. basically, just more tools to separate and organize your stuff."
5/9/2009,"bumping an important thread.also, anyone have links to previous proposals where this was brought up? it'd be interesting to see how many people want this."

5/9/2009,agreed.
5/9/2009,"if you have discovered a means of getting corp/alliance members to agree that nothing in the entire world of eve is more interesting than watching miners work while guarding them from pirates and belt rats please share that method.hiring guards costs isk. i'll mine in low-sec only when i can be certain that i'll make more isk than in high sec after paying the guards and accounting for ship, clone, implant, and cargo losses."
5/9/2009,/signed. this would make mining alot more interested when combined with other things.
5/9/2009,"humm, i dunno if this is exactly the best idea, but i do know that mining needs a revamp.i was thinking that adding a new type of asteroid, just like veldspar, only higher yield, to 0.0 might help with the trit imbalance. it's kind of annoying to be sitting in 0.0 and the most valuable ore you have to mine is veldspar. no joke!i'm thinking something along the lines of a 200% or 300% boost to the amount of trit per m3 as compared to veld. while right now that much trit would be worth almost as much as the abc asteroids, it would go down very fast, and balance out to likely around the ghhj level, which is where it should be, for a low end 0.0 asteroid.i'll support the idea anyway, mainly because mining needs a revamp, rather then because i think this is the best idea...."
5/9/2009,i would mine.

5/9/2009,"you are correct, there were conflicts in pf before t0nyg - but finally hammering out those isn't the issue. the issue is that t0nyg, who has proven he can't be trusted with pf, has announced he going to be doing some retconning. the only retconning that he should be doing is on his own material. the only people trust worthy enough to touch anything written before 2006 are abraxas and ginger. waiting for the changes is just silly because once ccp make a decision they stick by it and their people even if it was a bad one."
5/9/2009,"the concern is that the retcon will make changes to material that should have been used to write later material. example: the scorpion, according to in-game material(presumably from when the game was released) is very new, newer than the raven.in ruthless (written by tonyg) the raven is 'brand' new and the scorpion an established ship/workhorse of the caldari navy.the issue is a concern that instead of correcting more recent material (that should have drawn on the previous material to begin with), the older material will be changed to make what more recent authors have written the ""correct"" versions.making ccp aware of the concern before they make ""exactly what they are changing"" known.asking ""hey, why did you not change ruthless instead of the in-game description concerning the scorpion?"" after they have already done so is going to result in ccp going ""we made everything consistent, be happy! we don't care if we changed the older source!""we don't want ccp to do what lucasarts did."
5/9/2009,everything has been said already
5/9/2009,fully supported. please let ginger be the lead on this one
5/9/2009,"you're right the op didn't say anything about tech 2 battleships......but her second post suggested that she originally intended the idea to be a tech 2 bs.it's okay to want something and create a proposal for it, but as ive already said you have to think carefully about what the other races will get in return.if the op was suggesting it to be a faction ship they wanted then there would also need to be a khanid cruiser and frig......though im sure somebody already said that before.if you look at the faction shiptypes currently they all have mixed race bonuses.....well there are 3 gallente and 3 minmatar, but only 2 for amarr and caldari so why not make the khanid faction shiptypes have bonuses to caldari and amarr, then perhaps make them proficient in missiles and drones as thats the only hole that remains.again though ccp will have to balance this right and make sure it fits in with the storyline."
5/9/2009,even if it was just a repainted apoc with torps instead of lasers i'd still like this idea. doesn't need any fancy t2 / faction bonuseses.
5/9/2009,"i'd love to see a khanid bs. i think it was mentioned as a possibility when the khanid ships were all overhauled, but no word since then. i can't decide which would look cooler, a khanid apoc or a khanid abaddon"
5/9/2009,"we already have two t2 battleships, and both have the pve role and the pvp role down. a 2nd type of marauder would serve no purpose, especially if it were pvp oriented(too expensive, rather have a cap etc.).i think that with the need of improvement with factional warfare, six new faction ships could be introduced, all with a new look, preferably, they would only be purchasable with fw merits(or whatever they have over there)i propose 6 co-designed ships purchasable from a fw store:2 frigates: a minmatar-gallente hybrid and a caldari-amarr hybrid2 cruisers: a minmatar-gallente hybrid and a caldari-amarr hybrid2 battleships: a minmatar-gallente hybrid and a caldari-amarr hybridthis would not only give a point to factional warfare, but also give new shiny hybrid ships. you want an armor tanked missile bs? you got it. and all sorts of other wacky crazy hybrid stuff."
5/9/2009,"they should just turn the redeemer into a khanid ship. black ops where a caldari invention, the other races just copied the idea.wouldn't it make sense, that the khanid translate this caldari tech into an amarr hull ?"
5/9/2009,this is my wet dream.
5/9/2009,"the ui is falling to peaces, many controls and displays are inconsistent, many features just don't work (focus fire drones for example), many core functions could use overhauling and new bugs smell of horribly inter meshed spaghetti code.so i would propose forgoing new content and instead focusing on rewriting the current code base so that tweaking thing a doesn't always break things c and d.some examples of the problems currently are: the pos code all in a single class, when it could be easily modularized per pos module (see the dev blog about the pos exploit), the cargohold/container/hangar code is said to be too fragile to differentiate bpc's form bpo's, some containers seem to use different mechanics for adding/removing stuff than others (atleast the orca cargohold was bugged, but no other ships were affected the same (a container class should use the same methods to do the same things in all cases...) etc.i for one don't see the value of adding a bucketload of new features when we need to wait months afterwards for all the things they broke to get fixed (ifaik some outposts still have their manufacturing slots messed up from apocrypha 1.0)"
5/9/2009,"the bpc/bpo issue is due to the database setup and double the database lookups required to view containers in eve. it's not a ui issue. ccp has, for good reason, determined that database changes are not a good thing and they are trying to avoid them at any cost because a database structure change could very easily break pretty much everything in eve or cause incredible performance losses until they rewrite every bit of it to use the new database.on the rest of your suggestion: i like bug fixes. polishing some of the ""old"" stuff like scanning before trying to put new shiny things out there would be great. the downside is that mmos operate like a treadmill: if new stuff stops coming up, players start to outrun the game and eventually take off for greener pastures so a certain amount of new, shiny stuff is required now and then."
5/9/2009,"well, some new content would be required, i agree to that, but i rather have less new content that works than more half-thought half-working new content and old features broken.a rewrite of the core functionality would almost certainly lead to more maintainable codebase and thus make it easier to add new features in the future without breaking everything. also with cleanly modularized code ccp could add unit tests for the core functionality to catch the worst bugs and exploits before the code hits the live servers.being a master of tech student with cs minor i can tell that rewrites almost always lead to better, faster and less buggy code, but the rewrite takes time and marketing droids are scared of devoting developer time into something that doesn't add anything new now, just makes adding the new stuff in the future way easier and kills a ton of bugs in the process.also a quick fix to the bpo/bpc issue would be to just make bpo:s be a different item type in the db, so you don't need to do a join to get the ""is this orginal?"" bit from the db, just the same kind of query as with other displayed item types, implementing this shouldn't be to hard and migrating the existing db to the new item id's shouldn't be rocket science (no schema changes needed, just new item id's). (now: item id x = bp of item y, item has in it's db entry field if it's orginal or not, new = item x = bpc of item y, item z = bpo of item y, you can even keep the legacy is this orginal field in the db..., just change the icon of item type z)."
5/9/2009,"rendering of pages is very slow. this is true not only with the integrated browser interface but also with the character log-on screen news column and with agent interactions. perhaps there's a way to test what the real problem is. it could be the browser, the user's isp throttling content based on type or address, or even ccp doing the same. who knows? whatever the case, you have a good point, gduran."
5/9/2009,such a great idea implemented sooo bad
5/9/2009,i support this motion.-- s

5/9/2009,"i support this, sorting through drones can be such a hassle."
5/9/2009,"i actually hate trolling and some other people do too, especially around this environment which has got extreme high caldari kiddie trolls.~as you might know, the internet meaning of 'french' often was meant as coward, wine & cheese people, french bread (etc) and of course in our universum: gallente. the main problem with the gallente history lore is that it might actually demotivate (new) people from joining the gallente, because of the french thing. it also results during the game that people are being trolled and especially at fw, for obvious reasons. (read: easily surrendering, dont-carebears and vastly outnumbered by adhd consuming caldari-state kiddies.)i advise for the future that the french nationality must be changed to something else less... french-ish.i am joe and i was this late night very drunk, sorry if i messed some things up.plus a doesn't-work-on-yourself support thumb-up. (right?)~joe"
5/9/2009,don't know if troll

5/9/2009,ebay entry - french whine for saleopened once...seriously... what is this about?
5/9/2009,"heh, it's good to hear ccp is thinking about this! i would love to see something like this. reconnecting to lost drones would be great, doesn't matter if it's because eve crashed, your little sister hit the power button on your computer, or because you cloaked your ship without calling in the drones first. any and all ways of disconnecting to drones, you should be able to connect back to them."
5/9/2009,would be handy after a reconnect/extreme lagin every other situation i have no problem to pay for my carelessness/unawareness (it's eve after all)
5/9/2009,"damn, agreeing with neb' here +1"
5/9/2009,"i have a proposal, read your contracts before accepting. no amount of special colors will make a damn difference if you don't read it."
5/9/2009,"as it's been stated before, the csms do not represent the general playerbase. they only represent their own personal issues, those that either directly or indirectly benefit their corp or alliance mates, or whatever fotm issue everyone is complaining about just to get the votes.once elected, they become nothing more than parrots sitting on ccps shoulder. repeating everything they say.if the general playerbase has an issue they want addressed, they must completely bypass the csms."
5/9/2009,"i'm not sure what is busted about mining. i don't know how big of a change normal wardecs could possibly need, i know i've mentioned things that won't get implemented though they would resolve the problem of people attempting to evade wardecs. does ccp have a full workload? i should hope so and i'm sure they are doing their best with what they have. however that in no way means i should be patient and just sit back and not say anything about it.the way i saw the csm was that these were democratically elected representatives of the playerbase. just like in rl, sometimes certain things are given a higher priority then things that would better suit the whole. people vote for those that will represent them and help get what they want changed, changed. so while i completely understand your answer i will have to say that i completely disagree with the idea of sitting back and saying nothing. i make it a habit of voting in rl and try to rally other people that i know to vote, not in favor of what i am voting for but just to go out and vote and get heard instead of shrugging and doing nothing. so my statement stands that the csm candidates do not represent me and all of the other fw players out there. if i see no one that represents my interest then my vote will stay with me. this isn't a case of ""well my guy is/isn't going to win so why waste time voting"". instead it is that no one is representing a single thing that i am interested in. sure some say they stand for pvp but then they go and say 0.0 . to me that means they represent 0.0 pvp and maybe the changes they push for will trickle down to the rest of us. as for the idea that all csm members end up being parrots, i don't know. its entirely possible that they are nothing more then puppets in a false ""democratic"" system designed to ""represent"" the playerbase. so until i see a pro-fw candidate that has ideas of his own and a will to get fw pushed forward on the list of things ccp wants to do, i have no candidate. while fw may not have as many players as 0.0, it does not mean we should go without a voice. saying such is equal to suggesting that minority groups in the u.s. should wait until the government has finished working on all of the stuff the majority wants done. until then sit there and stay silent. we may or may not be the minority of the pvp crowd of eve but we still deserve a voice, to be represented on equal footing with the 0.0 crowd. until i see anyone step up and make actual commitments, i see the candidates as being a vanilla group of mass produced clones that have nothing more then an avatar to distinguish them from the others."
5/9/2009,cyprus black does not represent the general player-base.
5/9/2009,"you are correct, i do not represent the general playerbase. but then again i never said i did."
5/9/2009,your tone says otherwise.the csm can speak for themselves.
5/9/2009,"someone correct me if i'm wrong, but i could have sworn this feature was in the game years ago and vanished after a patch or expansion a long time ago.like around castor/exodus. either way, let's have it!"
5/9/2009,"+1, this should have been implemented years ago."
5/9/2009,"should behave exactly like refining imho. (select multiple items -> repair, to hangar and repair, etc)(it would be neat if you only get the option to repair something on damaged items - if it doesn't increase database load by a measurable amount ofc)"
5/9/2009,"the easiest and simplest ""fix"" would be to move sov from moons to planets. it's not that pos warfare is horrible, it's that there's so ****ing much of it required."
5/9/2009,or do like ccp is planning to do:
5/9/2009,"echoing sentiment of fellow pilots in that the idea seems too rough. i really do agree however, with a market-esque contract system or at least some massive overhaul to the functionality of the current one.as for the elimination of the autolinking of contracts in local, i think that might be a bit too brash. while i hate the spam, sometimes you actually do hit a gem of a contract that someone throws out in local that isn't 999,999,999 isk.then again... with a vastly improve contract system you might be able to find those gems much more easily, and without necessitating someone posting it in local.however, i'm not sure which side of the fence i am on with that issue specifically to be honest. i like the fact that people can advertise their contract much more directly by autolinking it. i don't like spam.i think we need to harvest more ideas on removing spam, but i'm not sure if the removal of autolinking contracts is the way to go. now maybe, we could have a color change for contracts that exceed a certain market/contract average. possibly have the contract average based upon jita?so if you autolink a contract in local and it exceeds the average, the autolink color will be red, and if it falls under the average it will be green.even this idea will not eliminate spamming though. all that would really do is make scamming just a bit harder, and i don't really see a need for that.tough calls, but lets see what some other people come up with."
5/9/2009,"i support the revamp of the contract system.i don't want to derail, but didn't ccp wanted to introduce the ""storefront"", a new corp-based contracting station service? around qr? what if they roll the two ideas together?"
5/9/2009,"the contract search should be improved. 1. i do not like this. linking contracts is very neat, esp in corp/alliance chat and (somewhat) local2. simply no. market and contracts are totally different things."
5/9/2009,i support this topic. i think it will be a very good step towards making battleships the winsauce they deserve to be.
5/9/2009,"thanks for the clarification. although an idea like that has some merit, don't we have enough ""smartbombs"" as it is? an intriguing idea, but one that i feel that is not needed atm. --isaac"
5/9/2009,"using a ""firing solution"" would better than just picking a direction, because of the massive ammount of vectors of approach available in 3d space, using a firing solution will also cause you to never bring all your guns to bear on the target, so it wouldn't be too overpowered.maybe someone far better than me at math can tell us how many different ""directions"" there could be just using degrees, mils would be a bloody nightmare."
5/9/2009,explosion velocity 127.5for a weapon that's designed to be used against frigates that's far too low.
5/9/2009,"so why don't you just move your battleships with pilots and in fleets? i still fail to see why we should make it easier and safer to move logistical stuff. if you don't have the technology, then fleet up and move it down altogether. our corp has worked just fine with this method, i'm pretty sure your alliance can do the same.--isaac"
5/9/2009,"i like the idea - you've given it some thought. but i don't think there is a need for the change if i'm honest, speaking as a minmatar pilot.on the battlefield these days, i've noticed there is a rather even number off each race, atleast in terms of battleships, compared to how things used to be. admittedly i think there's a fair few more gallente ships than others, but not a huge amount. and as that's the case, i think any change in reload times would just incur a further increase for those races whilst amarr pilots slip back in the pecking order.ccp have the game relatively well-balanced at the moment i'd say (missiles definately need some love though, but that discussion is for another time).however, i think it's worth discussing the topic. i think the skill would have to be rank 3 or 4 though, so it would take some effort to reduce your reload time."
5/9/2009,"here is why i don't support any changes to missiles:(yes, i realize its one weapon system that you talked about)you are immune to most e-war effects. only fear is jamming. you have no optimal range. just a range.can shoot at weakest resists. so guess what, lasers:affected by all e-war effects. have to constantly change crystals to stay in optimal.only have em/therm as their damage options.so there is why reloading is there. you would be too overpowered otherwise.--isaac"
5/9/2009,"i know heartstone, and really think highly of his opinions, so know how i'll be voting."
5/9/2009,"thanks for you comment james. in regards to docking mechanincs i am sure that there is no pvp player out there who hasn't at one time or another been frustrated with the ability to play docking games. at the same time i am also sure there isn't a pvper out there who hasn't saved his own bacon by using th mechanic. i personally feel from a rp perspective and a ""dark gritty universe"" perspective that it should be made harder to redock once you have committed to undocking. at the same time though there needs to be some way to establish if you should undock or not. people joke about having portholes in stations to look out of but it isn't far from the truth. why these giant behemoths of stations can't tell you what is outside them is beyond me. it is possible that a pre-launch scanner could be introduced. a very short range scanner (say 20km circle around the undock port) with a skill attached to increase the range. or maybe the answer is to have undocking and docking ports being separate cones on the station with the same scanning mechanics brought into play. i would certainly like to see something done about the whole docking games side of eve pvp."
5/9/2009,"i have updated my ops to give you another view onto my agenda, issues which i want to push, as they are my personal interest."
5/9/2009,"a heavily biased opinion usually comes from a heavily biased person. these people don't get far with most people, and the people they do get somewhere with are usually of ""easily swayed"" caliber.i myself am very often biased in my opinion, and i feel that leaving my personal feelings aside, it becomes much easier to negotiate with people. and that's what the csm do, they negotiate on behalf of the players. a biased opinion has no place in such negotiations. that just proved that you are trying to negotiate for yourself.ccp isn't usually swayed easily. they only take biased opinions in to account if there is substantial evidince to back it up, or if there is enough support for what's being proposed. some of the things i would like the csm to bring forward is mainly supported by the not so loud majority of eve. people who can't be bothered logging on to the forums because they're sick of reading the loud minority's repetitive posts.thus i believe erik is a good candidate to represent my needs."
5/9/2009,much better could you elaborate more on 'lowsec incentivizing' and particularly on the balance of risk vs' reward between highsec and lowsec specifically (not taking into account 0.0)?
5/9/2009,i read your interview you did with hallan turrek with some interest erik. it is nice to find out there is another candidate who is strongly into rp in eve. what is your take on the instances of pf contradiction specifically such inconsistencies as the wetgrave contradiction?
5/9/2009,i just appreciate your stance fixing the current system before new features are added.so... all of my new ideas... those are really just fixes to the existing system.
5/9/2009,"as a long time pirate myself, i'd like to offer my support to any pirate who can provide input and the ""alternative viewpoint"" to ccp.firstly, what are your thoughts on the unsettling trend that allows care bears to warp cloaked in transports...what's next, a cloak-warping freighter? it has become very difficult for those of us ""trapped"" in low sec to get great loot from any player with half a brain, as just about anyone can more or less enter a low sec system with impunity.secondly, i object to the fact that low sec status players cannot even enter high sec in a ship. real criminals walk the streets in r/l every day. we should be afforded the same treatment, but if we do something silly, concord should be able to have a 60%-80% (roll the dice) shot at catching and killing us...much like real life. it certainly would make the game more interesting for pirates, and certainly help eliminate the macro using miners and afk players who get richer by the day. let's keep the care bears on their toes i say!lastly, rather than nerfing falcons, i like the idea about an anti-jamming skill to train. it would also be nice to add an additional rig slot to every ship hat can only fit an anti-jamming rig of some sort. that may even the playing field for those who will dedicate time to training and who are not afraid to spend the extra iskies, without nerfing the falcon."
5/9/2009,"fw is one of the main points of erik's campaign.also, there has been an other thread about this, which provides some additional answers of some of the candidates."
5/9/2009,you can also find a more recent thread here which is ostensibly about fw.
5/9/2009,"i have begun work on the interviews. they are being posted daily on my blog..i actually believe i've gotten about three quarters of the candidates and more are coming in every day.go, read."
5/9/2009,*sniff* *boo-hoo* you need to ask.
5/9/2009,"wasn't so much ""forgetting"" as ""not knowing what to ask"". i can't ask how familiar people are with it, because it's an attitude, not a skill set. i can't ask how much people like it, because so far as i can tell, most people have about the same feelings on the topic - it should be better, but it shouldn't interfere too much with normal gameplay. there's no real contentious issues, like there is with local and t1 loot, and there's no general consensus of it being terrible like there is with sovereignty and lowsec. it's a broader field than i would really like to leave untouched in this kind of survey, but there was no real question i could think of to ask about it. also, given that better than half the candidates have answered, it's a bit late to change the questions now."
5/9/2009,"the easiest and simplest ""fix"" would be to move sov from moons to planets. it's not that pos warfare is horrible, it's that there's so ****ing much of it required."
5/9/2009,or do like ccp is planning to do:
5/9/2009,"> the fact she's a girlalthough this being her ""selling point"", is debatable from what i've seen."
5/10/2009,"i used to have a job porting a menu driven pc game to playstation i & ii. it's a harder thing to implemement than you think - each and every menu will have to be messed with to get it right, involving surprising man hours.however - it needs doing. i have ""perfect"" vision. i have also just bought a 40"" lcd tv. i'm also a returning eve player who's been away for three years. i have to run the game in 1368x768 to be able to play it without straining my eyes lots, which sucks (add in the antialiasing issue and it's a real ball ache that you pay for monthly ).in this day and age, there are going to be a lot more folk with big screens requiring high rezzes like me appearing every day. i know it's not as simple a thing to do as it sounds, but please ccp, you are going to have to do it sooner or later, and you'd make a lot of people happy by doing it sooner."
5/10/2009,"font don't matter as much, new font size would be vary welcome.i love my eyes ccp, why don't you?"
5/10/2009,"there used to be an unofficial fix for this, i was using 14 point verdana for the main ui font. no major issues with screen layout or the rest.there is no valid reason for keeping your players from being able to read the screen easily."
5/10/2009,"agreed, big monitors are getting more common and the font problems dont help"
5/10/2009,/signed
5/10/2009,"larger sized font, yes please. maybe it's time for a new, more legible one as well. in descriptions and such, the current body font can easily become a wall of grey-ish things. the content does not exactly jump at you in the way the text of a book might (or might not).also, since eve is larger menu driven, it's not always the easiest thing to quickly find the option you want with the current font.as for choosing our own font, this could be a very bad idea. as long as the interface is not resolution independent you might break the interface. it's all a bit tight already. typefaces differ in a plethora of ways, besides the pure aesthetic differences in the letter forms. base line differences, letter spacing etc all that matters. maybe if ccp prepared two or three fonts that we could choose between but that should be the limit of choice in this respect.but larger font sizes, yes please. preferably a somewhat more legible one (subjective, of course).tbh, i kind of miss the serif font showing your current location in the top-left corner of the main screen but that's a more stylistic preference."
5/10/2009,yes please!
5/10/2009,please please please please please ;)p.s: please!
5/10/2009,yes.

5/10/2009,"at least allow the increase of font in mail boxes, like it's done in chat channels"
5/10/2009,"yes!!! please, larger fonts would be nice! being able to tell if the 0.0 system is 5i or s1 would also be nice. :d"
5/10/2009,yes we definetly need bigger fonts! even with my glasses on i have trouble reading the 12 point font. all my chat channels i always increase the font size. trying to trade is very painfull seeing those small digits!
5/10/2009,as above - get off the second page grrrr.....
5/10/2009,yes
5/10/2009,"if you compare an af to a cruiser ask yourself ""which ships can i engage?"" you'll be disappointed.with afs the question is more ""which ships will the af allow me to avoid"".in eve both questions are important."
5/10/2009,"well we've arrived at the reason i fly afs almost exclusively. i have to confess to being an outlaw, and i fly along heavily contested fw pipes. in my jag i can laugh at the blob camps (although flying my 400 plate wolf is ""exciting"" at times). but on the subject of avoiding fights, afs work best with ab and scram in lowsec. if things start to go wrong, when fighting, for example, a mwd + disruptor fitted cruiser, chances are you are not going to escape. the things are so fragile, there are so many circumstances in which you will get obliterated by something that costs a fraction of the price. because of this i want them to be amazing when used in the right situation. a 4th bonus will give them a nice little boost without suddenly changing the roles they are able to perform."
5/10/2009,"this is already ingame. -> mark all your containers, rights click, ""open container"" will bring them all uptip: merge them into one big window with as many tabs as you like [you only need to do this once]tip2: double click on the window title bar to see only the tabs (esp useful for sorting your loot)ps: you can buy station containers at every station, just keep in mind that they can't leave the station ;)"
5/10/2009,oh i know i have voted on this very subject before.
5/10/2009,"i've been thinking the same thing for quite a while - a method of ""banking"" your isk. this seems like a simple and easy method to implement. nice idea!"
5/10/2009,"supercaps need a rework, i support this."

5/10/2009,"bs's don't have the abillity to lay their full dmg down upon cruisers or frigs..moms have the abillity to lay the full dmg down upon any ship size...sooooo no.beside the extra dps/tank is not nearly as effective as it looks because of the size difference.5 frigates well fitted can take out a bs, a ship costing 100-200x more then those frigates.5bs's will be killed slowly and painfully by 1 mom, a ship costing ow wait 100x more the cost of those 5 bs's.. hmm so where is the difference again?.besides the mom being overpowered compared to the normal cost/effectiveness formula for t1 ships (which it still is)."
5/10/2009,"crest, you are in no way comparing apples to apples. ship scales when 5 smalls can kill one big is so heavily dependent on factors outside of the norm that it's just silly. yes it happens all the time, but you're not equating pilot skills, ship fits, etc.super caps are typically static fits because they are all geared towards single functions.we/i am not asking for a huge gank and tank platform, we're asking for a rework of a borked platform that would make more sense. by your logic, our platforms are actually better because they benefit smaller ships more. titans should not be one ship fleet killers, it removes fun for the other 200 people out there in fleets every time doomsdays go off, and while the titan pilot has fun counting kills, everyone else get's ****y that they didn't get a fight.moms are problematic because cost v reward ratio is so skewed out of it's favor that most people just revert to carriers. most of their problem is derived from focus fire from dreads and the inability to tank in any substantial matter in a cap fight. both are issues that need looked at"
5/10/2009,supported! been annoying me from the moment i flew my first ship!

5/10/2009,"one of the principal ways to recognise the weapons/modules being used offensively against you is sight. far too often this visual recognition element is removed due the the need to reduce lag. would it be possible to extend the range of graphics effects options allowing players to better balance system performance with graphical immersion in the game. the current graphics options are:turret effectseffectsmissile effectscamera shakeship explosionsdrone modelsi propose that the following additions/changes be made.turret effectsdoomsday devices be added to the ""turret effects"" option. turret effects are perhaps more likely to be used than module effects during a fleet fight (the more likely place a titan will dd). players can then enjoy the glory of a dd more often, and also judge more accurately when it has been fired.missile effectssplit missiles in flight engine effects from explosions. this will allow players to see missiles in flight without the heavier graphical load of explosion effects on impact. players with a higher performance machine can ofc enable both.effectssplit the effects from modules into two groups. local modules i.e. sensor boosters, armor hardeners, and offensive modules i.e. nos, target painters. this would allow players to view effects for offensive modules and better respond to their affects based on a quick visual recognition, while at the same time remove the heavy work of rendering 30 or 40 sensor booster/hardener effects in a fleet.hopefully these changes would provide better visual stimuli for a combat pilot to respond to, increase the ability to manage graphics lag and generally improve the immersion and playing experience.zos"

5/10/2009,"one of the proposals was to delete the forum.how is this a solution?you don't like what happens in the forum so you'd rather see it gone? even though hundreds of people probably enjoy frequenting it, this is a game after all. we're all here to have fun."
5/10/2009,"as a counter proposal, how about we give people the option to choose not to open their browser, navigate to the eve-o forums, open caod, and spend their time reading it.i'm not a technical expert how difficult would this be to implement?"
5/10/2009,people use that forum?
5/10/2009,it may be some thing in your idea.advanced infomorph psychology (rank 8) look better.you have my support for this.
5/10/2009,"personally i just think we should be able to take out the implant (but they can only be used by us), this would remove the annoying element of jumping just to switch implants :)would have no problem with this if the first was applied, so i can switch through the different sets of implants as i liked ^^"
5/10/2009,"also, here is another reason why:its ccp's background. if they decide t0nyg is the guy to do it, then that is that. we will not be able to change that fact. it is a corporate decision and csm has very little influence in this area. --isaac"
5/10/2009,you may be right but if we don't voice our opinions now we have no right to complain after the fact if things don't go the way we'd like.

5/10/2009,i suspect a big part of this is the changes necessary to support devs wasting time on the vampires-in-stations beta.so support not doing that. obv.
5/10/2009,the csm can make it known there is a concern. your argument could be made concerning every part of the game and thus invalidates the very existence of the csm.there is one thing we can do should we be dissatisfied with changes made - leave. whether many will do it or not i do not know and it would of course depend on the changes made.
5/10/2009,"to quote a famous space opera line, ""i have a baaaaad feeling about this.""some canon inconsistencies are to be expected, as not everything can be perfectly checked. however, between the empyrean age novel and theodicy, tonyg has shown me that he is intent on re-writing the story of eve to fit his own story.i commented on the dev blog comments about this, to, so i'll be succinct: this could either be a 'fix all the error's actual inconsistencies' retcon spree, or this could be a 'stealth edit older items to fit my view' retcon spree.for the love of all that is holy, i hope it's the first kind."
5/10/2009,"inconsistencies should be reconciled by giving preference to the aspects of the storyline that the players have embraced and relied upon.after all, why should we incorporate any of the story into our gameplay if it's just going to be dumped later to accommodate one person's -- let's face it -- less than popular idea of what the eve universe should be?"
5/10/2009,"this looks alright, but ccp should give chance to wardec corp/alliance to bribe back concord and leave war with bribe.the amount of bribe that need to be pay like that must be much bigger from amount it was paid for starting war."
5/10/2009,"i disagree with your idea. the point of war is never winning or losing. you could lose every engagement you enter and still meet pre-set objectives (such as being bait, or simply distracting people away from an objective).that being said, the objective of war isn't to simply inflict damage - the point is to violence, inconvenience, and otherwise frustrate your opponent, or to achieve any physchological or political condition desired.that means that 90% of these objectives can't be measured in killmails.furthermore, war clearly favors the aggressee - they not only get free pvp, but they also have the option of simply docking and wasting the aggressor's hard earned cash."
5/10/2009,"quit lying and get back to wow. in eve, bad things happen to good people - get over it.and lol @ properly flying concord battleships at gates."
5/10/2009,+1if your definition of fun is making it impossible for others to have fun then there is something severely wrong with your idea of fun.
5/10/2009,i wonder how loudly the people who want to force me to throw isk into space via pvp would be screaming if eve contained a mechanism by which i could force them to either mine or hide in station?
5/10/2009,"they would leave the game. in the same way, if you dislike a mechanic such as pvp so much, then maybe you should consider leaving the game yourself.it has always been made clear that eve is a pvp game, and crying about how you don't like that is (hopefully) futile. there is a reason very few pirates in this game play wow or any other 'pvp flagged' game. in the same way, if you want perfect safety, then eve is not the game for you.as for the topic at hand, i feel that any change you try to make will only worsen the situation. what you are effectively trying to do, is set up a series of conditions which determine whether a war is legitimate or not. this is akin to trying to make a computer determine whether an act is morally right or wrong. aka, almost impossible. you can get a mediocre approximation such as ""wars cannot last longer than 2 weeks"", but that will still allow 'griefing' while preventing many legitimate wars. victory conditions are another terrible idea, since any griefers can set unattainable conditions for a unlimited duration war. the only solution which the carebears here will find satisfactory is a 'human level' ai which, unsurprisingly, is completely out of the question."
5/10/2009,"point proven.if you can force me to either play in a way i find a boring waste of time or leave the game why shouldn't i have an equally powerful mechanism by which i can force you to either play in a way that you consider a boring waste of time or leave the game?if combat pvp is the be-all and end-all of existence why aren't you playing team fortress ii instead?eve is a game with many aspects, not merely a one-dimensional, shoot-em-up scenario. the current war mechanism is a problem because it reduces a complex game to a single aspect -- turning it into team fortress in space.if combat pvp is fun to you as a thing in and of itself it would be just as fun for you if you fought an opponent who also thought it was fun. it would be just as fun for you if you had to declare an objective to accomplish when declaring war.everyone who threatens to stop playing if they can't wage unrestricted war against unwilling opponents without any objective in mind to accomplish is admitting that pvp for them is only fun when they are making easy kills against opponents of lesser combat capability. this is proven by the intensity of their reaction against any suggestion that would make easy kills harder to achieve."
5/10/2009,"in game, as in life. the only person responsible for your/my safety is you (or me...).wardecs probably need some kind of overhaul, but by no means should hi-sec be ""safe"" or ""pvp free"".every time someone sells an item on the market, reprocesses mission loot to ore, or mines out a belt, or undercuts someone else in the market, or finds and clears exploration sites - they are doing it in competition with other players. if you get loot from missions and sell it below the value of minerals that can be reprocessed from it, you negatively impact miners activity...if they took all the elements out of the game, that impacted or competed with other players playstyles - that would pretty much leave you with a single-player game.i don't have any suggestions or solutions, just want to say that *new* players should (and do get) some protection from being in npc corps... and while learning... but ccp hasn't been in the hand-holding business (as far as i know) since this game came out...it is my opinion that they shouldn't start now..."
5/10/2009,yes wardecs are broken. yes they can be fixed. nobody has suggested a suitable fix yet though.
5/10/2009,"actually, you can force pvpers to either pve or quit. if you play a pve-only game (such as hello kitty online), then either the pvpers agree to pve, or they don't play the same game as you. solved .what you fail to grasp is that open pvp is one of the core tenets of eve. it isn't the only thing you can do (sorry if my post implied that), but 90% of activities involve some form of pvp, and you cannot actually completely avoid pvp. what you seem to be saying is that every game should cater to every type of player, which by definition is impossible.i am not playing tf2 because, believe it or not, i don't actually think pvp is everything. however, i do believe that if there is a way to avoid pvp, people will exploit this loophole to the point where pvp becomes 99% consensual.yes, pvp is fun if both parties are consenting, but unfortunately if all pvp was consensual piracy would all but die out as a profession. piracy is one of the things that makes eve great, and tbh, i don't want it to become another one of the numerous 'lets all get along and be friends' games. the point i was making was that creating 'objectives' or 'time limits' is completely pointless as it won't achieve even close to what you want.also, if you bothered to pay attention to anything, you would have noticed that i am in a 0.0 alliance. morsus mihi specifically has a nrds (not red don't shoot) policy in empire space, so i don't know where you get the idea that i am only interested 'easy kills'."

5/10/2009,"proposal: corp friendly fire, highsec.so my thought ran over a few things, if some one is in your corp and decides that he want to kill of the members of the corp in highsec against their will (yer there are a lot of *******s out there and think it could be profitable if finding the right target), then he can do so without concord intervene and without any consequence (besides getting kicked from the corp, but face it if he does this i dont think he cares).so i propose that you have the ability to set friendly fire on/off meaning that it will give a double warning about this when friendly tries to shoot you and concord will react as if it was a hostile attacking you if they decide to ignore this warning.just a fast thought"
5/10/2009,troll ban finally cool down?no.if anything that switch needs to be set for alliances.. not corps.
5/10/2009,"well i don't really care if it is set for the alliance, the corp or the individual member, if it is just there i am happy ^^it just seems odd that you can't decide to say ""hey concord i don't want people shooting at me at all, even if they have the same helmed"" ^^"

5/10/2009,is this a whine?
5/10/2009,no i dont like this.
5/10/2009,personally i think that we should make the whole outpost stations more realistic: meaning.when you take over a station everything that is in that station now belongs to the owners of the station.

5/10/2009,"hahah, you must really get lost when having a convo with most people in game. i remember when i started i had to stop everyone to ask what the abbreviation meant. guess thats what happens when you are in 0.0 on day 1. most convos in game though are basically alphabet soup for those that haven't encountered the abbreviation before."

5/10/2009,"ahh, akita, as much subtlety as an atomic bomb my thoughts on the 'problem' is that t3 production was introduced pre-nerfed much like all new content brought in over the last few years, but as far as i am aware, ccp are actually monitoring drop rates so they can tweak them over time to reach their desired level. i know they originally hoped for strat's to be reasonably priced, but as someone in that thread pointed out, certain combinations are ridiculously powerful for ships of their size, so making them too cheap would create a similar problem with the capital proliferation in 0.0 and lowsec. keeping all that in mind, i do think the gas either needs it's m3 reduced so more can be shifted more easily or it's units/cycle time increased so that less time is spent cutting your wrists watching your ship mine. i am also aware that there seems to be a major bottleneck in the datacores needed, so the droprate for them should probably upped slightly too.basically, i'm willing to wait for ccp to adjust things slowly on t3 rather than go too extreme in any direction on it - making it easy and then nerfing it breaks the game just as much.about bloody time"

5/11/2009,/agree
5/11/2009,should have been done long ago!
5/11/2009,"that is correct, but currently there's not much incentive for 0.0, especially for industrialists, and even less for lowsec.though, i would say, they should bring moon mining into 0.4. lowsec is lowsec is lowsec, imho.as for this, i agree. and it should be easy for a formidable fleet to wreck that sec status down to the bone.this would give 'true sec' status a new meaning, because it'll be really hard to bring security to a -1.0 system =^_^=also, i think they should make all orbital objects /actually/ orbit. it's kind of annoying that they are completely static. and if we had planet sieging, it'd add a different tactical twist. at x time on y day a warp from point a to point b could be z seconds, but change the time variables, and this all changes.this also goes into how i feel all ships should have different accel and decel rates when going into warp. sure, all ships align at different rates, but all ships accel for 30sec and decel for 30sec. the only ships that really notice their warp speed are titans and freighters, other ships don't notice unless in 90au+ systems.removing the '30sec accel/decel on all ships' rule, and giving them varying numbers, would make planets orbiting give you a tactical advantage or disadvantage. true orbits would also boost ambulation's war-room idea where you could go into the system map in the war room (zooming in further than the star map showed in the video ccp linked to about ambulation) and plan attacks based on time of day, fast-forwarding and reversing time (on the map) to show planetary placement. this could make for some very rewarding military operations, and make eve feel that much more like the living sci fi novel it aspires to be.</ramble>sorry, didn't mean to derail there. op and kween fully 100% supported."
5/11/2009,tractors as they are are fine. if adding med or large then make it so you can only use one tractor beam and that they have massive range but slow speed. this would solve the 0.0 stuff as you can still approach and it still comes towards you but not fast and only one item at a time.
5/11/2009,we meed to improve orbit settings!
5/11/2009,i like this idea also. one other thing especially in gate camps would be the direction of orbit. i would like options in which direction to orbit a gate. this would help setting up gate camp bookmarks.
5/11/2009,i support this! very time consuming to sort what stuff to reprocess and what to sell.
5/11/2009,yep
5/11/2009,"i'm minny guns in pvp and caldari in pve and i think the loading is part of the weapons. we don't need to make the game a one click game. if you can go out in a passive tanked nighthawk with fof heavies and afk a lvl 3 or the easy lvl 4's then we have a major problem.if your going to do auto firing then, make it so it does not work with fof or mines, as these could be used to mine the space to and from each warp gate on major routes to take out cloakers, by simply orbiting the damn gate and launching mines.i think the current system is fine. i don think this needs changing."
5/11/2009,"thumbs upmaybe it will make reloading guns work better in lag, or is that too much to hope for?"
5/11/2009,it should have been implemented long time ago
5/11/2009,what about a new drone...salvage dronesopens up new skills for everyonei believe salvage drones was mentioned in a eve storyand a industrial that can carry a few along with a tractor beam boostthat doesn't cost 400mil
5/11/2009,its not happening. ccp declared its not going to happen. --isaac
5/11/2009,stop. trolling.ccp didn't introduce salvage drones for technical reasons. they never excluded putting them in game at some point.
5/11/2009,"wrong again, troll. please try harder next time."
5/11/2009,"actually there is a non-published skill for salvage drones - it used to be listed in the eve-wiki, though i don't know if it got removed with the apoc update - i haven't looked.as far as i can tell, they have just never been implemented, most likely for technical reasons of one form or another."
5/11/2009,"no there is already to much easy afk money in mission clean up, adding med / large tractor beams or salvage drones makes the isk / time to high. and whats worse it makes the game closer to one click and win games.eve is a game where you need to micro manage. making it eaiser for wow-monkeys or prople to watch tv is not needed. there is no major problem here i dont think it should change."

5/11/2009,"some of the ships like drake, manticore, hawk have visible launcher points on the hull. so some of the ships only need some launcher effect upgrade on the models. the ships that don't have any integrated launcher need launcher points like the turrets have.i support this."

5/11/2009,a. individual acts of piracy and wardecs against corporations are not the same thing.b. when debating an issue its a mistake to take arguments personally. any given alliance's policies in null sec and low-sec space are irrelevant since war decs are a high-sec phenomenon.
5/11/2009,"this needs immediate attention. ccp just needs to change one number around and the problem will be solved, or at least have a great band aid on until a more comprehensive change could be made.citadels need to be able to do damage approaching that as their other dread cousins, against a moving mothership or other moving capital ship.as it stands, citadels are a pathetic joke against carriers/ms."

5/11/2009,"why isn't this in the ideas forum?ideas forum is for getting feedback on new ideas and suggestions. this particular idea has already been rolled around a bit here and even earlier here. it's now on assembly hall so that hopefully interested parties will find their interests generally met well enough to raise it to the attention to the devs or csm, whoever happens to be reading.are these aoe mods?no. targeted. one specialized t2 bc would be able to apply some effects to one or two caps. pilot for pilot, ship for ship, isk for isk, a fair value. the effects would be relatively harmless on their own, but would multiply the efforts of gang mates considerably, just like recons.how would incapacitation work?rp: gain access to control software and perform massive overloadingeve: when module is either active or in cool down phase, can be deactivated with 100% heat damage. can be repaired with nanite paste.why does x race have y ability?all four races basically lose their racial flavoring of ewar when it comes to sieged dreads and supercaps, and to some extent carriers i.e. no capital neuts. this was at least a motivating factor in most design choices. for instance, caldari ecm is dead against sieged dreads and supercaps. it makes sense that the caldari would extend their technology to regain their combat philosophy.in other cases, i was taking an item from the ""wish list"" of things that have shown up on this forum a lot and matching them to the race with the most expertise in that field. for instance, amarr are the best sustained tankers, so giving them anti-spider/triage capabilities fit with the whole theme of upscale recons being the meaner cousins of gang-boosting command ships.finally, the lists needed balance according to some kind of logical arrangement. thus caldari ended up with anti-ddd. mini got anti-jump portal gen.skills?obviously bc v and recon iv. three-mod version would likely require something in leadership or hacking (anything themed with the idea of infiltrating gang-link hardware). rest is up to ccp. given the potential value of anti-cap/supercap ewar, the skill reqs and cost of ships, mods, mind links, should be higher than for command ships.don't kill x.aware of supercap thread. coupled issue. hp or self-directed tanking boosts etc would be easily justified in the case of any new anti-supercap ewar.great, so how do we counter the new upscale recons?jam them, tackle them, chase them off, snipe them, catch them etc.open to suggestions?do you turn down a fee lunch? in all honesty, the devs will have their way with any player/csm suggestion. the best we can do is hit the main points."

5/11/2009,"supported, lag is for ccp to figure out, i just want customizing!"
5/11/2009,"i'm all for pre-set paint jobs. even with the limited set of ""templates"" we have now for the t2 ships i think it'd be a nice addition (allthough more templates to choose from would make it much nicer). paint your fleet in ""ishukone urban camo"" or ""roden shipyard red""? adds a bit more diversity to the game."
5/11/2009,"i like the new scanning system. it's more hands on and i think it's true to the eve philosophy of making the player engange their brain rather than just grinding skills all the time.however, i agree with the issue raised here. the new texture is icky and makes it hard to see. it also seems to cause ridiculous lag when the probes warp and my high-end pc nearly burst into flames earlier today when i was trying to chase someone and uncloaked, hit warp and tried to recover my probes all in one go. it took it about 30 seconds just to restabilize. also there's a lot of bizzare green flashing on the system map when probes are launched or warped. i think that's what the epilepsy talk is about. to be honest, though the warp line graphics are neat they're really not necessary and also a lot of the time they don't even display.the filter problem mentioned is also sort of a pain though i think it's merely a minor oversight in the code. if he's referring to what i am then the problem is that when you open the scan window the non-filtered state is active but the filter name displayed is the last one on the list of filters.also, i've noticed that after the last patch there's a problem with the system when a single signal may be in one of two locations. a 'ring' hit still displays okay, but when a third probe is moved in to triangulate from there only the correct location is displayed for that result rather than both potential locations. i don't know if this was intentional or not, but please put it back how it was. the new process is cool should not be 'dumbed down' for people who can't cope with primary-school science.occasionally when scanning with multiple (7) probes i've noticed that sometimes the system icons disappear, which makes it difficult to determine whether results (esp ships) are near gates or stations, etc. closing and re-opening the map doesn't fix it. it takes a session change to get the icons back.sometimes it's hard to move a probe around because the labels get in the way.finally i'd like to note that it can be extremely difficult to manage the camera at close range when far from the central object. an object nearer to the target can be selected as the rotation focus but sometimes no object is available for that purpose and i don't think a lot of people know how to change the rotation focus. it would be nice to be able to r-click an icon (including scan hits) and 'set focus' to help with moving the camera.i know all that sounds critical but overall i'm impressed and gratified with the new system and would like to thank everyone who put work into it as well as everyone who works to make eve the best game available."
5/11/2009,"some of the new effects i like - the spinny effect during the scan proper i really do like the look of. the lag is completely unreasonable, though, and the graphics trump the actual usability of the interface a little too often for my tastes - the fact that the probe boxes are almost invisible when the plane of the system is between them and the camera is done terribly, and the fact that we can't turn our camera perfectly vertical like i'm pretty sure we could before is fantastically annoying, however minor. i like the new scanning system, and i like most of how it was implemented, but it needs some tweaks yet. i wouldn't phrase it as stridently as the op, but i do basically support this."
5/11/2009,i do think the problems with the new graphics outweigh the benefits.
5/11/2009,"i think this is a good idea. would make combat more interesting. using ship scanners, probes, or corps having system scanners at pos's would be a good substitute. only if you chat in local would you show up. or if you are an outlaw."
5/11/2009,"i dont support this, no change.wh space is fine with no local (fits into story and was planned that way) changing empire to that i disagree. leave known space alone."
5/11/2009,this! and this!
5/11/2009,"fully supported.delayed local like w-space would be awesome.it's safer in a lot of ways for both players and pirates... /aswell/ as more dangerous for both.sure, we'd get less local chatter, but it wouldn't change highsec much, and it'd make lowsec easier for carebears to mine without having to worry about pirates as much.sure, pirates could find them, but they'd have to probe them out.this would raise lowsec incentive to an almost high enough level to be worth it.do this, and remove meta 0 loot from missions, and lowsec will be totally worth it.giving us delayed local in all space makes military reconnaissance more of a job and less of something that's easily available. you'll actually need good pilots to recon, and the team with better recon will be able to sneak up on fleets that would normally outnumber them.local chat should be used for occasional general chit-chat in highsec, for advertising contracts, or for showboating... not as a spy tool. delayed chat fixes this.look at w-space.sure, there are lots of pirates, but your odds of getting ganked are still lower.it changes the tactics on both sides.the only people who really lose with delayed local are the large fleet griefers that depend on local to blob everyone they see in local.---edit---i would also like to add that delayed local makes cloaking a much more entertaining job...and possibly there could be some kind of cov ops scan probe that only finds cloaked signatures, but has like a max 4au range...---edit---"
5/11/2009,"so let me get this straight. what you're proposing is that a corporate thief can invade a corp, make off with all the goods, and if any retribution is tried, concord comes over and smashes the people whose property was stolen? sorry, i don't see that happening.this concept is ripe for abuse and exploitation, so i'm gonna have to go with 'no' on this one. if you don't like the player corps, start your own one-man corp or stay in npc corp. trust is a hard thing to earn in this game, so make sure you trust the people whom you're going to be calling corpmates."
5/11/2009,if you can't trust the people in your corp then maybe you should look for a new corp. the situation is analogous to corp theft. if someone can come into your corp and steal from hangars and you cannot turn that off then you should not be able to turn off other legitimate forms of corp shenanigans.
5/11/2009,ooc repping sucks. should have more consequences
5/11/2009,i support this if you can't see covops cloack fitted ships but you can see regular cloacked fitted ships (ships that not designed for cloacking). and you should only see the cloacked ships if they are try to move.+ i have an idea for prototype cloack nerf.you can cloack from radars because your ship absorb the incoming radiations. so your ships after some time should overheat. afters some time in cloacking your modules get a damage like they are overloaded.
5/11/2009,so this will nerf cloaked ships with a legit reason for being there (intel on a gate/pos/belt) and not nerf afk cloaking ravens or what have you in safespots. brilliant.
5/11/2009,"you dont need to broke cloaking in general to solve problem of cloaking ships who are on the 1st place not supposed to be cloaked. as i said earlier the best solution for this is to increase cap consumption while cloaked on all ships except bombers, force recons, coverts, black ops and blockade runners (or just simple to increase cap consumtpion on all cloak devices except covert cloak device). for all other ships you can stay cloaked only for certain ammount of time cause in couple of minutes of being cloaked your cap will be dry and your cloak will turn off."

5/11/2009,"i place this thread here as a marker for any and all csm candidates who have a strong platform on faction warfare and who place the greatest emphasis on getting ccp to reform and improve the current system.i'd like to hear from those csm candidates who are now (or have been in the past) legitimate fw participants. such candidates would be encouraged to provide their plans to bring to the csm those changes which might improve and reinvigorate this ailing expansion.talking points:a.) wardec mechanics which allow pirate corps to 'cherry pick' individual fw player corps without drawing aggression from the rest of the militia.b.) provide a real advantage to establishing sovereignty. deny station services (but allow docking) to enemy combatants in non-militia (npc corp) stations and disallow docking altogether in militia-labeled stations.c.) plex spawning. insure the mechanics are such that plexes spawn more evenly throughout the day and in plenty of out-of-the-way fw systems to encourage more solo and small gang roaming outside the major pipes (kamela/kourm/auga/amamake, tama/suj/heyd/oms).d.) establish modest loyalty point awards for fw activity. this should be low enough that high-level mission running is still far more lucrative to dissuade farming, yet provide enough incentive to plex, thus opening more pvp opportunities in more systems not in the main pipes mentioned above. taking a couple minor plexes down might grant enough lps to buy faction ammo, for example. changing sovereignty (or successfully defending a bunker) should grant enough lp to purchase faction frigates. faction cruisers and other significant rewards should be the result of accumulating larger amounts of lp."
5/11/2009,"hi meridius,nice to see you again in regards to fw there have been a couple of threads (e.g.) on here in recent days asking about fw and which candidates consider it important. whilst i am sure you're corp will not be voting for me anytime soon i'll answer you points anyhow.a.) a discussed over and over on the forums disallowing war decs for corporations within fw will provide a far too powerful advantage to fw corps over normal empire corps. as long as they have no need to leave their chosen faction or allied faction's space they will be almost free from be able to be attacked by anyone. additionally to this it would also be a way of making a pos effectively invulnerable. a better change to consider might be the idea of if you war dec a militia corporation the other members of that militia get to choose to dec you back for free without incurring the use of one of their war dec spaces. b.) just a small niggle but you aren't establishing sovereignty but occupation. the idea of denying docking rights to the opponents of militia specific stations would be a nice idea and one that has come up before and so far i haven't seen a good reason deny it. as to other station services being denied an occupied region i like the idea of substantially increasing the fees per day the system is occupied but i'm not sure about denying them altogether yet as i would have to look in detail at the possible ramifications of it in terms of what you do if you are badly on the loosing foot and have nowhere to do anything outside of low sec as this would effect those people in fw that can't enter hi sec due to their sec status. so yes in principle your ideas are great but complete denial may make things just too hard for the guys on the backfoot to have a chance of coming back. c.) yes utterly agree. not argument or thinking about this one needed. from me at least.d.) i think it wouldn't hurt to give a small lp reward to fw pilots in exchange for handing in their vps maybe. the amount of plexing that is needed in fw is rather large and for those militias who rely on a few people to do all the plexing for them (minmatar/gallente i'm looking at you) it is a thankless task. some sort of ""reward"" beyond a rank is certainly in order but it shouldn't be anywhere near enough to make people consider it as the main reason to do it and certainly not to draw people into plexing for the lp. i personally would go with equivalencing the lp to a rough translation of 10-20lp per vp which would mean a large amount of plexing would need to be done in order to gain anythgin substantial from it. in the main however i would like to see ccp continue to develop fw beyond the point it is at now. ccp are great for launching new and shiny things on us but not so great for continued support for these things. fw offers a great deal to a great many people but the interest in fw has been waining since release as broken or problematic mechanics go unfixed and new content for it isn't delivered. a promise was made to the players of fw at the beginning that this would be an important part of eve's development to the extent that ccp hung a whole expansion off of it but it seems to have been left to rot along with so many other brilliant but unpolished ideas they introduce to the game. if elected fw is one of the things that i will pay a great deal of attention to. i won't be biased in this despite my character's allegiance as what will help one side will invariably help them other. i hereby promise to spend at least one day a week if elected talking to anyone from fw who wants to raise issues with me and furthermore to pay attention to what i am being told. when raising an idea i will talk to all factions involved in fw and get their side of the story. factional warfare could be so much more than it is."
5/11/2009,"if by just about anyone you mean blockade runners who were nigh on unlockable before they got covops cloaks anyway...-10 players are perfectly capable to move through lowsec, just don't stop or slow down! as for keeping carebears on their toes... see for yourselfi've always been keen on a skill which increases your sensor strength. given that all the other ewar mods have a relevant skill which counteracts the effects to some degree i think it should be added. as for some sort of eccm rig, yeah why not."
5/11/2009,"this is quite a hot topic for every small gang/solo pvper i talked to, so here is your opportunity to score some extra votes by showing your support ;)in case you don't know what i am talking about here are some threads about the issue and why it is a bad idea:"
5/11/2009,i constantly use this trick.i'd hate to see it go away
5/11/2009,"i disagree with your assumptions. skirmish gangs do not normally fit cloaks, interceptors are used to scout gate camps, not mwd align cloaking badgers."
5/11/2009,"i've camped a lot of gates in my time and cursed those who use this trick... i've also used it to get past many a gatecamp.i feel it's a pretty lame tactic (doesn't stop me using it) and is probably not intended but i will be very sad to see it go.as a previous person mentioned it won't hurt combat gangs, mainly ratters, haulers, etc etc... it will hurt recons and covops who find themselves caught short in a bubble."
5/11/2009,"that has come up in the other treads linked above and sufficiently answered there as well but since you apparently haven't read those i'm gonna humor you anyway:an inty might still be able to survive a camp (or get instapopped, happens frequently also), true.but i have to disagree with your other assessment, roaming gangs do indeed fit cloaks, not only on their recons and bombers (which is kinda their trademark so it would be silly not to fit cloaks on them) but also on hacs (for which you pay a price with the scan resolution and lock delay penalties which is balancing it out). they do that to be able to survive gatecamps better and be able to avoid getting scanned out and killed when they inevitably get boxed in by a fleet 10times their size.so, are you saying an inty should be the only ship able to (maybe) survive jumping into a camp but recons, covert ops, bombers, blockade runners and the like should just die in every competent camp they come along?it even makes the recently buffed black ops a joke as how is your covert cyno ship supposed to infiltrate hostile territory if it just gets killed in any camp it comes along on the way?it is this kind of catering to blobs, territorial powers and gatecamps that has made eve a less fun experience for everyone not into that kind of stuff like people trying to fight while outnumbered behind enemy lines etc and we certainly do not need another nail in that coffin. but that does not mean it is impossible to catch people using a cloak, it just means your camp (or the one you were facing) was not competent enough or just unlucky. a good camp can frequently decloak and catch ships using cloaks up to and including recons and covert ops. i've had it happen to me and have done it myself. with these changes even an incompetent camp will be able to kill anything coming in, it will be like shooting fish in a barrel.at least this is true for 0.0 space where there are bubbles aplenty these days. in low sec where even bs can use the the mwd, cloak, warp trick this is indeed a problem i can imagine. but to fix a pure low sec problem by breaking 0.0 combat variety is just wrong, there has to be another way."
5/11/2009,"as a non-territorial small gang pvper myself i have seen this ""trick"" being used on numerous occasions and i am in two minds about it being dealt with as it is by ccp. in regards to it's effectiveness at evading gate camps in 0.0 a well setup gate camp should be able in most cases to de-cloak and destroy most ships coming through it with the possible exception of cov ops ships even if they do use this trick. attempting to go through a gatecamp into 0.0 is already a tough challenge for most small outfits unless very specific ships are used. in regards to using a cloak on hacs yes i have seen it done and i don't really find it provides enough of a boost to escape a gatecamp setup in 0.0 anyway and this change should not effect their ability to hide when they they need to when already in a system. so from a 0.0 perspective it will negatively effect the ability of a few ships to enter a heavily camped 0.0 system. however it must be said that for every system that is camped right now there is usually a way past all but the most core systems of someone's territory. additionally to this i feel the change will have an effect on a minority of ships as the vast percentage of ships that could use this trick on a properly setup gatecamp is minimal. certainly a hac shouldn't be able to get past a well setup 0.0 camp with or without this trick currently. in regards to low sec there are currently many things that need to be looked at as it is simply too easy to avoid fights at the moment. the agility of ships is far too high allowing ships to escape combat whenever they wish. to given an example i was on a gate with my corp mate today who was in a triple sensor boosted phobos. with the current level of agility of ships we had a dominix get past us because he wasn't able to lock it in time! i mean obviously the dominix was setup to do just that but when a battleship can align and warp before somethign with nearly 1000 scan res can lock it there is something wrong. the cloak/mwd trick is just another example of how low risk empire fighting has become. indeed right now there is few ways to force an engagement from an enemy if they do not want it. whilst i am sure that appeals to many in eve it does strike me as contradictory to the cold dark universe ccp have stated new eden is meant to be. whilst it could be said that this change will effect the small gang 0.0 pilot i do not honestly believe it will be a huge change from the status quo for the majority of them. the big hit will be against the solo ratters and industrial pilots who fly around 0.0. without wishing to push voters away on the eve of election it is about time that vunerable ships were escorted in so called dangerous space anyway but looking at it where does most combat in eve take place? a cursory glance at the map on any day will normally show a vast amount more ship kills in empire than in 0.0. given the additional difficultly of forcing a fight in empire it would seem to me that the majority of combat simply must happen in empire. as a result bring a change that will being eve closer to the ideal that ccp want for eve would seem to be the way forward. for the minority of pilots in 0.0 that this will effect it will be another challenge to be overcome but not a great one as little will actually change for the majority."

5/12/2009,"huh. i think we're at the stage where we need to decide on what the accepted role of an af actually is. i don't do much solo work so i won't comment on that, but in a fleet setting, i use them asa) heavy tackle - the ability to hold onto a target without dying long enough for dps to arriveb) frigate superiority platform - killing frigs and destroyers at a disproportionate ratio to ship losses.especially when paired with interceptors, i really cannot stress enough how well they perform these roles - especially if you're dealing with smartbombing battleships - as is often the case for us.so the questions now are1) what solo roles do they fill2) why are they lacking in fleet or solo roles (each ship)?3) what bonus would you propose to solve this problem (each ship)?from there we can have solid options to evaluate."
5/12/2009,"agreed.afs really are small counterparts to the hacs. each individual ship may excel in a certain role, but the class as a whole is designed to provide ships capable of performing well in many cirucmstances where high performance is needed couple with agility and speed. looking at the bonuses of the afs and hacs, a lot of them are cleary designed to be used in a similar way.harpy -> eagle ranged dpsretribution -> zealot ranged dpsvengeneance -> sacriledge heavy tanker ishkur-> ishtar drone bukkake enyo-> deimos blaster boatthey individually have quite different characters, whilst at the same time being versatile enough to perform well in a variety of situations, for example in fleets, as you have mentioned. they also work very well in the role i use them in, which is solo or with another af wingman, killing much larger targets. with an ab and a scram, they are able to speed/sig tank even when webbed, and take down much larger ships, whilst at the same time being fast enough with an ab to make the initial tackle, and nimble enough to evade gatecamps that would catch a cruiser or larger ship. so my point is this: afs are able to, and should continue to be able to, perform well in a variety of roles, whilst still having distinct characters. therefore, as with hacs, i'm against giving the whole class the same bonus that bolsters their use in a specific role, rather they should be given their bonus on a case by case bonus, in keeping with the general character of the ship. the problem with afs in general is that they simply are not worth the isk. they were initially given a 4th bonus, which was to resists, however when this was incorporated into the hull, as with other t2 ships, they did not receive a new 4th bonus.i feel like i'm starting to repeat myself here as i have given some examples of the bonus i would like to see before, but i'll quickly summarise my thoughts here:harpy: inherit the 5% bonus to resists that the merlin gets, completeing the merlin, moa, harpy, eagle family of caldari rail boats.vengeance: bring it into line with the sacriledge and give it a rocket rof bonus.retribution: not sure on this, a zealot style rof bonus may be overpowered... answers on the back of a postcard...hawk: i would suggest a rof bonus here, like the cerb, and also a boost to fittings so its possible to fit with t2 launchers plus tank and tackle without fittting mods. ishkur: probably a 5km per level drone control range bonus is suitable here, a drone damage bonus for example would make this already superb ship completely overpowered.enyo: how about a falloff bonus, to match the incursus. both falloff and optimal bonus, this would become a very flexible ship.wolf and jaguar: 7.5% bonus to turret tracking. these two differ from others in that they're both used in similar roles i.e. with autocannons or artillery, and so i'm in favour of a bonus that is helpful in both roles. they still retain their characters with this; the jag being the more agile shield tanker, and the wolf slower sturdier armour tanke. while we're on the subject, its worth noting that a lot of people want the falloff/optimal bonuses to be switched."
5/12/2009,"as i stated before in the post, i'm of the mind that the containers aren't good enough. i do understand that the basic functionality in the end result of what i am looking for is already present with cans, but the truth of the matter is that they are terrible for a whole host of reasons.most notable is the fact that they cannot be opened remotely, through the assets pane to be able to peek in and see exactly what is inside. you could set up a contract for the can itself, but that only gives you the base stack of the items in the can and not the amount of each stack. also there can be nothing done about managing those items remotely either (i.e. contracting and such).i use cans and it sucks. you have to open them each time, and then if for some reason you have to reinstall the client (but eve never craps out!) then you have to reset the settings on every one that you have because all that info is saved client-side.lastly, you can't sell items directly from within a can, which is another pain in the colon.i would advocate a change for cans as well as an implementation of the item-tabbing idea, but i still think, given that we have a corporation hangar that encoporates this function, it seems only natural that we have divisions in our own personal hangars that follow suit.this issue had prior support by at least 2 csm members and i hope that the new guys pick up the torch. keep the ideas coming though guys, and gals."
5/12/2009,"supported.allow us to make custom tabs.maybe we can 'partition' hangar space for each tab.allow this for ships, aswell.this would make station containers useless, but you can't search containers in your assets.oh, and, if this is implemented... let tabs show up as expandable trees in the assets window, just like corp divisions.-edit-for those that will whine about all their organized station containers:ccp: turn all station containers into tabs of the same name (tab # if the container isn't named) and automatically reprocess all station containers into ore. :3-edit-"

5/12/2009,"i might support this later, we'll see, i like the thought, but with how tractors are right now, two new middle-classes would feel redundant.maybe if they had different strengths, and two people could tractor the same object... tractor tug-o-war style... then we could go with the +10km range per middle size, with higher strength (tractor velocity, excuse me, call it what you want) or go with the op's stated +100% and have the larger ones not as strong as the smaller ones.the idea of the op's proposal is nice, but tractors need to be reworked a little. this could make fighting ninja salvagers pretty interesting, especially if you go with shorter range increments for the middle-class but make them stronger... they could waste all their tractors on more wrecks, and hope to out-salvage you, or they could try to out-power you by putting more tractors on (this should only raise tractor strength, not velocity, this is why i used the 'strength' term earlier)oooh... to expand on that, just combine the two. make larger tractors have higher strength but lower speed. this could make for some interesting salvage battles =>_>="

5/12/2009,"caod could easily be an interesting, readable, useful forum like shc's war and politics forum. it isn't at present, for two reasons:1) people who have something to say, not saying it there; and2) people who have nothing to say posting for the sake of it.forums are supposed to be a means of communicating, of passing information from one person to another. it would be wonderful if there was one accessible to those who don't rp where they could actually... you know... talk about what they've done in game.the rules on caod, ccp said, were deliberately lenient, presumably to allow some measure of smacktalk between enemies. but most of what we see now isn't even smacktalk. it's just talk."
5/12/2009,"i like caod as it is, just a bunch of bros chilling and having fun. i don't see the problem. maybe if we all decided to respect each other and not judge each others posting habits, we could all work together and build a better forum, one where we can all just relax and have fun."
5/12/2009,now all we need is someone bold enough on the csm to bring it up!
5/12/2009,"this game has had many of its more adult references sanitized for the release of the boxed version. there needs to be some outlet for channeling the nerd rage that fuels the stories and intrigues that make this game enjoyable to play.if you think this is a good use of csm time that will affect very few of the actual playerbase, ok. i think there are larger, more pressing issues they can spend their time on."
5/12/2009,"how do you afk mission cleanup?more salvage would make rigs cheaper.too much isk/hour? compared to what, pvp? there's no real money into missions compared to other aspects of this game. you've been fooled. missionsunners are together with miners the slaves in eve."

5/12/2009,"the challenges of live events are beyond what tranquillity can muster, perhaps another idea is to host live expeditions into wormholes with a single corp. or alliance running security with perhaps another against them.for players that avoid or are in small corps setting up temporary ""expendable"" fleets for insane objectives through the contract system.set this up with volunteer players and live agents interacting with players and corps chosen by criteria based searchingexamples: events in factional warfare, daring slave rescues by the minmatar, assaults against a rogue drone controlled titan. 0.0 events like taking over an ancient space station or setting up colony worlds.that's a few seconds of thinking what could ccp come up with with a team of thinkers that would know how to set this up.finally i apologise for my ad hoc suggestion,it's all straight out of my mind."

5/12/2009,"signing this.missiles are boring to look at. if you link all 7 turrets on a megathron, you still get 7 gun trails shooting at the target. if you link all your launchers on a raven or golem you get...one single-missile sized glowy ball thing. before linking, when you actually had to finger-roll f1-f6 on a raven, you had a chance that all 6 would fire at the same time and you'd launch a giant glowing ball of doom that at the very least looked somewhat menacing.make missiles fire like turrets. give each launcher a specific point on the hull that it's mounted to, and have each launcher launch an individual missile toward the target. and make missiles look like missiles. a little 5 point elongated pyramid would work, with a big trail of fuel (color coordinated to damage type) that slowly fades out after a few seconds."

5/12/2009,"apologies if this has been raised before. i did have a search through but didn't see anything on this (but could have missed it)anyway, i recently purchased the new eve box set with 60 days of free game time. this inspired me to create a new character and actually run through the starter/epic missions just to refresh my memory of what it was like to be a new player in eve.what i have found is that ccp have made significant improvements to the new player experience - it's gigantically better than when i first started to play eve 6 years ago.however, one thing that i did not have to contend with back then was constant isk seller spam. now i am aware that you can block spammers, however the spammers rotate these so you have to go through the same process on a regular basis. as a 'vet' i think it is particularly sad that the first thing that greets new players are isk selling adverts, the frequency of which often stifles reasonable conversation in newbie channels.now i am sure ccp are aware of the issue but i do think a special effort should be made moderate the newbie corp channels and kick/ban offenders on a regular basis.there may be something that ccp simply do not have the manpower to deal with but at the moment it seems to be being ignored so i would be interested in csm members investigating this issue with ccp in greater depth!thanks"
5/12/2009,you think thats bad?stop by jita or rens and watch local for a bit.contract scammers galore.
5/12/2009,"hello hardin,i understand your pain, being in a newbie corp myself. however, even if ccp did monitor the channels, the spammers rotate so much that it would be a lot of effort for nothing. the block command is simple to do and gives you the same amount of protection from the annoyance as a ccp dev would be.i'll admit that something needs to be done, but it should be on the coding side, not the monitoring side, and i'm not even sure if anything can be done about that."
5/12/2009,what ever happened to right click - report spammer function? why has it not been implemented ingame yet? what's taking so long?
5/12/2009,"lol, dodixie is worse than rens nowadays =>_>=but yeah, the top three systems are worse than channel spammers."
5/12/2009,"this is a ms change idea to give them more of a combat role. this would only be one aspect of their overall changes.fighters with one shot, very high alpha, firing a stealth bomber type bomb with less explosion radius and requiring higher sig radius of the target to be effective. after that one shot they have to return to the ms to ""reload"". due to the constant motion you would probably need them moving fasting than normal fighters while mwding. the bombers would be designed to anti capital work but would probably also be effective against fighter clouds just due to the amount of them being thrown out. when assigning these to someone they would stay at the ms until the attack command was given, at which point they would enter warp as a normal fighter, come out a certain range from the target make their strike then return to reload. different races obviously using different damage types, give the carrier skill itself a bonus to their mwd and warp speed or the typical damage/hp bonus.to offset the fact normal bombs cost isk to fire, make them reload by drawing topes out of your cargo or god forbid a fuel bay if it ever gets put in.and for anyone who is reading this and thinking ""stealth bomber"" these wouldnt cloak so dont post saying cloaking fighters is gay etc etc"
5/12/2009,"supporting because i'm pretty sure eve is one of the few (if not the only) spaceship game that has no bomber class to compliment fighters.(pros will note my use of the word ""compliment"" before they :words: on about stealth bombers.)"
5/12/2009,"supported.this would be neat, it'd nice to see carriers have more use in capital warfare other than dying...and the aoe explosions would help balance out the massive damage. shouldn't be too hard to program drone ai to only lob bombs from certain distances...i really like the reload idea, aswell..."
5/12/2009,anything that makes carriers more interesting in a fkeet fight is something i will approve.
5/12/2009,sorry bfm i don't support this one. a simple adjustment in build cost to maybe 6-8b per ms and leave them otherwise the same would be a good compromise. their current cost is clearly not in line with their usefulness but the answer isn't making even more powerful big ships. could you imagine a wave of remote stealth bomber attacks on a single target while the mothership chills out at a safe pos? that would be as broken as remote doomsdays.
5/12/2009,"1. they wouldn't be stealthed, they also would warp in a specific distance from the target not the person commanding the drones specifically to avoid that kind of abuse. to assure the person receiving the attack had time to respond and encouraging people to use support fleets on the same grid as capitals.2. ms are 10-13b min cost as is, dropping it by 2-4b wouldn't even begin to give them a real purpose just make them a tiny bit less worthless. they need a niche nothing else can fill."
5/12/2009,i hear some corps have as many as 5 motherships that they could use at once in the same system! could you imagine coordinated attacks of this nature with those weapons while the motherships stay perfectly safe?
5/12/2009,"no support in current form. looks more like a proposal for a giant capless remote smartbomb flack cannon.as an aoe damager or a heavy hitter, ms's would start encroaching on dreads' or support's roles.bombers would be cool, but should be just larger fighters that are slower, hit harder, and track less. slow enough that when they orbit they have trouble shooting bs's. damage somewhere in the 2k range for a carrier. any more encroaches on dreads.bombers should be a tradeoff from versatility to firepower like every other weapon system."
5/12/2009,"against someone not deploying any kind of support fleet or simply failing to react? it would be devastating. the same anti support ships that completely romp tacklers would be ideal for killing these t2 fighters(which would be no means cheap). when a fighter is deployed the moment you see it take damage you can recall it, these would be forced to finish their run even if it meant their destruction. the days of sieging 50 dreads and then sitting back knowing nothing short of 100-200 bs pose any real threat(or more dreads than you) would be gone and the fleets would be more active as a whole. positioning, support alertness, and capitals themselves would have to adapt. in pos warfare currently if you aren't a cap or bs, you have very little to do unless a fight breaks out. these bombers would give them a role in the offtime and increase the chance a fight does break out. 5 ms of these would do a lot of damage, 20 ms even moreso but through methods like size you can limit the number each ms can use and through price you can make losing them extremely painful to the ms pilot. a fighter that costs 60-70m a pop is not something im going to gleefully suicide 20 of every given chance. that said if a group can routinely field 20 ms and they can all afford a full flight of bombers and you cant manage to kill them fast enough to justify losses you take then you probably shouldn't be doing what you're doing anyways.edit: look at that i responded to everything nande said too without ever seeing his post"
5/12/2009,instead how about explore alternate roles for the mothership? maybe a deployable platform allowing repairs for ships nearby while it burns some sort of material to maintain the deployment phase? a super repping platform? maybe it can deploy fire and forget drone killer drones that just fly out in a cloud and kill drones independently until recalled? anything other than a more powerful remote damage dealer because that whole philosophy was terrible when it was first dreamed up.
5/12/2009,"i love those ideas too, im just putting forth an idea i think has potential for the devs to spitball over. i would love to see ms get any change to make them more useful just to show they are actively looking at them and tweaking."
5/12/2009,the idea of throwing your mothership into the middle of combat doing an aoe repair on ships in your fleet while in something like a siege mode would be awesome and an interesting twist on how to use expensive supercaps.
5/12/2009,"supporting a good idea.also, first!"

5/12/2009,"edit following comments edits in bolddropping cans etc to have a fight is all well and good, but it does lend itself to abuse sometimes. and there could be a much better mechanic for random fights in eve.i propose the intstant battle mehcanic.somebody wants to fight you.they right click on your ship and on the pilot section, is a ""request combat"" button.the player who you want to fight gets a message saying this person wants to fight you, just like you get when a convo starts. you can select yes or no. clicking no closes the window. you can set it to auto deny battles, to save freighers getting spammed to hell.if you select yes then both players get a new instant combat window with a few options available, and an eve voice channel, similar to the fleet mechanic, it allows players to fight without concord intervention. in the options for this section is a begin button a surrender button and a few settings to agree terms for the fight to determine the winner ie. leaves the feild = lose structure damge = lose. you can invite non combatants to your battle to place bets / and they get an expanded watch list of all the combatants similar to how it looks for the tournaments. you can move people around the instant battle window into groups. the combatants sides and the spectators side. spectators are unable to lock combatants to prevent sneaky remote repping / randoms joining the fray, and you cant move or invite new people once the fight begins. similar to the trade window there is an accept terms button. once all combatants fleet commander clicks accept, thre is a coundown of 60 seconds where combatants ships are invulnerable and cannot move / lock anything / or launch drones.if the surrender button is clicked by the fleet commander then that side becomes invulnearble and the battle is over.other sides can no longer lock that fleet and the person who surrendered is made imobile for 1 minute then ejected from the battle. (like if you light a cyno)you can have multiple combatants per side who can arrange themselves into squads and give bonuses just like in a fleet. and create as many sides as you want for the ultimate free for all tournament mechanic. edit over."
5/12/2009,stopped reading right there.no
5/12/2009,"this could be heavily abused, but i support it.if you're agreeing to fight someone, then you're agree to fight on eve's terms, which do not favour a balanced fight.i do disagree on the auto-battle timer, though, sure it'd reduce afk'rs and macro'rs, but it'd be abused more often than useful. it was a valiant thought, but the execution wouldn't work.if it were just a ""do you agree to fight me and my fleet (y/n)?"" that could time out like a fleet invitation, then it's your fault if you get blobbed after agreeing, thus, not really exploitable, just a war against stupid, which i firmly support. sure, the person could be lying about his fleet size, but that's your fault to agreeing with a legal skirmish.but i can /not/ stress how much i disagree with the auto-agree. it should just time out like a fleet invite or a chat invite. just like the soon-to-be-implemented ""sex0rz me (y/n)?"" feature."
5/12/2009,maybe you gotta click yes then. was just thinking how it could be used to kill macro miners etc. i guess pirates would just spam the local channel
5/12/2009,"yeah, you can't really hurt macro miners without hurting players in a way that they will not enjoy.the only good anti-macro fix i saw was in darkfall, where they have a specific group of gm's that, in-game, watch players and talk with them if they think they're macro-ing.but the overall idea of the op is really good."
5/12/2009,*thinks of all the afk haulers and freighters***** yeah i support this. it will never make it in the game because it breaks immersion and doesn't exactly make a lot of sense. concord looks the other way because the pilot was afk for a few minutes?
5/12/2009,"i disagree about it breaking immersion.with the timer, sure, but without, it can easily be kept out of the 'immersion-breaking mechanics' list.make it to where it can only be done off grid of stations, stargates, and other npc owned structures (like data centers)have it not affect sec because it was consentual combat between folks.as i said, this is exploitable, but all you have to do is say 'no'."
5/12/2009,hell no. wow is that way if you want dueling.
5/12/2009,"i remember a time in eve when you could attack gang members that weren't in corp, and concord wouldn't care.it'd made testing friends' tanks out easier if they weren't in corp, and made fighting friends that weren't in corp easier than having to deal with a lame wardec when all you want is to fight your friends for an hour or so before you go do some missions together.these aren't duels.i /did/ mention that fleets could get involved.this is consensual combat.we have sport fighting in real life.plenty of people would enjoy sport fighting in this.and sense eve is a sandbox, other people could jump into the fray and suicide bomb it, or it could be in lowsec and pirates could interfere, etc. etc. etc....this isn't dueling like in wow.this is a consensual fight in a public place.you friend cheering you on can jump in if they're ****ed at how the fight is going.that drunk guy across the street could've heard the yelling and thought he heard someone say something about his momma, causing him to flip out and just start swinging punches, or in this case, smartbombs...all-in-all, comparing this to wow is fail. consensual combat, and strictly-ruled duels, are two very different things."
5/12/2009,"hmm the op post realy similar to duel,even if he ads squads to it. also after 3-5mins it allows the agressor to engage freely wtf wtf wtf wtf will prevent that i wont see 100 duel requests/seconds in my freighter?should i log off if i have to be afk for 3mins? wtfthis idea is just plain stupid. if you want to fight without concord go play faction warfare or go to 0.0 those options are already there."
5/12/2009,"honestly, i agree that the timer is stupid.it needs to be like a fleet or chat invitation.send invite, if they don't accept, it times out."
5/12/2009,"it is really impressive how often this <self-censored> griefer concept comes up. why not add other options, too? ""request isk"", for example. if you dont click anything, it is assumed you want to give the requested amount of isk after 3 minutes. the only thing worse than spammers and bots are the wannabe-sheriff fascists and their flaming sword crusade against them. apart from that: the average bot is already smarter than those guys, which means it would just click ""no"", whenever one of these brain oozing combat requests would come in."
5/12/2009,"nice to see how people only ever read the op, and never the posts after =>_>=op, you should edit the timer out before people troll your topic off the board, you have a great idea, advertise it better =>_>="
5/12/2009,"saying no to a screen full of spam fight requests everytime i fly through hi-sec in a hauler.eve does have a mechanism for consensual pvp already, namely entering low/null sec. while appreciate this doesn't meet the agreed 1v1 that the op is looking for, that can be found by asking in local for this kind of fight.not supported.zos"
5/12/2009,"no, i dont like this."
5/12/2009,"i can support a duell function. one that just cut out the formality of dropping a can and reduces the extent of aggression counter compared to candropping. accepting a duell will give participants a 15 minutes personal aggression counter to each other only, meaning comrades can not intervene in highec. no guarantee for ship survival. smaller ships could be oneshot anyway.the anti-macro auto-accept proposed in the op will actually only hit afk'ers. macro programs will be scripted to detect the fight proposal. afk is not a crime, nor should it be."
5/12/2009,"i don't really see the point. in a random encounter, who would ever challenge someone they couldn't beat? and therefore, why would anyone accept such a challenge? as has been said, there are already reasonably satisfactory workarounds to do duels, and this mechanic would be abused extensively just to annoy people.sorry, no support."
5/12/2009,"because a lot of people believe in honorable combat, and other people like the idea of appearing weak to a larger opponent and then wiping the floor with them."
5/12/2009,"honorable combat is a function of honor, not game mechanics. a honorable fight is possible with existing mechanics. enforced honor is no longer honor."
5/12/2009,"going out to lowsec to go fight with friends only to be ganked by pirates isn't honour.this is not enforced honour, you could get blobbed by your opponents friends, but by saying yes, you both have the option to be honourable without concord or pirate interference."
5/12/2009,support for this.
5/12/2009,do want.
5/12/2009,"you have my support on that. my notebook -which runs eve, struggles with the station-animations too. i am a manufacturer and stay 23/7 in station and it would be nice to have an option to turn it off because the whole system is 'stuttering'. does anyone miss gamma-correction options in eve? when i enter eve i always have to adjust the screen to make it brighter and when i get out -again. problem is to run in windows mode (1024x768) and browse the web. eve is to dark again and my web is to bright..."
5/12/2009,"very much signed.for the last year and a half or so i've had to have the map open while in station or the station environment, on or off as it could be set in previous clients, ate my cpu and gpu in a most disgusting manner. viewing the starmap is only a partial fix.besides, you took away the gallente pleasure palace environment, the only one that was fun to look at.let us select a single static rendered frame that doesn't run our gpus at full load, or let us go for a good ole' black background."
5/12/2009,i can see by the dates and responses that thiis area is a waste of time
5/12/2009,you created a waste of a threat stating the obvious.
5/12/2009,"i've been searching through this forum for this, and have yet to see anything talking about it....i love the idea of faction warfare but it feels really empty, being locked into lowsec, and not really having any hold on the game world itself, other than making some areas of space more dangerous for non-fw participants than other areas...and how cool would it be to do missions for guristas and join the guristas militia out in 0.0 and fight in fw on a side that has no allies?this brings fw out into 0.0, and bring more life into fwall pirate factions have no allies, and have bases out in 0.0, making it harder to work for them.this also lowers faction standings, of course...but by killing players of one of the four factions, you raise standings with their two enemies.this, coupled with allowing alliances to ally with militia, would bring new life to fw, something that did fairly well in the beginning, and seems to be slowly dwindling out of existence... (it is most definitely not true that you can not ally while you ally...)"
5/12/2009,"when i spoke to ccp during fanfest that was one of the things that was originally planned and never got implemented. with all the problems related to fw that still need fixing one year later, i wouldn't hold your breath.i'd love to see it though."
5/12/2009,fully supported. hope to see this one day.
5/12/2009,"absolutely, i'd love to see this someday."
5/12/2009,"=^_^=yeah, i thought ccp was talking about it back before fw started, but then right before fw hit, ccp was all ""four factions"" and whatnot, and i felt really let down...all my guristas standings just sitting there, waiting to interfere with a caldari tak"
5/12/2009,"i agree and support this. the payout of mined minerals to corp / alliance is another example. we have to create seperate spreadsheets to work out the payments, then make manual transfers. with a corp / alliance market we can set the price of specific items and members can sell directly to the corp. the market can be linked to a specific wallet and the funds transferred automatically to the seller from that wallet. this will give directors more time to play the game and organize ops and less time doing admin tasks (which some do in real life at work, then escape to eve, just to be confronted with more work). sales tax should be linked to the tax rate the corp / alliance has set as general tax."
5/12/2009,this. a better contract interface will do the trick. a whole second marketplace is overkill and could get confusing.
5/12/2009,"supported.i understand the contract system does this, but only at a small level.allowing for alliance marketplaces would be a very neat feature because you could put up a lot more orders than you could make contracts, and be able to trade within alliance without having to be online.this doesn't make for easier money, it just makes for less hassle alliance trade."
5/12/2009,"like tinting the metal certain colors, or have a primary color and secondary color would be swell."
5/12/2009,"signed.corp logos wouldn't be that hard either if the logo spot on a ship was predetermined (maybe give 3 possible locations?)considering corp logos are made of layers of preset images, these are just a couple more low-bit variables to pass down the pipe.having rgb on various parts of the shim (main / 2nd / detail) would be very win, and, with those options right there, you get tons of variety from three variables, all of which would probably be very low-bit, and handled client-side. (var 1 rrggbb var 2 rrggbb var 3 rrggbb etc.)y'all argue lag? i argue will-to-implement.i won't hold it against ccp if they don't implement it, but i really would love to fly a white apocalypse with black and red details with my corp logo on it, firing infrared and multifrequency lasers at the camera for the corp photo op...."
5/12/2009,i allways wanted a pearl white domi.
5/12/2009,forgot to support!!
5/12/2009,"this is a game where we can be anything and being identifiable by our ship/ ships colors should be apart of it. ask any b-29 bomber pilot from wwii what p-51s they wanted escorting them and they would all say the red tails (the tuscogee(sp i kno)airmen)i was just looking at my hookbill and noticed that there is the ""v""s on it like you would find on current day military vehicles operating in the gulf. these could easily be replaced with our corp logos. while i would love to paint my ship urban camo, jet black, or any other color i can think of. i believe that the corp logos would add realisim to the game and give it that bit of personalization to it."
5/12/2009,should just release the same ships with different pre rendered painted schemes. not player designed.
5/12/2009,"this. this. a thousand times, this.supporting even if this is the 9,001st thread about it."
5/12/2009,"agreethe nice fancy triangle polygons on the spheres can stay but tone the glow down or make the polygons larger so there's not so many of them.... or use some similar solution to tone down the visuals while probing.also ot: why does a signature found by 3 probes report a single dot, pre 1.1 it was two dots as it should be?"
5/12/2009,"i like it as is. i don't see any reason to change the graphics, they're not ugly and are quite clear. the new probing mechanism was the best change i've seen in eve in years also."
5/12/2009,/signed
5/12/2009,"your a damn moron. you obviously have no experience with macroratters or people who are most likely using ""bacon"" if that crap is still around or are in the category yourself. when you jump into a system and within 2 seconds the raven poofs off the scanner and cloaks that is total bull****. at that point it's impossible to kill and i am not bad.to the carebears crying about not being able to tell when pirates are coming after you, start supporting better intel tools. but realize the same pirates also won't be able to see you in your precious local.at least when your rats mwd'd off of belts you could still kill them. op supported, get local out of here."
5/12/2009,"not supported.just the thought of having to click every few seconds to check out local is mind numbing and boring.lets make changes that make the game more fun and stop trying to do things that turns it more into a job !not to mention things like hunting down wartargets in empire would become virtually impossible.undocking would give anyone outside the station too much of an advantage(especially if they were a cloaked gang).plus it would probably result in a lot less systems being used in 0.0 as most would start ratting/mining in the dead end constellations with a scout giving them plenty of warning.also if you use a system that is well traveled even by you're own corp/alliance you would have to repeatedly get safe everytime you pick a ship up on scan,since there is no way to tell wether it's a friend or foe.same when you're traveling or scouting how could you properly hunt targets down ,there would be no more big roams you would get bored continually scanning and hunting down every scan hit within about 3 jumps (probably take a few hours to travel that as well,checking out every hit,especially if you had to get the ship on grid just to see if it's friendly or not)"
5/12/2009,what he said
5/12/2009,"not supported.if people think that removing local will help increase the incidence of pvp they need their heads examined.the majority of people playing eve are risk averse, removing local will simply ensure that those risk averse players will do more to limit their exposure to risk. in other words they will stay docked or in poses unless they really need to travel and when they do travel they will blob up even more than they do now to provide mutual protection... in busy systems the scanner is pretty useless for detecting potential inbound hostiles and the result will not be that more people will be caught in belts - but that less people will be in belts to start with... in my view the removal or local will actually damage pvp by reducing opportunities not enhance it..."
5/12/2009,"this would damage it in some areas and enhance it in others, you are either blind to the truth behind how awesome it would be, or have all of your fun hunting these 'at-risk' people because it's super easy for you.having it this way makes it more challenging for pirates, but also make it more safe for both.it won't lower pvp because most pirate gangs i run into have at least one member with combat probes, it would just raise necessity for mining gangs to have one aswell.technically, this all makes life harder for the miners, not the pirates, because they have to counter probe to be safe. pirates are already probing to find out /where/ people are, anyway.it's easier to probe for offense than it is defence.i'm also not saying we /remove/ local. i like delayed local.all of this also brings back more of ""the unknown"" to space.sure, it'll /feel/ safer, but you won't be able to do a thing without be mad paranoid.... instead of how it is now, where most don't even bother /trying/ to do anything, because it's too easy for one side. it needs to be balanced for both sides, without stupid security rules or anything. the best way to help this is by, instead of adding some lame mechanic that nerfs piracy in lowsec or some****, nerf local to be delayed, this puts both pirates and miners on an even playing surface.the current way local is... imho, it's cheating, and i'm not even saying this because i get ganked a lot. i use local as my hunting tool. there is something seriously wrong there.and i heavily disagree here, sure, some systems will /feel/ more empty, but overall system traffic will go up because less people will be scared to go out, and highsec traffic will probably lower slightly, spreading the eve population out a bit.imho, if this were to happen, we'd see a lot of highsec corps move to lowsec because it won't be a useless, low-reward, suicide trip."
5/12/2009,i support this. what other pvp game tells you the number of people and who is around? death spam in local is one thing. however it takes away from the game having this.
5/12/2009,"it's truehow awesome was it in uo getting snuck up on by a player-assassin in the woods?! you had no idea he was in 'local'.i can't think of a single mmo that made it anywhere with openworld pvp and a list of everyone near you...not saying that eve isn't makin' it, it most definitely is, but instant local doesn't make sense, especially when you start getting out into lowsec and further...maybe keep highsec instant to keep highsec wars good?this will also add a different form of risk, because no one's hidden in highsec, so suicide gankers wouldn't start ruling the world again, and wars could be fought the way they've always been fought... until you have to chase your targets into lowsec for a real fun game of can and mouse..."
5/12/2009,"not supported.if you accept an application to a corp, that means you trust them enough to allow them to 'test your tank' for free.if you aren't sure if you can trust them or not, then you should do some research on their employment history.there are always ways implemented in-game to deal with asshats. hell, corp member fires on you against your will? kick him from corp before you pop, then your good little friends at concord will deal with him. if you aren't a director, then sucks to be you, and you can take it up with your superiors.sorry if you aren't a director or a ceo, but, it's called hierarchy. deal."
5/12/2009,do not support.maybe a 30 minute timer instead of 15 for being an *******.concord needs not meddle in these things.
5/12/2009,war collaborators should be flagged for the rest of the war.
5/12/2009,this
5/12/2009,"i'd sign this idea in its own thread. if you rep someone involved in a war you should become permanently involved in that war and become a permanent target of the side fighting against the side you just aided.for example if x corp and y alliance are at war and z player reps a member of y alliance, z is now permanently aggro to x corp until the war between x and y is concluded.modify the wars tab to include wars that the player has interfered with, also indicating which side they are now on, and have them sent a mail by concord at the conclusion of the war so that they know their permanent aggro is gone. allow members of the at war parties to see character links to players who have collaborated with the enemy as well. either make collaborators show up as war targets, or give them a similar tag on overview and in local.leave concord out of it. the less they interfere with player activities the better."
5/12/2009,"so your intel was wrong. your bad.that is against common sense. actually, in most civilized countries it is illegal not to get involved.all these concepts are nothing but nonsense. if a character has more friends than you, no matter whether they are mains or alts, it is your bad luck. not his. i recently helped a buddy who was being shot up, even though he was no in my corp. why would it be illegal for me to do that? does it really make sense to you to stand by and watch, while an ally gets shot up, even though you could help him? that is just sick. getting concorded would be even sicker. wardec means concord isn't watching. you expect them to suddenly grow a conscience, when someone steps in on one side and helps out?"
5/12/2009,glad to hear that the powers that be are considering this. losing drones to a minor power flicker is a major annoyance.

5/12/2009,"how do you get that ""thumb up"" icon, if possible, this suggestion has one from me too.ah, found it...d'oh"
5/12/2009,"scamming is good. spamming, and the encouragement to spam mindless eye tricks, is bad. people should be rewarded for the effort of creating a good scam, not able to set them up with a few clicks and a bot."
5/12/2009,"i don't fully support yet, evolve this a bit.i mentioned in the ""nerf local"" thread about how if we had delayed local in all of space, we could possibly have special ""cov ops scan probes"" that could /only/ detect cloaked ships, had a maximum of 4au, and were possibly faster at scanning down.it would only take one probe to know if a cloaked ship (or fleet) existed, but that one probe would have really short range, so it'd take time to comb a system with these probes to see if it's completely clear, and of course it'd still take normal triangulation to actually warp to said ship. (maybe instead of making the probes stronger, just give a hidden 'cloaked sig radius' attribute that is like 250% (pick a better number, this is just an idea) the normal sig radius.i'ma keep an eye on this op, i like the basic idea, i'll possibly support it soon, keep those wheels turning."
5/12/2009,"if you can see it, you can lock it. maybe you won't be able to lock it instantly, but within 5 seconds interceptors are going to bump that cloaked vessel. no support. this breaks fleet intelligence and does not fix cloaked ravens as mentioned earlier."
5/12/2009,"no, it is not good idea.leave cloaking alone as it is."
5/12/2009,i think the cloaking mechanics are fine as is.
5/12/2009,nope
5/12/2009,"i support this non-idea!1)i think it'd be neat to see some more variety of ships...maybe some cross-faction ships that aren't just overpowered pirate/navy ships?like... maybe there's a gallente cruiser with a laser bonus, or an amarr frigate that specializes in rockets and drones?these would take some extra time for a character of that race to grab, and when another character is training into another race, it gives them a ship that they can get into sooner, while also boosting the amount of visual variety in the game...2)i also would like to see some more faction mining ships. surely ore isn't the only faction in the galaxy that mines... and the 'mining ships' for factions are complete crap. maybe some comparible faction mining barges that are easier to get into but not as good as their same-sized variants? like an amarr mining barge that can armour tank really well, can use two strippers, but only gets tank and cargo bonuses, and no mining bonuses... or maybe there's a gallente frigate that can use 5 mining drones and a stripper, with a mining drone yield bonus....3)yes. destroyers should destroy things that are already alive, not destroy wrecks. something's wrong here /="
5/12/2009,"mh, yeah... ok then. i agree. a little.1. what about bc's and destroyers? but yes, caldari could use some more rail boats (come on, merlin (split) cormy (not so good) moa (ok'ish) ferox (needs moar grid to do what it's intended to do) rokh (one of the best ships in the game imo), but then that's all. some more would be nice), and minmatar could use some more dedicated hp layout ships (i.e: more ships dedicated to one weapon system), and amarr could do with some ships that actually have a role (other than ""scorch online (tm)""), gallente need some serious help, and i don't mean croissants. oh, and yes, adding t3 when t2 has become the norm. maybe balancing the current set of t1 ships would be better, or maybe adding some more useful t1 ships.2. yes, agree. the current selection is a bit limited.3. make more destroyers? destroyers with bonuses that allow them to use medium guns maybe? t2 destroyers that are more like assault ships? i would love to have some of that.0.0 and the whole sov system needs some work, and yes, it needs doing fast. however, since everyone seems locked on the idea of reinventing shoot a to remove alliance b's sov, then place a in system b, i don't really see the point of making any changes at all.all in all, supported, with a few adjustments."
5/12/2009,"supported, though i think 10 seconds is more reasonable."
5/12/2009,no support for the op.this would eliminate one dilemma and in turn create a massively exploitable game mechanic.
5/12/2009,i can't imagine a massive exploit of not being able to shoot or be shot for a few seconds after loginso i support this... i would withdraw my support if someone showed me an exploit that's worse than the current exploit of this not being implemented
5/12/2009,"i support.station owner should be able to boot jump clones, and assets should be moved to impounded.this makes perfect sense, and can keep the old alliance from having a backup reinforcement fleet ready to spawn out of your own base, with ships already in hangar.i honestly think this makes perfect sense."
5/12/2009,"we all know ppl complain about low sec in one way or another. pirates hate wtz, the lag etc etc. fw hates the lag, no rewards, the pirates etc etc, and the carebears hates low sec. (hell, even the 0,0 guys hate low sec).but, there are a few out there that loves low sec with all it brings, and hopefully some of those that love low sec are csm candidates, so what i ask of you is to tell the rest of us your views and hopes about low sec.basicly, why should we overlooked low sec players vote for you???"
5/12/2009,"because i live in and love low sec. it's where i spend 99% of my time. i'm chronically aware of the problems faced by pirates, casual pvpers and industrialists operating in lowsec (i conduct all three activities across my accounts). i want to see more incentives to bring players to lowsec without nerfing highsec (well, at least not too much)."
5/12/2009,"low sec is an area often overlooked by ccp and players. i agree that many that inhabit high sec (well, empire where concord response gives a degree of safety) don't ventue into low sec enough. it should be a testing grounds for pvp/pve before graduating into 0.0/wh space. alternatively, it's a decent area to live and earn a good income. however, that said...it could do with some additional content for -sec players. ideally, something like pirate npc corps permenently at war (or periodically changing dependng on player actions) that players can join. make content for these such as stations with pirate modules etc.i'm sure there are many other good ideas about for improving low sec. i'll be looking out for such ideas once in the csm.xavier hayes"
5/12/2009,"i think low sec ought to have a boost. i suggested an issue recently that would force people doing lowsec hauler missions to carry valuable items instead of the 1 unit of quafe they usually do(mostly to solve the macro hauler problem, but will also boost lowsec). we need to increase the rewards of lowsec to convince people that they will make more money in the end despite the danger involved. going from lowsec to 0.0 is a rather small step but i think there needs to be more effort made towards helping players overcome taking that big step between highsec and lowsec."
5/12/2009,"i've made fixing lowsec a major part of my platform with no less than three separate proposals for how to make lowsec more profitable and better-populated. nothing directly to boost pirates, but pirates will gain enough from an actual choice of targets that they don't need any direct boosts, just a vibrant lowsec to prey on. ultimately, lowsec needs to be better than highsec at pretty much everything(though not as much better as 0.0 is) in order to compensate for the increased risk. in some ways it is already - l5 missions bring people in, fw brings people in, faster line times at npc labs gets people moving stuff in, and the moon minerals, while nothing like 0.0 alliance income, can also bring in a decent amount. that said, lowsec missioning is not as well-supported as highsec, lowsec mining is a bad joke, and not much of the other content seems to bring people out either. i don't want it to be overbalanced, or to have people abandoning 0.0 for the mad profits of lowsec, but it should be a place where corps who can't hack in in 0.0 can still go, get their feet wet, and have some higher-risk, higher-reward fun."
5/12/2009,i have been an advocate of fixes in low sec from the begining of my csm focus. a lot of the out of band conversations directy with ccp in iceland was about how we can improve the low sec experience.basically low sec is not correctly balanced in terms of risk/reward and needs a revamp.issler
5/12/2009,"i think the current issue is:hisec: cool beans, mission (mid ends from refined loots, high ends from drone missions), mine trit, labs etc etclowsec: mission for more lp than highsec (and maybe get ganked), mine mid ends (lol i can mission for that stuff) do exploration (i can get that stuff in hisec if i look hard enough), i can build caps (jump freighters=no risk)...nullsec (excellent missions in npc 0.0) good rats, good ore, good plexes... can build caps in npc stations or outposts.right now there's not enough to set lowsec apart from 0.0 or indeed lowsec apart from hisec... right now there needs to be some sort of compelling reason for the average player who isn't into pos reactions or building caps for venturing into lowsec. bs rats were a good start... but really it needs expanding on. i would like to see all t1 (meta 1) loot removed from missions and a good deal of the ice removed from hisec (after all, it's capitals and poses that use ice and these are mainly lowsec/0.0 things that use these) but am well aware of the knock on effect this will have. we all hate our chinese brothers who mine 23/7 in the ice belts but praise them for our cheap isotopes. but yes... perhaps it is time for a change."
5/12/2009,"i do quite a bit of low sec exploration and i like the added danger without the hassle of 0.0 politics. but i have to agree with larkonis.. right now there isnt a whole lot of benefits to going to low sec versus the isk alternatives of 0.0. i'll be honest and admit that i dont know how it could be improved, but i'd love for low sec to be more than just the 'bit between 0.0 and high sec'."
5/12/2009,move the positive quality level 4 agents to low sec. giving people who want to make more isk have to take a risk while making it. it would increase the traffic into low sec making pirates happier even the the majority of isk makers would rather stick in high sec doing the crappier quality agents but more will venture overall to 0.0. also gives pirates a better ability to make isk and fix security status on their off time if they decide to make one of these systems their home.
5/12/2009,"whats your stance on the mwd+cloak situation, especially the gimping of recons and cov ops thats currently happening on sisi. are you for or against any changes to this tactic/bug?what are your ideas in regards to small gang impact on sovereinty? is this is the wrong thread to ask stuff?"
5/12/2009,"it's something that should have stopped a long time ago and finally is. ccp needs to figure out a better way to allow coverts and recons to do it tho. under the current sov system - none. but as ccp are currently working on a new sov system, i'll wait to see where they are heading and if it needs ideas for small gang combat then suggest as appropriate.ask away"

5/12/2009,"i have been playing eve long enough to understand the diversity of this game. i understand the issues that many players address, from sovereignty in null space to alliance logistics in hi sec. i know, without a doubt, that heartstone will fully address and assemble solutions that are in the best interest for all.my vote's for heartstone."
5/12/2009,"voted for heartstone, i think he will make an excellent csm representative."
5/12/2009,it is a very critical period for many aspects of eve gameplay in the next six months - faction warfare and 0.0 revamp right at the top of the agenda. its important that we have candidates on the csm that understand faction warfare and what needs to be done to improve and enhance this area of gameplay - just as its vital that the interests of small unit pvp and raiding playstyle is represented in the new ideas for sovereignty development. as a result i fully support heartstone's candidacy and would advise anyone currently wanting ccp to pay more attention to faction warfare and small unit combat to cast their vote in this direction.
5/12/2009,"you see, redsplat, the csm will never be able to design game changes for ccp. consequently, ccp has repeatedly asked the csm to comment on the ""larger"" picture of where we would like to game to be developed. i know, that has already led to frustration, where the csm is called a pr gag of ccp to keep the gamers in line.given this landscape, i would be highly satisfied, if we could incentivize ccp to talk about radical changes in the game. they have gotten more and more conservative and cautious as the game has grown in the recent past. once we have started talking about bringing pilots out of empire space, they will have their own ideas, where we can then again intervene and shape.if you want to hear a radical idea of mine? the security status is today much too artificial. it should not be a cause, but a consequence. look at my concord refactoring idea: if the sec status is just showing how many marshals are around and not triggering any stupidly automated npc police, then a well organized pirate force could bring even luminaire down to 0.1 ;)hearstone, i must admit that i am already happy, when ooc remarks stay out of my corp chat, and that we have abolished tendencies of colleagues to bring alts into the company, or even to have an alt at all. i am not too familiar with the history, if not published in the more popular capsuleer news casts since 105. i admit, i'm basically reading the scope. you are running as well for the office. i am looking forward to discussing backstory impact (more regarding the future, not so much clearing past contradictions...) with you regardless of both of us, one, or none is finally elected."
5/12/2009,"going over this thread i am reading all posts with a heavy sense of ambiguity. i'll recognize that ankh has been very prolific towards both ccp as well as theeve community as a whole. whether a concerted effort of all csm members or bygrace of her tenaciousness alone, she did manage to push through the skill queuewhich has turned out to be a very popular and much appreciated feature. so, in thatlight, i would say that i'm happy to have voted for her in the last election. however! and i will largely be addressing my misgivings here concerning mylittle corner of the eve sandbox, i find both her and your addressing of fw issueshighly suspect. with ank's unsuccesful bid to introduce even a modicum of change andnothing but vague intentions on your end, i am beginning to suspect take care onlyincludes fw as an issue in order to garner votes from a sizeable part of the evedemographic. ankh's activity in fw has been limited to advertising her csm campaign and brieflymaking a cameo during a ccp event, in which she promptly switches sides in the hopesof attaining a ccp issued medal. though her in-game loyalties are not for anyone toscrutinize, one would have hoped that - at the very least - she would have takenthis opportunity to gauge popular opinion in both militias she has partaken in.no such thing happened however. and in spite of many of the more heavily involved corps trying to get their viewpoints across to ccp, she never showed any effort to acquaint herself with these issues, let alone represent them.now you are asking for the votes of those that partake in fw, advertising yourself as""being the only one who has fw on the agenda"", but by my estimation your credentials onthis are even worse than ankh's. do you have eyes and ears in all the militias? do youknow what the common issues are? or what people have proposed to change this? if so, canyou more carefully delineate your propositions? if only to show you, in fact, have your finger on the pulse of fw.kind regards,anwar"

5/12/2009,"voting booths have opened, and i'm right there at the top, easy to vote for ;)also a slight update to my website. i had a whole lot of ideas to add, but i seemed to forget them to moment i look at the website's content management system :("
5/12/2009,there have been half a dozen threads already.
5/12/2009,"i too will vote for one of the candidates that takes fw issues seriously.in particular i also want system occupancy to give some advantage to members of the militia in that system. it dosen't have to be huge, if i get say +5% shields / armor in every minamatar occupied system that's great.also make the militia store operate on victory points and give militia-specific items (they don't have to be better then the faction ones, just different so we have something to aim for and be excited about)."
5/12/2009,"ankhesentapemkah i agree ccp do need to adjust their mindset regarding fixing the many shortcommings of factional warfare. there are many threads that capture the specifics, the op dex on this thread has mentioned a number key areas that need to be fixed fast. if as you say ccp are interested in launching new content to obtain additional subscriptions for percieved profitability then this sounds like flawed logic and short sightedness. surely a subscription saved is of equal value to a subscription gained. over time i have seen many pilots come and go from the fw ranks and i'd say roughly half of those that depart unsubscribe their accounts while the other half explore other facets of eve. we the fw players have a right to a standard of service from ccp as paying subscribers who every month make a decison to vote with our real life cash to support the product. i and a large number of the fw pilots are looking for a csm candidate who will hold ccp accountable to their commitment to build and develop the fw game content. we are looking for a candidate that will lobby and passionately represent a shift of focus from introducing any new content until the existing content issues are fixed. csm candidates there are likely thousands of votes on offer on the fw content all votes that are free from the usual alliance / 0.0 political voting lines, we could be the marginal voters that make or break your election campaign. voters that will respond favorably to a candiadte representing fw are comprised of all current fw content players plus the many who have either left or avoided the broken content and would like to experience the thrills of pvp on demand that fw does offer. give us a candidate we can confidently endorse and we will give you our votes and our trust to represent our community."

5/12/2009,done ;)and got some votes for you in my alliance too.
5/12/2009,"is this some kind of false advertising to get votes?from another thread:and the reason web was changed was the nano nerf and people complained to die in web range to easy. unfortunaly many people don<U+FFFD>t understand the real meaning of web range for blasterships that have not billion isk tanks and 90% faction webs like in the fancy vid you refered to. also mwding in range don<U+FFFD>t hurts, it is the basic thing that seperates blaster ships from others and should be her main drawback(and we allready have preaty deacend lasers for people that don<U+FFFD>t like this). to low damage to keep up with the heavy tanks of today and a to weak web to hold down and hit your target on the other hand actualy are problems that are very real(the problems of solo blaster ships that fighting in blaster range)."
5/12/2009,"good luck on your application.... and now a list of my peeves, hehefor drone options, but good for other menu's....have the option to disable or hide certain menu items like abandon drones vs ordering drones to return to drone bay, they are right next to each other and so easy to accidentally choose the wrong one in the heat of battle. sure it asks if we are sure but then u gotta hunt down the no button then redo what u wanted to do losing very precious time.something to remove the ctrl-q logout exploit, maybe if we send a tell to a person in local, even if they dont accept, some sort of timer begins.larger asteroids on respawn day. kinda lame that roids dont fill at least a can.medium webber drones maybe an option to rename our chars. game can show name history like employment history but how many of us have alts that have names we like but can't use because we didnt think of it and our mains are to high to change.an option not to be ejected from a station when we undock going uber speeds, takes freakin forever to get my orca to slow and align in the right direction for warpage. prob same for capital sized ships, etc.being able to align to bookmarks. if i have a station bookmarked, i cant align to it."

5/12/2009,"a bump and a shout out!thanks to eveyone that has contacted me directly with your support. i am definitiely still in the running and committed to the values i have stated previously. my alliance recently experienced two wars back to back and it renewed my commitment to focusing on making wars have more defined purpose and clearer rules for declaration and definition of what constitutes ""winning"".i hope the ""bears of eve"" will support me in my run for a second term in the csm. i hope i can continue to offer ccp the feedback that the pve/industrial/casual/missioning/solo/small corporation/non-pirate players of eve would give in a manner that keeps eve a great experience for the full range of pilots in the 'verse.issler"
5/12/2009,"could the csm candidates please also state what they think should be done instead if this tactic gets killed off? since the inception of cloaks (and thus the mwd/cloak trick) remote sensor boosted hics have been introduced and wcs have become extremely crap and useless anyway .. see hics. the current system is balanced (if you have semi competent decloaker bumper in your lame low sec camp).edit: btw the domi example sounds pretty unlikely. i think he got lucky with the random ""you fail to target nothing"" locking bug that happens quite often. a full inertiaed domi still needs 5 seconds to get in warp. a 1000 scan res hic should lock it no worries unless you get the locking bug."
5/12/2009,"gatecamping is boring, i don't like giving people more reasons to do it.also this takes away one of the few ways interdictors have of surviving past one bubble in a fleet fight(besides incredible luck), and i generally don't like having valid tactics taken away from us."
5/12/2009,the god awful new player experience was also conveniently neglected by the csms. just like last election and the election before that.
5/12/2009,"just wondering what, if you have any, is your take on missions, and do you have any ideas to present to ccp. many of us believe that they need a bit more substance, to kill some of that repeatitive feeling you get grinding them out, i think storylines need to be more drawn out and in depth, making you really feel connected with the corp you running them for. what do you guys think?"
5/12/2009,i think a full roll out of the epic arc mission system would add a lot in terms of immersion to the mission running side of eve. i spoke to a dev involved in them at the fanfest last year and if what he described as the plan for them wasn't 100% alcohol induced i think we shall see some marvelous things from it if it ever does reach the light of tranquility. it is certainly something i would like to see.whilst i do have a few ideas of my own in regards to missions i wouldn't raise them with ccp without consultation with the playerbase so i will post them later on the sister forum to this but to give an idea one of the main things i am in favour of looking at is dynamic agent quality based on player usage of said agent.
5/12/2009,i guess this issue i raised might make hauler missions more interesting
5/12/2009,i believe there are already some exciting new missions in the works. ccp wanted to get the new mission infrastructure in place and now that it is i know they are bus working on new and exciting mission content.issler
5/12/2009,"this...mazz has hit the nail right on the head here...i still believe eve is a pvp game... by all means go and mission for isk, but too many people are penalized for taking this route early on and digging themselves deeper and deeper into the hole that is negative faction standing. there is currently no way to recover this beyond certain skills, and they only delay the inevitable.ref epic mission arcs... i haven't had the chance to try them (thanks to my terrible sec) but i have heard good things... i would like to see more involvement by ccp and perhaps a reintroduction of the aurora team (albeit with massive oversight) giving the average bod more involvement in the day to day politics and functions of the universe.a new expansion is out... the slaves are free... wat? i'd like to see the players affect the story of the universe a lot more..."

5/12/2009,a corpmate asked about this issue at evevegas this past weekend and it seems the devs said flat out that alliances will never be allowed into fw.how very disappointing.
5/13/2009,seems we were missed in 1.2 :/ can everyone thats supporting this topic please get there friends to support it as well? maybe it needs to hit a certain ammount of pages before ccp pay attention.
5/13/2009,ok now that csm elections have begun maybe if a candiate who would like several hundred votes might like to step forward and support this as well?
5/13/2009,"wang jing is making some really solid points here that i think will provide a boost to the af's of all races without destoying either game balance or ship roles.as a minnie pilot i agree wholeheartedly with the proposed addition of the rifters tracking bonus and a swtich in the optimal/falloff bonuses. atm i tend to fly a jag fitted as ""tough tackle"" as someone mentioned above, which is great, fun, useful... just very dissapointing when i can't orbit at speed and hit for **** due to poor tracking.i wouldn't argue that the jag or wolf needs any dps boost other than the improved hit rate.zos"
5/13/2009,"yep, my thoughts exactly. even though they put out less dps than some of their counterparts, minmatar ships should be able to use the flexibility of their weapon systems combined with their natural speed to compete. for example, when fighting an enyo with a wolf, you need to get out to 5 or 6 km where the falloff you gain with barrage ammo allows you to outdamage him. on the otherhand, a harpy or retribution will still cause you problems at this range, and so you should be able to get in tight and outtrack them. unfortunately this simply does not work without a tracking bonus."
5/13/2009,"i also want to mention that since assault ships are getting a nerf to agility this coming patch, giving them a boost is all the more essential."
5/13/2009,"sigh, too right. they will struggle to get past camps with a proper tackler after the patch, and that is a huge nerf."
5/13/2009,"definetely useful, especially if you can designate certain wallet divisions for certain tasks (such as seperate areas for buy/sell orders)supportedem."

5/13/2009,fof missiles anyone?
5/13/2009,here's a brilliant idea: disable it for fof missiles. not that you can't already use drones for the exact same purpose in missions. it's not like lasers aren't already the best weapon systems by a wide margin. giving auto-fire after reload to missiles/projectiles/hybrids would hardly change that.
5/13/2009,"looks like we get a fix, people! go fly your nagls this weekend! tell me how they fair!"
5/13/2009,"yes, yes, yes, oh god please yes.in case anyone hadn't noticed i'm fully in favour of this idea"
5/13/2009,there's nothing that can't be improved in this game by ccp banning the right ten per cent of its players .. not that many of us will agree which ten percent.definitely worth a try.

5/13/2009,but yes... id give up jump cloning for good if that was available as an option.i support this - the ability to switch out of implants combined with the removal of jump clones.
5/13/2009,"i don't support the op, but i even less support this.you're stupid to think they need to be nerf'd.if anything, they /do/ need a couple boosts in a couple areas. mamas need the ability to let jump clones jump out, and a few other minor changes.this removes the whole /point/ of implants."
5/13/2009,a solid and intelligent arguement... you've turned my opinion around entirely.
5/13/2009,how do you figure that?implants come in various sizes and flavors.... and do all sorts of stat changes.your still likely to get blown up.... still likely to spend piles of isk for them....still likely to lose them upon death.so i fail to see what the problem is in the logic.or are you just trying to troll?epic fail if that's the case.

5/13/2009,"wouldn't surprise me if ccp is being blackmailed.like, ""pay us a zillion yuan's or usd, or we will keep spamming till there is no tomorrow.""i feel bad for the people in the newb corp who apparantly have to deal with monotonous isk spam every 30. second (!). it shouldn't be a csm issue though, but perhaps they could push for getting some comments from ccp about the prospect of dealing with isk spammers."
5/13/2009,"i'd obviously like this to get fixed, but i'm not sure what the solution is. having someone in channel who can channel-block them would help(be they a paid gm or an isd volunteer), having right-click reporting would help, but macroing together trial accounts to spam with is too easy for eradication to be possible. the best overall solution is probably making sure new players know about plex, and that they can buy isk legally instead of having to do it illegally. yeah, you might get twice as much, but it's not a deal if you lose all that money to ccp caching you."
5/13/2009,"isk selling is one of the few things that actual gets under my nerves in this game. so yeah i agree that ccp needs to overall need to watch it better, but even more so in the newbie corp channels. i think that perhaps one way to do this would be first add a right click option for reporting isk selling spam. then automated counter would alert a gm after so many reports. gm could check chat records to see if they were spamming, and then bring down the ban hammer."
5/13/2009,"titans costing billions hasn't stopped anyone from ninja-ddd'ing. overpowered with relatively low risk leads to whoring in selective circumstances, leading to virtually no vulnerability and total exploitation. at least the nano-titans finally got nerfed.agreed.i get it now. there have been a lot of posts about sub-cap anti-caps, and lots of angry responses about how this is nothing more than a fairy tale luke skywalker hull. this is more like putting a flock of luke skywalkers into the hands of a ms pilot though. so the circle of insanity is complete at the capital level and as far as blowing up fighter clouds, first of all you have remote ecm burst and second of all anything that blows up fighter clouds like this will have an even more devastating effect on support fleets, which have larger sigs than fighters.i see how you're trying to enforce support fleets as an essential part of eve by necessitating them through the anti-capital threat, but doing it via a capital tool isn't the way. when you look at subcap combat, the reason why it's not always about who fits for the best speed, dps, and tanking etc is because of ewar mixing things up. right ewar makes the wrong gang mixup a total loss. what we need are better recons that focus on caps.personally i'd like to see ms's get some kind of really nice ""uplink"" mod that could be activated on a logistics to turn it into a motherphocking awesome logistics :-d would see layered spidering and more elaborate fleet organization. uplinked ms feeds 8 logistics a constant supply of cap, armor, and shield to let them do their thing with higher scan res and more individualized loving."
5/13/2009,while i agree with you almost completely every time ccp suggests a subcap cap killer you get hordes of cap pilots who dont like their 2b isk ship being killed by 2-3 100m isk ships.
5/13/2009,"sub-cap cap killers always go the wrong direction. by and large, none of the stuff i threw down in my idea for upscale recons would result in capital death directly. therefore they are not cap killers and you still need a lot of isk in ships and pilots, cap or subcap, to do the killing part.i mean, if you increase turret cap you can cause a relatively low intelligence moros or rev pilot to burn up their defensive cap. the anti-spider/triage mods would undoubted affect the survivability of lone carriers and carrier groups, but the siege-mod damage reduction would provide a way to respond by gimping the heavy hitters in cap fights, thus lowering the overall damage flow anyway.anti-cap force multipliers of the upper-echelon subcap price point i think would be a fair solution for everyone that would really add a lot of unpredictability to large scale combat as well as adding more need for tacklers and recons to both aid and intercept those force multipliers."
5/13/2009,"ccp is about to release the new patch to change citadel torpedoes but they arent changing explosion velocity. the thing that actually needs to be fixed is being ignoredccp stop being ridiculous and fix explosion velocity on citadels, or at least tell us what your reasoning is for not fixing them now. it only requires you to change 1 number....cmon!!end the speed tanking motherships"

5/13/2009,"if you look at the apocrypha trailer, the ui is much cooler looking. i personally think eve should have a more futuristic/holographic ui. just look at the map scene and you will see what i am talking about.i really wish the ui provided more information on random stuff. maybe if you have a ship scanner, it would work like the trailer's scanner did, a 3d ship image popped up and the different modules were identified and you could click on them. this could also be utilized in the fittings area.i know this isn't a pressing issue, but i think it would add more ""cool"" to the game.if not this then please allow custom ui's made by other people. i know we all hate wow, but my cousin plays it and the custom ui's that some people have made are pretty nifty. they allow you to see information the way you want it to be seen.agree with me or let the flaming begin."
5/13/2009,"i support this, though i really like the ui how it is.the only reasons i support this are:1. as much as i love the ui how it is, it's not very intuitive, and a lot of things that should look cooler do not (like scanning, for instance, a perfect example, my friend)2. people might argue the ""need for speed"" clause... i disagree, for this would be 100% client-side. maybe even have the option for ""classic ui"" for the old schoolers that like the current look, like myself. (now y'all have nothing to complain about, gtfo.)i would love to see a ship scanning animation, or maybe when you use a survey scanner, a ""pulse"" goes out from your ship with dx9 and highlights all the roids it hits for a half a second (for looks, not for use, you get all the info you need from the scanner itself)or maybe a codebreaker brings up a password roller that goes while the codebreaker is on (again, purely asthetic), or an analyzer could actually act like it was analyzing the object, scanning different parts of it and whatnot...this is a much unneeded change, but i fully support it happening."

5/13/2009,this should be in jita park.>.<;/me gags on stench
5/13/2009,"as seen by the dramatic increase in bomb usage, the mutiple changes introduced by ccp recently regarding stealth bomber abilities and bomb costs have been very succesfull. the considerable volume of the bombs is well justified as a game balance feature to make firing bombs a tactical choice rather then just spamming them at every opportunity.this is however severely limiting the ability of bombers to carry the void and lockbreakers in addition to their standard racial damage type. a typical bomber carries two bombs in the launcher and two spares in the cargohold. in this setup it is not possible to switch ammo types as the two bombs need to be moved to the cargo first and that is not possible. the restrictions in reloading (requiring the jettisoning of bombs which has a timer, affects the ability to cloak and creates a warp to point) could easily be avoided by changing the way reloading works.as it is now the ammo is first moved from the weapon to the cargohold and then the new ammo goes into an unknown parallel dimension while the reload timer is running, to appear back in our reality once loading finished.if the ammo present would also be able to utilize this tear in the space time continuum it could first be moved out of the launcher only to appear in the cargohold once the ammo being reloaded had also left that space."
5/13/2009,"loli support the op, but this through my head on a tangent...why not make bombs work more slightly differently...maybe you put 'empty' bombs in your launcher and cargohold, and have 'warheads' that you can put in these bombs that take up very little space.this would allow you to change damage/utility easily, without making it easier for people to have more bombs, or changing the size of utility bombs."
5/13/2009,"why not give the bomber a ""bomb rack"" or separate hold for the bomb ammo not loaded in the launcher. this would eliminate the ammo issues. i agree but with a bit of tweeking. we could really go out on a limb and request a rig mod (for bombers only) to make this possible. have the rig affect the speed similar to a hull expander in the low slots."
5/13/2009,no support for this. if you want to fight someone. start shooting... who care about the concorduken?
5/13/2009,this feature is already in game. get out of hi-sec.
5/13/2009,"/not supportedyes, the mechanics to fight someone in high sec are a little indirect, but they exist none the less, and require trust.don't trust your opponent to honor a 1v1? don't fight him, or have a backup plan when he does bring friends.although i won't lie, i wouldn't mind an arena to bet on matches / duels. personally i think there should be more gambling in the eve universe."
5/13/2009,"the current mechanics for 1v1 are nigh non-existent. both the current mechanic, and the proposed, require trust.i don't know about the op, but i am not looking for an arena. i am looking for the ability to fight friends in highsec without concord intervention, and without some stupid killrights exploit just to have a fight.with consensual combat, you could have fleet battles, even, purely for fun with your non-corp buddies.the least ccp could do is bring back free friendly fire in fleet.let me shoot my non-corp fleet-mates. if you agree to be in fleet, you agree to have no issues with people blowing you up.sure, people can whine about how lame it was that they got con'd into a mission squad that ganked their ship mid mission and looted their deadspace fit raven.. this is part of that whole 'don't do it if you don't trust them thing' also called 'not being a freaking moron'."
5/13/2009,that must be a high-sec mentality. i can tell you then when i fleet up with my mates the last thing i'm thinking is that they are going to shoot at me... i fly in null-sec and fleets are for allies and friends.
5/13/2009,"please ask ccp to immediately halt this nerf until larger discussion with the players can take place. this has the potential to seriously unbalance the game and shift things even more towards blob warfare and gate-camping than they already are. at minimum if this goes through then the cov ops cloak should allow ships to ignore bubbles. please, do something before small gang and solo pvp gets even more hosed."
5/13/2009,please explain or better yet provide a link that explains what you're talking about.
5/13/2009,hey chicken little... or little chicken.how about providing a link or proof before screaming the sky is falling eh?morons...ps: i scoured the boards.... currently there are no ccp stickied or marked topics talking about this crap... so unless there's proof... there's no credence to this.
5/13/2009,patch notes:
5/13/2009,"and how does this affect cloaks?all i see is a rebalance of lock on times for ships... which honestly is a good thing.should make things a bit more interesting for a change.now if your complaining over a ""glitch"" that being the mwd cloak trick... please... get a backbone man.it's a glitch.... i never used it anyway and i seem to do fine without it."
5/13/2009,"i'm guessing he means item 4 under modules: if a ship cloaks, all active modules that modify attributes, such as ecm, will stop immediately and the icons showing the effect will disappear.while ecm is used for the example, this would affect that one cycle of mwd or ab that people use while cloaking to get away from camps. this would be a pretty hefty boost to gate camps, especially bubble camps. i wasn't aware bubble camps needed a boost..."
5/13/2009,"it was never a boost or a nerf to begin with.for people who use cov ops cloaks... its a waste of time to debate.your going to warp anyway. in the case of an dict bubble... your still going to cloak and have full throttle.now if your flying a big assed ship... well what did you expect?standard cloaks are ineheritly dangerous due to the inability to fly away at top speed (minus ab/mwd) and warp away.gate campers have whined...complained... b####ed nonstop about it.i feel this is a good compromise to get them to stfu.: o pthis also encouages teamwork... scouting parties... and what not.this isn't the ""end of the world as we know it"""
5/13/2009,"the problem is a brute force change intended to counter falcon pilots (now at much closer ranges to their targets) doing the uncloak > jam 1 cycle > recloak thing has eliminated the #1 reason people fly 4 classes of ships in 0.0:reconscovopsblockade runnersstealth bombersif you jumped into a large anchored bubble or dictor camp in a covops-cloak fitted ship, you simply moved off in a random direction and got 1 free cycle of your mwd to coast out of the no-warp zone. a smart player could usually get away from the gate, although some luck was still involved if the campers had good interceptor pilots. now, if you jump into a dictor camp, your choice is 1) fight your way out or 2) hope you can make it back to the gate. coincidentally, this is the same choice non-covops cloak ships have.i want my skillpoints from recon v transferred to hac v, please."
5/13/2009,here come the tears.i fly blockade runners.... honestly i don't see what the big deal is.i never needed the mwd trick... i just cloak before anyone can spot me.
5/13/2009,"not supported.cloak shouldn't use active modules. it's part of what cloaking is all about. if you want to target, uncloak.sure, if they can do this, it gives them more use...but delayed local is a much better way to keep cloaking useful. allowing ships to do something that doesn't make sense, well... doesn't make sense.maybe they'll add a cov ops ecm down the line or something, but don't hold your breath...as for mwd cloak glitch ""interference from your cloak does not allow you to use this module"" or ""interference from your propulsion does nont allow you to use your cloaking module."" these seem to sum it up. i don't know why you can glitch and get an mwd on while cloaking, but it doesn't make any sense."
5/13/2009,"drake, you are right that noncloaky ships (battleships, for example...) should not be able to use the cloak warp trick--bs should not be able to escape interceptors at gate camps. recons, blockade runners, cov ops, and bombers, on the other hand, are absolutely hosed by this. these are the ships that are supposed to scout, which means they need to be survivable. their cloak is a big part of their survivability, as is their ability to quickly move away from their last known location so that they don't get decloaked.but the really big thing is that ccp never discussed this change with the players. it appears as though they have given very little thought into the wider consequences--namely, the fact that they have just given a buff to blobs with jump bridges. how, for instance, are black ops supposed to get into a system if one can't reliably insert a cyno pilot?the solution to this is fairly simple: ships with a cov ops cloak fitted should be allowed to ignore bubbles. gate campers get their cloak nerf, cloaky pilots don't get the shaft, everyone is happy."
5/13/2009,you don't live in 0.0 do you?
5/13/2009,i agree this is pretty sucky.i want my cloaking skills changed to something more useful now.
5/13/2009,"last i checked, you could cloak in a bubble as long as you aren't too close to the emitter...if you can't cloak in a bubble, then /that/ needs to be fixed.there's also no reason a cov ops ship should be able to ignore a bubble.the reason ccp didn't talk to anyone about it is because it was an unintended glitch that didn't have a place in the game. stop whining about how much you're going to miss your exploits.btw, i fly a blockade runner and a stealth bomber, live in 0.0, and never had a problem. (and last time i ran through a bubble, last i remember, i didn't have a problem cloaking on my way to the gate.)so many cov ops pilots feel they should have everything given to them. it's really disheartening to the people that are actually /good at flying/ said cov ops ships."
5/13/2009,"if this is an alt you are posting on i am going to ask to be forgiven for what follows.you have one kill and 17 losses on battleclinic. losses are all pretty much low sec losses of drakes and caracals. however two of those losses are manticores, one of which was lost to a pilot from ""empire blobs you"" corp, the irony is killing me right now.again i apologise if this is an alt you are posting on, but please, comment on what you seem to be publicly qualified to comment upon rather than offering ill informed opinions.on topic, this change worries me a lot since i just trained into a rapier so i could enjoy solo roaming, and enjoy the scouting role too. my anticipation is that recons/cov-ops/bombers/blockade runners operating in 0.0 will feel this pretty hard.all of these ships rely upon a cloak as their principal defense for sure, however the ability to swiftly move away from the last known location is vital to making that cloak work effectively. if you cannot move away from the spot you cloaked with some reasonable degree of rapidity then the cloak essentially becomes a mute point due to rapid de-cloaking at the hands of a half decent fast ship pilot.further i am unsure on how this delay to mwd after cloak works, but if true then a recon that is decloaked has no way to even run away or to the gate.seems pretty scary that four ship classes become sitting ducks in a bubble with one change.all that is bad enough, but the real issue for the csm here, at least in my eyes, is ccp's lack of communication regarding the changes, either pro-actively or in response to player posts raising the issue noticed on sisi. no dev blog, no response to questions, no response in the threads today. a very poor service and with such large implications for gameplay it is something that should not have been ignored."
5/13/2009,"wow, i love how people think when someone disagrees with them, its ""obviously"" an alt. how about a non-alt perspective? i think the change is fine. it gets rid of the exploit/bug in the game and actually forces some player skill at avoiding gate-camps. why do people think that they should be able to solo everything in this game? so your ship got ""nerfed"". its not going to affect players who actually had some skill and will be able to avoid the gatecamps. as for myself, i'll still be flying these ships. ccp never intended for these ships to last forever (which btw, i've only lost one. the 2nd one has survived countless gate-camps.) qq more. emo-rage-quit the game. i'll still be here. --isaacp.s. currently thread has no supports...interesting...p.p.s.s. fit some speed mods in the lows."
5/13/2009,you don't use your brain before you post do you?cry some moar!
5/13/2009,"i think maybe you missed the point.when a player makes a post on a character it is often useful to evaluate the validity of their opinion based on information available from killboards e.g. battleclinic. if someone offers an opinion on a shiptype they have never flown, or flown very little and in circumstances different from those on which they comment it is reasonable to assume their opinions are not based on experience.therefore i offered an apology up front if it was indeed an alt post, and the pilot may well have experience on another character, posting on that character would cast a whole different light on the validity of their opinion. however if it was not then i think the point stands in relation to the pilot offering opinions on a subject they have little or no exprience of.much like asking for a medical opinion on an internet forum, i am pretty sure you would check that the offerer of a diagnoses was in fact qualified to do so.a perfectly rational and reasonable evaluation of validity.as regards your qq emo rage quit cry more posts, well maybe try offering a considered and thought out contibution to the discussion."
5/13/2009,think about this before you start griping people.the point of a cloak is to cloak... not to be abused or to sneak in a shot or to speed past gate camps.its to be not seen and give you the chance to evade detection.there are risks.... for too long people have endeveroured to find that one little gtlich or one little bit of edge.ccp says no more.end of discussion.don't like it? gtfo.i for one cannot find a single argument to declare there decision wrong.so demanding to be heard is like asking for whine rights.i have to ask... to what point? to say you cant get through gate camps?guess what they say... they can't stop you anymore...while i'm in favor of evading gate camps... i am not in favor of disruption of balance or mechanics.so forgive me for labeling you an idiot if you can't see that.
5/13/2009,"when you start giving us considered and well thought out posts, i'll start. but like every person who hates people that don't agree with them, you automatically assumed it was an alt or someone with no experience. last i checked: assume = ass out of me and u. --isaacp.s. thread is derailed. get off this damn subject of who is who. get back to the main problem and quit attacking other people. the cloaking ability-loss is fine with me. i'll still fly the ships. i have yet to see another problem with this nerf other than it ""nerfs"" the ability to escape gate-camps. that's not enough reason to not-not-nerf this ""issue"". why? you may ask, its because there is more than one way to escape/avoid a gate-camp. even in a cov-ops."
5/13/2009,"actually, no, this is a reactivated pre-trinity character, back when kill mails were in eve-mail. and i have and this is not my blockade pilot, i will admit. this is my main, my blockade pilot is my alt.and fixing a bug without announcing its existence, in my honest opinion, is a perfectly excusable thing that ccp did. they've done this hundreds of times before. hell, most mmo devs interact with the player-base even less, so show some respect for a company that is as active as ccp.we don't need discussion on something that was broken getting fixed.if you think your ships are now sitting ducks, then we should suggest better solutions than keeping an exploit in-game."
5/13/2009,i really wouldn't classify mwd then cloaking as an exploit.the problem with this change is that it has been in the game for years and has been well known. as with the thread in the game development forum there has been alot of reasons why this is a bad thing to implement.the main ones being it encourages gate camping and reduces further the option of solo roaming. no one is asking for a i-win button as recons and covops can be killed at present with a skilled frigate or inty pilot to decloak someone in a bubble.not allowing the mwd to cycle in addition to a 3 second delay after decloaking and faster locking times just doesn't give someone a chance to escape. of course if you like the direction that brings jump through a gate and watch yourself lose a ship.or get a second account and get the noob alt killed and come back with a bigger blob than is sitting on the gate. great stuff. not.
5/13/2009,"thank you for qualifying your opinion with a little background.let us assume that for the sake of argument the mwd/cloak mechanic is an ""exploit"". if indeed it were to be measured as such then i agree it should not be kept in the game and better solutions found. however to simply remove it without finding any ""better solutions"" effectively nerfs whole classes of ships and styles of gameplay, and that is rather game breaking."
5/13/2009,"fixing an exploit first, before it becomes a problem, and /then/ discussing a solution, seems pretty viable to me.i do agree that those ships need more work, but keeping an exploit before they get something new seems more realistic. i also don't think cov ops cloak should avoid bubbles, but it's a definite start on this discussion, and i approve the direction, but i think ecm ships need a lot more work still. (stealth bombers still need some work, too, but they are starting to have a real role other than the solo pvp lolz they used to have)"

5/13/2009,"not trying to be ungrateful, i respect ccp for making an effort, i just hate to see wasted effort, the solution here was very easy and had exited in the game, why not just turn it back on. anyway i reserve my judgment on the update patch until i see it, i hope to hell it's faster then it is... :(edit :- after reviewing the patch notes i see - ""if load station environment (esc-menu -> display & graphics) is not checked and a player clone jumps into space to a clone vat bay, the picture of the station environment will stick to the screen instead of space being shown. overview and brackets will be rendered normally. docking and undocking at a station or relogging the client brings back the normal space rendering. to avoid this issue, you can turn on the load station environment option prior to clone jumping (it can then be turned back off after the jump if you like).""this has lead me to believe the option to not load the station environment has been added. yay!!thank you to everyone to supported this topic. after confirmation of the patch i will request this issue be closed."
5/13/2009,locking this thread isn't a waste of time as i get paid to do it :)
5/13/2009,"*bump for the day*anyone else have any other thoughts towards or against this? i'd really like to see some discussion here, maybe some ideas thrown around of how this could work, and possible ramifications this would have for 0.0i honestly see this making fw suddenly all worth it again. the only reason it was worth it before was because it's free pvp for people that don't want to move to 0.0, but right now all of that is kind of broken by the fact that everyone who does fw is either caldari (who outnumber the other three races /combined/), rarely ever actually online, or in that joke-of-a-war minmatar vs amarr.i'd love to see some sansha players interfering with amarr military operations in minmatar space, or some caldari pushing a front to lower serpentis resources...and the fw scoreboards could be a lot more interesting..."
5/13/2009,"first i dont want the old system chanded its fine...jsut we all know it can be ""cheated"".thats where my idea comes into the game.i thought about an somehow additional ""bounty system"" where it would be possible to choose from a list on bounty hunters (maybe some new thing like the military academy)...only for bounty hunters youll need to be in it to get to the hunter list.on that list the victim can choose the hunter he trusts in and offer him an contract to kill the pirate.the ammount of money offered by this contract will also be added to the bounty shown at the charater sheat but it wont be possible anylonger to get killed by an alt or friend to get the money.if you set up the bounty the old public way it will still be possible."
5/13/2009,"i like the goal, but what's the difference between this and hiring a mercenary?"
5/13/2009,its makes the living as an merc hunte esier.it makes sure that the money the victim spents will go to the merc if he kills the guy and not to the pirate or his friends.
5/13/2009,bzzzt.try again.... nothing is stopping from someone putting a large bounty on there head and joining said merc team with an alt to collect it.feel free to be creative but you get the point.your idea has merit but it is holier than swiss cheese.
5/13/2009,"agreed, the current contract system does not function like an in corp /alliance marketplace shouldand corp hangers can easily be stolen from.it would be great to see this implemented./signed"

5/13/2009,"points raised here against are valid.. that said, ceo's and directors should be able to enable or disable this for the corp as a whole or it could be made a votable topic for corp politics."
5/13/2009,"though i could see where this would be nice, no corp would ever leave friendly fire on.it just doesn't work with the eve universe.don't hire people you can't trust, and you'll be fine."
5/13/2009,umm.. never said i would turn it off.. wouldnt even consider it as one of corp rules is never go afk in space unless you are in a safe spot. enforced by putting your ship into structure the first time you are caught and putting you in a pod the second.
5/13/2009,"i had hoped some of the csm candidates had more spesific ideas on how to fix low sec, and im also a bit sad that a lot of the established csm like vuk lau doesnt even reply to a question like this.guess it goes to show that the 0,0 players mostly dont give a rats ass about low sec"
5/13/2009,"honestly, i think low sec needs some help, but i don't have any immediate solutions.however, don't you think expecting a response from all csms, saying exactly what you want to hear, in 28 hours from first posting, is a little impatient?"
5/13/2009,"back in january at the csm/ccp meeting in iceland, it was pretty much decided that the limit should be raised to the minimum freighter cargo size as that would be the least exploitable. why this hasn't been implemented yet when ccp admitted it was a relatively easy solution to implement is beyond me - and it will come up for review in the 1st meeting of the 3rd csm. all i can do is ask politely (while holding a large stick) why it hasn't happened.broker fee's are an interesting thing. i still have yet to see a concrete fomrula of how they are worked out. to me it makes more sense to use both actual standings, derived standings (skills) and trader volume to figure out the fees. it makes no sense to me to use a broker that refuses to give you a discount when you are pumping multiple billions of isk through his hands and you can choose to go elsewhere. unfortunately those brokers have a monopoly, so you have no choice.if at all possible, i would love to see players acting as brokers at some point in the future of the game, i think it would open up an entirely new way of playing the game for some people and add some much needed diversity to the game. of course there is always the risk of that broker running off with your goods, but hey, this is eve"

5/13/2009,"i already said i supported it also, just so eveyone knows as it doesn't seem to have filtered through yet - csm 2.0 can't raise any more issues for discussion. our last meeting with ccp is this weekend and as issues need a minimum of 2 weeks lead time when sent to ccp, anything raised now won't/can't be discussed until csm 3.0 starts."

5/13/2009,"""from known exploits to stupid spawning"" ? so you are saying that taking plexes after their spawn is exploit? oh my god. but then again ankh did not see any problems using her high standings to plex attack plexes without npc attacking. i know that ccp said it works as intended ( which sounds odd ).but ankh was not willing to do everything to change this 'bug' or stop to use it because she was gaining advantage and causing unfair game to other player like good griefers usually does. ankh was plexing afk and wanted good reward from it, even medal were asked for being afk.i do not like exploiters so i do not vote for you and you can blaim ankh for that."

5/13/2009,"hello amaldor themodius,over the past year i've been the fw csm, sometimes to the annoyance of the rest of the csm as i tried to raise yet another fw issue. a large part of my csm issues were fw-related, and i've written large documents about the problems with fw and been handing them to ccp since august 2008. i was there in the fw roundtables at fanfest. ccp is completely out of touch with the fw players and despite them making all kinds of promises they didn't live up to a single one - not even alliances participation has been finished despite them promising it would be in every expansion since empyrean age 1.1. i'm now raising that very basic issue for the third time because ccp still hasn't delivered.same thing with the cloaking exploit. that thing was unfiltered in my bug report list for almost a month (i still have more fw bugs that are unfiltered after months), and despite half a dozen emails to ccp and even phone calls the exploit is still there - ccp obviously doesn't care.now my time is running out although i still have one more csm-ccp meeting to go. i passed on all my documents and issues to erik finnegan which will be my successor for csm3, and he'll be the next fw champion.we care about fw even if ccp does not."
5/13/2009,"ank,given that you are not running for the csm, i find it interesting that you are answering questions for candidates. erik, i believe, had internet access and time to campaign.i find it amusing that you think you know a lot about fw, when you have yet to pvp- i believe you sit cloaked at sites to hold them, gaining standings within the faction in a way many would find unacceptable. i doubt this is what would constitute fw in any meaningful way."
5/13/2009,please stop this anhk. we know you have lent your support to erik but a position on the csm is not an appointed role. if you are serious about fw getting sorted you should be passing your documents on to all candidates not just your chosen one. i have stayed out of these things so far but i am fast getting fed up of being told by you that erik is the next this and the next that. there are a number of people who care about factional warfare who you are dismissing. erik on the other hand has seemingly more interest in working with people and not saying he is the one and only which is how your support of him comes across.
5/13/2009,"ankhe, i have followed your efforts to address faction warfare since you began on the csm (i voted for you both times with at least one of my accounts). it is disheartening to see that ccp cares so very little about this flawed expansion, which released with so much fanfare. it is still a great mechanic if only they would address these handful of issues.with the said, i'd be pleased to hear erik discuss briefly each of my main points in the first post, clarifying his position on each of the arguments i've made above for changes to fw."
5/13/2009,"just my points as person who has been in fw from almost day 1. in my opinion fw works pretty well so far but here are few things:1) i do not want alliances to join fw. last thing we need are 0.0 people coming to get their lol-kils from less serious minded people.2) isk rewards. no, dont want them. it's war, it should not be profitable unless you are good. being in fw does not stop you from running missions or ratting in low-sec (today i got dg implant, hello several new ships). also, you can already make the isk by looting tags from plexes. takes a while but doable.i can agree that militia stores could have something nice though, with plex vps and missions giving access to it. hell, just having an option of buying vanilla blackbird with caldari camo colours or one of the orange gallente battleships would probably encourage a lot of people.4) occupancy. if you start doing radical changes, this will simply get flak from people who did not bother with system capture before and in worst case, get people to quit en masse or demand ccp to do a roll-back to captured systems (again, leading to massed number of people quitting). throwing a small bone like cheaper repair costs might be an option.5) bugs. cloaked plexing is annoying, so is standing bug. surely it cannot be that hard to make the npcs open fire on anyone not belonging to proper militia rather than some esoteric calculation where faction standing + charisma - npc ships random bad day generator score determines if you have npc back-up or not.also, i will not vote for erik because of what ankh did in fw. neither will i vote for heartstone due to his allegiance. right now it appears that i will simply abstain from voting.damar rocarionbrigadier general"
5/13/2009,"i would just like to say that this is a bit of a mistake. erik isn't anhk and i'm not my character. it's your vote to do with as you will but i suggest you might want to think again and vote for the person most likely to raise the issues that you wish to be addressed whether that be erik, myself or another candidate as 8 people will get on the csm and will be presenting fw issues to ccp so you might wanna try and make sure that it's the people you can stand the best doing it."
5/13/2009,"ankhe is posting on the forums as my team mate* because her temper is much more suited to the general behaviour here. and i thank heartstone for his seemingly flame-resistant character.meridius, your points add some good extra legitimation and application use cases to my more general ideas for change. please have a look at my program and it will all make perfect sense to you.here are some mind-links:a (fw & war dec) - i want to bump the standing system and make the standing between capsuleer entities meaningful. both from a roleplay perspective that makes sense, and can be used to solve your topic : is it not naiv today, that you can war dec an individual corp and friends and allies have no way in intervening? war dec mechanics should allow friends (by proven standing history or allied with the corp by milita status) a reasonable low entry barrier into that war. war is never likely to stay contained between the two initial parties. if it is ""war"" and not bribing concord to be able to grief without their intervention. then again, i want to get rid of concord in the long run...b (sov impact) - clearly stated : factional warfare must be meaningful for the whole population. i want it to be the end-game of empire space. system is occupied ? too bad for the loyalists (including the pacifists) of the defeated side.here, of course, from a marketing point of view of ccp, we will have to include some large scale corrective measures (asymptotic) in order to make sure that neither of the empires ever wins. sorry to say that, but it would be catastrophic for ccp's sales, if new eden were entirely occupied by the federation...c (plex spawning) - this is too obviously wrong, and too often told. i want player-driven spawns, i.e. depending on general player activity. not a simple one-cause-one-reaction relationship. or even capsuleer built ""plexes"", which require resources, etc. to keep up, yet reward you with sovereignty...oops, i meant occupancy. ;)d (fw rewards) - you do not fight for the honour, but for a living. yes, definitely. both the direct rewards must be greater, and the indirect reward (occupancy pays-off, see above) through carebear activity. just as we want alliances to be rewarded for providing infrastructure to bears, why should a militia not be rewarded through its faction for the bear activity, which they improve thanks to occupancy ?*) take care is a team in order to improve csm performance for you all ! is that so hard to bear ? this platform intensifies exchange of methods and best practices, and provides a long memory for issues, which have been discussed. where in the forums a thread is forgotten after it scrolls on page 2... so stop whining. you have the right to remain silent. everything you write, can be used to improve the game."
5/13/2009,"fair enough, but i did say this at the start:"
5/13/2009,"it sure as hell is not.if one could instantly appear at 0 km anywhere with a blaster ship it would be fine. however, a blaster ship is a damage ship, mwd'ing 30 km hurts no matter what and you apply little damage while speeding forward.i just stated what i think is the basic problem. how we fix it can be many;more damage, when you first come close you should rip.higher falloff, to make damage while you approach.better tracking, when you first come close you should hit good.etc. etc.personnaly i prefer more damage, but i won't limit myself to one option. so how they get fixed does not matter, just that they get fixed. this is not my opinion i'm afraid. if you see on the start of the post.i was posting it for a friend. sorry for not making it more obvious."
5/13/2009,"got my vote, and my alts"
5/13/2009,"i would prefere damage to, still i see the need to sort kitting and tracking issues within web range first(preferable with a slight bonus to the web power) to bring back the solo and heavy tackling abilty that made this ships still dooing ok during the nano age(if you managed to catch someone you actualy had him tackeled not like slowed down a bit with the actual 60% webs).dont get me wrong, im not only interested in this one point and preaty mutch agree on the many other thing like rockets(and some other missles) and aks/artis, since the problems are also preaty obvious.im actualy happy to see all this points at least in one candidates opener that also recognize the need of some readjustments to the patch that is now allready over 6 month on the server. then accept my apologies, didn<U+FFFD>t get this."
5/13/2009,"well my dear future csm'swho of you actually wants to adress the issue of scam spam in eve.i don't say completely ban it, but some minimising of the amount of scams or such would be dandy.as it is at the moment your more filtering out scams when checking contract then actually finding none scams.isn't there any way to make it a bit more training intensified to scam so scammers would have to do more then just roll an alt for a few days without any skills or training just to scam on the side?make scamming a tad more work then it's now?that way you would atleast decrease the amount of scam alts because if people also have to invest more time in atleast some skills for the alt before they can start scamming they might reconsider because it might take training time from their mains."
5/13/2009,"well the one nice part they are doing to help the contract scam comes in effect tomorrow by putting all totals in words at the end on contracts will stop contract scams. but my opinion of scammers is really low, but i think an idea to help us know which scammers are which is to implement something used on ebay. once you have bought something from somebody or you catch one scamming, then putting an option like ebays feedback page would be able to work in eve and if they end up with say 50 players rate him as bad/scam artist etc he take either a really large isk deficit on items he sells or has to pay a fine etc to get rid of the reputation or a variation like a secruity penalty so they cannot go into certain trade hubs"
5/13/2009,"contract scams are annoying, to be sure, and have basically made it impossible to sell to a legitimate wtb contract. however, eve is a harsh universe. in many ways harsher than the real world because consequences for many actions versus players are practically non-existant.a seller rating system, not unlike ebay, at first seems like an excellent way to counter this- if the seller/buyer's rating is low, you double-check the contract for loose ends first. however, this would be a fairly simple system to grief through, casting doubt upon a buyer/seller through aggressive and unethical market practices.the main issue i have is local spam. jump into a market hub and your are assaulted with links to phony contracts. often the spammers post multiple contracts, or post the same contract with different characters, in order to avoid the letter of the law when it comes to spamming. yet another situation of following the letter of the law, but disregarding the spirit in which it was intended. sure, you can block the spammer, but the same bot will be posting with a different character name tomorrow. i would like to counter these spam tactics, and i would be willing to hear reasonable ideas to address both spam and scamming.*edit* i did not see any other responses to this post when i clicked ""reply,"" did not mean to make an attack on shatana's idea. sorry :-/"
5/13/2009,"well i can see several solutions depending on what results you want.my biggest issue is just the spamming that goes on. jita local is spammers hell. 1] prevent trial accounts from posting links in local and npc corp chats. no contracts or url's. would also fix a lot of the isk spammers they hate so much. 2] if you spam too much in local or npc chat you get a warning, 2nd time you get blocked for a time. spammers would use alts to get around blocks to there main player so block the whole account. this would not only apply to scammers but anyone who thinks we need to hear there message every five minutes in local.people can't stand spamming in rl why ccp thinks we'll quietly tolerate it in game is beyond me. also wouldn't surprise me a lot of scam spams are done by macros. i can't think of any skill that would only target scams without making it harder for any other legitimate player. scams by there nature are ment to hide amount legitimate contracts. and the current change only reduces 1 kind of scam. doesn't fix the faction swap scam where you think your getting a navy issue raven.if you want to almost completely eliminate scams just put a warning message when your about to buy something on market or contract that is way out of proportion with the general market. say 200%. sellers by the way get a message showing how above or below market the price is and a warning to prevent them from accidentally listing say dysporium on a sell order for 100isk a unit. my only question with scams themselves is how much it clogs up the petition system and the contract server. i, and most people wouldn't be happy if it turns out they have to wait an extra 24 hours for an answer from a gm because they have to spend a large proportion of there time replying to scam complaints."
5/13/2009,"i agree that eve is a harsh place, but the creation of disposable alts without any training or whatever and leaving them in an npc corp so you cant retaliate without getting concorded or so is more protection of illegal handlings then protecting the socalled law abising citizins in empire.in fact the clerks and concord protect this kind of action and that is where it's off balance.it's way too easy to scam and get away with it, no repurcusions.as far as i learned that no matter how harsh something is, there is always a way to get back. this system as it is however prevents that without losing even more.ccp prides itself for socalled balancing, i don't see any balance in this however."
5/13/2009,"it's pretty simple, i want to be on the csm for one principal reason: to change the way the game is rebalanced. right now, nerfing is the only way the game is rebalanced outside of expansions. i want to change that. check out the full story on my site: galant3's websiteenough reading, go vote: vote for galant3"
5/13/2009,voting has finally opened.hopefully people will vote for whom they feel can best represent their area of concerns in eve and we can get a good balance. good luck to all the other candidates!ammath for csm.
5/13/2009,"just wondering if there is a list already, before i start trudging through everyone's platforms."
5/13/2009,"its pretty much heartstone this time around. roleplay, faction warfare and small unit pvp.hopefully he can twist ccp's arm on finally delivering alliance corps in fw and we'll see the ushra'khan able to properly crush the 24th crusade at some point"
5/13/2009,i got friendly with hardin in the back of a 'geddon once - but i'm not sure that counts as being rp friendly...
5/13/2009,"i asked about that, at eve vegas, this past weekend. it's not gonna happen. regardless, fw still needs some love in general for those active in it.i'll read up on heartstone."
5/13/2009,"erik finnegan is a roleplayer and has a lot of rp things on the agenda, and is the main fw candidate as well.watch the movie, i'd say."
5/13/2009,i killed hardin and pie several times in the past while flying with friends of matar. ;)
5/13/2009,"bah, given the amount of times we've had topics supporting this move presented to ccp in the past, and given what we were told on csm1 about the technical viability of it - i'd be very disappointed if the devs have now decided an about-face for some reason.all the more important to get some strong representation on the council for this session there and make sure the case is still argued."
5/13/2009,"i think torda and crante may also be somewhat rp-friendly, but i think heartstone and my ceo (erik finnegan) may be the best choices."
5/13/2009,what?! they're so gonna die in the csm meeting next saturday! i raised this topic for the third time now so at least they can't avoid it.
5/13/2009,"bah for raising topic when i'm asleep. both erik and myself are, from what i've seen so far, the only rp candidates. from my understanding erik's corp are rp heavy in their corp and with thier dealings with other and well you already know who we are .both erik and myself have a strong fw leaning in what we would like to achieve. (i would be grateful anhk if you would stop referring to erik as the main fw candidate as it is rather rude to dismiss other people.)beyond this there are many differences between myself and erik which you will have to judge from yourself from what we individually written."
5/13/2009,"i think you'll find there are others who are/were rpers over their lifetime of playing eve, you can always ask your ceo about when i was a director of jf (granted it was a long time ago now) :)sure, i'm not promoting myself as a champion of rp, but then again, i'm not promoting myself as a champion of any specific group at all.as i have said from the start of the csm, i think having a broad knowledge base of all game style preferences helps on the csm, rather than being entirely focussed in one or two areas."
5/13/2009,"sorry oz you're right i worded that wrongly. what i meant to say was the only candidates who are currently active in rp to my knowledge. i know other candidates, you especially, have experience and knowledge of it. sorry if my quickly typed comments offended anyone"
5/13/2009,for what its worth ank i think you and i were definitely the strongest supporters of fw during csm1 and i do acknowledge and thank you for the continued support of fw during csm2. i think it would be healthy for eve and very good for the interests of the thousands of active faction warfare players out there if both heartstone and erik get elected to csm3 and can continue to press ccp for much needed change and improvement of the fw system.
5/13/2009,"heh, i remember you don't worry oz, and i hope you get elected too!"
5/13/2009,i love rpedit: \/\/\/ hhahahaha
5/13/2009,apparently the nerf already made it in tomorrows patch:nicely disguised but that doesnt change the massive issue that arises for small scale warfare if mwd are still included in this and since it doesnt specifically exclude it like it should i assume it is still affectedfrankly i am quite disappointed not to say enraged at the complete lack of comments from ccp about the concerns risen by the community
5/13/2009,"ive got one vote spare, convince me :)"
5/13/2009,"i just silently hope ccp changes their mind and do not smash their nerfbat into skirmish warfare.if even specialized ships can't bust a camp anymore, what's then the role of a covert ship besides scanning down whs, plexes and ships in your homesystems?"
5/13/2009,unfortunatly the 'few' ships which are affected include those which need to be able to get through gate camps.two examples:* scouts can only do their job if they can get out of a gate-camp and find an alternative route.* covert cynos can only be lit if a cloaky ship makes it into a heavily camped system.
5/13/2009,"this will affect us in a big way. running into a gate camp with a cov ops frigate or stealth bomber you will die. there is no tank to speak of on either ship and the only ""tank"" that they do have is a mixture of the cov ops and pilot skill. i agree that a domi shouldn't be able to escape in a situation as mentioned by heartstone but i disagree with the full cov ops nerf. perhaps make it specific to ships so that only ships that can fit a cov ops cloak still have some chance of escaping. blobs and gate camps exist but will now become more the norm and the small gang and solo pvp will become a thing of the past. this is not a good thing for anyone"
5/13/2009,i agree with you entirely poreumai. what i said above was not to say that this change will not have a negative effect on the role of these ships but to point out the idea that it is nerfing all ships across the board isn't accurate. i think that these ships will indeed suffer quite badly from the mwd/cloak change and these ships are very disadvantaged by this change. to me the only answer in the current expected mechanics seems to be that you must infiltrate these ships via a different route or find an alternate route. in general whilst this isn't a major boost for the space holding entities it does boost the effectiveness of well setup 0.0 gatecamps and gives the defender a further advantage which isn't something they really need given the current state of sov. mechanics. the current aim of the mechanical changes in tomorrow's patch seem to me to aimed towards creating more non-consensual combat between pilots as it also includes the agility changes as well as this change. the question to be asked of ccp is whether this boost to non-consensual pvp should be to the advantage of one pvp style over another. personally i think the change is welcome but something should have been done to mitigate the effects of this on ships expressly designed for infiltration. maybe to make it so the change only effects non cov-ops cloaks.
5/13/2009,"quite simply it will kill off a huge part of the game for smaller & those in larger alliances with the balls to go out and roam .it will stop ppl using a part of pvp that some people have no understanding of .hacs/recons market will suffer as less & less people will want to roam .wow suffered when devs who played the game decided on what they wished the game to be , is this another case of a dev who likes to carebear in peace ?.everything about this game is centred towards the defender who holds sov , the one thing left for us skirmish warfare alliances who wish to attack the larger stronger alliances is going to be removed .i,ii certainly be looking elsewhere for my online gameing .ccp want to play the ignorance game and refuse to give a reason for this stupidity ?fine by me , i'ii simply walk , along with the rest of us who love the challenge of pvpinin hostile territory , outnumbered and outgunned , but then this patch is about the carebear .like every other patch these days .your about to shoot yourself in the foot this time round ccp ."
5/13/2009,i still have not voted in the csm elections. so far it seems i won't be voting at all.
5/13/2009,i will say this on my part:-this nerf has it good and bad point imho. to look at it in a whole its immedatly obvious the it seem to be a alteration for the single pvp player to go about it alone it is making it alot harderthis i do agree with tbh in the whole sence of the wordwe need our scouts and if we want to get our ships who are able to use the covert cyno.. how can they if the cloaked cyno ship can make it through.. again this is showing favor to numbers versus skills in pvpi think we need to keep in the single player hunt as well as having benefits for large numbered gangs...ccp's goal seems to venture on benefits for sov holders in systems rather than give the little guy a chance to make his way.i am still not 100% on what it means for my char in the game i guess i will have to wait to see how the patch effects my ships personaly
5/13/2009,"tbh, the new player experience can't be that bad- we're still playing. i thought it left me a hanging a bit (keep in mind i have only experienced it in red moon rising, i hear its been improved since then) i like that in games. i like it when they leave me to figure stuff out on my own instead of just handing it to me."
5/13/2009,"pvp is just a single element of a very rich game. one of the great things about eve is that you can pursue any path in how you enjoy that. there is also the key concept that actions have consequences. so i always think there needs to be a way to undue a bad choice, but at some point it may be very painful to do so.issler"
5/13/2009,"yeah missions need a lot of work. its not called mission grinding cause its fun.i could write a lot of what i think needs changing but i can think of a few immediate fixes that would help make it a little less painful. like expanding the mission list an agent has available to distribute. i'm tired of the 20 or so missions an agent recycles over and over again. make the random less random. i once got ae four times in a row. god please do something about the dialogue. i'm surprised i can reach my agents cause they seem to have a lot of 'massage' appointments. more intelligence would also be nice. i can't see an agent that you have 10 standings with ever calling you scum. and the first time i meet an agent they shouldn't be saying how i'm just the man for the job.you should always have access to an agent in any corp. even if its just a level 1 -20q. mission runners who can't access the npc agents in 0.0 have just one more reason to never leave empire. would also allow you an inroad into reversing your negative standings. painfully of course but some players like challenges.we know players have a lot to offer in the way of creative design for the eve universe and it would be nice to see ccp develop some way of allowing players to develop and contribute to mission designs. to start maybe a simple webform where player's could write a plot, dialogue, and a mission layout. shouldn't be too hard to implement. ultimately i would love to see ccp work with players on contributing to many aspects of the game"

5/14/2009,"/signedthe old effect was better imho. while the new 'bubble' effect is cool, it does not give the shock value that it should.i would prefer a enhanced version of the old cyno effect, which would clean up it's appearance. also the old effect did give that 'oh crap' feeling when you suddenly see a dozen cap ships jump in.the best example ever of that was the foundation's movie ""the clarion call - triage special"". when they jumped their dreads onto the battlefield, you knew that they had showed up, due to the effect moving far around the ship. so even though the cap ships that were jumping in were not in the cameras frame, you still knew that they jumped in!"

5/14/2009,i will not support this idea for the very reason you failed to either make a link or copy and paste the damn thing yourself..... shame on you and your family. how simple was that?
5/14/2009,"believe it or not, i will not support this idea. one of the objectives of low-sec was to bring industrialists to it and the pveers, and this does the exact opposite. with more players in pvp on either side, the 'carebears' have even less reason to go there, creating a semi-fw attitude in a fair area of space, but with no organizations to join.since 'carebears' comprise over 70% of the population (according to the qen), i can't see this being good for the game. the only result is that a few people who enjoy both will train both skills to create the new items, and high-sec will remain high-sec as it is now."
5/14/2009,i love this topic and everything it stands for.

5/14/2009,"this won't grab /all/ carebears, but it'll grab ones that are only carebears because lowsec is worthless. i know lots of carebears that would /move their hq/ to lowsec if they had awesome things like this. i'm not looking to move /all/ carebears out to lowsec, that would be horrible for everyone, none of us 'real' players want that, now do we?the main idea behind this wasn't bringing carebears in. the idea of this was making life not suck for people that /do/ live in lowsec, or would /want/ to normally if the reward were better (despite the risk). i apologize that your laziness causes you to respond like this. if you're so lazy, why did you even bother posting? go eat some chips."
5/14/2009,"while it might be nice to have a bc sized covert ship, the focus on anti capital is foolish. when capitals are on the field, the only thing you use covert ships for is getting warp in points. anything else will just be obliterated by the massive bs fleets and their cruiser and frig support. an anti command link sounds interesting, but too difficult to implement. i mean who does it effect? everyone on grid not in your fleet? is it usable in low sec? high? get you concordoken much?not supported."

5/14/2009,there are 2 main problem with plexes in faction warfare:1. they are too easy to do by speed tanking.2. they give no monetary reward (compared to missioning). (general problem with fw and low-sec space)right now a fw plex can be speed tanked by any inty with a microwarp drive. it is so lame to see a fleet of 10 cruisers look at an interceptor capturing a plex.proposal:1. make fw navy use webs so plexes need to be cleared instead of speed tanked.2. make the plex drop look at about a somewhat similar rate to a mission.so if a plex can be done by a 4 battlecruisers pvp gang make if drop loot equivalent to a level 4 mission.that way people who want to just grind isk can stick to running l4 in a raven pve fit. while pvp gangs can make some isk doing a few plexes while waiting for enemies to spawn.this would also lure many small gangs into fw low-sec which is something we all want.
5/14/2009,"actually, it's worse than that. with effort, they can be tanked with a single t1 frigate with t1 fittings. with two t1 frigates, it's trivial to tank them (even the high-end plexes). so i agree: they need to modify plexes to be challenging enough that it takes at least a small gang to accomplish all but the most minor plexes.as to the reward, i think there's certainly room for improvement, especially with the boosted difficulty. however, while i think there should be some worthwhile drops here and there (for example, low-end faction ammo/modules from the faction being fought), i think that lps would be better as the bulk of the reward. ""go out and destroy our enemies, and we'll give you access to some of our restricted equipment."" this would work especially well if there were some new toys put in that were unique to the militia lp stores -- requiring the same tags that the complexes drop.fw missions also need to be boosted; they should be at least as good as their equivalent high-sec missions, and should also provide a benefit to the sponsoring militia (should generate system capture points or something along those lines)."

5/14/2009,"yes the ui interface would be entirely client side so that people with nicer computers can enjoy the better graphics. personally, i am a fan of useless information. i personally think it would be cool if when a ship/roid is targeted, the new holo-ui would pop up next to the ship/roid and provide exact figures for its hp. just cool little things like that would make me love this game even more. we are in the future flying spacecraft and have access to holograms (holoreels), be cool if i saw that in the game.***perhaps we could have an option between the original tactical overlay (ta) and the new ""holo"" ta. basically if you use the holo version, the camera zooms out a bit and the interface is filled with info and has the ui like the apoc trailer. if a target is locked, all info available would be shown. this does not include modules unless there is a ship scanner or balance can be brought to it. eve could use more pizzaz."
5/14/2009,"i petition that the changes put forth in 1.2 (without any interaction or feedback from the players, i might add) which remove the ability to mwd-cloak should be rolled back. furthermore, i petition that the 3-second no-mwd delay upon decloaking should also be removed, because it basically guarantees death for anything smaller than a battlecruiser if it hops into a gatecamp.both of these things are terrible for small-gang pvp and encourage the blob. it makes roaming about 0.0 in a small group a thing of the past. they are stupid, stupid changes that anyone who has pvp'ed in 0.0 will make the game worse.roll back these changes!"

5/14/2009,"copy and paste from patch feedback thread in support of the rollback.----------------------------ok... now you ask for feedback.i think feedback would have been better utilised pre-patch, and was in fact available in the game development forum from a large number of players concerned at some of the apparent (but un-announced) changes.the changes to module activion time and module cut off on cloaking were not raised with the community via a development thread. however a number of players noticed the changes on sisi and tried to give prior warning of the implications to the development team here, here, and here.at least one of these threads reached 8 pages with no response from ccp in several days of posting.end result is several seriously broken ship covert ship classes including recons, which i have highlighted with a little testing on tq today...first thing i did on logging in was try my rapier. it feels heavier i think as a result of the agility, but not a huge difference. when i decloak after jump i am trying the following.select a celestialhit alignspam mwd (seems to take a second or two to kick in)hit cloakspeed with mwd before cloak hits maybe 500m/s and drops really fast getting me maybe 2km away from my original decloak point moving at 300m/s (ish). considering the distance i have moved and the distance required to decloak a ship it leaves me pretty vulnerable. testing this with an dictor pilot friend gets me decloaked maybe 50% of the time by his dictor burning from 0 off the gate, and still within the radius of a bubble. feedback from him is that after gate decloak i am visible for a couple seconds while i try and spam mwd (seems to be a significant delay) before cloaking, that couple of seconds is long enough for him to get my exact direction of travel from the tactical overlay. i can only guess at how bad this percentage will be with several inties/frigs at a gate.further to this i find that in the absence of a bubble, it is pretty easy to align/mwd/cloak/uncloak/instawarp in a battleship of all things.end result is that 0.0 specialised scout ships are now pretty much useless in the face of a bubble and a couple of inties, while low-sec gate camps are pretty much useless in the face of anything sporting the new cloak/instawarp combo.had ccp announced their intentions with a development thread, and/or responded to the feedback from the community we would not have this issue today. ccp's own failure to communicate has left the game severely broken, and my expectation is that it will take several months of complaints/suggestions/dev blogs/testing to regain any balance.very dissapointed.i know people will respond qq cry more, but i honestly don't see myself resubscribing in 30 days when it's due.edit: many players made a significant effort both prior too and post patch to offer moderate, thought out, reasonable feedback. would ccp please respond to that feedback on this issue please with a reasoned explanation of their intentions and consideration of the results we now have on tq?---------------------------note to the csm, this is an example of very poor development and implemtation with no community involvement/communication. this kind of issue needs to be addressed with ccp via the csm at the earliest opportunity."

5/14/2009,"don't agree.i run an industry alt corp in empire and have a high sec pos. every few months i online the pos and run off a bajillion bpcs. once done i offline the pos because i won't need it for another few months.for me personally the only advantage of having the pos in high sec over low sec is that i don't need to leave it online when i'm not using it. and besides it's already been said just war dec corps that have high sec pos. it happened to me, i went away for a weekend and came back to find war declared and rectracted on my alt corp and my high sec pos missing leaving only a km with 2 gank fit amarr bs on it who'd obviously set themselves shooting and gone to bed."

5/14/2009,"i've lived and made my fortunes in low-sec but even i can't be bothered with it lately. there's is so little there now worth the trouble.lots of problems with low-sec aren't directly related to low-sec itself so some of the issues need to be fixed else where to make low-sec more attractive.miners don't go there anymore. with trit prices so high the best ore in empire to mine is veldspar. and that can be done a lot of safer in highsec. ice is slightly better in low-sec but veldspar is still worth more for your time. most mission runners avoid low-sec accept in large groups cause they will get owned by mission busters. fittings for missions and pvp are 2 very different setups. ratters are better off in 0.0 as there is more safe quiet space to spend a few nights making isk and recovering standings. even though ccp introduced the odd bs to low-sec, 0.0 is far better.as a stepping stone into 0.0 it no longer works because there's a lot less room in 0.0 accept for large, well established alliances.the high price of dysporium is killing a lot of the market for other moon minerals. making it less profitable in low-sec for a lot of new, small corps to get into.a few changes i think should be looked at to see what affect they might have on the attractiveness of low-sec.1]look at increasing the insurance on t2 ships. on a 100mil hulk you get 11mil basic insurance. 29mil for a cost of 8.7mil. no hulk pilot is gonna risk a lose of 100mil ship to earn 7mil isk an hour mining in low-sec. how many people ever take there marauders in low-sec or null-sec? same reason. why risk a 1bil ship for 20mil-40mil an hour.better insurance would also result in a higher demand for t2 across the board and that would make pos's more profitable. more pos's means more industrials in low-sec.also the high costs of t2 ships and the risks with them means that only the richer players can afford them. so newer players avoid pvp as they feel they have a disadvantage from the start.2a]make ice mining in low and 0.0 more profitable by increasing the amount of ice products in the lowsec/0.0 ices. the ease of mining ice in highsec and the fact that lowsec/0.0 is only slightly better means 99% of ice is mined in highsec.2b]add bpo's that would let you make coolant and oxygen from ice products. stupid that 5 out of the 9 items you need for pos fuel have to be bought off the npc market.3]provide either a speed or material bonus to manufacturing in low-sec. the majority of the slots that i know of are usually completely free.4]possibly introduce bpo's to make robotics and mechanical parts. might not have much impact on low-sec but certainly 0.05]0.0 needs to be made more in reach of medium sized corps and alliances. as these alliances/corps would be less likely to be able to supply all there needs in 0.0 they would have stronger ties to empire so more traffic between."
5/14/2009,"let me give a few ideas i think could work to make low sec better:1. easy, improve the ore, ice and rats.2. create new content only found in low sec.3. allow player corps to be the ""police force"" in low sec providing unique reqwards for anti-piracy actions.4. allow some form of corporate mini-station between a pos and an outpost.5. make it place where corporations can create missions. (introduce player created content there)6. even something as simple as making gate and station guns get increasingly effective eliminating perma-camps on gates.7. move trade goods and things like pos fuel to low sec only.those are just a few things i would love to see discussed in greater detail and considered as ways to inprove low sec.issler"

5/14/2009,"well, i am not to sure if i will be voting for erik, though reading this has been fun. i myself am working on becoming a 0.0 carebear(drug manufacturing) along with my corp. i am glad to see from this that some people actually want to debate topics with the candidates before voting for them. i have checked out all the candidates that i could so far. but so far this thread and admiral iceblocks are the only candidate web pages or threads that actually have any real discussion on them. this is good sign to me in favor for erik. as for as the candidates go, none of the have really stated any concrete plans in my opinion, some very good ideas in general of things to purpose, but no real plans. i would like to see that happen at this stage, it would give me better idea of what the candidates are willing to put into this. hence the why i would never run, not that willing to put that much effort in this direction, just doesn't seem fun to me. but i do appreciate those who do. i am glad to see a couple of other candidates in this post, it gave me a better fell for them. thanks to you candidates. also were there any debates between that candidates that i missed? if so i wouldn't mind reading through that. if not i think it should be considered for next time."

5/14/2009,admiral iceblock made a pretty impressive post on fw here:
5/14/2009,"we have a discussion going on this on our corp forums. i'll post my reply there here, clarifying my original suggestions for fw.:honestly, i've heard a lot of complicated ideas in several different threads which would involve ccp doing a lot of work in terms of writing all kinds of new code. knowing their history, i wouldn't count on the devs to implement those kinds of changes. i pretty much stand by each of my proposed changes. they are not hard to implement and would collectively fix just about everything wrong with fw, bringing back countless former participants and encouraging many new ones: this fix would mean nothing more than making all four militia factions into alliances insofar as wardec game mechanics are concerned. can't dec one corp within without deccing them all. hell, it'd probably involve changing one line of code for each militia.doesn't have to be complicated, doesn't need any new set of rules. just use the nullsec docking code for fw with those stations that are militia in nature (those having the respective militia in their names - tribal liberation force logisitics plant, 24th imperial crusade testing facilities, etc.). if you don't have occupancy, your militia can't dock in those stations. you could still dock in any non-militia stations in any system (quafe company warehouse, etc.) regardless of occupancy, but perhaps with station services cut off to whichever militia does not have system occupancy. perhaps cutting off station services in npc stations might be seen as too extreme, i don't know. some faction warfare systems have npc corp stations in them, others do not. systems which have only militia stations will be something for enemies to consider when flying through an enemy-occupied system -- and give them a good reason for taking said systems themselves.this would make fw a little bit more like 0.0-with-training-wheels, as ccp say they intend. if you are ""behind enemy lines"" roaming or fighting in enemy occupied space, it will not be so easy to just dock up and get repairs (or avoid fights). this requires no further explanation, as most everyone - ccp included - agree the plex spawning mechanics are fubared at the moment. as far as cloaking and speedtanking the plexes, the solution there is also a simple one: one must destroy all npcs in a plex in order to finish said plex. you can still run the timer down, cloak up and speed tank all you like, but it will just keep flashing ""0.00 seconds"" until someone finishes off any and all rats. (continued)"
5/14/2009,"i don't think giving actual isk rewards would be the way to go with this at all. it should be loyalty point based for such items as may be purchased only in the faction store. and to avoid farming, make taking a major unrestricted plex scale to about 2/3 what a single level iv mission would earn a high sec carebear, and scale all lp rewards for lesser plexes down from there. remember that this is not like mission running. if these changes are implemented, you'll have to not only kill all the rats in a plex but do so with potentially scores of wts searching through many of these systems looking to gank you. as always, make offensive plexing more rewarding then defensive plexing."
5/14/2009,"the blasters issue is good to hear, but i have to admit the same problem is now apparent with torpedos, their range has been so nerfed, many are turning to cruise missiles for their weapon of choice. perhaps a significant boost to the long-range t2 torps could negate this, but it used to be that someone would train t2 torps and be set for all short-medium range engagements. now you'd have to train t2 cruise missiles too. anyway... just saying that the problem that blasters have also applies to the nerfed torps.secondly, the issue with mwding in webrange has now also been made increasingly problematic with the warp scrambler boost.1 tackler with a warp scrambler, makes the already slow triple trimarked, plated megathron a stationary slab of rock that ships with longer optimal ranges can then easily take you out.would like to hear some opinions on this :3"
5/14/2009,"right on, when is the next meet in toronto, i was unaware there was eve meets in my area"
5/14/2009,"just going to point out that there is more to improving roleplay opportunities/tools in eve than just improving factional warfare. while factional warfare is an important component (and i agree that u'k, cva, em, 4th, etc should have the opportunity to participate as those entities); there are other ideas that should be brought to ccp's attention both regarding factional warfare and roleplay opportunities.i think both heartstone and erik, who are actively particapting in the roleplay enviroment, will recongize when ideas are presented that should be passed on to ccp for refinement."
5/14/2009,"oh, dang, now i've got to check you out too. and i just narrowed it down to erik and heartstone. oh well...edit: nevermind, page 1 of your thread made it clear that you won't get my vote."

5/14/2009,stop killing small gang pvp.ps: is the guy who came up with this in a providence holding alliance? this is like hitting u'k with a bat in the ballz.
5/14/2009,"they don't care anymore for the pvpers, only the huge blob wtf warfare, that involves no skill whatsoever. i can command a fleet of 1000 people too, just call a name and ur good, ur better if u know the shiptypes and know which ones pose a bigger threat, but all in all its easy. small gang warfare, now thats an art, sure you will still have someone calling primaries, but in the end the individual players make decisions too while the fighting is going on, like say for instance, a falcon decloaks within drone range, if the fc didn't see it but the rest of the gang did, then they will set their drones or change primary when needed, sounds simple right? wrong!, carebears are too stupid to think!!! thats why they love large fleets where there is someone calling targets for them. now that i went off topic and explained why small gang warfare is that much better, if the cloaks are nerfed, forget small gang warfare. for those of you that say it will not eliminate small gang warfare, bull****, you my friend have too much money and time on ur hands to have a thousand alts scouting you through your intended target region/area. i myself cannot and will not get another f#%$ing alt to feed ccp their money. they get enough of it as it is.no nerf is required for the cloaks, plain and simple, no mwd/cloak tactic, no small gang warfare. ofcourse, in traditional ccp style, they will ignore the pvpers and continue on with their nerf for carebaers. as ive said in another thread, this continues i may quit the game and ccp will be gettin a nice post from me ps: wow **** is blocked, this world is going to down the drain when a non-vulgar world like **** is blocked, i mean ****, wtf? :p"
5/14/2009,"could a representative from ccp or the csm please address the reasons behind the cloaking change?i do not personally support the change for several reasons already echoed in this thread. that said, i would like to make an informed decision based upon information from both sides. with nothing in forum or publicly available to review that is not possible.regards"
5/14/2009,interview with happy joymaker by hallan turrekwhat is your ingame name?happy joymakerlinks to your forum thread and site.
5/14/2009,"does it bother you that veldspar is more profitable than any low sec minerals?to some extent. it is largely market driven, and ccp has made it so that trit is used a lot. i think ccp needs to look hard at resource balancing, and go back to some of their older ideas of introducing super veld in 0.0 space so that logistics are not hampered. the stealth removal of the mission that provided large amounts of trit into the game hurt a lot of industrial concerns and places major burdens upon logistics  time sinks for no other reason than to have time sinks. the introduction of the orca and the jump freighter has helped out a lot, but more balancing needs to be done.methods of being able to mine in low sec effectively need to be introduced, but in such ways as to not remove the pirate from the game. knowing that about 1/3 of all minerals in the game are in essence recycled, not from mining, is also something to be considered. being able to mine all day in empire is also not, in my opinion, a good thing either  but i prefer to see that become a game mechanic as opposed to a player mechanic. i have many ideas on how to do some of these re-balancing, and by being elected to the csm, i can effectively work with ccp to help bring some balance to the issue.what's your opinion on current war declaration mechanics?i think it is relatively fair and reasonable. there are some mechanics that i dont like so much (corp votes, for example), but overall it appears to work.what is the single largest imbalance in game, and how would you fix it?the disparity between the older, wealthier players/corps/alliances and the newer  in particular as seen by the ability to have the dispro cartel meaning virtually unworked for yet extremely massive amounts of game wealth. keeping such massive amounts of wealth sources in the game that are static isnt good for the health of the game. ccp realized this when they made the static plexes above 2/10 no longer static, but have not done anything in regards to this massive imbalance in regards to moons and moon mining. by making it so that dispro, and to a lesser extent promo, is so rare, yet so needed for the production of t2, ccp has set it up so that these static resources are disproportionately utilized. this is not a good situation for the economy of eve, nor for the ability of newer players to feel that they can succeed in the game. by having the resources static, and in essence a passive income to such a large degree, it has created a very static playing field that newer alliances cannot hope to enter.changing sov mechanics to no longer allow absentee owners to control large selections of space will be a significant first step. you need to occupy the space to control it. this, however, will not help with alliances that can project might into areas that sov does not play a factor, areas that should be available to up and coming groups to allow them to build (or fail) instead of being sucked up by the super powers to support their endeavors while keeping the newer folks out (it is about as much resource denial as it is resource usage).secondly, changing these resources so that there is no longer the massive disparity and massive wealth will be necessary. alchemy was an attempt, but it failed in that the economics of it were out of proportion to the problem. you need to run how many large poss to make up for a single reaction that uses dysprosium? and what are your overhead for doing so (additional equipment, fuel, manpower, etc)? right, it is out of whack. the two ways i have seen that can both work is to no longer make the resource static  by either making it run out on a moon, so that it respawns on another moon in the same region (think faction war plexes); or moving it off of moons entirely and into gathering sites similar to asteroid / gas belts.continued below...."
5/14/2009,"continued from aboveof course, one of the things ccp should look at is the actual usage of the materials. a rebalance of the blueprint needs would also do wonders by increasing other moon requirements while decreasing the dependence upon dispro and promo. t3 ships will, also, hopefully take some of the pressure off, but it will need to be more of a longer term, as opposed to a shorter term solution.as players gain experience and begin to take notice of the greater eve universe out there, they often feel obliged to sign up with the existing large alliances or forever be a small fry out there. there isnt a way for newer folks to effectively work their way into the big 0.0 game (which is perceived as the end game content), so a lot of people just walk away  after all, how many missions can you run, how many belts can you strip? eve is a game about social interaction, and these game mechanics so effectively place limits on these interactions that it is broken, and will drive players (read: ccps clients) away from the game.anything to add?thanks for reading the wall of text, please vote for me!"

5/15/2009,i read through this post
5/15/2009,"i can see some positive and negative to this.on the whole the dynamic has some appeal and would maybe pick up on/tie in with some of mittens in vegas - ten ton hammerhowever i do see some serious downsides if the system security flips between hi-sec and low sec.how would it be possible to flip a system back from hi-sec to low sec? do concord move in and stop any piracy?sec changes would disrupt travel for both hi and low sec status players. this may disrupt trade severely and upset the economy.pockets of agents may develop that actually focus rather than spread player activity if the agent move is random.that said there are some interesting ideas. perhaps make the sec change one which operates within the current low-sec parameters i.e. 0.1-0.4.systems with 0.1-0.2 become pierate enclaves with agents offering missions for pirate faction loyatly points and loot. systems with 0.3-0.4 become concord outposts offering mercenary missions for concord faction lp and loot.systems can be flipped by killing ships of the opposing ""faction"". the flip could be based on a value derived from the difference in number of ships killed with a multiplier based on player sec status for example. thereby encouraging the opposing factions to maintain their sec status at the maximum possible, pirates would be encouraged to be very evil, and concord mercs to be whiter than white.so maybe, once a month/week the value counting to ""sovereignty"" is calculated and a change applied.pirates killed 500 ships x (pilots total sec status/number of pilots involved)concord mercs 300 ships killed x (pilots total sec status/number of pilots involved)obviously enough the concord pilots would need a multiplier to counter the +5 vs -10 disparity and someone with a math degree can put together a proper equation. but you get the idea, it isn't just the total number of ships killed that counts, it is also the number of pilots involved and the value of their sec. theoretically it would be possible to kill fewer ships but since your factions sec is better you get more points.there would be an inherent interest in pilots continuing activity in the system to maintain the ""sov"", and perhaps the changing security could be used to improve low-sec use by offering services at a station based on the faction ""sov"".improved refining yield for miners if ""sov"" is concord merc.availability of illegal drugs and booster materials if the ""sov"" is pirate.just two ideas, i am sure others can add more and the now infamous ""methnaught"" bpc's could be a reward if the system retains 0.1 sec for several weeks or something.generally i support the idea, but it would i think need implemtation that retains the current travel/trade routes by confining sec status changes to already low sec systems."
5/15/2009,"y'all need to stop whining about your cloak-mwd nerf.it's really starting to get annoying...it's just like back in the days of nanoships, y'all whining about how much it would ruin the viability of your ships yadda yadda yadda.not supported.deal with the inability to exploit like real men, and stop calling exploits 'tactics'."
5/15/2009,"nozh's repeated tactic of posting once in a thread, posting a quick reply on page 2, disappearing for a month, and then throwing his original changes in a patch and claiming customer interaction are why i support this.the guy is just terrible with interaction. and his ideas are usually horrible.and i'm under no false belief that he'll be fired due to a thread. but honestly, the very fact that a player made a thread about the incompetence of one of ccp's most visible employees warrants someone looking into the reasons why. you don't see such threads about the others.and to clarify two points:1. the reason the 3-second delay was added was presumably to prevent ships from mwd'ing back to gates, because its too easy at present for them to do that. why is it too easy? because after nozh's nano-nerf, webs were weakened severely. so we've gone 360 now.2. nozh gets no credit for the nag. that was chronitis's thing, and he does a much better job of balances / fixing than nozh does. i didn't agree with the changes they ended up on, but at least its reasonable. it's certainly not nearly as bone-headed as today's patch."

5/15/2009,"it should rather be that grinding down the opposing factions would just repair your standing (at a lower pace then it takes to destroy the other standing though).so if you have -10 with the gallente, go blow up serpentis and caldari navy npcs (non-mission related). it's weird that it doesn't seem to work this way already.having a whole epic arc sounds nice, but it seems like a fix that requires a lot more work and again, a one-time-shot. still would be a nice thing to have though."
5/15/2009,definitely supported. i would love to see a whole line of t1 khanid ships.
5/15/2009,"/methnoughton the side, what would really be cool for these systems is to have lots of unmapped resources that are able to be probed, but can't be used unless the bribership changes from one side to the other. hidden stargates, stations, gas cloud formations, asteroids etc etc.essentially, to be in on the criminal activities and be able to reap the benefits of them, you have to have the keys and be friends with the locals.empire people without cartel affiliations or standings problems get to use resources in lawful systems. criminals and cartels have to scan for resources in these systems. in the lawless systems, it's the other way around. empire people have to scan to find the goods.also, instead of alliances, cartels. cartels are the bribers. the briber of a system can set allies and usage permissions just like alliances, but in general the good guys and bad guys can't be on the same team because of conflicting interests.just like in real life, the anti-drug enforcement is carried out by scorched earth practices. modules that completely destroy gas fields in a system, thereby removing the income and leaving the smugglers etc.the smuggler part seems like the most fun. horrid amounts of gatecamps, secret stargates that are able to be bookmarked and such, get destroyed and rebuilt, all to support the movement of illegal materials needed to get the best drugs together.that's my 2 cents last thought, we need a druggie smiley in the forums to compliment the pirate face."
5/15/2009,do not mistake efficiency and general know how for laziness. however this further reinforces your ineptitude..... which is make your ****ing links!! in your own posts. imagine if websites wanted you to copy and paste basic url addresses instead of having their guys make simple links. also you clearly missed the sarcasm. but that makes sense. please wipe the cheeto crud off your fingers.
5/15/2009,"bunyip you are starting with assumption that every carebear has the same mindset like yours, which is totaly not true. as mentioned above i know ****load of people who would move to lowsec if reward/risk ratio would be higher."
5/15/2009,"i agree with bunyip, that it doesnt add real incentive for non-pvp'ers to go to low sec. but that is for decent part just due to alts, and you cant do much about that. (pirates will use alts anyway to get their ships from high sec, then you can move some asteroid types to low sec only, so some minerals only are mined in low sec, but in best case that will result in a very small part being mined empty, and everything else not changing at all).however, that it doesnt add reasons for non-pvp'ers to go into low sec, doesnt mean it is a bad idea."
5/15/2009,"i disagree.if we have this 'dynamic' sec status, this will make it safer for people to go to the newly-raised-sec systems (no concord, but faction police, maybe?)"
5/15/2009,"allow privateers who enforce the ""lawfulness"" of systems to sell rights to use warp points in that system. extort duties etc. give them a portion of the taxes from all stations in those systems. just make it an isk thing where they can benefit from the general activity of carebears.hisec population is huge. privateers can form up and take over enough systems, and those systems will fill up with carebears who will make them money :-dcall it deputy status or something and make it have complimentary privileges to infiltration."

5/15/2009,"i do not support.the delay when uncloaking should be removed, i agree.cloak-mwd shouldn't exist.stop whining about ccp removing your exploits and pilot your ships better.sure, we need to think of ways of fixing some of the problems that these ships have, but being able to mwd while cloaked doesn't even make /sense/ considering how it affects in-game propulsion.i do not, and will not ever, support the idea of a rollback on this patch."

5/15/2009,signing in even though it has already been admitted by ccp that it was a bad case of being lazy and not checking everything i'm signing in to help it get fixed asap. in all honesty i could see a technological reason for non cloak specialized ships to not be able to cloak while mwd. but the specialized ships have indeed been hit hard by this little f. up. i was already wondering why ccp would nerf the blockade runners while they just actually got a role to begin with but i'm glad it will be fixed. just fix it sooner than asap or just right now please.. i have some high value cargo to transport
5/15/2009,"agree, ccp must fix this and do not destroy cov ops ships, allowing them to perform their role."
5/15/2009,dropping in to state that it seems ccp has corrected the issue. i have no trouble engaging mwd and cloak and the mwd will finish it's cycle.please test and see if the issue has been fixed with you aswell.edit: it also appears it has been a quick and dirty fix. when engaging warp the mwd will display a cycle after you clicked it while it states you can't do that due to warp. once you actually enter warp it displays the message again and the cycle is cut short a bit. it doesn't appear to speed up the process of going to warp so it seems to be a graphical bug.

5/15/2009,risk vs. reward. either decrease high security reward or increase low security and 2 x increase 0.0 reward.
5/15/2009,"i have to agree with pretty much all ove issler's suggestions and i would add a few more.the first is one that accepts a number of realities.1) it was originally conceived that low sec should be a 'jumping off point' to null sec. that is not the case. perhaps in the past it was, but it hasn't been the entire time i've been playing (a bit over a year now). it's time to recognize that reality.2) storyline-wise the powers in new eden are the empires. tough as the goons might be - they aren't the amarr empire or the gallente federation. but they have the 'better' space. huh? how does that work? that makes no sense at all.3) given the above, it makes sense for high sec to be the least profitable. after all, this is the heart of empire space and in addition to capsuleers there are all those npc corps and militaries doing their things. what is left could be seen as 'the leavings' not considered important enough for the big boys to bother with. it would be nice to see some content in-game to support this and help extend the illusion of eve's reality.4) low sec is tougher to secure. the border space between empires that they are in conflict, hot or cold, over. these spots are like that for a reason. if they were junk, one empire would have left and ceded it to the other for a stable, tradeable, policeable border. but, for whatever reason, they are not. they are either strategically important or very valuable - hence the reason they are 'low sec' and not developed more into more high sec space.5) null sec is the unexplored (save that it's now all explored) the dregs, the areas too far away or too hard to defend for the empires to bother with. there should be real gems out there for the null secs - but in general these areas should be less valuable than low sec save for very far from empire. otherwise they'd have been gobbled up years ago by the empires.6) what this means is that, storywise, low sec should see a large boost. nerfing high sec isn't needed (and is foolish). the reality is that low sec is more dangerous to operate in than null sec. that may not have been how it was envisaged, but that's how it's turned out. out in null sec i know the boundaries and who are friends and who are foes. in low sec? the enemy could be anyone. there are no rules for the outlaws and only some of them are flashy, and even that doesn't show in local. with the rise of the large alliances in null, low is more hazardous to operate in. not to pass through (no bubbles) but to mine or mission in? much more dangerous in practicality.so, low sec needs a big boost. in addition to low sec only content worth going there for in terms of reward, there needs to be better minerals (much much better) and things there you cannot get and actually need and want that aren't available in high or null.finally, there needs to be some way to protect yourself there - a better balance of conflict between good guys and bad guys. a way for 'good guys' to move in and operate (the police force idea is a good one). there needs to be a system for actually defending ships adequately with sec status effects that make sense around it and missions need to be more difficult (not impossible) to bust into and interrupt.as well, missions and pvp need to close so you can do both with the same ship fit and have it work out. as long as they are different, anyplace with pvp and pve had better have very secure pvp defenses (like borders and intel channels) or hugh payouts in order to be profitable.one way to do this is to make missions mostly non scannable (there are already jammers in some missions - be nice if they worked for the players as well as the npcs) and make entry difficult. locked to all save those who can unlock them by having a key or beating guards. finally, anyone in a mission should have be able to attack intruders."

5/15/2009,"i too am annoyed by the webifier nerf, especially when i consider what effect this have on close range ships. a little patch on the wound would be to add a falloff of 5km or 10km. e.g. if falloff is 10km and the target is 15km away. webifying the target would have 50% percent effect (50% of 60%). when target is at 12,5km it would have 75% effect (75% of 60%).or another patch on the wound would be to make webifiers have 90% effect @ 1km and let it decrease to 60% @ 10km.why i pointed out rockets as a individual point is because rockets to me has always been subpar. i think they should be frigate sized torpedoes and not autocannons with projectiles. still all missiles need to be looked at. personnally i would just revert the changes and turn missiles back to what they were.also, i remember a certain ccp dev posting that missiles should be ""all damaging without the need of any bonuses due to some ships having twin-weaponsystems e.g. typhoon."" still waiting on that change thou!and a random idea of mine; remove eccm and make eccm scripts for sensor boosters. also increase sensor booster activation level to 30 sec. to limit instant-switch of script."

5/16/2009,"yes artillery sucks, and a 100% role bonus to damage for projectiles would compensate for the nag's relative lack of damage, but what if the nag pilot decided to fit... oh i dunno, autocannons? plus, by removing the two missile hardpoints, and not adding a third turret hardpoint (which would require a total overhaul of the naglfar ship model) you're giving the naglfar 2 extra high slots, something no other dread has. this could give the dread the ability to equip neuts, or remote ecm bursts, or god knows what else, which goes against what dreads are meant to do.perhaps just a 50% role bonus, it would effectively give the nag 3 turrets, instead of 4, and remove the extra high slot."
5/16/2009,"no! for the love of god noo! that is perhaps the naglfar's best attribute by a very wide margin! making it horizontal will make it look like a terd the pheonix just dropped into the toilet. you can do everything else, just please dont make the naglfar lay down!"
5/16/2009,yes. obv.
5/16/2009,"supported. minmatar capitals do need some reworking, i can deal with a difference in tank between ships, because that is a pattern repeated in minnie subcaps as well, but the naglfar is extremely handicapped. it honestly seems as though it was designed like an oversized tempest, meant for skirmish warfare but little else. skirmish warfare doesn't really work in a dread. maybe if it had higher dps, perhaps comparable to a pheonix then there would be less of a problem, but as it is it's no good."
5/16/2009,yes please.
5/16/2009,yes.
5/16/2009,"i'm not sure if this hase been discussed so here it goes.since many alliances have special corps or people that invent/build items/ammo/ships and sell them for extreme low prices to benefit all members,an example is to sell ships 20-30-40%(this using moon minerals available in 0.0). cheaper yes, but you don't want to sell it on the market for even blues and the only way to sell them is using trade or contracts(witch are limited) and is time consuming.then commes the ideea of creeating of an alternate market specialy for alliance/corp with something like 50 slots max exactly like alliance/corp contracts.ps: had to give it a shot."

5/16/2009,"i dislike nozh's style of work too. there is no need in ""ecm drones fix"" and similar farfetched problems.supported."
5/16/2009,"lolfirst i would like to say there are too many ccp fan boys here. personally i could give a ****, but at least have some dignity and pretend to have a real reason for non support.second, you act like nozh has some sort of executive power over development. from reading his posts, it sounds like he spends more times jumping through hoops, running back and forth consulting different members of separate projects.also keep in mind that eve has a general direction that won't change - eve is becoming a softer, friendlier universe to appeal to a wider audience.adapt or die. if anything, i view these changes as a fun meta game to find advantages over other players - be more opportunistic. they boost frigs, buy a frig and win. they boost recon, go **** in a recon. if you can't be flexible, you shouldn't be playing this game."
5/16/2009,"that's quite a budget committment - i expected most people just to pay a subscription, which is way less.one person's view who happens to be a customer does not magically invoke the right to dictate policy to a business.right... so pointing out the obvious logical fallacy in the op's statement - that somehow his minuscle contribution to ccp's earnings gives him the right to tell them how to run their business - is being a fanboy?some people really do have an overinflated sense of their own importance to the game."
5/16/2009,"well i don't know.the balancing team has been doing rather terrible , especially with the nano nerf, but seems to try and communicate more with the playerbase (the issues tread) and fixed a very big and old issue , the freaking vertical thingy ....what they should do however is evaluate their changes and things they balanced in the past year , and then look if they really did what they hoped they would do.for instance the nano-nerf didn't do what they intended to do , ccp intended to keep the whole nano-thing still viable , but well if you ask who is actually still succesfully nanoing , very litle people will answer it.and i doubt putting someone else in charge of the balancing program will change things much ...so not supported because the balancing team hasn't been doing too bad lately and i don't think a new face would make it better."
5/16/2009,they are fixing a lot of things that dont need fixing lately... except the naglfar
5/16/2009,deciding who works for ccp is not your job. how would you like it if nozh phoned your boss and told him to fire you?
5/16/2009,all you naysayers.... your fired.gtfo and pack your bags.seriously... leave.that's what you wanted isn't? oh i'm sorry... you want him to go.... i thought you implied we had power to throw people out right?oops!
5/16/2009,honestly... i doubt nozh is directly at fault for any of those.nozh in my opinion does a good job. his team on the otherhand tends to cause bugs... but even then... that's still alright. there's another team completely meant to fix those bug.qa team with help from the bug hunters. they are solely at fault for letting bugs get into the game. even then it's within reason.however if you have any experience with the bug reporting system. it's terribly horrible. bug hunters will filter and essentially not pass on a bug basically all the time.i bug reported... gave logserver and such. still got filtered. now you have stickies in like all forums for the black screen issue.the bug report system needs to be fixed.
5/16/2009,all this is... is a lynchmob.you morons just want someone to hang for your pathetic little whines and complaints.maybe if you took the time to think about how they do the work instead of going off of what you see and what they see you'd figure out that its not just one guy.it's an entire company.
5/16/2009,"not supported.and i personally think the naglfar changes weren't very good. in my opinion, it was ccp's way of trying to:1. make the nag a shield tanker, however i don't think it's really got much on the phoenix. the extra mid slot doesn't improve the ship's ability to armour tank either, so it's still a terrible dread to tank.2. improve the nag's bonuses so it would be a focused projectile weapon ship. the problem is, there's now two semi-useless launcher slots and there are plenty of existing minmatar dread pilots who have time tied up in a less meaningful citadel torpedo skill. if they were serious about fixing the naglfar, they'd have done what they did, but perhaps give the ship 3x turret, 1x launcher, so it could outperform the other dreads with a ""token citadel launcher"" vs. being a good tanker like the rest.on top of it all, ccp have broken the trend of all race ships sharing an equal amount of slots.revelation: 4 4 8 = 16moros: 4 5 7 = 16phoenix: 4 7 5 = 16naglfar: 5 6 6 = 17having said all this, i'm glad to see ccp are attempting to fix certain issues like the naglfar, but i just think they're going about it the wrong way.if they'd have left the slot layout and cpu/powergrid alone and just given the ship a greater bonus to both cap projectile turret and citadel launcher rof (perhaps 10%), or even changed one or the other to a damage bonus rather than rof, then it would atleast be the best damage dealing dread around, despite its poor tank.so yeah, good job on trying to address the issues, for which we're all thankful, but please stop ""fixing"" issues that either don't exist, therefore nerfing certain aspects of gameplay, which you've been accountable for since as long as i can remember."
5/16/2009,"completely supported in principle. however, i'd argue, as i have before, that a better approach is to involve the storyline and backstory more closely into eve in a more automated fashion, to avoid the drain on resources that has been mentioned."
5/16/2009,"i have to side with this end of the argument. if you worked hard enough to get to -10 with a faction, and with all the faction's friends, then you have unequivocably stated that you don't care about them, their culture, their values, their interests, their likes, who their friends are and what they stand for. if you take it that far, if you go all the way out of your way to well and truly make enemies of a faction, why would they ever have to give you the ability to claw back?on old earth you could get kos with a faction for minor social infractions, for mere trivia that hurt absolutely no one and nothing except a perception of pride and honor. you weren't even thinking of systematically, methodically, studiously and deliberately trying to get every single one of them and their friends to hate you to the very core of their being.so if someone in eve goes that far, if they take it to that literal extreme that a faction and all the faction's friends place them at the very farthest end of the like me/hate me curve, then either there should be no way back for them or it should take ridiculous amounts of time and a sisyphean effort to make it back. a few sissy missions with a bit of risk should not even qualify as an effort to recovery.and who will be in this situation? will it not be the pirate, the master of their own destiny, the very person who could not give a wet slap about their standing and reputation? and now they're crawling back? it's cold and lonely in the dark pits of exile they thrust themselves into? it is now just that tad too much of an inconvenience?tough cookies. you make your bed and now you get to lie in it. the cold mercy they so generously bestow on others should be shared with them.no mercy for the merciless.abulurd bonifaceme meceo"

5/16/2009,do want !
5/16/2009,"i think that the idea for selling kill rights and making them more viable is definitely an awesome change. i also like the idea of turning low sec into a vegas style hive for the corrupt, not just pirates. there was one thing that left a sour taste in my mouth, and that was smuggler's cloaks. i think that particular thing would have to be a very restricted item, perhaps only be of use on say blockade runners? i am not a carebear to a large extent, but i know that local is the only thing that keeps miners and ratters safe in lowsec and 0.0 because there is no way to circumvent it, if such a device would be applicable to a combat ship, then the concept of ratting or mining on a small or even large scale would evaporate almost entirely.but so far the good far out ways the bad in corruption, i support"
5/16/2009,"as far as the smuggler's cloaks, i disagree with the idea of their existence.though, i counter (because i love their idea...) with, delayed local.i don't believe a cloak should have this magick 'disappear from local' thing.i do believe that you only know who is talking around you when they're talking. most other games don't even have memberlists for regions, yes we have this omnipotent knowledge of who is in the /solar system/ where we are hangin'.... i feel this doesn't make sense, and the fact that w-space is more fun for carebears than lowsec, proves my ideals towards how local is way too broken for communication. it should exist, i like local, but it should be delayed, or even expanded further than that.. maybe it's delayed other than who's on grid, and have /all/ cloaking act like you aren't on grid for this variation on local?"

5/16/2009,perhaps only allow a queue for anchoring the modules and not for onlining them.
5/16/2009,faster loading would be good but more features would be bad. you especially don't want them to integrate something like mozilla into eve. can you imagine the security problems? or the number of patches that would happen to fix them? with ccp's patch record? the game would never be playable.

5/16/2009,"i'd like to say i support the idea, but i think black ops' role needs to be reworked overall. ccp has done some bandages for them for now, so i'm happy with that. hopefully more fixes come soon. --isaac"
5/16/2009,"all black ops receive the racial battleship skill bonuses of their true parent hull, ie:redeemer = armageddon with -1 low, +1 mid, -1 turret hardpointwidow = raven with -1 low, +1 mid, -1 high, +1 mid, -1 missile hardpointpanther = tempest with -1 low, +1 mid, -1 turret hardpointsin = dominix with -1 low, +1 mid, +1 high, -2 turret hardpoints (dominix has 1 less slot than the other bs, so the sin gets an additional slot to balance it, but loses an extra turret hardpoint in the process)all black ops received a black ops skill bonus completely out of left field that makes no sense whatsoever, ie:redeemer, viziam (ie zealot)= tracking bonus??? this should be 5% damage per level, or 10% optimal per level like all other viziam ships.widow, kaalakiota (ie crow, nighthawk)= ecm strength bonus??? this should be 5% bonus to kinetic missile damage per level like all other kaalakiota ships.sin, creodron (ie ishtar, eos) = agility bonus??? this should be +drone bay or drone control range like all other creodron ships.panther, thukker mix (ie vagabond)= speed bonus this one actually fits, though thukker mix is stupid for bs design, and the 3rd/4th bonus for thukker is always 10% range (optimal or falloff) per level, or 5% damage per level.so the ships have glaring mistakes in their current design. however, as far as balance is concerned, you need to do more than just fix those mistakes. the panther needs to be changed to boundless creation (ie sleipnir, muninn, wolf). the sin not only needs to be changed to duvolle labs (ie deimos, astarte) but also reworked as a megathron instead. it should have a 6l/5m/8h slot layout (based off megathron slot layout, really a 7l/4m/8h slot layout would be ideal), 6 turrets, 125m3 drone bay, and have 5% large hybrid turret damage, 7.5% large hybrid turret tracking per gallente bs skill level bonus. and either 5% turret damage or 10% turret falloff per black ops skill level bonus just like all other duvolle labs ships."
5/16/2009,even for all their faults... if they only received 2 items i still think they would be rather nice.a: cov-ops cloakits black ops.... why not?? it would make there niche just that much better.b: longer jump drive range.... not as long as say a jump freighter or even a carrier... but long enough to make it viable.
5/16/2009,"they are already rather nice. a cov ops cloak is unnecessary and would come at the cost of a nerf to the ship class, making them worthless.the sin needs the most help simply because drone boats don't mesh well with the way black ops are utilized. it needs to be a megathron. the marauder is for pve, it should be the dominix.the only things the class as a whole really needs is the long overdue fuel bay and some tweaks to the 1st bonus from the black ops skill to match the ship's design that i listed above. a slight increase in base ly (2ly > 3ly) would make them more effective deep in sov 0.0 space, simply because space is so spread out there. their jump range is perfectly fine in low sec/npc 0.0."

5/16/2009,"my self and my friends like playing eve but we dont do the pvp side at all just pve, we dont play the game a lot at all we dont have time to so we do when we can so income is low. we stay well away from 0.4 and lower for obvious reasons, loss of our ships is huge setbacks for us, insurance does not work for us!.we found being in a player corp together gave some majour benefits to us:the office we rent allows us to share items with each other when we are not all online at the same time!the coporation wallet and it's divisions allow us to easily share the sales of loots from missions, the divisions are important for when we do missions with different people and place items on the market so the sales go into a certain wallet when it sells a few days later.being in a corp throws us into a channel of our own automatically so we can see who is already online and easily fleet up and communicate the whole benefit of corp owned blueprints.standings and an identitywe have been in a corp together for over 6 months, we are still learning the game, just recently we learnt something new.being in a corp left us open to warefare. we was ransomed for money we did not have, we avoided conflict that we could not afford by not playing the game for a week! just logged in to check status and waited it out till they got bored and retracted the decleration. conflic would have set each of us back just over a month of gameplay.we only earn 5 - 20mil per mission split between 2 - 3 players every other night we play, we do 1 - 2 missions a night during the week but not every night. so our income is low for the cost of replacing a megathon or hyperion is hard to replace. insurance does not work for the sheer cost of replacing all the modules and rigs is the same as the cost of the ship and they aint covered.we belive the game really needs gang buddy system that has the features and benefits of a corp.the idea i have in mind is that a member of a gang can be a part of an ncp corp so they are not vunurable to corp wars where as another member of the gang can be in an player corp that might be at war and not bring that problem with him to the other gang members and so it is his or hers and their corps own problem alone.this flexability can allow frinds to play together much more closely but still remain independant from eachother if one wants pvp and the other pve only then they can.just think along the lines of communities and clans where each member has a collection of games, some members play one game and others another but they all have at least one game they all own and play together.pve is one game and pvp is another, we want to play together but some in the clan want pvp and some want only pve and sometimes all of use want a bit of one or the other but nether the less we still want to communicate and share things but have indipant actions, what happens to one in a corp effects everyone else in the corp..."
5/16/2009,"1. safe from wardecs: stay in npc corp.2. distribute loot & salvage without corp wallets: designate a trader who handles the stuff, who uses containers to keep stuff in orderly fashion. if you need more advice how to set something like that up, mail/convo me ingame.3. if you can't afford to lose a rigged hyperion: don't fly a rigged hyperion. stay in your brutix or myrmidon for a little longer until you have enough cash to affort a ship loss. 2-3 young characters can make much more money running level 3 missions in battlecruisers, than running level 4 missions in battleships. at least if you loot and salvage.4. find alternative ways of making money. there are plenty. many don't require much more than a frigate and many don't even require you do undock at all.5. wardec aggression does not transfer in a fleet. if you are fleeted with someone who is at war, he is at war and you are not. he can get shot, but not you.6. eve is not meant to be safe. not even highsec is supposed to be completely safe.7. insurance is no meant to repay your losses. it is meant to make them less severe. otherwise ccp could just give unlimited ships to anyone.8. there are other ways past a wardec and there are also other ways to fight and not lose incredibly expensive ships."

5/16/2009,"i can see where op is coming from, there is no denying that there is a stereotype about the french. in all other races of eve there is no mention of any lineage from an earth nationality, so why should there be for gallente? it even says immediately afterwords that there is nothing besides that statement tieing the two races together, so why is it even there? i'm a gallente character myself, and i just ignored the french thing when i joined (mostly cause i love drones though.)i'm for the most part neutral on the subject, i don't really care either way whether the gallente description is changed or not, i'm simply pointing out that joseph has a valid point, just as you opposers have a valid point as well."

5/16/2009,just because you're racist and don't know history doesn't mean the game should be. anyone who knows history knows the french have actually won more battles and wars than they have lost. the whole surrender monkey thing is anglo-american propaganda since ww2.
5/16/2009,"(i hate that you can press enter there and it post)ok, so people want mining revamped.this is a given.csm mentioned an 'optional' 'minigame' (in the style of how probing is a minigame) for mining to get better/different yield.also.in this post: checkit.it mentions the idea of generic 'roids that you scan to see what /multiple/ minerals are in them to mine.highsec would have fewer (but still have...) lowsec and next to none (not none, though) 0.0 ores...well, with the minigame idea, it could raise chances to get these other ores, while still giving the ability to mine like normal.we can even keep the roids how they are, just have the minigame allow possibility of this stuff, and massive profit gains in lowsec, and maybe massive highsec gains in null...support and expand on this please!"

5/16/2009,"i support this idea, mostly because i like how much eve tries to stick to a realistic and scientific side (even if it is set 23000 or so years into the future.) i especially like the idea of making asteroid belts look like actual asteroid belts. perhaps make them gigantic fields of useless roids, with patches of mine-able materials scattered around. it certainly would give miners a much needed boon, being able to sit several hundred kilometers away from a warp in point is always a good way to avoid being ganked. the percentage/density system is a very good idea imo, very much like actual roids that are floating in space at this moment. though i don't see why scanners would need a nerf so as not to show specific percentages and concentrations of ore, i mean every ship has a warp drive capable of reaching faster than light speed, i think a scanner should be able to pick up details like that"

5/17/2009,"been away from the forums for a while. been neglecting an important debate.this i can buy for sure, but i think it's important to keep in mind therefore, that as hac's are to battlecruisers, so af must be to destroyers.with presumably the following to finish the listhawk -> cerb long range missile dpsjaguar -> vagabond -> fast close range dpswolf -> munin -> tanked close range dps100% agreedsupported - caldari af are a little broken.my concern with this is that ccp are supposed to be de-nerfing rockets, and having good damage and epic tank rather than just ok damage and epic tank makes me nervous.a 300dps retribution. *drools* i think that this would certainly be too much. a speed/agility boost though could hit the spot quite nicely, but then why would you fly a jaguar?this wouldn't work for me - there's no point in having a drone control range that exceeds the targetting range of the ship (though of course you could well fit sensor boosters, but it's a tough fit to get right i think)i'd actually plump for a resist boost here. most of the feedback i get is that when choosing twixt the two ships, you can have the enyo, or the enyo with drones, and who'd pick the enyo in those circumstances? in this way it becomes a distinct choice.the point for me about not having the tracking bonus on the wolf/jag is to do with dps reduction. this is also why these ships operate in falloff - having that much dps without spending a drop of cap makes for a very powerful ship indeed. i've not really logged enough time in these ships though to judge what else would fit - perhaps a 5% boost to velocity on the jag and a rep bonus or something for the wolf. more postcards there please."
5/17/2009,the topic that will not go away until ccp caves in :)
5/17/2009,"supported in general principle on the basis that the general direction of the changes promotes the following.titan becomes less of an i-win vs. conventional ships.titan becomes a platform for focused anti-capital weapons.mothership gains increased utility on the field.super-capitals are deployed as part of a coherent fleet with mixed ship types.i would love to see titans deployed on the field and take part in sustained capital engagements, taking heavy fire from enemy ships and being suppported by motherships and carriers for reps. i am not a supercap pilot, but i do imagine that changes which promote sustained use over sitting in a safespot cloaked would increase the fun vs. investement payoff.some things i wouldn't like to see.one shotting dreads. any action should have a counterable action, perhaps a level of damage that allows a two shot unless very heavy reps are applied to the targeted dread within a rate of fire window of maybe 30 seconds. realistically if that dread was also taking sustained fire from other caps it would likely die quickly anyway, but this would at least allow a chance of response based on player skill at handling reps.cap killing dd. i think this would simply see titans used in a similar manner as currently. hostile fleet jumps into system and into a ton of bubbles. titans cap dd and hostile fleet is stuck in bubbles with no cap available to mwd out or rep each other effectively. friendly fleet warps in and picks them off. anything which continues to promote one sided fleet enagagements at gates over more balanced battles in system simply reduces the element of player skill and removes fun that can be had taking part in lengthy battles on a more even tactical field. similar for heat damage. granted it would be more fun for the side picking people off, at least they don't camp a gate for 2 hours just so one pilot can boom and they all go home. but eve is a two sided game, and changes that promote fun for all are preferable."
5/17/2009,"there are already counters to dd, like dodging them, jumping in parts of fleet, anti bubble warfare, etc. the difference between removing cap and heat damage or 1 shot kills is obvious. 1 allows you to continue fighting if the worst happens, the other ends the fight in one flash.1 cap injector counters the 0 cap issue while still giving the titan dd a significant advantage. the point is, you want a dd to be massively effective. you also give more of a role to capless bs in fleet fights by doing this (hello sucky minmatar and caldari). you don't want a dd to be a 2-3 pilot afair against enemy fleets. you should have to work harder than what is currently necessary to have such a huge effect on enemy fleets."
5/17/2009,"i agree that the dd changes as proposed would make fighting less of a 2-3 player affair, however those 2-3 players still have a massive impact on the opposing fleet using any area of effect weapon.snipers fitting a cap injector are going to gimp range. it would still be a turkey shoot from the defenders point of view. same if the fleet entering system lost all it's module functionality to heat damage.any kind of aoe which can impact unlimited targets has an exponentially detrimental impact on the fleet it is used upon. removing this so that fleets have more of a chance to fight on ""equal"" terms creates an envirnoment where more pilots can havefun in longer sustained battles.move the titans role to cap killer and the whole business comes down to numbers sure, but numbers can be countered with skill and tactics played out over time. good fc's can adapt to circumstances, sieze opportunities as they develop and turn the tide of a fight. that will only happen in longer fights, not fights decided by aoe."

5/17/2009,"before the apocrypha patch, new player retention rate was around 50% and under. the new player experience was horrible. we all remember the learning curve picture with the cliff.worse still, absolutely none of the csms from previous elections addressed new player concerns. not a single one.then the apocrypha patch releases and with it ccp promises to revise the new player experience. unfortunately the revisions have had the opposite effect. players are just plopped into the game like a naked baby out in the middle of the woods. zero direction, 94% less skills, a confusing and fragmented tutorial, and an army of griefers taking advantage of them (something i personally experienced as a new player).it seems that learning cliff has become even higher and steeper. i don't have the numbers as ccp has not released them, but i have no doubt that retention rate hasn't improved one bit.i doubt anyone will disagree with the opinion that eve has the worst new player experience out of any mmo on the market.as a player running for csm, what is your opinion on this? what do you plan to do to address this ever present problem in eve? i'm asking you this because you vaguely mention new player experiences. most other csms don't even have the words ""new"" and ""player"" in the same sentence, let alone addressing relevant concerns."

5/17/2009,"so, it has all come down to the vote, finally. i'm rather astounded that this time around, i have not yet made up my mind on who to vote for. maybe the candidates in my corner of the political spectrum have not had that high charisma score to pull me over? whatever the reason, i find myself leaning towards either erik finnegan or issler dainze, but i'm not even sure there about them.i used to be a staunch supporter of take care, but i have been less than impressed by some of erik's statements (avoiding concrete answers and statements of intent in some instances, proposing some very pro-sandbox, anti-npc views elsewhere) as well as his inability to put a stop to the ****fight surrounding his candidacy. issler, while covering many of the same topics and yet sporting a cleaner record, seems to stand on a bit too broad a carebear platform where it does not quite come clear where she will side on issues likely to divide said demographic. and, i still haven found that website he's promised us last month...now, neither has deigned to reply to second questionnaire, so i might gonna need help deciding.i'm looking for a candidate of shrewd tenacity who is both able to sway others to her/his causes as well as seek and find a working compromise regardless of petty personal quibbles. he or she should have a vision of eve where - a wide variety of playstyles is actively supported- players are not forced to team up to accomplish most things, and the individual will not automatically lose to the group- choices will have real and lasting consequences- immersion does not take the back seat to cheap balancing tricks- npcs and their corps are more than static mission generators and rats but the basis for a rich and vibrant game world that gives meaning to player actions beyond grind and pvp- the cluster feels as big as it really is by filling that space with danger, diversity and uniqueness and preventing players to cross it in a couple minutes- your ship actually feels like a gargantuan thing of steel and glass several hundred meters in length instead of just another generic matchbox rocket among thousands of clones- you can have fulfilling and varied gameplay even if you are only able to play a few hours per week in short sessions- great rewards are always preceded by even greater risk some say they want eve to be a sandbox for us players. me, i'd rather use my shovel in a cool theme park than on a barren sqare of quartz sand."

5/18/2009,i strongly support this idea.
5/18/2009,"while at it, flip the range bonuses between the two... they're completely out of whack with all of the other bonuses on each of the hulls."
5/18/2009,"thanks for the reply foolish! i'll try and address the contentious points.firstly, with regards to the hac comparison, i deliberately excluded the minmatar ships. the jag definitly has vaga like characteristics, but the vaga is built around fighting with barrage outside of web and scram range; even with small autocannons, a falloff bonus and falloff rigs, you'd need to be just outside overheated web range to be getting more dps than with artillery, with a very high risk of messing up and getting killed. but then on the otherhand, the muinin pretty much always used with arty from what i've seen, which the wolf isn't. switching the falloff and optimal bonus would certainly help, but with the difference between small and medium projectiles the afs and hacs just can't function in the same way. so, as to the tracking bonus; the wolf is out dps'd by every one of the ""gank"" style afs (enyo, retribution, harpy), and even the ishkur, which is a tackle af. the jaguar fairs a little better, but only because 2 of the tackle afs are lolrockets. the point of minmatar ships is to use their speed and flexible weapons to outfight the enemy where they are weakest. the ability to do this is a fair trade off for less dps, although it requires more thoughtful piloting. you cannot always try to sit in falloff. do this against a blaster harpy, a retribution or an enyo who decides to load long rage ammo and you're not going to do well. against these you need to get in up close and use superior tracking to win. without a tracking bonus, some of these fights are unwinnable. problems are also caused in situtaions where the enemies tracking is borderline enough to hit you, for example an autorupture. you need to be as close as possible, going as fast as possible; having to slow down so your guns can hit is just silly. rocket ships: yes it does look like rockets will be getting balanced. this is great. if ccp are sensible (we can only hope) they'll also look at rocket using ships at the same time. perfect solution: balance rockets so that rocket using afs will be doing around maybe 150 dps with a second damage bonus, plus the explosion velocities and radius sorted out so they can actually hit frigate sized targets ok. given that they are both ""tackle"" syle afs, and can hit out to 6km+, this seems reasonable to me, although i'm not a big rocket user so am happy to be told i'm wrong here. retribution: 300 dps sounds silly, but then a coercer with 3 heatsinks gets well over 300. i hear a lot of talk about lasers being overpowered, and i can see why when i look at the numbers here. being able to do a lot of dps but with significantly worse tracking (and no tackle ) is a fair trade, given the lack of speed and agility of a ret, but yeah i'm still unsure here but i don't think i would have a problem with a 300 dps retribution if it was unable to hit a jag or whatever in a tight orbit (and i was able to hit it ).iskur and enyo: there is definitly not enough to distinguish these at the moment. dare i say it, the ishkur overpowered. it really shouldn't be doing the same dps as a wolf. i would think maybe 200 dps (down from 220+ atm)would be appropriate. as the ishkur is the ""tackle"" af, i would have thought it should be getting the tanking bonus. a resist bonus could suit if the dps was gimped a bit. or of course the armour rep bonus that ccp loves for gallente ships. that leaves us with some kind of gank bonus for the enyo. just a thought, but how about a reduction to both mwd and ab cap use, similar to other blaster boats but also helping out with the ab scram fit. i really am struggling with the enyo ."

5/18/2009,"definitely agree something needs to be done, the amount of offline pos-es you can find in even a single high-sec system is rather ridiculous, if anchoring a gsc and paying no further upkeep to prevent others from being able to use a moon is not permitted i don't see why anchoring a pos and paying nothing further should be either.on the plus side this would provide another isk sink via the npc supplied fuels if the owners wanted to keep their pos-es in place.give folks a bit of leeway in terms of inability to get to the pos to fuel it, but at the same time need to ensure the leeway itself isn't open to exploitation, e.g. having it require a month of continuous offline status means you only need to pay for an hour's fuel each month, and so the placeholding would still pretty much be free, whereas if it instead something like if it was offline for more than half the month - at least then they'd have to fork out for 15 days of fuel per month.15 days of fuel for a pos with no active modules would still be pretty cheap but at least it's cost something to keep a moon out of the hands of others.probably should also avoid issuing corporations with a eve-mail warning beyond the pos being out of fuel, as in no warning that the pos is about to be unanchored/self destructed/hackable or whatever other mechanic gets employed to solve the issue."

5/18/2009,agreed.

5/18/2009,something crazy is happening.. i agree with jason edwards.
5/18/2009,"sniper fits would hardly be affectedaoe is fine so long as it's more nuisance than pwn. the point of a dd is to turn the tides of battle meaning a smaller force has a greater chance. right now, titans alone win fights requiring hardly any support to do so... obviously there are exceptions to that. this idea is meant to keep the devastation but remove the 3 pilot affect on fleets... i.e., if you wanna kill my fleet and ensure your titans live, you better damn well bring backup.as i've stated now many times, titan dd's atm are the most overpowered and under performing things in game which is why titans are ghetto. you either miss horribly and run the risk of complete catastrophy, or nail a fleet and laugh. in the future, i think said changes would bring far more strategical purpose to why a titan or fc's would even want to dd. you worry about cap, but comparing cap to the actual existence of a ship is no comparison. as someone who runs fleets, titans to me are such a double edge blade. i personally have no desire to use titans for anything other than massive blobs when i'm massively outgunned. however, most people in titans are out to dd anything and everything for ****s and giggles. that removes fun factor for anyone on either side of the fight. every time we dd an enemy fleet with our own fleet waiting, 100s of pilots see a wasted fight. is that fair to them? allowing them to go in after a dd and get said fight seems far more appropriate, even if the enemy fleet is gimped."
5/18/2009,"wholeheartedly agree, which is why i also disagree.supporting vuk lau's cap killer proposal for the titan over a change to dd that leaves it as an unfocused weapon vs. smaller ships promotes more fighting for all piltots. this is especially the case in the early moments of battles when the attacking fleet has to jump in. i can't imagine anyone disagreeing that the fleet that jumps in isn't already at a significant disadvantage.many of the attacking fleet will be out of range to shoot the opponents gathered in a snipe spot. the defenders on the other hand can concentrate all their fire.fleet jumping in cannot make effective use of remote reps to counter that for the same reason, the fleet is spread out.the defending fleet has freedom to move and warp off unless a skilled dictor pilot makes it through. the attacking fleet is bubbled regardless of player skill and often for 50km or from the gate.personally i don't see the difference between dieing to the actual dd as it currrently stands, and dieing a couple minutes later to a sniper fleet while i am:capped out in a bubble, not able to shoot or mwd, or if i fit an injector i can shoot but don't have the range to hit a dedicated sniping opponent. giving up a mid-slot on a sniper for cap injection on every attacking ship is going to hand the defending fleet a huge tactical advantage in terms of it's ability to dictate range.worse still, sitting in a bubble with completely burned out heat damaged modules, not able to shoot, can't mwd. turkey shooting ftl.granted at least the defending pilots get to shoot stuff, but that hardly addresses the fundamental imbalance that exists as a result of titans being an aoe platform vs. sub-capital ships."
5/18/2009,"you're assuming an alive fleet with 0 cap is helpless. i think many people would disagree with that statement. you're taking 1 instance, jumping into a bubbled gate, as it accounts for every instance. most dd are not fleets jumping into massively bubbled gates, they're fleets on grid bubbled by dictors. consider it the fc's fault if he's dumb enough to put you at that disadvantage w/o a plan in your scenario. in all other scenarios, this type of dd plays out far better than most other ideas.a dread killer titan is a joke just like a fleet killer titan is a joke. aoe is fine, it just can't be a direct damage effect like it currently is.i seem to think you missed the part where a titan dd was supposed to turn the tides of fleet battles... everyone wants that. they just don't want direct damage affects."
5/18/2009,"unfortunately the natural tendency with titan area of effect weapons is simply to stack them up.when one doomsday wasn't enough people used two, then three. i imagine the same will continue to happen, and any change to another area effect will simply result in the same. no change to the essential use of titans, warp in, dd, warp off. same essential devastating effect on the dd'ed fleet."
5/18/2009,"there is no problem with availability of veldspar in nullsec. we specifically don't mine veldspar because it is economically unfeasible to haul veldspar to a refinery when there are hauler spawns that drop tens of millions of tritanium. for veldspar to be viable to mine in nullsec, it would have to yield much more tritanium per cubic metre of veldspar ore.the way i mine at present is: keep running missions until i find a sizable pocket of veldspar (eg: mordus folly, recon (1 of 3)), bring in mining fleet, mine veldspar until downtime.to reduce the market price of veldspar, you'd have to make it available in higher concentrations than currently available. at 4 isk per unit (each unit being 0.1m3), it's barely enough to justify mining in the first place. if the concentration of tritanium in veldspar was to increase by an order of magnitude, the volume of supply would go up, the price of tritanium would plummet, and the values of the other ores/minerals would rise.as for the actual mining mechanic, i don't want the actual process of mining to become any more involved than it already is. i like mining as a nice relaxing exercise i can participate in while catching up on real-world chores.things that would make mining more ""interesting"" without interfering with the relaxed game-play would be to change all system belts to be just plain veldspar, with exploration sites yielding interesting ores eg: a smattering of kernite, along with huge planetoids of superdense veldspar. the mining director would scan the belts and tag rocks to be mined by various specialists who would then calibrate their mining tools and start pointing lasers at rocks.macro miners could keep doing their worst in system belts, while those of us prepared to invest a little effort in hands-on belt discovery can find these exploration belts with the good ores.in the meantime we need vastly improved supplies and mobility of tritanium in order to boost the value of the other minerals. more tritanium for less money means the manufacturers will have more money left from their budget to spend on the other minerals.of course a side effect is that the ""40% minerals from reprocessed items"" figure will start being terribly skewed since these vast quantities of tritanium being hauled around the place will start appearing in the form of whatever manufactured item has the best mineral compression available at the moment."
5/18/2009,"why mine arkonor, bistot or crokite when you can mine uber dense rocks of veldspar instead! i love these new changes, it really is something to look forward to. veldspar, here i come!!amidoinitright?if you look at old dev blogs and what ccp have reported then you will see that ccp have said that they want to redo the entire mining system in the lines of what has been mentioned but aren't sure yet as to how it will affect the community or game. that is why they haven't changed the way mining works as they don't want everyone to stop mining in 0.0.most of what i have read here is about veldspar. it's obvious either most have never set foot outside of high-sec or have an obsession with veldspar and are intent on forcing everyone else to mine just because it's the best in high-sec. funny thread fails to deal with the issues at hand and fails miserably.last but not least, ccp have already said they will revamp the entire system by, or after, 2010. all these, so called, initiatives are a waste of time as ccp won't implement anything until then."
5/18/2009,"you know i've supported this idea in the past, but need to put my vote in here as well. composite asteroids are the best way to revamp mining, passes the common sense idea, and would put more use in 'scouting for rocks'. it would make using a survey scanner a necessity for maximizing yields, and take a little more thought than just lock-activate-haul.

5/18/2009,"at the risk of going off topic by complaining about skill training times again, i will point out that marauders are unreasonably hard to train for considering what you're getting. i'm currently flying a raven. to get into a golem would take me over two-and-a-half goddamn months just to get inside the hull, never mind the t2 launchers and all that. anyone who thinks a marauder is a reasonable choice as a salvager needs to adjust their definition of ""reasonable"".i see no real reason why not to implement larger tractor beams. since they'd obviously have higher fitting requirements it's not like you could just replace the smalls on your destroyer with mediums; they'd actually make using ships other than destroyers (or marauders) as salvagers a viable option. people who oppose things purely on the grounds that they're ""not necessary"" need to stop and realize that itching feeling they get when they sit down might just be that stick they have up their ass. supported."

5/18/2009,"from csm meeting 1.2 minutes:0102-01-0047 nighthawk needs powergrid increasewhile the nighthawk may have some performance issues, due to the lack of power output, compared to the other field command ships, the ship is not designed to fit heavy assault missile launchers and micro warp drives. ccp plans on reviewing the command ships as a whole in the future. ccp zulupark stated that there will be several balance changes early 2009, and that this will likely be part of it, with the nighthawk getting a good look."
5/18/2009,"well, since it's nearly the end of early 2009, let's hope we hear something soon."

5/18/2009,still needs a boost just to be able to fit a gang mod with lesser weapons (hml) and a mwd let alone any form of a pvp tank
5/18/2009,i'll keep supporting these threads until it gets fixed.
5/18/2009,"agreed... i ran a newbie through 21 days of trial to see what i could accomplish with them and filed no less than 40 isk spam petitions. often the target was back to spamming within 15 minutes, having changed only 1 letter/number in their name. one guy i petitioned 7 times, under 7 different names, in 1.5 hours!also, newbs should have the option of closing those channels!"
5/18/2009,"as i've said before... we need a 'spam' button on our chat. r-click the name, then select 'spam'.the target is immediately blocked to you until you log out.if enough such 'spam' selections activate on a char in a given period of time, they recieve a short gag (an hour or two). if enough short term gags add up they're temp banned. a gm takes one look at their chat logs and boom, forever gone (owing that they've not already been petitioned multiple times for isk spam and thus already banned).also, ccp needs to get rather invasive... the client should always report the nic address of the host. if the host recieves a ban for blatant violations of the eula they recieve a nic level ban (this bans the hard-wired identity of their network interface card, so they can't access the game without changing their card)[yes, i have no idea if this is even possible... but it would be damned nice if so]"

5/18/2009,"this would make an end with the ever so manipulated kill boards out there, and i think it would surely be fun to always being able to check rankings / statistics ingame.but the individual player should be able to decide if they want their own kill board statistics to be publicly viewable or being private."
5/18/2009,"so basically have the option to make your combat log public? might be nifty, but i doubt it'd see much use - there is no way ccp is going to make a killboard half as good as the private ones, and we already have apis to fill them with reliably and easily. could fill a niche similar to eve voice as the cheap, low-hassle version for players who want basic functionality, though. i'll support this as an issue, but i only want to see ccp do it if it's easy. and of course, you need to have the option to keep it private."
5/18/2009,if *totally* optional i support this. by totally optional i mean pilots have the option to have both thier wins and thier losses not displayed. example: pilot joe uses the public killboard. pilot sam has opted out of the public killboard. joe kills sam. the kill doesn't show up publicly for either pilot because sam has opted out.
5/18/2009,"o/so right now we have a pretty terrible system for finding out who needs armour/etc when flying in a remote rep gangs. for a small gang of ships (5-10) it works fine, but as soon as you start going over that you run into two big problems:1- watch list can't support more than 10 people2- broadcasts being flooded, and being too hard to tell how long ago a broadcast was madewell, i figured the 10 people max. had something to do with the server struggling to keep track of the hitpoint status of a whole fleet, but that's no reason to leave it in the nerfed state it is atm.i propose that changes are made so that when you broadcast, you are automatically added to the watch list of everyone in the wing/fleet , all depending on fleet settings of course. if you have 10 people in the watch list already, the oldest person would get removed to make space for a new one.this would make staying on top of broadcasts much easier, and help battleship gangs massively - particually when fighting without cap support (ie: in a hostile cynojammed system, especially when trying to disable the jammer itself)um, that's it. do point out anything i missed"
5/18/2009,supporting my own topic
5/18/2009,"watch lists are also used for cov-ops pilots giving wp in's, logistics pilts/carrier pilots spider tanking and cap transfer, probably a lot of other things too that people need to keep an eye on.although i do think the system can be messy with a lot of broadcasts, that can be managed with good pilot/fleet discipline.not supported."
5/18/2009,"well you'd be able to change the settings on it as need be. it's just an idea - not quite refined yet. yes, you would need to be able to 'lock' people on watch list if you didn't want them disappearing, but keep all unlocked spots for broadcasts.as for fleet discipline - i see what you're saying: a good fc and good piloting should be rewarded, but when you have, for instance, 25 battleships at a hostile cynojammer and half of them are taking heavy damage from both pos guns and enemy support/carriers the current watch list/broadcasts system simply does not work."
5/18/2009,"as a hac pilot, when you move to your respective command ship, you get a really good anti-support that uses more of the same medium weapons and survives ddd. it's a logical hac upgrade.as a logistics pilot, when you move to your respective command ship, you give a really solid boost to gang performance, usually with a defensive focus that enhances the role of logistics. it's what you graduate to as a logistics pilot.as a recon pilot, recon is currently the end of the line.on the other hand, we have a set of unused bc hulls. unlike the tier 1 bc hulls, which have as a whole more defensive bonuses, the tier 2 hulls are a little beefier on stats and have more blatant damage oriented bonuses. harby and hurricane being the obvious examples. tier 2 bc's, without stating specifics, should without a doubt be adapted into something more aggressive than the tier 1's.what is a t2 tier 2 bc role?what is a recon upgrade?deimos is to astarte as arazu is to ......?do these questions not highlight the serendipity of a bc derived recon upgrade?"
5/18/2009,we need large or capital scale neuting or smartbombing or heatwarfare. which in of itself will make it anti-capitals.large smartbombs + ship bonusheavy neuts + ship bonus and not a bhaalgorn lol.heat warfare. slowly incap all ur enemy's modules. something like. lets say heat battlecruiser. directs heat into target ship.heat warfare lvl 5 means that your target needs thermodynamics 5 to be able to survive him. if he has lvl 4 his modules will slowly take damage. if at lvl 0 or 1. the ship will be fairly quickly disabled.
5/18/2009,i agree that we need t2 tier 2 bcs.doesn't make sense that they aren't there.think that this would would make for some very nice tactics on the field of battle.
5/18/2009,"no, you got a bs size upgrade. imho an astarte and deimos are not really related."
5/18/2009,"*sigh* if you call lolblack ops the upgrades of recons just because black ops use a few skills that are also good skills for recon pilots to have, then marauders are the bs graduation path for hac pilots.as neither marauders or black ops require any t2 cruiser prereqs, they are barely related.furthermore, recons require sig analysis v and electronics upgrades v, neither of which will get you into a black ops any faster. yet hac's require weapon upgrades v, which will get you into a marauder faster.skill-wise, recon pilots get a bit left out. talking about black ops is kinda unrelated."
5/18/2009,"i'm actually going to be pulling ideas that i was posting in a previous thread about the same topic created by lana torrin new bounty systemmy ideas are actually inspired by lana's idea and continues to expand on it with a couple more additions aqnd some changes to the original idea.the new bounty system will pay out bounties based on the destruction of players ships and/or pods. the amount of isk paid out would be equal to only 60% - 75% of the destroyed ship, item, and implant values. the only way for a player to receive the full, or almost full value of the kill is to work specificly as a bounty hunter, which i will define later.how does a pirate get a bounty?in the system there will be two ways for a pirate to receive a bounty.1) as with the current system, any player with negative security status can have a bounty of any amount placed on them by any player.2) a pirate with -2.0 security status becomes eligible to receive concord sanctioned bounties.a concord sanctioned bounty is gained by committing a criminal act (for simplification, the destruction of an unagressed ship). after the ship is destroyed, concord will place 10% of the ships value as a bounty on the pirate.basicly the more a pirate yarrs, the larger his bounty will become. meaning that killing a good pirate will almost always net some money for the pirates killer.this concord sanctioned bounty would be added to any pre-existing player bounties that may already be in place.what this also means is pirates now have a new e-peen tool (my bounty is bigger than your bounty). to add to the e-peen factor, we could also give the pirates color coded skulls to make them feel special for having the red 300+ mil bounty skull as opposed to the purple 10+ mil bounty skull. bounty hunterany player with a security status of 2.0+ would be allowed to engage in bounty hunting. to do this they would talk to bounty agents who would (for a small fee), allow bounty hunters to hunt targets for a set period of time (lets say 1 week).bounty hunters are allowed to engage their targets in high sec, even allowing podding they are also given the abiltiy to collect private bounties. however, the targets given out by agents are random. a pirate may only have a set amount of bounty hunters chasing him at a time. the amount of bounty hunters is based on the amount of the bounty. for every 50 million isk, one additional bounty hunter is allowed to have kill rights on a pirate at a time. global and private bountiesglobal bounties are bounties payed out upon the destruction of a pirate to all parties involved. global bounties are paid out at a maximum of 60-70% of the value of the destroyed ships, items, and implants. global bounties can be collected by anyone including other pirates.private bounties are only available to bounty hunters assigned to the pirate. private bounties pay out as much as 90 - 100% of the value of the destroyed items as well as enabling a bounty hunter to turn in a pirates corpse for an added 5 to 10% bonus to the previous payout. to prevent players from stockpiling pirate corpses, the corpse must be turned in within an hour of receiving a pirates bounty.where do the corpses go?!if pirate has multiple bounties and i turned in the corpse? who gets the corpse?in this sitaution i would say that the corpse goes to the highest player bounty contributor. basicly, if pirate a has a 150 million bounty which is broken down into75 million isk bounty placed by concord50 million bounty from player b25 million bounty from player cin this scenario player b would receive the first corpse, and player c would receive the second corpse.in the event that a pirate only has a npc bounty, than concord would give a small bonus, lets say 5% of the previous payout for the corpse."
5/18/2009,"but we can't give the pirates nothing!with the introduction of this new system many pirates and ""pirates"" will find themselves with a little more heat on them then they might otherwise be used to. so pirates will receive eve-mails regularly that will let them know how many active bounty hunters may be chasing them and whether they have been online in the last 12 hours.also, a pirate who is uncomfortable with a rather large bounty on his head would be able to ""rat down"" the concord portion of his bounty. by killing npc rats he can lower the total concord bounty on his head, however the player bounty portion is permanant until collected by another player.how can we accuratly get the value of items to be added to a pirates bountyfor most modules this would be easy, the averages could be received from the average payout of contracts / market prices for the particular item. this would probably be the most difficult portion to implement and may have to be limtied only to the ships and implant values instead of also including fitted modules."
5/18/2009,*reserved*just incase.
5/18/2009,which soon as the bounty amount becomes larger then the clone value. it is smart for the pirate's friend too shoot and pod him.which just means moar isk for his friends.never true. infact it doesnt even have to be a friend. many people have alts which can do it.so the pirate's friend simply has to keep 2.0+ sec? pretty easy.no. the bounty system literally has to become like fail warfare and militias.people opt into being bounty hunters.pirates opt into being pirates.anti-pirates opt into being anti-pirates.once standings start being wrecked when bounty hunting and whichever piracy. the system starts to balance. not only that. even if you dont opt in. your standings can force you into it.thusly a -5.01 sec will force you into being labeled a pirate. which makes you fair game to be killed by anti-pirates. same with anti-pirates. kill enough of the pirate faction. you become anti-pirate.bounty hunters can find themselves in the same boat.
5/18/2009,"read carefully. how will the pods value ever become more than the pod value if you only receive 60 to 70% of the pods value on the kill? the money received comes from only destroyed items.pirate pays 1 mil for a clone and his freind pods him? he gets 600k back....you need to read the post much more carefully.*edit* to clarify... though i think i made it pretty clear in the post.pirate a has 100 mil bounty on his head and is flying a harbinger (value 40 mil).pirate a is destroyed by player b.player b receives 75% of the value of the harbinger (30 million).30 million is deducted from the pirates total bounty, which is now 70 million.even if the pirate kills himself. guess what? he just lost a harbinger and gets back only 30 million, which is like crap insurance or just underselling on the market."
5/18/2009,as soon as you start putting concord bounties on player owned ships you run into the problem of folks getting max insurance on a ship and then having their own alt popping that ship for the ship bounty plus the insurance which would be worth more than they lost so they start can start a infinite loop of endless isk.
5/18/2009,"i know, beating a dead horse here.how about when a player is podded, the bounty is only paid up to the value of the clone they are using?however, the full bounty is paid out if the player loses sp from not having an up to date clone.yay/nay?"
5/18/2009,supporting my own thread obviously.
5/18/2009,"if you're basing bounties on actual damage inflicted, then don't limit them to poddings, include ship damage in the mix. that said, something along this line is needed."
5/18/2009,"at the moment podding is the only way to get a bounty payout. moving it to being on ship destruction, while easier for low sec, is hard because ships can be insured so no way of telling how much damage you have actually inflicted."
5/18/2009,"well, the game knows how much damage was inflicted, even if the bounty hunter doesn't. i like the idea of bounties being commensurate with the value of loss to the target - value destroyed less the amount of related insurance payout, and skillpoints lost due in death (if any).i'm not sure how to work that into the bounty system practically though. so, supported for the concept, but obviously some details to work on."

5/18/2009,i think t3 needs time to settle in before throwing more options at it. currently there are issues with manufacture and cost and the ships are not in common enough use to gain a full view of their balance in game.give them time before more changes.

5/18/2009,"once walking in stations hits, you will have to recreate your avatar anyways. so this issue is kinda pointless, at this point.however, the ability to change your race, just seems.. wrong."
5/18/2009,i agree with this.
5/18/2009,"i assume you include bloodline with race.as a new player, i've not experienced ""race matters"". again, please correct me if i'm wrong but there are no in game implications for race and bloodline, they are now purely aesthetic/flavor.i can understand how the suggestion would seem unreasonable and wrong, and i don't want to push it further than that but... we already die and are cloned with our minds intact; what's wrong with a little genetic tweak ^^?"

5/18/2009,"i think i am a good pick for you. let me respond to some of your points:- a wide variety of playstyles is actively supportedi believe that it is the range of experiences in eve that are separates it from other games. i will always support keeping those experiences as diverse as possible.- players are not forced to team up to accomplish most things, and the individual will not automatically lose to the groupsolo play is very important. there will always be reasons why players will want to do something alone and not in a group. i believe this is also an important part of eve.- choices will have real and lasting consequencesabsolutely!- immersion does not take the back seat to cheap balancing tricksi want to see things that increase immersion, if i wanted an eye/hand twitch experience i'd go play tennis or paintball!- npcs and their corps are more than static mission generators and rats but the basis for a rich and vibrant game world that gives meaning to player actions beyond grind and pvpwe need smarter and more variable npc experiences. this goes hand in hand with both immersion and solo play.- the cluster feels as big as it really is by filling that space with danger, diversity and uniqueness and preventing players to cross it in a couple minutesi love the sense of how big the 'verse in eve is. i would fight anything that diminished that.- your ship actually feels like a gargantuan thing of steel and glass several hundred meters in length instead of just another generic matchbox rocket among thousands of clonesi believe the physics model needs some loving to make that difference in theoretical mass seem more ""real"".- you can have fulfilling and varied gameplay even if you are only able to play a few hours per week in short sessionsnot everyone can put in 40 hours a week in eve. the training system in eve makes it clear that you should be able to enjoy eve if you can only play casually.- great rewards are always preceded by even greater risk risk/reward is what eve is all about. i think we need to actively prod ccp to make sure these two are really inline. for example low sec right now is clearly out of whack using that metric.hope that helps you decide,issler"

5/19/2009,please look into the mechanics of neutral/alt remote repping and their aggression.current game mechanica neutral/alt remote repper can rep someone under attack.the repper is aggro'd to the attacker.the repper does not get an aggression timer in the effect that they may dock up -or- jump through a gate leaving them half assed free for sticking their nose into a fight.there is no real risk for the repper and he may disengage after turning the tide of a battle at any time.game mechanic examplei war dec a corporation .... one of its pilots decides to flaunt a ship i can easily kill infront of me.i start shooting the ship ... all of a sudden his alt (who is hugging a station -or- a warp gate) starts remote repping himhis alt is now aggressed to me ... leaving me the option to shoot the original target -or- shoot the remote repper.so if i shoot the remote repper ... he is allowed to dock up or jump through the gate anytime he feels comfortable ... he doesn't have to wait the normal 1 minute de-aggro to do so. in which i could probably kill him during that de-aggro time and punish him for sticking his nose in our war.if i ignore the repper ... i'm fighting a losing battle against a ship i can normally take.suggested fixnormal aggression timer when concerning docking & gate jumping ... which is 14 mins ... which 1 minute of that you can't dock -or- jump.

5/19/2009,why have i not supported this yet?
5/19/2009,"i strongly support this, especially with the expansion having come out. in wh space, if you anchor a pos, and fuel it, but then have to leave or are accedently locked out due to wh collapse, the pos will go offline, but the chances of someone bringing in enough firepower to do anything about the pos is slim, granted for the moment there's plenty of moons in wh, but they'll eventually be more populated, and as it is, if the original corp happens to come back, and start refuling their pos, they'll have a base that's extreamly difficult to remove, making the weaker entity have no choice but to either abandon their pos, or try to get it out while the other corp is busy elsewhere, and not having an imediate wh exit could cause some huge issues."
5/19/2009,"supported.allow the hacking and removal of towers and all mods that have been offline for 30 or more days.if there are concerns over this removing an isk sink, then perhaps have the hacked tower recovered as a new item ""derelict tower"" that can be sold to npc's for a value lower than a new pos. this could actually introduce a new ""salvaging"" profession to hi-sec."
5/19/2009,there are already small freighters. they're called...jump freighters!
5/19/2009,"i quite like what ccp did with the orca - it's a small freighter, good for moving rigged ships, and also a support vessel for mining ops to give it something to do that justifies the half-billion price tag. between indys, ts, orcas, jfs, and full freighters, every imaginable combination of hauling capacity is already in place. we don't need more. maybe a couple tweaks(rigged ships in freighters, say), but no new hulls."
5/19/2009,this...
5/19/2009,"try to move something that is above 100k in size.it would fit into an orca - if you could tear down the walls between cargo and corp hangar.why would it be bad if we had a small freighter? (i'm not even considering the jump freighters. they're t2 freighters, not ""small freighters"", even if they're technically smaller.)"
5/19/2009,i don't really like what they did with the orca. it's like they tried to solve too much with one ship. i would rather have had one small freighter per race and one mining command ship like the orca but without the sma and cargo. though i wouldn't want to see it nerfed now.i think it makes sense to introduce a new ship (for each race) that are basically the same as the orca minus links and corp hangars but with some extra cargo space.
5/19/2009,this. we're still lacking an intermediate hauler that fits into the price progression unlike jfs.
5/19/2009,"well i woudnt mind smaller brother of freighter in the price range of orca, but as a his big brother without any slots for fit or rigs."
5/19/2009,yes please and i find it quite awkward that ccp gave us the orca instead of the mini freighter we asked formaybe they could even make a mini freighter with 500k m3 ( just a rough idea )and 1million m3 of ship maintenance bay to haul rigged ships in empirerigged ships are subject to trading aswell and we need a solution to haul rigged ships
5/19/2009,"you maybe right about this, we need something like small or light freighter.orca is more like mining support vessel, and we need some type of transport ship.you have my support."
5/19/2009,the only way i'll even support this is if the orca can handle 1 freight container's worth of stuffbut it stops there.: o potherwise your screwing up the balance.there is no need for a smaller freighter... if you can't be bothered to buy the damn thing yourself then stop whining for a new ship.
5/19/2009,"it's called the orca. i dont see the devs putting out a new ship that does basically the exact same thing, just with a new training path."
5/19/2009,"i don't see what you mean about something with 40-60k cargo space as being the same as the orca.the progression path is fubared. why would you need to have:mining barge vastrogeologyastrogeology iiisciencescience ivminingmining iv mining director ileadershipleadership imining foremanmining foreman v to fly a cargo moving vessel? it does not make sense.there is nothing about mining anywhere when asking for a ship that is larger than the industrial/transport class and smaller than the freighter. hence the light/small freighter designation request.i am sorry if ccp duped you all into training for the orca to fill this niche but it was a stupid decision. i am just calling it out after getting back into the game after a long break.it may be a new training path, even though all it needs is one skill a ""small freighter"" skill with the same pre reqs as the ""freighter"" if not a little less.i would suggest to keep it like the orca in that the ship is for all races, i am sick of seeing all of the different tiers of ships when there is no reason for them. the obelisk and the rest did not need to be 1 per race. the super haulers should have been all the same.anyway adding 2 ships for all races, not each, would work nicely.1 ship with 30-50k base cargo.1 ship with enough space to move 1 assembled and fitted battleship. can only carry assembled ships."
5/19/2009,"well i will definitely not vote for you for csm. that is great if everything is capable of being hauled as you say, however that is not why we are requesting this. we are requesting a fix for the flaw in the progression of skills related to moving cargo and items.i would hope the a csm would not only look at issues that need fixed because of a bug but also look at making the systems and mechanics more consistent.can you explain why the orca makes sense as being the intermediary between indys/tss and freighters? if you look at the skills they do not make sense if the orca should come first in progression of skill. now due to the mechanics of what the ships are capable of they fit in the middle but the skill requirement is fubar."
5/19/2009,"sorry to hear that. the reason it makes sense is that mining barge has essentially ceased to be the mining ships skill, and has become the ore racial skill. just like you need indy 5 for ts or freighters, you need barge 5 for rorquals and orcas. the skill isn't especially long for a pseudocapital ship, and it's the right one to use as a requisite for mining-focused ships. it's the problem with making it dual-role, but that was necessary in order to give it a role other than ""bad freighter for people with no money"". i don't see anything obviously wrong with the skill progression."
5/19/2009,"problem is that an orca doesn't give anything we don't already have with an iteron 5, with rigs etc.calling orca a mini-freighter isn't right. it's a more versatile industrial ship, with ship hangar and some mining bonuses."
5/19/2009,"three times the cargo capacity, give or take, and the ability to move (small) rigged ships. even if you don't mine, it has utility that the itty 5 just doesn't. it's no titan, even at logistics, but it does have advantages."
5/19/2009,"also, to answer those that complain: ""it doesn't fit in the training skill plan"". sorry, but in my honest opinion, i think that the plan for a freighter isn't enough. especially the jump freighter. so should we change it just because i think so?no. so your argument that the skill training plan is fubared is a moot point. (example: light interdictors & heavy interdictors)--isaac"
5/19/2009,"if you read the link in the op to my thread, you'd see that heat damage is in part a way to user in more t3 goods.... do you want that t2 beam that dies to 1 max dd, or do you want that t3 good that dies to 3... add that to a 20 % chance to be affected on each mod, you have an amazingly low rate of death of mods.this also opens up the avenue to other things. as for the neuting part.... there are now a viable **** ton of ways to counter neuting. rr fleets all carry cap injectors already, only sniper ships do not. smaller ships are anti dictor platforms, so it's less likely they'll even get bubbled.you are being very 1 dimentional in your thinking, so you've said no to area, and you've stated why, there's no point in repeating yourself w/o further ammunition. you seem to be running under the assumption that i and vuk have not considered the rammifications of this before posting. yet he and i are involved in one of the biggest wars eve has ever seen, and experience and lead fleets with titans for and against us daily. you're a bit out gunned on the the experience factor there."
5/19/2009,"i actually quite like this idea, good on ya mate!+1"
5/19/2009,"first i want to say that i very much like the idea of splitting up the colony into a orbiting hub and an actual base. i like what it would change in the pvp and industrial aspect of eve, as do many other players. but i have some suggestions myself... 1. the hubit is said that the hub can be attacked and destroyed, also destroying the resources and the whole complex/colony, reverting the planet to its original state. i say reverting a planet to the pre terra-formed state is scientifically impossible, even if the terraforming was not yet complete. so either have a solid destructive force wipe the planets ecosystem clean again (see ""5. ships"") or just leave the terra-forming (complete or incomplete) for the next alliance to hold control over the planet. because for a system of changing ecosystems to work, different ecosystems should mean different resources and services, so that it is interesting for the alliances to change them to their needs. i would also suggest the hub being an improved player owned station with the possibility of changing ownership when the control point is taken. as was said in the text, it would hold a planetary transport service too. these stations could and schould be well defended. this way, the battle for a planets colony can grow out to be an allout war between alliances. large pirate or merc corps could also give it a try, but of course they can only loot/kill and not take over the planet. they could however disable the planets production to fit their agenda.2. the colony itselfbecause the destruction of the hub wouldn't necessarily mean the destruction of the colony, this would mean a new dimension in planetary control. it would be more fun to disable for example the shield powering stations with playercontrolled vehicles or airplanes, to then take control of the disabled settlements or domes by destroying certain structures with laser/missile/... bombardments from orbit (see ""5. ships""). after taking over all settlements, the alliance would now hold the hub and the colony of the planet. if there are two controllable planets in a system, this process would be repeated to hold sovereighnty. when one of the planets is disabled or different planets in a system are controlled by different alliances, the system would be contested. for outsiders or players not involved in faction/alliance warfare, this would mean more clarity in these matters, maybe even motivate them to participate in those matters or join one of the parties. please visit your user settings to re-enable images.3. clonesan interesting new approach on this matter is the use of clones for planetary transport. you just jump into a new body when you are on the planet. then, for example, when the hub has been taken over or disabled by enemy forces, you can either whait for the base to fall into friendly hands again or you jump to one of your other clone bodies. this would translate into an increase in the clone business. (perhaps clone manufacturing could turn out to be a viable new playercontrolled trade...)4. carebearsi must agree with the guys who said simplifying the work of a carebear is a stupid idea. but i also thought the idea of a settlement taking less and less work to maintain was a good idea, but it may be nearly impossible to implement... so, i'll leave it be. in line of the mining/producing/... on the planet. try to make it just profitable enough for the alliances to take over the planet, don't overcomplicate but also don't simplify too much and last but not least, try to make use of the passengers (prostitutes, soldiers and slaves alike).5. shipsjust exploring some possibilities here, laugh with it if you want ^^"
5/19/2009,"these would be the skills needed...primary skill required: capital ships iii advanced spaceship command v spaceship command v secondary skill required: [race] cleansercapital ships iii advanced spaceship command v spaceship command v [race] battleship v spaceship command iv [race] cruiser iv spaceship command iii[race] frigate ivleadership ivtertiary skill required: advanced laboratory operation ivbiology vgraviton physics iiquantum physics iiplasma physics iinuclear physics iiengineering vscience vastrogeology vmining ivas i said, this type of ship would specify in planetary warfare, bombarding the planets defenses or control points or laying waste to the planets ecosystem by dropping chemical containers or something. they would also prove essential in building up new settlements and other logistic tasks."
5/19/2009,"i forgot,/signed!"
5/19/2009,"hell i wouldn't mind being able to just inject every skill and train in them once the prerequisites are complete.but i concur, it would be a nice hassle saver."
5/19/2009,i would think the issue is at the moment the check for prereqs is on injection and not training queue.i agree it would be good to pre-inject.what should be changed is that you can inject any skill you can't train it until pre-reqs are met. since the queue is smart enough to escalate the training time base off of queue status the pre-req. check can be based off of trained + queue.
5/19/2009,"hint: just because it would make something easier for you doesn't mean it should be implemented. in fact, it's often a very good reason why it should not be implemented."
5/19/2009,i'll support if medium is 30k range and large 40k range. or ccp just's gives us teir2 dessies with salvaging bonuses already!!
5/19/2009,yes pleaseps: the hurricane being the best salvaging + looting ship i suggest ccp looks at it for an example
5/19/2009,"okay. there is something really wrong with the stealth bombing system. the new system obliterates the possibility of soloing. first, they use torpedoes. honestly, these things are so slow you can beat a rhino to death with a toothpick (which was bent) before it hits. this severely restricts the targets you can hit with this. you can only hit a battle cruiser or a battleship. maybe a cruiser with a huge sig radius. huge. though would have to be not watching anything also. secondly, you now can not solo in this. the old system worked. you warp to a gate camp, sit a... few... kilometers out, de-cloak, fire off a volly of missiles then cloak and... for lack of a better word, gtfo. this wasn't ""unfair"" or ""unbalanced"". why? because you can't take out a battleship like this solo! best you'll get is a bad cruiser. it also had a very strategic element to it. use the stealth bomber to kill that pesky electronic warfare frigate, then warp in the big guys to mop them up. the new system gets rid of these packs of stealth bombers that would get rid of gate camps for the fleet to warp in. also, you had to be quite experienced to actually solo correctly in this. now, i am not saying that it wasn't a fleet ship, because it still was. a group of them supported by a fleet could take a pos's defenses on or be a softener before a fleet jump/warp (as said above).thought i would just bring this ol' topic up again, just because i know it is irritating a lot of stealth bombing pilots."
5/19/2009,"umm, wall-of-text = bad. btw: i'm a stealthbomber user and i'm not complaining. before, they sucked worse than anything else.--isaac"
5/19/2009,"the old bomber was an anti-frig ship, essentially, but it was bad at it, and there are more than enough anti-frig frigs out there already. the new bomber is supposed to fight battleships, generally in groups. you can't do what the old one could, but you can do a lot of things now that the old one couldn't. besides, ccp is never going to roll back their changes a couple weeks after they came in, so it's not even worth trying."
5/19/2009,"agreed. ccp have made changes to other ship and weapon classes in the past to ruin their effectiveness (eg. missiles) but this isn't one of them. the increase in bomb effectiveness through cost/mechanics has made them viable to most pilots. the torps are disappointing, but it's not a huge issue.although the old bomber wasn't an anti-frig ship as you say, unless you mean in terms of solo pvp. it could take on any ship class and be effective. and with enough of them, you could kill any ship class incredibly fast."
5/19/2009,"i was mostly talking about solo pvp, yes. but it still remains a fact that killing something with torpedoes is 'slightly' harder than cruise missiles. i'm not saying that stealth bombers are useless now, because they have had very nice additions to bombs, as you have said, i'm saying that solo pvp in a stealth bomber is more than slightly difficult now.i'm not going to go as far to say as this fully endorses blob warfare, because it doesn't. i'm just saying they could possibly beef up the soloing abilities of this a little more than what it is currently."
5/19/2009,"while the new sbs might not be good for solo pvp, they are great for solo ninja ratting in 0.0. and lets face it, the old sbs werent much better for solo pvp, unless you count volleying t1 frigs 'pvp'.the new bombers actually work a lot better in pvp, and a small sb gang with a tackler or two can seriously inconvenience big ships."
5/19/2009,"it's true that the torps do redefine the role of stealth bombers somewhat. i think they actually bring more into line with what a stealth bomber typically do. now at the risk of comparing real life stealth bombers and ones that exist in eve i will say that real life stealth bombers are used to take out strategic targets and usually large ones at that, using ""bombs"". and from what i've seen since the patch people are using them for exactly that bombing. saying that stealth bombers can't alpha frigates is entirely untrue. in fact with the inclusion of the bomb launcher on them they are actually better at this. i've seen at times, 3 or 4 frigates go down to one bomb if it's aimed correctly. i've seen stealth bomber pilots annoy the crap out of people who are trying to set up and or rep pos, armour and shield maintenance drones don't react well to being hit by bombs. and if your setting up a pos don't deploy modules before the shield is up.but more and more i see stealth bombers being used as ""bombers"" just like they should be. the fact that they can launch torps just makes them that more versatile for fleet engagements and gate camps you just have to change your tactics a little bit."

5/19/2009,supported in general principle that password security is poor.perhaps add a reminder to the login screen once a month with a suggestion and tips on good password security. perhaps even with a link to an advice page like we get with patch notes etc. a reminder wouldn't hurt while leaving it open to player choice.

5/19/2009,yeh i want my drakes to outdamage 300mill ships too
5/19/2009,supporting this partly just because it will help share the burden of corp management and so on. we have people log in to play and then spend almost their entire time dealing with standings/pos's/lord knows what.spread the work.
5/19/2009,i want to fix my -4 standing with gallente.
5/19/2009,"it's about time to fix this.it's well known fact that 40% of mineral flow is coming from loot tables.replace t1 with t1 named mods, and remove the ammo and drone drops totally. they are so small portion of the loot drops anyway.this change would be like the removal of npc shuttle production, major one. it would be good for the new eden."
5/19/2009,"we have been discussing it intensively inside the csm.however there's so many variables to consider, that it's not clear if it fixes the problem, compared to the fact that it will upset a lot of people.so while i like the idea, i'm afraid it's not that easy"
5/19/2009,pretty much what he said. this is not an easy decision to make.--isaac

5/19/2009,"i would personally retrain my gallente/amarr trained toon to caldari if missile launchers had their own turret like graphics, and launched from those bays instead of just from the center of the ship./signed"
5/19/2009,"supported, its ridiculous to fly a ship who can fit two tier 3 bs inside, when the ship has the same size as a tier 3 bs itself."
5/19/2009,make carriers and stations bigger!
5/19/2009,yes.
5/19/2009,"regular caps need to be bigger, supercaps also,seriously... make them bigger !!carrier size is lolms size is lol"
5/19/2009,+1that would be easy for ccp to just x2 (3?) all carriers/ms size.
5/19/2009,yep.when carriers were first introduced and i saw their design it was like :yay!and when a first saw carriers ingame and they were almost bs-sized it was like : oh crap ):
5/19/2009,"now wormholes allow people to invade sleeper territory. personally i think the sleepers would be affronted by such a thing, and would naturally want to invade back.i propose that a small amount of sleepers should be capable of using a wormhole in a system where upon they warp to either a belt, station or other such place and begin attacking in their normal fashion and acting accordingly. after all we had this big event of wormholes appearing and planets disappearing and some people are not even aware of it. perhaps its time to make them aware. plus if you kill the sleepers you get a small amount of loot. im not suggesting massive hordes of sleepers killing everything in sight (although that would be fun too), but just the occasional gang of them in normal space. sleepers must use probe launchers too, right?"
5/19/2009,grate idea. make it more interesting or they could fight concord also. but actual make it decent battles and what not.
5/19/2009,"sorry but this will never ever happen. the sleepers are long since extinct, the only remains are their automated guardian drones and some electronical gizmos that are still active."
5/19/2009,so said guardian drones went skymet on our collective asses. i fail to see the problem.
5/19/2009,"if anyone bothered to read the devblog/back story, you'll find that sleepers are defensive drones only.thus this is yet again, another moot point.--isaac"
5/19/2009,"so i've been using poses a lot lately, and i've discovered firsthand just how immensely frustrating they are. this is no surprise, of course - i've known it for years. it has, however, got me working overtime thinking of ways for them to suck less. i'm not going to propose anything drastic here, just a change that should make a lot of things less annoying, without negatively impacting ccp's ability to do the real overhaul further down the line. basically, instead of each lab, hangar, and array being separate, merge them in together. the pos has one single corporate hangar, and the ""capacity"" stat would become a boost to the capacity of the pos hangar rather than a separate hangar of its own. all lines are together as well - a pos with 12 advanced mobile laboratories wouldn't have 12x3 copying lines, it'd be a single installation with 36 copying lines(and 24 me, and 24 invent, and 250,000m3 of hangar space). you'd probably add in the ability to name individual lines, so that corps who want to keep lines reserved for whatever can do so. ideally, you'd also be able to open the hangar remotely and see what's inside, like you can with corp offices, though i understand that ccp may be reluctant to inflict that upon their database. there'd be a couple other effects, but i don't think any of them are really serious, either for or against. basically, this would streamline pos operation nicely, it's not going to ruin any future plans ccp may have, and i'm pretty sure there's enough of a chance that it's workable that it is at least worth asking for."
5/19/2009,good idea.in the same time it's possible to have the right also with the alliance on the office to share some items. that will be great ...
5/19/2009,"i think combining the storage into a single logical unit would be nice from the user's standpoint, i can see problems when it comes to those hangers being shot and such. i'd prefer items stay in their respective places, but instead, allow labs/factories to pull from/to corp hangers. the only change required to do this would be to allow naming of hangers (should have been implemented anyways) and show those names as options in the s&i interface."
5/19/2009,"why?just train the scientific networking skill up a bit. suddenly, you're at a remote station holding all the blueprints you need and can just slot one in the lab as you desire. the problem has been taken care of already using in-game mechanics.not supported.edit: i do agree with joining the slots, just not the hangar on the pos itself. read what i write before you flame me please."
5/19/2009,"did you read what he wrote? or did you even tried to put research job remotely? or you are just randomly trolling csm candidates you dont like?i hate when i need to widdle tru 20 labs in system/pos to find free slot.supportededit: just to clarify things it pita even from station to search for slots, esp if u have more then few labs as u usualy have"
5/19/2009,"true. the other option is to make it a function of the corp hangar array, such that having one at the station is what merges everything, but that's an annoyance in its own right(different game mechanics depending on whether there's a corp hangar present or not? ugh). as always, ccp is going to work out the details before implementation anyways, so i figure i'll give them enough to work with and let them sort through the nagging details. if all you're doing is me/pe/copying, sure, it's easy. leave the bpos in an office, pick a free slot, use it. the problem comes when you have jobs that take materials. i have a corpmate who is planning on buying another half-dozen data interfaces as soon as he gets a bit of spare cash so that he can just leave one in every aml he invents at, instead of having to be at the pos in person every couple hours moving stuff around in order to do his invention. i've gotten to the point where i'm so frustrated having to move my materials around between different component arrays that i have an alt permanently parked in my pos, solely so that i can log him in to move things around for me. scientific networking helps, but not nearly enough. this is the other reason, yes - finding free slots becomes a lot easier when you have to look at one list of slots per pos, not as many as 15. also, always good to hear my pos proposal get support from someone who runs a thousand times as many of them as i do."
5/19/2009,"i don't see ccp rewriting the pos hangar system. it's going to take too much time for too little gain.a complete pos overhaul, and we can speak. but then again.."
5/19/2009,"i expect that this will only be done if it's simple enough to justify it. if it'd take as long as a full overhaul, i'd rather have the overhaul, of course. i propose this because i think that there's a good chance it could be done a lot faster than that - most of the code is already there, it's just pushing it into new molds. there's enough of a chance that it is doable, and it'd be useful enough if it was done, that i think it's worth asking for. if ccp says no, they say no, and i'll leave it be, but until then i'm going to take a shot at it."
5/19/2009,"small modification in this barge.now it's something difficult to tank the rats in 0.5 with this ship. this ship cost about 20 m isk. one way, it's to had one middle slot and increase a little the cpu and powergrid. cpu 200 --> 220powergrid 35 --> 50orincrease the shieldshield capacity 785 -> 1200"
5/19/2009,there's this really need ship... its called a hulk.
5/19/2009,the difference between the hulk and covetor it's about 4 days ( skill days).with a fregate you can tank the rats in 0.5 ( the fregate cost between 50k to 350 k).merlin cpu 175 powergrid 35 shield 460 about 350k (skill time 1 day)retriever cpu 125 powergrid 35 shield 391 about 5 m (skill time 3 week)covetor cpu 200 powergrid 35 shield 781 about 20 m (skill time 7 week)hulk cpu 300 powergrid 35 shield 1519 about 80 m (skill time 7 week + 4 days)you need about 2 month to use the covetor the price is about 20 m and it's difficult to tank some rats. i don't ask to make the second hulk. i just ask to balance a little the covetor versus hulk or retriever.
5/19/2009,"quit soloing? get better shield skills? (yes, there are skills that help) get a hulk? use combat drones?no need to change.--isaac"
5/19/2009,"nice isaac. your are mister ""no""if you have some argument that will be better"
5/19/2009,"your refusal to fit for the environment is not a good reason to change a ship. use combat drones if you really have problems. here's fit that is cap stable at 49% and will tank as well as any combat frigate and is t1 to boot:[covetor, tank]mark i generator refitting: capacitor power relaymark i generator refitting: capacitor power relaysmall c5-l emergency shield overload iice harvester iice harvester iice harvester i[empty rig slot][empty rig slot][empty rig slot]edit: if you're not going for ice it fits just as well with strip miners."
5/19/2009,"the difference for me between a covetor and a hulk was roughly 23 hours. where do you get this 4 days crap from?the difference was so short, i didn't even bother with the covetor at all, and went from a retreiver directly to a hulk.if they want to do anything with the covetor, they should lower the mb and astrogeology skill requirements by one level each.no support."

5/19/2009,"one solution fixes the plex capturing abuses:make destruction of all defending spawns a requirement for capture. stop timer at 75% until last navy vessel is dead.instantly solves cloak abuse, range (dragging navy away from timer) abuse, speed abuse. also forces people to either gang up or make themselves vulnerable by having a carebear fitting.everything else is, hopefully, being worked on. should be noted that fw was never meant to act as a source of revenue, but rather a pvp training ground. the whole system does need a look-see though.my opinion: income should be enough to cover expenses for the average player, no more. the new probing allows you to do exploration while waiting for timers, bookmark sites remotely for future completion, combine with ratting the bs now in lowsec. makes for a great side income."
5/19/2009,hi there.as the topic says raise this threat to make the following changes regarding this devblog:new dev blog: overview changes in apocrypha 1.2with this change exspecialy lowsec gets us a little in trouble. why? because of this:-5 person = outlaw = solid red backround-5 to -10 person = solid red backround dont forget this goes for standings from yourself aswell as for standing from your corp/alliance towards a hostile corp/alliance which surely will not only have -5 member.now who has the time to check up on this in lowsec? how much people will now fall for gategunfire because they dont want the possible outlaw to escape?meanwhile wartargets in empire = red flashy.i say why not just make outlaws and wartargets flashy? they are both shootable anywhere on sight it wont make much of a difference.
5/19/2009,"a timeline of selected events<-|---------------|----------------|----------------|-->dinosaurs.......jesus..............you..............nowalso, it's not hard to make your own overview settings. you're asking for trouble using the default settings.really, they did this for the benefit of new players. it's not a bad thing.no support."
5/19/2009,maybe where the you is you should write i.just as example. imagine you are a member of cva which have to maintain nrds in their 0.0 space. and with all that -5 to -10 standings from your alliance if you dont get it! you have now to fly through lowsec domain like they do too.now how do you think how much small cruiser / frigate pilots will die to gategun fire cause they now see redsolid backround as outlaw?it just makes it easier to see than a small colortag and people will use it. but for using it you are screwed not the way it should be.
5/19/2009,"perhaps i should have noted that the timeline was there to point out that this has already happened. both your post and thread title make it sound as if it has yet to happen.to refute your extremely situational example, again, apocrypha 1.2 only changes the default overview settings. it was done for the benefit of new players. you can still modify it to your own liking. and again, most if not all members of a serious (heh) space holding alliance like cva will have their own custom overview settings, which this patch does not mess with (save the bit that blues now show up as reds sometimes due to changed priorities on the display, but that's easily fixed )."
5/19/2009,oh really? would have never noticed it was in the new patch... oh wait several servercrashes cause of it.stil if you did read the threat you see i complained before about it.modifing it yourself stil dont changes the fact that it would be the easiest to have wartargets and outlaws both flashy which is what i suggest.to identify someone by a small colortag seconds after he decloaks for a gatejump for example is lesslikely than when you see the whole red bar turn red / flashy.as it is now people who have solid red backround for horrible standing selected just to see their enemys easy will now have a hard time once they change from 0.0 to lowsec. if you would clear me up what the exact problem would be in having wartargets aswell as outlaws flashy?
5/19/2009,"no, you're wrong. the change was brought in 1.2. that was days ago. 1.2.2, which was pushed today, brought minor changes. today is when the server crashed.you linked the dev blog where they make the announcement. the reasoning is there, and it's sound.and again, if you refuse to change your overview settings to your own liking so that you always know what you're dealing with, that is not my nor anyone else's problem."
5/19/2009,complaining for a possible change at todays patch maybe vov?stil waiting for you answer on why its bad to have wartargets aswell as outlaws flashy which is the only suggestion i am making in this thread just in case you missed it.
5/19/2009,"today's patch:-modules will no longer be subject to an activation delay when a ship has de-cloaked after jumping through a stargate.-storyline missions have been fixed and will now be offered correctly. any storyline missions that you have already qualified for will now be offered.-station environments will no longer move with you when you use the clone jump service.-fixed an issue that would cause the ships and items panels to not display correctly when the load station environment option was unchecked.-numerous server side issues have been fixed.so no, you're not complaining about a change from today's patch. hence my ""god, you're late"" reaction.from my post above: ""you linked the dev blog where they make the announcement. the reasoning is there, and it's sound."""
5/19/2009,"it seems logical that the desruction of structures would leave something of value behind in one form or another. of course the chance of finding high quality loot should be low, but the chance for something should be possible when structures go ka-boom!"
5/19/2009,"i think its a balance issue.. some missions drop a lot of loot from wrecks. without nerfing wreck drops, having all structures have a chance to drop loot might flood the market in mins, as most drops get reprocessed. i know its frustrating to pop a structure and get nothing, but i dont think giving all of them a chance to drop is the answer, that said i would like more structures to have drops, just not all of them as walls, junctions, etc are considered structures too.so.. partially supported"
5/19/2009,i totally agree even more so when you spend stupid amounts of ammo in expectance of loot dropping from the structure
5/19/2009,there should always be a nice tasty loot for the stations and structures take an insane amount of ammo to blow up.i'm tired of not seeing any loot when they blow up. :/
5/19/2009,"i like it, although it certainly would need to be carefully balanced.here's a different idea in the same vein: regardless of drops, have destroyed structures leave wrecks, which can be salvaged."
5/19/2009,that.... is ingenious... provided you get an a bit more salvage than you would expect....
5/19/2009,when is ccp gona do anything about them
5/19/2009,good idea!
5/19/2009,"this would only really effect t1 ships, seeing as t2 ships return crap for insurance ( i got 7 mil for my 100+ mil zealot i blew up a couple days ago). that being said, i would believe that the best course of action would be to disable insurance on ships flown by someone with a bounty. because really, how are criminals getting insurance anyway?"
5/19/2009,if you are going to stop payment on insurance then all that is going to due is make pvp more expensive and even less people will participate in it than already do.
5/19/2009,"do you really think pirates are going to stop pirating because they dont receive insurance? not to mention pirates might end up with even more money because succesful pirates would be able to collect bounties on rival pirates. this would easily offset not being able to insure their ships.not to mention generally the ""expensive"" ships lost by pirates are t2 ships anyway, or at the most bc sized ships which hardly qualify as expensive."
5/19/2009,"while yes for the few good pirates out this might be true, but for the majority of pirates this would not be the case.not to mention getting rid of insurance payouts for selected groups of people is not something i think the devs are going to go for.your idea isn't bad i just think there are too many exploits at the moment with it that would require too many changes to other aspects of the game that just arn't really realistic.simplify it some and maybe it will work"
5/19/2009,"well this is eve, not everyone gets to be top dog and this bounty system would reflect that. while this bounty system might lower pvp by making it expensive to pirate it may also boost pvp by making antipirating profitable enough to engage in. so where you lose pvp on one end you may gain it on another."
5/19/2009,"when you're in a system with 100s of people, it's hard to find the wartargets or lower standings folks among all the other capsuleers.could we add a sort feature to the local member list? specifically, the ability to put wartargets at the top of the list."
5/19/2009,"how do you feel about limiting the price increment on market orders, such as limiting all buy and sell orders to 3 or 4 significant digits? this would force traders to offer a significantly better price instead of just beating the old price by 0.01 isk."
5/19/2009,"it would be a fairly stupid restriction considering most minerals fall below that number threshold. it's the same reason there isn't a % based limitation. any limit you place on market prices will break at least a portion of the market, and the rest can be gamed."

5/19/2009,an increased chance of inventing a bpo would be better then buiing them on the market.e.g.: i'm inventing tech 2 ammo and when i have invented 10x a tech 2 bpc i get a x% chance of inventing a bpo

5/19/2009,indeed fix it first then think about new ideas and features for example the sec status nerf in a way i can understand it but i belive its tto severe. piracy has awalys been a part of eve another thing empire ganks imo if its a high sec system then dissalow combat period. guns should have safties should they not why not making weapons hot and act of aggression in a high sec system.im a pirate i stay in low sec idiot in highsec breaking the ruleas and exploiting the delay before death by concord to kill some one for profit is affecting pirates who play by the rules and stay in the outlaw spacea few bad apples are ruining the entire basket

5/19/2009,"some very good ideas, but overall just a pompous jerk. too bad, pirating really could use some overhauling . . ."
5/19/2009,bump
5/19/2009,"im not very good with english so i'll keep this short. there might be some mention by some candidates, to make our life easier pls post ur view on the large projectiles here so we dont have to run through all those long speeches. tq"
5/19/2009,"large projectiles have the worst dps at long range, still pretty bad dps at short range, worst tracking, and the minmatar ships are the only race's battleships that cant participate in a fully long ranged sniper fleet. after the hp increase projectiles couldnt be used to ohko small ships and there was never really any compensation for the loss of their specialized use since then.so i want to bring that to ccp's attention while i'm in the csm."
5/19/2009,"artillery in general needs an improvement in form of damage increase. poor rof, poor tracking and high alpha is what makes artillery stand out; so a large damage increase is justified.as for large autocannons, they need a tiny tweak, but no power-buff."
5/19/2009,can't really add anything beyond what admiral iceblock has said. arty needs work. ac are pretty close to fine.
5/19/2009,"ideally they should be tweaked a little to make them in line similar to hybrids, since they work around the same principle, but definetly don't make them identicle. projectiles should still be kept in their own little niche, making them usefull in their own way.it would be great to see them get a bit of a range boost for sniping"
5/19/2009,disturbingly i agree with iceblock on this one.
5/19/2009,"ruri, what do you know of pvp. your idea of pvp is can flipping miners, jumping rookie ships in high sec belts and trying to extort money from corps under threat of a war deck. and you usually get your butt kicked if the the ""miners"" have a bit of fight in them. your a joke."
5/19/2009,"i would love to be able to vote for a pvp council member to help balance it out.but i feel that you would not be the best choice. from knowing you in game, it is obvious that real pvp is not your interest, but only less penalties for war dec`ing and griefing industrial or noobie corps. when someone is more interested in pvp`ers against pvp`ers, they will have my vote."

5/20/2009,"supported.repping alts have a easy life. time to shake it up alittle buy giving them agrrestion timers,don't forget that rr ships don't need guns if your just repping so you can have a huge tank to wait out the agression timer. i don't see the problem with them getting agression timers. adding and abetting the enemy!editing: for pb's reincarnation of this post 05/05/10i now have a alt that can rr silly amounts of armor/sheilds only because everyone else does it and its near impossible to fight wt's/canflippers now without it.i still agree with no out of corp remote reppers and would be glad to move my alt into privs if thats whats needed. tbh tho get a pair of b**ls and actauly fight 1v1 or gtfo of the game and go play somin else i do not use my rr unless they bring out there own. i took a hyperion down to 5% hull in a cane whilest my alt watched as he did not use rr/neutrals only his local rep mods this was a fair fight and a bloody good one! coudos to that pilot for actualy having the b**ls to fight me fairly."

5/20/2009,"even if slightly off-topic, i have to quote this. it's high time ccp renames the mining barge skill to something less confusing.if nothing else, it would at least reduce the repetition of the ""the skills are weird"" argument. (which, currently, is true, because the skills are weird.)"
5/20/2009,not supported.ffs you got the orca or you have a itty5or heaven forbid an occator
5/20/2009,"ok lets reiterate a little bit because this seems to confuse some people.the original post was to have a ship that is larger than an indy but smaller than a freighter for a middle ground. ccp responded by stating that the orca fits that need.the point i am saying is yes the orca as is does fill that niche but it also has several other abilities. what i am asking for and or suggesting is a ship that does not have the extra's and only fills the middle shipping ground.the orca has several other secondary and tertiary requirements that are not related to shipping.let me repeat this is about shipping, not mining, not hauling fitted ships (even though that is another area that is a bit lacking). it is like saying that cars have to be shipped to the dealer in parts because transporting an assembled vehicle is too hard.the transport ships do not fit this spot either, they have the same or less cargo space than indys but have other fun stuff related to low sec transportation.jump freighters do not fill the role either because they are the t2 of normal freighters.there should be a logical steady progression of shipping/cargo space which at present there is not. it is either 10-15k cargo or less and then the 500k+there should be a middle ground in the 50k-250k range.the middle ground should not require much else outside piloting and indys as indys should definitely be the the pre-requisite skill tree.actually all of the extra piloting skills for each race is a bit insane. the base type of ship should be the skill progression and then racial specializations should be applied later."
5/20/2009,"i support.sure, i fly a freighter, but a mini-freighter would have a lot of use.i agree that this mini-freighter should not have a ship maintenence bay.i also don't believe it should have a corp hangar.or any fit.the orca is not a mini-freighter. i'm so sick of it being called that. it has a ship maintenence bay that only holds a few ships, it has a corp hangar that is fairly-sized but more of a capital-ship thing than a freighting-thing. it also has a fit. and it's cargo isn't very large at all, if you ignore the hangar and bay.we don't want a command ship that can haul as its secondary use.we want a small freighter.orca != small freighterorca = sub-capital industrial command shipfreighter (800m isk) = hauling/freighting skillsorca (450m isk) = mining/leadership skillssmall freighter (100-300m isk) = hauling/freighting skills---as for the hauling of rigged ships...i think it's about time for us to have a ship freighter with nothing but a ship maintenance bay..."
5/20/2009,"approx this supported! except the one-shot dread pop...since a couple of dreads can pop a titan quite swiftly, the titan should be able to send some of them to hell before falling, even if the dreads are sieged.dd should be much less deadly (when used as area effect - see later), should be reusable much more frequently, and possibly should give some nice, but not at all deadly bonus (like an ecm burst), which grants tactical advantage to friendly fleet, but doesn't completely ruin the day of the opposition. dd should be scriptable, and thus focused on a single target resulting it to instapop, except if it's a supercapital one (where it would just give some conventional, but huge damage). since most of the titans' bonuses are for gang assisting, they should really participate fleet battles, pretty unlike they do now, but due to this, there shouldn't be any new type of new anti-cap guns introduced, as the high-slots should be reserved for gang assist modules.- the conventional gun bonus of the titans should be removed for eg. dd reuse time -%/lvl.- area dd should kill off only drones/fighters, and frigs (possibly nano-fit t1 cruisers also), and give some tactically useful bonus like an ecm burst.- dd should be scriptable to focus its strength to instapop anything that is non-supercap. (1 target only)- dd should be reusable like 5 minutes. half of this time the titan cannot warp. both these times can be reduced /titan level. - boost in clone vat bay and ship maintenance hanger, so they can field much a bigger fleet. (this also goes for mommies)the upper changes (and prolly some more smaller ones) would give the titan a key role in fleet battles, not just this ""came, flash, gone"" strategy.anyway. revision is highly supported from my side."
5/20/2009,doomsday should be a direct fire weapon that does enough damage to easily one volly a dread and should have a bonous against fixed objects (towers and stations).motherships need a hp and most importantly a jump range boost (should be further than carriers tbh). hp boost should be in ratio to the components it takes to build them. ms should get a bigger boost to remote repping than carriers. also the clone vat bay should be inherent not a mod. ms and titans need a big bonous overheating so that they can effectivly overheat for tens of minutes without burining out any mods. and both or at least ms need to be dockable.
5/20/2009,i've been wanting this since the skill queue came out.make it happen ccp.
5/20/2009,"hmm, i'm a little bit worried about it being abused to move high value skillbooks without risk. just start training a short unrelated skill followed by the pre-req skill (which has been trained long enough to fit into to 24h timer despite the first unrelated skill) and then inject amarr titan or whatever. then start moving to wherever you want that skillbook to be, and when you get there, cancel the pre req skill and recieve 1 super expensive skillbook that could be moved anywhere without risk, and then resold. not sure how to fix that, but i'm confident a soloution can be found, so i'll support this anyway.edit: maybe have the queue enable you to add a skill that you do not yet have injected to your queue, and when it's time to train it, it looks for the skillbook in your cargohold, aswell as in your hangar if you're docked? would allow you to queue it, while still having to drag the skillbook with you just like it is now."
5/20/2009,um if you use the modification i suggested by allow injection of any skill at any time and just make the training trigger a pre-req check means that the skill book would never be respawned which already fixes the exploit you are worried about.
5/20/2009,simple... treat it like a rig... once injected... no going back... if you don't pass pre-reqs... skill book is destroyed.
5/20/2009,yes.
5/20/2009,simple yet perfect idea. fully supported!
5/20/2009,"i remember doing an l4 called recon (3 of 3) where you warp into a celestial toxic cloud...awesome skybox.and a couple other missions with the same one with different colours.why aren't there more missions with sweet skyboxes? make space look /different/ more often, maybe?i loved that mission a whole lot, and was let down instantly when i didn't get to fight anything in it.why not a sweet l4 that takes you to a nebula?other examples would be sweet here, have fun guys!"
5/20/2009,the new changes are pretty nice imo. the only qualm i have with the change is the removal of the cloaked velocity bonus. it makes it really hard now to catch a target/get into position to launch your torps / bomb(i have no experience with em so no idea how hard it is). not to mention rage torps+damage bonus + recons 5 = epic alpha.
5/20/2009,"that's not entirely true, you could 1 shot important t2 frigates and other un cloaked stealth bombers. anyways, looks like i'm the only one complaining 'bout this whole issue here. oh well, i guess i'll just have to adjust to the new system."

5/20/2009,"in few weeks its the mid of the year already, yet there are no announcements in the game development forum. guess early 2009 means late 2009 or early 2010. and i have a pg issue even without fitting hams or mwd, t2 hm launcher and 2-3 extenders make the link impossible to fit."
5/20/2009,its a caldari missile boat! its supposed to suck for pvp!
5/20/2009,are you seriously expecting ccp to keep to an announced timeline?
5/20/2009,"hello psi,i'm the one that brought the concept up to the csm in the second term. if i'm not mistaken, somebody also did so in the first term.while i still want this to happen, realize that mining is going to have to be improved before something like this is even likely to happen. ccp is currently looking at how to improve mining, but it's a careful change that's needed (like scanning was, or sovereignty will soon be).as per your replacing t1 with meta t1, that would flood the market with named modules, making them extremely plentiful and cheap. this is something that we call 'bad for the game'. other ideas have been posed which hold merit, but the change needs to be gradual (such as reducing drop rates by 10, 20, 30%, etc for meta 0 items).tl;dr: it's being worked on, but mining needs fixed first."
5/20/2009,"i -- a l4 mission runner, mass loot reprocessor and salvager -- support this. though i think a better solution would be to make named modules non-reprocessable (like salvage now is) and only remove standard t1 module drops. drones and ammo typically give very little by way of minerals (edit: except cap booster charges, but they take so much cargo space i don't think many bother to pick them up in the first place)."
5/20/2009,"issues like this have a significant impact on the game economy, and therefore need very careful and progressive balancing. to simply cut 40% of the mineral supply from the game would be crippling.as the csm has indicated, changes to mining to make it more interesting/higher yield (not more profitable per unit) are what is required. as mineral supply from any mining changes the loot tables could be adjusted. not before.not supported"
5/20/2009,"right... now you need to realize that ""reprocessed goods"" does not mean t1 modules, and most certainly not mean ""mission loot"".before the drone regions where introduced this number was much lower. besides, if you're gonna remove all those minerals, where are we gonna get replacements from? in effect, you'll be boosting macro mining.until you come up with a plan for replacing all the minerals: not supported!"
5/20/2009,"i don't see the problem. there are alot more people running missions then there are mining, and despite that, the miners manage to produce more minerals. also, with the only reward from f.e. drones being alloys that must be converted to minerals to be worth anything, so there are many missions being run that rely completely on getting those minerals, aswell as ratters doing the same in drone regions. no support from me."
5/20/2009,"ehh? the idea is that they do not drop t1, just named t1 meta1-4 with variable order and chance... i know that their mineral quantities vary, but hey 0.0 and lowsec are filled with minerals, not to mention w-space and there is assload of ore wich isn't being mined at all."
5/20/2009,do you know how much the mineral flow from drone loot and t1 module loot is all together? is it over 50 percent of overall mineral supply?

5/20/2009,not just mining but all of the production and blue print availability as well. course it could just be that a few people that already have all the blue prints just want to **** the market and screw over new players more.no i think the equipment drops are fine just as they are.
5/20/2009,"honestly, sure, it'd destroy the economy for a little bit, but it'd fix itself in good time.the only real issue here i see is all the butthurt for mission-manufacturers and mission-oresellers.imho, nerfing the hell out of meta 0 drops isn't enough.maybe cut all reprocessing of equipment in half.then you could keep meta 0 loot (possibly, but i still think it should go)as for drone ore, maybe that has a bonus to reprocess where it gets reprocessed normally..sure, there are people that farm drones like crazy, but it's still a much smaller percentage than the mission mineral farmers :|maybe they could implement all this into the next expansion and call it ""the universal depression"" so the answer to the butthurt is ""it's just troubled times, sir, either stop whining or kill yourself.""eve is a really strong game, and as we saw with the shuttles, it can take a good hit to the nuts fairly well. i give eve a month to start leveling out its economy after meta 0 loot is removed and/or reprocess is cut in half..."
5/20/2009,"while i support the suggestion that scale should be more realistic, i also realize that a size increase by implication will need to be a complete re-engineering of most of the star systems, and pos systems etc.so in stead i propose ""make everything else smaller"" my comment above refers to the fact is you resized carriers up to titians you still need to be able to fit a fleet inside a pos. larger ships would mean large pos shields.as for station size increase (which considering volume of some of the stations needs be upsized considerably) there are several situations where the stations are co close to their celestrial that you would be expecting them to be burning up in the upper atmosphere."

5/20/2009,need rescaling
5/20/2009,"patch 1.2 and subsequent problems have caused me to take a look at communications, or lack of, between ccp and the player base. i was going to wait a while longer and consider a proposal, but reading this from ccp in the general forum kind prompted me to raise this now...from issue thread in general forum""the problem with your repro is that it only confirms that there is an issue. which was already apparent by the petitions and bug reports sent to us as well as some of the posts in this thread. my first post in this thread was not implying that there was not an issue, just that we had not found out what exact order of events caused the issue.i will no longer be following this thread after this post.""i found this to be the only response from ccp regarding the frozen client after jumping bug. nothing in game development, known issues, patch 1.2.2 feedback. two days of a widely reported and common bug receiving what seems to be a dis-interested, half hearted, unhelpful and actually pretty rude response from a ccp employee.the background to this i think we all know. ccp rushed through a ""fix"" to a bug allowing an imbalance relating to one ship type, the ""fix"" was applied despite considerable feedback from players regarding serious and widespread consequences, which in ccp's own words were game breaking. the subsequent ""fix"" seems to have introduced this new gate freeze issue.ccp has numerous ways to communicate with and develop the game in cooperation with the player base, forums, petitions, bug reports and csm. so why did this happen?forums.the forums relating to development, ideas, bugs are split over several categories including development, known issues, features and ideas, assembly hall, information portal and general discussion. there does not seem to be a structured use of these various forums by ccp. sometimes ccp respond to a game issue in a thread raised in one section, sometimes on a thread relating to the same issue in a thread in another section. this may be due to a lack of moderation, and disciplined use and monitoring of the forums by ccp. it is also clear that dev's do not read these forums or the issues would have been known in advance.proposalreduce and rationalise these forums and moderate them more effectively. split them into the following.assembly hallplayers proposals for features and ideas as well as other issues can be raised here for the attention of the csm.game development forumproposals escalated from the assembly hall and ccp's own development blogs can be posted here for player feedback.sisi test feedback forumonce an idea progresses past the game dev forum onto sisi the notes are pasted here in a new thread and feddback from the player base invited based on sisi testing.tranquility bug forumincorporates known issues and workarounds and serves as a bug reporting tool for players who perhaps do not understand how to bug report. issues on tq can be raised here.information portalnotification of patching, patch notes, server failure notices and links to threads in tq bug forum can be posted here and locked to keep the forum clean.each of these forums should be actively moderated, threads moved to appropriate other sections and locked with a link if duplicates. ccp should monitor these forums daily to gain a good understanding and forwarning of potential issues either prior to or after patch deployment. ccp should also respect the player bases good intentions and effective co-devlopment of this game by responding in a timely and effective manner to issues raised.to be fair ccp does have better tools for player interaction than most mmo's i have played, it simply needs to use them better.tl;dr - ccp needs to listen up and communicate more."
5/20/2009,supported ofc.
5/20/2009,"lol whut? that whole general forum thread is the reason the ccp employee said ""i won't follow this thread anymore"".you all were bastards in there. threatening, asking for someone to get fired, whining. good lord. get over yourselves. ccp is not god. they'll fix the issue as soon as they can. unless any of you are employed by ccp or any similar company, you have no reason to harass them. /me ends rantas per your ideas. i will agree that the forums could use some of your edits. however, the question becomes, can ccp honestly monitor them enough? i don't know. i also don't see the need to have the csm raise this issue with ccp. its not an in-game issue. also, i have doubts it will increase the speed of ""fixes"" in-game. ccp has to cut through a lot of crap that is spewed on the forum to find the problem (i.e. the general-forum thread) so until we get rid of all the trolls and complainers (which will never happen...) we'll have to live with the fact that changes happen slowly. you all bring this upon yourselves. --isaac"
5/20/2009,yup
5/20/2009,"the backstory can be (over)writen anytime, and they would be useful for killing up macrominers with some proper coding... :dand yes, they would make a nice twist to hisec life. :)"
5/20/2009,"if they were to invade i would rather see a massive army of npcs clean out low sec space and give it a ""soft/hard"" reset."
5/20/2009,"sez you....for all they know they might be ""sleeping"".no seriously."
5/20/2009,"lol @ -^and i like the idea, a lot.maybe not make them travel to the wh(this would be very anti-need-for-speed), but maybe have sleepers that spawn near some wh's, on 'our' side of space... chances and spawn sizes possibly determined by category of the wh?"
5/20/2009,"i don't see how this will benefit anything.if you're pve'ing, the last thing you want is an unexpected something that will kill you dropping on you randomly with no warning.if people want to kill sleepers they do it through wormholes. they won't switch to waiting on scarce random spawns which have more competition and are less profitable."
5/20/2009,"not all sleepers will drop on you and kill you :|and i do agree that they shouldn't move from the wh itself, like, maybe they could spawn in the belts of the system randomly (super rare) and belt spawns be scaled based on security status, but i really just feel that they should spawn at the wh itself, scaled to the category of the w that it leads to."
5/20/2009,"as the op describes, yes, it would take a bit of coding, however, i think changing the s&i system to allow pulling from other hangers in the pos would not really imbalance anything, and probably not be that difficult either."
5/20/2009,"given my last year on the csm, i has gotten an insight into how ccp perceives the mess that is the pos system.and just the thought of ccp having to touch the pos code, makes me shiver. in which case, i can't imagine what the poor developers might be thinking."
5/20/2009,"like the heavy interdictor, what about two new ships/module role/type (or a t3 subsystem or heavy dictor deviation or capital)?let me suppose they would be ships.the first would be the cloaking ship. she emits a field that cloak every fleet mate (max number/level or the like) in range but without damper their sensor nor their speed or targeting/weapon capabilities. if not a field it could be some device that cloak a target in range, maybe leaving trails indicating the number of ships cloaked. cloaked mates have no need to decloak to fire enemies. however, the cloaking ship will move slow, no turret or launcher hardpoints, but like heavy interdictor, she must have some mean to survive being primary like high resistance. cloak device duration would be high enough to avoid spamming (5-10 mins), but cloak device would cloak immediately and it would be strong enough to drop every lock-on-target and resist proximity decloaking. if she would be a capital ship, she would need some fuel to activate the cloaks. please note that smartbombs and interdictor bubbles (and dd) ignore cloaking.the second ship would be a focus fire attractor. like heavy dictors, she can warp enemy sensors or bend the space itself or whatever, to attract enemy fire of some sort (maybe one type of damage or weapon or ammo) and suffer that damage herself (maybe converting a little part of it). fleet mates in range would be realatively safe (for a while) but will undergo some heavy dampening on their sensors because of the warping nature (like targeting range). that ship should be slow and clumbsy, without weapon hardpoints and with some mean to survive being primary. the effect she emit could be some single damagetype(em/kin/therm/exp)/ammotype(miss/hybrid/proj/laser)/whatevertype(ammo dimension?) heavy resistance bonus to targeted fleet mates in the field.a deviation on the theme would be a ship or a device that lock on target and force that enemy to not lock anything else, effectively disabling that enemy ship.the two ships cannot be cloaked by any means nor they can benefit from the focus fire attractor bonus (but would suffer the heavy dampening) because of the device warping nature.no effect will stack."
5/20/2009,"my name is izo alabaster, and highsec warfare is what i do.one of the main things that drew me to eve was the fact that in eve, often times the pvp is not consensual. that means that sometimes, someone might attack you without you wanting to be attacked. highsec warfare is the very embodiment of this aspect of eve; a group who wishes to conduct warfare attacks a group who doesn't wish to be attacked. this is one of the great things about eve that makes it a unique game.in eve, there are consequences for acting stupid. if you make yourself an attractive target to a more powerful organization, you will likely be milked of some of your isk. there's nothing wrong with that.don't like it? learn to defend yourself. hire mercenaries. negotiate a surrender fee. there are plenty of ways to avoid highsec piracy and being the recipient of a highsec wardec. it's just that most people don't care to learn those methods and practice them, and so they should be rightly removed of some of their isk.most of those who want to defang the current highsec warfare system don't appreciate just how difficult it is to conduct highsec warfare. it's not a matter of just sitting on a gate and wtfbbqing everything that comes through the gate (which is easy). instead, you have to hunt for targets, sometimes for hours, before you get a single kill. it's often times very time consuming, tedious work. it requires a great degree of skill and patience in order to be successful at highsec warfare.please don't allow this game to be turned into space-wow, where both parties have to type /duel before they fight each other, and neither party stands to actually lose anything from the fight. keep it the harsh place it needs to be."
5/20/2009,i'm sure that killing mining barges and industrials is truly an amazingly difficult feat that can be accomplished only by players of such advanced training and skills that the victims should be delighted to grovel at the griefers' feet and consider licking their boots a privilege.
5/20/2009,"tl;dr: are wardecs broken? yes. should they be eliminated: no.long version:as a self-proclaimed mission running, item making, asteroid killing goddess of doom (tm) (aka a carebear - really, ya'll say that like it's a bad thing), i still understand that i can, at any time, be attacked...wait for it...even without a wardec. suicide ganking anyone? wars can be declared and fought for a wide variety of reasons, including resources, rebellions, honor, and plain old fashioned, ""i just hate you and i want you to die (in-game in this case)"". our corporation has been war-decced in the past, and i am sure it will be again in the future.we even discussed wardeccing another corp. why? because we wanted the asteroids they keep mining out from under us. basically, we just wanted them to go away - or at least cut back their operations in that system. we ultimately decided not to pursue the wardec because the potential costs outweighed the benefits.wardecs are indeed a tool of greifers. but that doesn't mean they don't have legitamate uses."
5/20/2009,agreed... our alliance's current last 2 war-decs have been nothing short of a total pain in the side.even they admit its to ultimately grief.and when you do put up a fight... they go hide and run and laugh all the way...and smack to top it off.thats just utterly wrong.and the majority of the corps just don't have the isk to hire a merc because they are too busy trying to make up for losses already incurred.which adds to the alt plague.... how the hell else do you expect anyone to get anything done?: o p
5/20/2009,"if people with no skill formed a corporation in real life, they would be demolished by their competition. its no different in eve.if you want to compete, be in a diversified corp or face getting shut down, no corp full of noobs only should ever feel like they have a right to exist."
5/20/2009,"people who have no skill who form corporations in real life tend to succeed because they have the right to exist and give it a good shot... people in real life don't declare war and shoot people in the heads or mow down there resources.comparing real life to eve online makes one look like a jackass.eve is not 100% pvp.... nor is it 100% ""carebear/hello kitty""... get it through your thick skulls people."
5/20/2009,"wow, you are a moron. no kidding it's not exactly the same, rl and eve have different mechanics. we aren't flying spaceships irl.the outcome is the same however, an inexperienced corp full of inexperienced people won't fare well irl nor should it in eve.if you hire the right people and diversify then you'll fare better irl and in eve."
5/20/2009,once again your comparing eve to real life... stop being a hypocritical contradiction of terms and come back down to earth eh?
5/20/2009,my point is made and it's valid. your choice to live in denial is your own.
5/20/2009,"your point is hypocritical and refuses to accept the fact that its not as cut and dry as you think it is.so get your pvp centric thumb out of your ass and join the discussion constructively or kindly take a hike.a balance must be struck... telling everyone to adapt or die in this context is like saying you don't give a rats ass about whatever anyone else thinks and you want to force the issue.dig a little deeper than what you see on the surface and you just might find out why i refuse to take either side in this little debate.i do not favor the war-dec system as it is in its current state... nor do i favor nerfing it either.it is too easy to start a war-dec let alone pay for one.it's way to easy to abuse it and use it as a pay to grief tool.there is potentially no end to a war-dec for so long as you have any amount of isk to be spent.no one really makes any money in a war-dec which is why a large number of industrialist and carebears don't particllary like it.it has nothing to do with skillthis is the classic case of playground bully versus the little guys.... or whomever the bully would want to kick around.breaking apart upstart corps forces them to npc alts.... and alts upon alts upon alts.station games...abuse of neutral remote repping, abuse of undock redock....abuse of stargate hopping.war-decs favor those who wish to win and will not accept losses or any particular lack of kill mails.war-decs only end when you get bored or run out of money....that said... lets see you come up with a solution as opposed to telling people to adapt or die mr. holier than thou."
5/20/2009,"nothing is wrong with the wardec system. you play a game with non consensual pvp. if you would have read a little about the game before you joined, you would have realized that and wouldn't be complaining here. everyone was once a noob, i didn't complain about wardecs then and i don't complain now.once again, if you fly in an unorganized corp full of newbs with no experience, you choose to sleep in the bed you made.when i started eve more than 3 years ago, i was a member of a failing noob alliance who got destroyed by triumvirate. they caused the destruction of the alliance and it was beautiful. it made me fully appreciate the benefit of being organized and inspired me to be better at this game.you say ""wardecs end when you get bored or run out of money"". that is a very narrow and false viewpoint. if you have any form of diplomat, usually surrender terms are quite negotiable. this is left up to the player and not some hand holding set of initiatives set up by ccp. it's perfect, one of the last perfect things remaining about eve.the only problem i have is with whiners who ruin perfectly fine game mechanics. if you change this game mechanic, you are further emptying the sand out of this sandbox game."
5/20/2009,"no support, though i support the idea of a wardec revision.the ""victory conditions"" idea is neat, and would be awesome to have anyway, but would solve no problems.your proposal still puts the aggressed at the mercy of the aggressor, wars could still be dragged on indefinitely.crumple, toss, and try again."
5/20/2009,"wardec to fight fine, wardec to grief, bleh, hire mercs and give them (the mercs) a reason to exist."
5/20/2009,"*bamp*been away for a little bit, heh', didn't realize this got buried."
5/20/2009,"fantastic! something like quasi-nullsec-pvp. a corporation or even an alliance of carebear that can ""hold"" the low-sec empire sovereighty in place of the empire itself! the goodfella would be privateers, and the smugglers the others. :)to enforce security, privateers need to take clean the space from smugglers (maybe even from real alliance) and vice-versa. who hold the system, won the taxes and won the ""concord"" patrol npc. server-side will simulate the logistics."
5/20/2009,"not concord. police. not a broken, untankable and beatable force. just plain old faction police. ships we can fight."
5/20/2009,"if there was maybe a toggle button, add armour/shield calls to watch list, so that logistics pilots could have the latest callers pop up in the list? that wouldnt affect the watch list for other functions."
5/20/2009,"after the few quickpatches and major gliches with ubercloacking ships, bugging stargates and jump systems, lagging database etc i think it's even clearer that this is needed. seems that the codebase has broke magical spagetti code limit where new bugs are created after every bug fix :( - mr garo"
5/20/2009,"new content is a ""nice to have"", granted. but fixes first! i don't need to play a game with lots of flawed content ..."
5/20/2009,this game really needs less half-broken new content and some serious bug hunting.
5/20/2009,"best suggestion i've ever heard.would be hard work and some time for ccp, but it would be effort extremely well spent... i wonder how many new players try eve, see what a buggy mess it is, and just leave for wow or others that aren't so crippled."
5/20/2009,no support.. i don't consider myself qualified to dictate the correct development path for a successful mmo. i lack experience in the field. i'm suprised to see that we have so many mmo development and leadership experts on this forum. can you tell us what mmo's you lead the development of so we can be impressed with the knowledge and experience base from which these recommendations come?
5/20/2009,"they have already tried this with a subsequent patch to empyrean age (iirc). they got zero positive feedback after fixing over 100 of the most commonly-complained issues. i don't see this happening.what i would rather see is them dedicate the next few patches to fixing the aspects of the game that are broken or unusable. they already did this with scanning, and they plan to do this with 0.0 sovereignty. other aspects which could bear an overhaul, maybe at the rate of one per patch along with some new content, is: mining, manufacturing, wardec mechanics, player security status, etc.this list could go on, but i believe this would be the best way to approach it without destroying the other aspects of the game. any more than this would require a complete code rewrite, which while it may be very handy, would most likely require far too many man-hours to accomplish.sorry, not supported as you have outlined it."
5/20/2009,yup....
5/20/2009,those are not bugs those are unintended features. so let's have no more crazy talk about fixing things that were never meant to be fixed.
5/20/2009,forgot to support =)
5/20/2009,"corporation contracts & buy/sell orders should be controllable by any director/accountant/contract manager.it's just stupid that once a sell order it's set by someone from corp, that sell order cannot be modified by anyone except that person. if the contract/sell/buy order was set in the behalf of the corporation, ppl with right roles should be able to modify them."
5/20/2009,"you might want a couple roles, for security reasons, but yes, i'm all for this."
5/20/2009,agreed.
5/20/2009,"i'm not sure if this has posted already but i thought it wouldn't hurt mentioning it. i know that some of the bigger ships are suppose to have a crew onboard and that you as the captain controls this crew, well just imagine now that you have to buy this crew. yep, thats right buy the people, but have different types and/or groups that could give different bonuses and debuffs. say... crew a.crew a gives a bonus to weapons but being a specialized group of people they loss efficiency when it comes to operating the engine or shields.crew b.crew b is the opposite and gives bonus to shield tanking and makes you deal less damage.or another way this idea could work is... say you fly a battleship, it holds a crew of about 1200 people and that makes your ship opperate at 100% efficiency. you get into a fight, things go a bit bad but you come out alive, but that doesn't mean all your crew came out of it alive.could throw in some skills like ""crew disipline"" that say increase the effectiveness of the crew by 1% per level maybe, surely it isn't just the tech on your ship that makes it run.just a thought, and i'd like to see other people's thoughts on this idea. terig"
5/20/2009,belongs in featurse and ideas section and has been suggested a billion times over before
5/20/2009,"search the forums a bit, there is a very deep post that brought up this very thing.i still support it.the other post got into how you have different kinds of crews that do different things, and your crews could level up, but would be destroyed when your ship got destroyed, like rigs, but can be moved from ship to ship.again, i support it, but i suggest that you search harder next time."
5/20/2009,could put a link please?
5/20/2009,"simple proposal; add a 4,000,000m3 ship hangar (enough to shift 8 unpacked/rigged battleship-size hulls) to each race's freighter, with the restriction that the frieghter cannot scoop or launch any ships.this would allow for the niche for hauling rigged ships to be filled with minimum work."
5/20/2009,its called an orca.
5/20/2009,"self-support ftw.edit: what you're failing to realize is that the orca only has 400,000m3 of space for ships. that isn't enough for even one battleship. it would seem to be failing it's role if it was intended for that purpose. another edit: proof"
5/20/2009,no.it shouldn't be easy to move rigged/insured bses around. that's the whole point of rigs/insurance being lost upon repackaging.
5/20/2009,"lol not even carriers get that much m3 for their ship bay, why should a freighter get it? no support.--isaac"
5/20/2009,"hauling your rigged ships to the combat area is pain in the ass, thats for sure. but imho there are way better ways to fix this than just adding a ship bay to freighters."
5/20/2009,"this would be more simply addressed by removing the 120,000m^3 limit on contracts. rigged battleships could then be placed in courier packages, which can be moved in freighters."
5/20/2009,"well, if this was done, it would have to be a smaller bay, and would need to remove roughly 50k of normal cargo space for each 500k of ship maintenance bay it recieve. although, it's only a rumour, and i have no way to confirm if it's true or not, but i've been told that ccp mentioned during fanfest 2008 that a new ship class was being considered, the ferry, which would be able to enter high sec, have a jump drive, large cargo bay and a ship maintenence bay large enough to move battleships. it is a possibility, but at the same time, it feels a bit unlikely since it would make jump freighters obsolete."
5/20/2009,"don't forget that a carrier has to ""hold"" a 700gw powerplant, and 730tf supercomputing in almost the same vessel volume, not to mention it's huge dronebay, the extra corp hanger, and the slots for fittings.imo the freighters are whether (% based on obelisk, raw data):- too big (for nothing: 96% of their volume is for nothing really)- has too small cargo bay (for the same reason)while thanatos has pure cargo/dronebay (so empty space within the vessel) of over 8%, while they have to have those powerplants and supercomps and stuff within the vessel, which the freighters don't have (at all). edit: aye, and the jumpdrive, which deducts approx half a million cubic meters, when talking of freighters <-> jump freighters.i support the freighters to be rethought in some way, but i don't support ops idea."
5/20/2009,you really didn't bother to think this through didn't you?
5/20/2009,"nope. but unless there's a dedicated ship that can fill the role of moving combat-ready ships about enmass... suggestion stands.would 1,200,000m3 be better? (two battleships, smaller than a carrier.)"
5/20/2009,"this idea is rediculous, as the freighter serves it's dedicated role in the game. the orca is the high-security ship carrier, so why not make a small modification to this?my idea is to increase the ship maintenance bay by 20% (to 500k). this would allow it to fit one of a few battleships, and also other ships that might be needed to move. a vast improvement, but by no means game-breaking (like multiplying the bay by 10)."
5/20/2009,if your going to do that.... make an orca mk2 (tech 2 version) of the orca and require industrial command ship v for it.problem solved...details can be worked out later.the op's idea is so bloody asinine and stupid its not worth even trolling.
5/20/2009,why not just make a new kind of ship?ship freighter.moves ships. can't scoop. can probably only hold 2 battleships. has no cargo. etc...
5/20/2009,the problem is not to have or not the hulk. ( i use the hulk already).the covetor hasn't a good balance. skill time about the same than the hulk.tanking about the same than the retriever.for me this ship is completly unbalanced.two possibility :reduce the skill to use them (ex. astrogeology iv or mining barge iv) but not the both a vincrease a little the tanking.
5/20/2009,but much lower price and insurable.

5/20/2009,"black ops are not in anyway an upgrade to recons, they are two completely different ship lines. bos & recons are complimentary to one another the same way that recons and stealth bombers are now complimentary to each other (rapier + sbs = win). each performs an essential role that the other sorely lacks, thus the two work in tandem perfectly.the problem with continuously upgrading is the danger of obsoleting previous tiers of ships. there is no upgrade from recons because recons already do the job exceptionally well, there doesn't need to be an upgraded version of a force recon.here's the upgrade path for recons:1. t1 astrometrics frigate upgrades to the t2 covert ops frigate.2. t1 ewar frigate upgrades to the t2 electronic attack frigate3. t1 ewar cruiser + t2 covert ops frigate upgrades to the t2 force recon cruiser4. t1 ewar cruiser + t2 eaf upgrades to the t2 combat recon cruiserthis ship line was shoe horned in after the fact, technically it's not a part of the upgrade path but for consistency i'm including itthe upgrade paths for hacs, logistics, command ships, etc has already been listed. here's the the tackle/fleet tackle/supercap tackle upgrade path:1. t1 fast/tackle frigate upgrades to the t2 interceptor.2. t2 interceptor + the t1 destroyer upgrades to the t2 interdictor3. t2 interdictor + the t1 combat cruiser upgrades to the t2 heavy interdictoragain, not per the tech tree, but close enoughand bos:1. t1 ""missile/snipe/alpha"" frigate (heh) upgrades to the the t2 stealth bomber.2. t2 stealth bomber + t1 gank battleship upgrades to the t2 black ops battleship.also not per the tech tree, but as far as roles are concerned this is the upgrade pathblack ops are *not* ewar, they have nothing in common (as far as roles are concerned) with force recons. the widow is a raven hull, all of it's stats including it's slot layout is adapted from a raven hull, it's 2 caldari battleship skill bonuses are taken directly from the raven. the same is true for the panther (it is based off the tempest, not the typhoon).unfortunately all blackops were shoehorned into being the tier 1 bs, while all marauders were labeled as the tier 2 bs, which is the only reason why the widow had to take one of the useless bonuses from the scorpion which is what's lead to all this confusion over their roles. all black ops are based off of the t1 gank bs, all of them receive dual weapon bonuses from the t1 gank bs. their role is very straight forward, damage/gank."

5/20/2009,"this is what seriously is not a serious proposal. that's your biggest problem, m8? :)"

5/20/2009,"currently to run 5 invention jobs you need to have the datacores in the lab and then run 5 individual jobs. what i propose is that if you want to start 5 jobs you highlight 5 bpc's, and providing there are enough datacores and free slots in the lab all 5 jobs are started.have it limited to only 5 jobs at once or even 10 jobs at once(queued) per lab. this would be to stop people queuing up a full day of invention jobs."
5/20/2009,"i agree with the above (complexes need to be fought to capture, and give lp points for capturing them), and i also want to say faction militia should have faction-warfare specific items in their store.not better, but at least a few unique modules or ships."
5/20/2009,"i dunno what the best solution is, but fw (in general) needs a lot of fix-it-up for sure."
5/20/2009,"this is the most ridiculous thing i've ever seen, and believe me i've never seen it this bad before. if you would all draw your attention to this image:"
5/20/2009,"cuz they buy licences every month.... they dont do anyhthing because they, saddly, keep the plex flowing. money is the reason...as always...i hope somebody can prove me wrong"
5/20/2009,"that is an interesting image, and to me it definitely shows a macroer at work. ccp does care about macroing, as it depletes the economy and creates money from another source for relatively nothing. when i was in reykjavik, certain un-named sources told me that they have something in the works, and although it has taken quite some time, i do hope that this is true.as a 'carebear', this activity does pain me to see, as people are destroying eve's carefully-balanced economy for the sake of a few dollars of gain, and at the cost of many people tied to a computer screen for unknown hours a day. i, like you, want this to go away, and have even made suggestions to how it might be done, but i trust that ccp doesn't like this any more than i do, and they will do something about it.for now, i'll wait, but it does drive me crazy to see."
5/20/2009,"you really dont get that i was aming for an also blinky in todays patch well whatever...to your ""and it's sound"" i think its far from. just take this passage:|||the current defaults, where only outlaws are set to blink, is rather unintuitive - the blink seems to suggest that there's a great deal of urgency involved, but people who are just outlaws can't actually legally shoot you. by contrast, war targets are currently non-blink by default, despite the fact that they can shoot you at will.|||i bolted the funny part as outlaws will shoot you no matter if its legal or not ironicaly thats why they are called outlaws. also its ""urgent"" when you consider the flashy guys in highsec ""until now"" were mostly suicide ganker (aside from the average shuttle / interceptor traveler who appears some semi few seconds on your overview).what looks more dangerous, a simple red button or a flashy red one?also let us take into account the differenece between a wartarget and an outlaw:wartarget is shootable without begin attacked by gateguns.outlaw is shootable without being attacked by gateguns.wartarget can shoot us without being attacked by gateguns.outlaw will be attacked by gateguns *this is only in our favor when we dont attack first so it dont makes a huge difference except that it would be a positive thing for us if they started so its in our favor and who would mind that?*wartarget can jump to highsec after deagressing.outlaw can jump to highsec after deagressing *will either be killed by concord or the faction police will web him for warp out so its a 50% 50% thing, non the less it works again in our favor*"
5/20/2009,"when will you understand that this is for newbies? if billy mcnoobcorp see something flashy red on his overview, he's going to think that it poses a threat, or he's going to shoot at it.or both.i'm unsure how outlaw mechanics work in highsec. (yes, i realize they will get shot by faction police, but it's possible to tank those for a time.) do people that fire on an outlaw get marked as legal targets for said outlaw? if so, it seems that poor old billy is now in dire straits. if not, meh.the point is that ccp wanted to polish off an aspect of the game that could end up frustrating a lot of newbies. it is not their problem, or anyone else's, if you are too lazy to change your overview settings from the default. as such, this issue is hardly worthy of the assembly hall, where people raise issues that ccp and ccp alone can fix.edit: you said, ""i say why not just make outlaws and wartargets flashy? they are both shootable anywhere on sight it wont make much of a difference."" and i say, why not just get off your ass and change it yourself? if that's how you want it, fine, but don't go thinking that it should be that way for everyone else."
5/20/2009,wrong button grr 2.30am :p
5/20/2009,i never said that sleeper drones attacking fit in the heretofore established cannon. i just supported it. it would be hilarious. nice job using ad hominem attacks to try to prove me wrong...from a completely separate discussion.and the point still stands that this is no one else's problem.
5/20/2009,u mad?its stil a thing only ccp can change from what its now or you ganna tell me where the field is so i can turn on blinky for other tags than war/milita target?acctualy outlaw bold red vs bold red low standing is a problem a lot people will face but sure have your oppinion.i really would like to have the oppinion of a member of the cva block on this who work in both lowsec and 0.0 and enforce a playstyle *nrds* that is heavy influenced by this.
5/20/2009,i'm excited by walking in stations. do any of you csm candidates have a 'vision' for walking in stations? is there a walking in stations idea you're thinking of supporting already?
5/20/2009,"i support increased market pvp. if some jerk is undercutting you on your primary sale product, you should have the option to kneecap him with an electric drill.but seriously, i'm interested to see what the final implementation looks/feels like. once that happens i'll start coming up with ideas on how i'd like to improve/change/remove the feature.still feels a little early to wildly speculate on it, to me."
5/20/2009,"these are the features of walking in stations that i think will be implimented, and i'd like your support of them: players get to set up run their own bars. decorations can be found in space and put on display. players can program npcs to give out missions to other players. exotic dancers!this is the feature i'd like to see eventually: finding hollow asteroids in space (via exploration)=> being able to get out of your ship in a space suit => first-person perspective pve => collect loot!the critisism often levelled at eve is the lack of first-person combat (not being able to pilot your own ship tie fighter style). i think the above use of walking in stations is an excellent solution.what's the opinion of the csm candidates?"
5/20/2009,"i think it all looks pretty cool and will add some nice fluff to the game. anything which adds a bit more depth to the market/contract system will be welcome, however i don't want it to turn into a timesink of wandering around the marketplace into the bowels of the station to find some guns to stick on my spaceship.also i want them to let me smoke a pipe."
5/20/2009,"i think walking in stations is going to be a huge improvement in the eve experience. my major fear is what will happen to eve when the number of new players triples the server loads! :-)what i think it does is it can make the trade experience richer, it can make the corporate and alliance experence more social and immersive and generally add dramatically to the ""social"" aspect of eve.i can't wait!issler"
5/20/2009,social eve is not pew-pew!
5/20/2009,"walking in stations is for socialising, but in asteroids it could be put to another use!"
5/20/2009,"and eve is way more than just ""pew pew"".issler"
5/20/2009,"and eve is way more than just ""pew pew"".issler i have to agree with you there. i cannot help but fear that a new breed of players will join post ambulation that rarely venture from stations and enjoy all the other delights eve has to offer. you could argue that there is nothing wrong with this (rplay opportunities etc aren't to be sniffed at), but as they will be low consumers of market goods it won't benefit the many other types of players of eve much. hence, if you don't rply maybe ambulation won't be that exciting afterall (unless there are great fighting engines developed for physical combat between avatars etc). a mobile avatar in a station is afterall just a suped-up interface. then again, maybe i'm being a ludite!"
5/20/2009,as long was wis follows the standard system security protocol i am sure this will be fine.
5/20/2009,"agree with this, but i also think that part of the security measures should be the next 3 things:- ships blown up by concord give no insurance payout- at a security status lower then 0 you can not insure your ship- concord pod's players (not with gate guns but with ships) who's security standing is lower then -2if people make a choice to be a pirate they should take the consequences of being a pirate. and in the old day pirates where hanged, shot and quartered, no mercy given by the major empires.this would also solve loads of jita lag...."
5/20/2009,2/10 terrible troll.
5/20/2009,"i don't understand your response. trit and pyerite already trade at an effective 3 significant digit restriction and i don't think anyone is complaining about that. as i write this, there are 9 orders to sell trit at jita 4m4 cnap for 4.24 isk and they are all waiting patiently to fill those orders in a first-come-first-served order. mex, isogen, and nocxium all trade under 100 isk, so they currently trade with an effective 4 significant digit limitation. the only minerals that would even be effected by a 4 digit limitation would be zydrine, magacyte, and morphite.frankly, minerals would be the market least effected, so perhaps you misunderstood my proposal, in which case i would be happy to explain further. if not, i can't make any sense out of your response and i would appreciate it if you could explain what you mean."
5/20/2009,thank you for the support. :)should you wish to vote for me here is an easy link to use.
5/20/2009,i'm frequently annoyed by the fact that i cannot man my alliance's holding corp guns without leaving my own corporation. what are your views on this? do you think there should be a mechanic that allows members within the same alliance use pos guns and stuff between corps (such as a role)?
5/20/2009,"yeah, you sound like the sort of guy dark harlequin needs on the csm. have ""advised"" the corp of your candidacy and informed our head of security to do an exit poll of our membership. fly well."
5/20/2009,"how will you talk with ank on matters subject to an nda, should you get into the csm? i would have thought that much of what the csm discusses with ccp would be subject to such a thing."
5/20/2009,"cyprus- i'll start out by saying that my answer is probably not what you want to hear, and i'm sorry to disappoint you. maybe i've misjudged the tone of your post, and maybe this answer will be satisfying to you. i hope that this is the case.when i started playing the game in late 2006, the new player experience was nearly nonexistant. i was directed to warp to a local ""new player training area"" beacon, marking a 1/10 deadspace area, where i could engage a few harmless npcs, mine a little veldspar, and loot a can.there was an individual of less than savory nature camping this particular area. he consistently killed and looted the npcs before i could, and he looted the reward can at the end of the complex to prevent new players from recovering its contents. i was unable to do anything to stop him, and the tutorial did not give me any further instructions on how to, say, go find a new beacon. i sat for 1.5 hours and waited for him to get bored and leave. i did not have my local chat channel open at the time, but i'm sure that he was laughing at me somewhere.as a gallente character, i did not even start with the drones skill. it was a week before i even figured out that my ship not only had a drone bay but that i needed special skills to utilize it. i went through about 10 atron-class frigates before i figured out that the market contained equipment fittable to frigates other than the civilian models. it wasn't until i joined my first corp that i learned that gallente traditionally base their defenses on armor repairers and not shield boosters.the tutorials were click-through windows that were just informative enough to confuse me. i started with even fewer skillpoints then than new characters start with now, and i didn't start with accelerated skill training.you want to know the really amazing part of this story? i kept playing.i am not in favor of handholding. eve hardly presents a tolerant universe, i think its unfair to give new players the impression that they will be helped in all their endeavors. i think that the changes to the new player experience thus far have been great to improving the experience without just handing you the information that should be learned as you go. allowing annual attribute redistribution has given some comfort to the older players who allocated all those points to charisma in the hopes that it would improve our interaction with other players (what can i say, i was new and knew nothing of eve) while accelerated skill training allows new players to reach a level of combat readiness without feeling locked in to their chosen profession. i can't tell you how many new recruits i had to convince that just because they chose the special ops profession doesn't mean they can't fly anything well but stealth bombers. especially since, until recently, stealth bombers were a bit of a joke.the fact is that, no matter how disappointing or confusing the new player experience is now, it does not even begin to compare to how it used to be. if there are portions that you find to be confusing... bring them up. things that need to be clarified, tutorials that could be improved, hell, spelling errors that need correction, fine, i will look into it and act accordingly. i'm not going to just say ""eh, close enough."" however, i am strongly against a new player experience that drops you into the middle of all the information you need. that will remove the mystique of the world of eve, and i guarantee people will become bored with it long before they find something interesting in it. retention rates, in my opinion, will not be altered by telling you exactly how things work. eve is a complex game. it does not and can not appeal to everyone. that's part of why i like it. i'm a bit of an elitist bastard.new player experience can always use tweaking. but fixing? no. its not broken."
5/20/2009,"thank you, solo player. i don't think you know just how much that generous show of support meant to me.fly safe o7"
5/20/2009,"well, looks like i'll be abstaining again this election."
5/20/2009,"large arty need a fairly substantial boost to alpha, even at the expense of rof. maybe a touch more range.large acs could do with more falloff."
5/20/2009,already raised in csm1 by bane glorious.
5/20/2009,that was large autocannons not large projectiles in general and even if the topic has been raised before finding out the candidates opinions on something that has been raised before i don't think is an issue.
5/20/2009,"they are one of a huge list of things that need constant evaluation by ccp to make sure there is balance. i am reluctant to take a single item in a very complicated set of factors as something that needs dranatic action. i think they need a tweak to be sure but in the context of overall balance.so short answer, they need attention. i think ccp has been made aware of that. i expect there will be blanace changes at some point in the future to address the issue. if we don't see some change to address the issue then the csm should again remind ccp that this needs to be taken into account when they adjust the balance of the game.issler"
5/20/2009,iulixxi i like what i read in your website and your answers to the blog but i have not seen anything from you on the forums.what do other voter think of his ideas?
5/20/2009,"since i don't know any of the candidates, i've read all the interviews that i've found on several blogs.well, i discovered that all of them gave noobish answers to any question, someone didn't know anything about some game mechanics, but was sadly speaking like he was a university teacher.someone simply and clearly gave the same answer of someone that was interviewed before him, someone said 'i don't know' too many times, someone gave simply crazy answers (something like ""if i was <insert a powerful person> i would have done <insert something incredibly stupid>"".long story short, all the interviewed guys sadly looks like a bunch of noobs, dangerous for this game, and i'm a bit worried of what they will be capable to do.i hope facts will prove that i'm wrong."
5/20/2009,there are at least 2 very expeianced people on that list
5/20/2009,there's always mr.abstain to vote for. that's who i chose. best method to let them know how much they suck.
5/20/2009,just hit the abstain button like i did. it's utterly pointless anyway.
5/20/2009,i'll vote for whichever candidate is getting me a fuel bay on mah black ops >.>
5/20/2009,code for this is already in the works and is most likely added in the next expansion along with ammo bays and ore bays.
5/20/2009,"i voted for cat, it was the only sensible choice tbh."
5/20/2009,lol
5/20/2009,"yep. when voting for a 21-year old male cretin that likes to get a rise from people by pretending to be a teenage girl makes sense, you prove the notion that it's ""utterly pointless"""
5/20/2009,"excuses, excuses, ...there were three choices:1) run for office yourself2) vote for someone3) don't careif you choose 3), then obviously you can't be ""worried of what they (candidates) will be capable to do""."
5/20/2009,i haven't seen any of the interviews - can anyone point me towards them?
5/20/2009,"1: i can't, i don't have time and i don't speak a fluent english2: i'd love to, but nobody seems good3: how can i? i do care for this game, i don't want it to be ruinedwe all play the same game, how can i be indifferent to what happen or could happen?"
5/20/2009,"and waste your time dealing with people that are so utterly full of themselves they forgot what they're supposed to be doing in the csm and instead spend their time with political stupid talk and propaganda?mr.abstain is a valid voting option as defined by the voting mechanics installed by ccp. he only needs to take up a seat if he gets enough votes to stay a visible stain, showing off the csm's failure.about 90-92% of the player base does not care or vote. i do care enough about the csm and the purpose it could serve for ccp and the players to express my disgust at the mutated abomination we currently have in a simple vote for mr. abstain."
5/20/2009,"the interviews are here. i also have a list of the candidates which seem to have dedication and the thought power required for the job of a csm here.for those who don't want to vote, it is your right, but realize that the csm hold a very influential and busy position in their role. you can wear your tin-foil hats if you want, but after serving on the council for this term, i know just how important our role is as liaisons between ccp and the playerbase.some would try to tell you that there is more to the position than that, but we're basically only liaisons and filters for ideas from both sides. if you think the role of csm is worthless, we should also get rid of all diplomats and ambassadors, as they fill essentially the same role as csm members."
5/20/2009,hehe.maybe make a list of what you have against the other csm candidates?
5/20/2009,"so interviews aside, not voting because you think all the candidates are ""noobs"" is a pretty weak reason. so a list of candidates i know are not noobs include (and this is not an endorsement but just a fact):cat o'ninetails (i think the premier crime & punishment candidate)omber zombie (csm ii and deep knowledge of the game)admiral iceblock (five year ceo with good ideas)erik finnegan (the successor to ankhesentapemkah)happy joymaker (evil spy assasin guy :-) actually not a bad pvper with some real skills and experience)ruri dant (the can flipper griefer new corp ward dec-er guy)extreme (great csm alt)herschel yamamoto (seems to have some great well though out ideas)vuk lau (supreme maximum leader of the csm ii and a leader of a large alliance)as for the rest of the candidates i haven't looked at them enough to say i know they aren't ""noobs"" but honestly, i doubt any of them should be described that way.as for me, ""noob""? i feel like one all the time but somehow i've managed to continue to play eve actively for over 4 years, my corp founded over three years ago is still active and healthy with 140 members. oh, and my alliance is now over a year old. so either eve is insanely easy to play or i figured out at least some small part of the game.i hope you'll look again at some of the candidates and find one that you could support. if you can't decide you couldn't go wrong voting for any of the candidates i listed in my ""not a noob"" list. i hope you do find a way to participate in the process.issler"
5/20/2009,"here's what i've noticed after viewing all of the csm's stances and issues:-some csms are just playing on the forum fotm issues with no real substance behind it.-some csms are making insane game altering promises that they obviously cannot keep.-some csms have openly admitted the only reason why they're running is for the free trip to iceland.-some csms stand for nothing, have nothing to say, have no issues or agendas, and have barely said a word regarding their candidacy. -some csms are requiring all of their alliance members to vote for them, regardless if they agree or not.-some csms are just in it for the lulz.-most csms are trying to push 0.0 issues that most players in eve really don't care about.-almost none of the csms give a damn about fw. those that do treat it like a minor nuisance instead of a valid issue.-only one csm bothered to mention the words ""new"" and ""player"" in the same sentence, let alone address new player concerns. a vague issue this csm candidate later retracted.i could go on and on about all this csm nonsense, but i think the point has been made. don't act surprised when you see the voter turnout."
5/20/2009,"cyprus brought up some things key that i admit i have not brought up in my campaign postings. first fw.when it was introduced i created several splinter corps for members of my corp to leave to (one for each race) to try out fw. in the end none of us liked it much, but i see it still as important to many folks. i think if fw is important to you then then erik and the ""take care"" party are a clear choice. i wouldn't claim to have the experience, knowledge or focus i believe ahk has established as core to the party erik represents.as to new player experience. i haven't done much ""outward facing"" communications concerning the new player experience. what i did however, was buy the retail package as soon as it was available and started a new character outside any of my corp or alliance (i continue to leave that character a secret and play it regularly to continue to try and see eve thorugh ""fresh"" eyes). i had a lot of feedback that was provided directly to ccp in our session about the last major patch. the summary is i think it has a lot stuff that needs attention.for example the ""new player guide"" that came with the retail packaging was a not a hard copy (i felt that was a cheat) and largely useless and in many places misleading or wrong. for example it implied i could have a career as an 'artist"" in eve. still looking for that skill!i do not like the new ""get your skills through missions"" approach as compared to the get them when you roll the character.i do like the reroll that came out sort of a result though.i didn't find much in the new player missions that prepared me any better than what existed before the revamp.so eve remains a hard game to start out in. the question that begs then, how much of ccp's developer resources should go to improving that segement's experience verses the rest of the pilots in eve? i hope for a balanced approach as i am all for a lot of new players but i also am concerned about the growing player base and he finite resources we all compete for.issler"
5/20/2009,"much love for you, issler dainze. i think you're just about the only one who's openly acknowledged the existence of new players.i'm in the firm belief that there should indeed be some hand holding for brand new players. not throughout their entire eve experience of course, but just enough in the beginning to understand the fundamentals. i have also gone through the post apocrypha new player experience and, imo, it does not teach the fundamentals. not in any clear sense.we've all seen new players having to learn the hard way, often emoragequitting before they reach six months. though funny and entertaining to read, it is also sad at the same time.i was fortunate to have an eve vet roommate who took the time to show me the ropes ingame. he was always there to shout answers down the hallway whenever i had a question. not all new players have such a luxury.i believe this should have been ccps #1 priority. in a business sense, more players translates into more income. disgruntled players who can't figure out what to do or how to play often leave which translates to loss of income. eve is, after all, an income generating source for ccp. new player attraction and retention should be top priority.i don't believe eve needs to change to accommodate new players. rather i believe a better, clearer, and easy to understand tutorial is necessary.something i might get around to tackling once i purchase fraps."
5/20/2009,"i spend my time in game building, mostly tech 2 items, and blowing things up in missions. i play this way as i am a casual only player, with about an hour to play a day, and in that time i can normally complete either 1 level 4 mission or set up new queues to build and research stuff. that said, here are my issues:1. new toys. the last expansion had nothing interesting for me. i want tech 1 salvage able to be engineered into tech 2 salvage so i can build tech 2 rigs to upgrade my ships a tiny little bit without spending a billion isk. this was supposed to be implemented in apoc, but was removed. i want it yesterday anyways.2. cheaper toys. as the player base continues to increase with the same amount of moon minerals (approx) always being mined, the price of rare moon minerals continues to climb, and thus the cost of tech 2 ships continues to climb. this is annoying. ccp introduced a pre-nerfed feature called alchemy that was supposed to ameliorate the scarcity of tech 2 raw materials. alchemy needs to be fixed so that players with the appropriate levels of skills can afford to fly their new ships, and the neverending price increases need to be reversed for a while so tech 2 ship prices drop.3. crowded mission hubs - when i started playing 3 years ago, there were often only 10 or 20 people in mission systems. now there are hundreds. all the time. creating constant lag, spam, and griefing. i do not want any of the current level 4 agents moved. i want more added. as the player base increases, all of the carebears eventually move to level 4 agents. then they sit there forever, unless they go pvping. if ccp added 39 more high sec level 4 agents to each race (-20 to +19, mixing the different types) this would go a long ways toward spreading out the player base.i realize my priorities are not everyone's priorities. i personally have 2 votes. i also think there are a lot of carebear lurkers that share my priorites. candidates please post here if you do as well.thanks"
5/20/2009,"my campaign thread.to respond to your specific issues-1. i have to be honest when i don't remember a mention of a t1 salvage -> t2 salvage processing mechanic. if you could cite a reference i would be happy to provide a more informed response. as it stands... tech 2 rigs are a serious investment in the current market. most tech ii rigs cost more than a tech ii cruiser. according to current values at eve-central, a capacitor control circuit i costs 16.8 million isk. a capacitor control circuit ii costs very nearly 300 million isk. unless my math is wrong (it might be, i'm a bit tired) that represents a price increase of around 1700%. compared, now, to a thorax (t1 cruiser) and a deimos (t2 varient of the thorax hull), the thorax costs 6.3 million, and the deimos costs 113 million. this, once again, represents approximately a 1700% price increase.i recognize that the information provided here is hardly conclusive scholarly research, but i think it illustrates my point- all tech 2 prices are a little ludicrous, but tech 2 rigs are not necessarily costlier than tech 2 ships, proportionally speaking.2. tech 2 (and to a much greater extent tech 3) remain largely unattainable production goals unless you have significant man-hours to devote to development and maintenance, be that large quantities of personal game time, or large numbers of corp members all willing to chip in. i would love to see tech 2 production become slowly cycled into the mainstream, possibly by altering the invention mechanic to make success more likely and less expensive. i recognize that ccp does not want to eliminate the benefit of holding tech 2 bpos, as they earned them in a way meaningful at the time of their release. however, tech 2 is almost commonplace now, but the prices continue to stay high. many people complain about the isk faucet of level 4 missions... until prices for tech 2 ships, at least, become reasonable, the influx of isk will be necessary to continue to afford them. its simple cause and effect. when things cost less, people need less money. when people need less money, they do things that aren't as immediately profitable. like, for instance, pvp. yeah, that got your attention, didn't it? ""oh boy, willing targets! and all we have to do is charge less? who would have thought?!?"" </rant>3. hating level 4s is the flavor of the week right now, which makes anyone with a bit of a chip on their shoulder unlikely to take this complaint at all seriously. i recognize that level 4s supply a large amount of isk with little risk involved, and i recognize that reprocessing the loot from them has seriously altered the mineral market. i am in favor of curtailing the loot drops within level 4s to reduce both the income due to module sales and the massive influx of minerals to the market. i recently moved with my corp out of the area surrounding amarr- they spent most of their time with a level 4 agent in the tash-murkon region, i spent most of mine with the much-loved edami dantan of penirgman. we moved into areas less densely populated... and do you know what we found? more level 4 agents. higher quality level 4 agents, still in highsec. with comparatively small numbers of pilots utilizing them. there are plenty of level 4 agents around, but they aren't going to be brought to you. sometimes you have to build standings with a new corporation. sometimes a new faction. you may have to relocated 30 jumps away. but there are places to run level 4s without overcrowding, escaping the ninja salvagers and the can looters, already in the universe. and i seriously believe that adding significantly more level 4 agents to the universe of eve is one of the few things ccp would never do."
5/20/2009,"this is a sensitive subject since tech2 salvage material tends to come from a finite supply. adding it to missions would result in issues for the in-game economy given the fact there is no limit to mission availability. maybe the careful addition of t2 salvage material to the end of storyline missions might be reasonable. i would gladly bring the topic up to ccp if elected (and the issue gets representation in the assembly hall.)unfortunately supply and demand is at play here concerning tech2 ships. the valueable r64 moon minerals are found in nullsec (0.0 space) and lowsec which are defended viciously by whomever is claiming them. therefore they set the price on based on the risk and effort that goes into mining those resources. they are also getting their ships destroyed in the process to do this. slowly adding more cadmium and mercury moons into the game might not be totally reasonable but it has to be done carefully. it would be unfair to the alliances out in 0.0 if the very thing they've spent years fighting over was devalued. i do understand your wish to jump in better ships but one thing to keep in mind is the fact mission running can be a very low risk endeavor. i don't see any reason why there shouldn't be more level 4 agents added for the purpose of reducing lag (if the system is getting overloaded.) the only other reasonable solution is ccp reinforcing that node but that might be something better for saving use for 0.0 combat situations. however as garthran said it might just be a matter of doing some research and finding less crowded agents. yes, it'll require grinding up standings on someone new but that is part of the game, right?jus lookin, what ideas do you have for giving the one-hour-each-night players something they can do and still feel like they've accomplished something each login? as your csm representative i would be glad to hear your opinions. each one of us plays this great game for a reason and thankfully ccp is a company that gives the players plenty of ways (like the csm, fanfest) to be heard."
5/20/2009,looking for industrialist/anti-carebear candidate!
5/20/2009,"hey jus, i've been on the csm for the past two terms and i'm currently campaigning for erik finnegan, my successor. with your playstyle i'd say you should check him out, but also consider giving dierdra vaal a look.i'll tell you what has happened in csm1 and 2 regarding the issues you posted and what my stance on it is, expect erik to keep up the same line.ccp agrees the disparity between t1 and t2 rigs and salvage is larger than intended, not only do they want to address it through the salvage 'upgrading', but they also have a few other plans to improve the situation in the long term, which i don't think they disclosed yet so i can't speak about it for nda reasons. let's just say ccp is aware of the problem and are working to make adjustments from multiple angles. i support this attitude and hope the changes will make it in a bit faster. expect erik to raise an issue about this delicate matter if it takes too long.ccp's economist, eyjog, is monitoring the mineral market closely. the current price increases are the result from several factors, the upheaval in delve, the closing of the exploit, and increased demand. however, eyjo said the current prices are not a reason for concern because they are merely stabilizing towards their original levels before the exploit. if the prices continue to rise, ccp will step in.that said, i agree alchemy is too heavily pre-nerfed, the output quantity is way too low as well and it requires constant attention. this needs to be looked at. that and i don't really like the whole idea of static moon minerals, but i suppose that will get looked at in the major 0.0 revamp later on.this has been raised in csm1, and discussed in iceland. as a result, new agents have recently been added to the game, expect a devblog on this matter in the next few days."
5/20/2009,"i'd argue that alchemy is perfectly fine.it acts as a pressure valve for the high-end moon minerals. we can always argue about the fact that it sets the price slightly high. but i'm pretty damn sure that if ccp sees any problem, they would fix it rather soon."
5/20/2009,"candidates please post here if you do as well.hey jus, i've been on the csm for the past two terms and i'm currently campaigning for erik finnegan, my successor. obviously can't read :)i'd agree with you lv. alchemy was never intended to replace the high-end moon mining. it's an option available when stocks are limited (and thus expensive) and where an industralist has the capacity and capability to setup a decent synthesis operation.clearly some players don't understand the simple economics of supply and demand? supply is limited for the rare moon minerals. rarity, scarcity and demand adds up to a sort-after asset if you hold a moon. this creates the environment needed for conflict, which is what a lot of eve is about. conflict leads to demand for other commodities (ships/mods/ammo) and thus the market wheel is kept turning.i'd argue that prices for the rarer moon minerals aren't that high, as it is getting sold easily on the markets (this i know firsthand). prices for modules and ships have gone up as a response to increased base costs- but i'd argue they are still considerably cheaper than pre-invention. if you wish to see what happens when players push price ceilings, look at morphite in jita the past year. that hump was the result of one player. when supply is limited and then interupted (due to wars), expect hikes!this game isn't wow. unlimited supply and the ability to make stuff very cheaply isn't compatible with the universe that is eve. some players forget this (and candidates/campaigners) and want everything quickly and easily. ironic really considering many of them don't enter into the confilct side of eve at all. they'll tell you that the playerbase has grown and the seeding of minerals hasn't. this should indicate to players that ccp are happy with current seeding and there was just an abundance of minerals early on in eve, and a larger playerbase was catered for (ie, forward-thinking by ccp). i'd argue that with t3 ships being dependant on wh materials, we should start to see a drop in demand for materials required to build t1/2 in the future.xavier"
5/20/2009,"i think i would be a great candidate for you to support. i hope you'll take some time and read my previous posts as i think they would show you are exactly the type of player i focus on. as to your questions:1. new toys. not every expansion can include new content for all groups of players. that said it is important to have csm members that keep ccp remininded of the large number of players like you and that content for this segement of players continues to be included in future plans.2. cheaper toys. i think there are several issues. the promary one is we have essentially fixed amounts of resources being fought over by a much larger player base. we have double to players and the same moons and roid belts. that is not going to provide a quality game experience if it is not addressed. the solution is to adjust the levels of these resources to be back in line with where they had been with a smaller player bases.3. crowded mission hubsagain, it all comes down to twice the players but the same resources. i don't know if more systems or other changes in infrastructure are the answer, but clearly the experience has degraded as the game has grown and some sort of change is needed.there was also a discussion of alchemy in this thread. i think alchemy is not a solution to the moon scarcity. in fact i think alchemy is useless and needs a revamp. i'd love to meet anyone that is using alchemeny in any meaningful way. i actually went through the planning to try and use it in our t2 production process and found it to be impossible both in terms materials requirements and more to the point in terms of time.i hope this helps you pick the candidate that can best represent you in the csm.issler"

5/21/2009,"regarding the extension of supercap battle durability (sorry if this was mentioned before):problem with current suggestion: extra hitpoints will be easily negated by extra dreads, and c'mon, what can survive for 30min. when 50 dreads let it rip.sollution (i know it's radical please don't flame (too much)): micro reinforced mode that a supercap enters when it reaches half structure (or smth.). making it indestructible but also imobile for certain set period of time.how's that for a whacky idea?"
5/21/2009,"i dont like the effect of the dd mentioned in this thread.this does in no case eliminate the hit&run of titans.scenario: if the first titan places his dd(the new one) well,every other titan in system has 20seconds to fire his dd on thesame fleet without any ship of it being able to get away. with the increasing amount of titans i cant see why an allianceshouldnt fire lots of dds on the same fleet destroying every moduleon them leaving them gimped to any conventional fleet without any chanceto get away cause 20secs are enough to totally bubble them down afterthe dd. if a titan is going deploy a dd it should be forced to stay on field and not being allowed to warp off. that is the most important change that needs to bedone. multiply their ehp if needed but dont allow a titan to hit&run!"
5/21/2009,"of course it can die if it doesn't have support, and it should be that way. in response to the direct damage guy. we've got 1,000 ships in game that do direct damage, what is unique about another one, even if it's damage is massive?dd is a unique and tactical weapon. it should stay that way. however, it's affect at the moment is just ridiculous. so the real question is, how do you revamp the dd to have catestrophic effect while not just blowing ships up. i think the proposed solution is about as good as it gets. i can not stress how much i like the fact that this actually usher's in the desire for t3 ships and goods and gives people a reason to choose b/t t2 and t3 goods."
5/21/2009,"t3 is currently beyond the reach of the majority of the player base, and may be so for a very long time indeed. further to that the baseline cost ccp has indicated it would prefer the t3 to sell at is 300-400mil isk, so it will be considerably more expensive than the current standard for fleet warfare i.e. a sniper or rr bs.so i have some questions...are you suggesting that t3 becomes the only ship which can survive your heat dd with active modules(assuming the dd's are stacked as is likely to be the case)?andif so how do you propose pos warfare be carried out with t3 cruisers, since these are likely the only ones to survive at the gate?"
5/21/2009,"changing the covetor's mining barge skill requirementcurrent issue:currently once a player has achieved the skills to pilot a retriever they skip the covetor and go directly to the hulk as its only a day of more skilling to pilot making the covetor an obsolete ship and creating a huge gap between the retriever and ""next-in-line"" ship upgrade.with over 35+ days of skilling to pilot the covetor, another day won't matter to skip it and get a hulk instead making the progression bar for the mining career unbalanced and a ship has become obsolete and useless as it was the best mining barge before the release of the hulk.suggested fix:lowering the covetors mining barge skill requirement from v to iv making the coveter once again an attractable ship to obtain and a perfect ship to pilot while you skill for a hulk.a retriever is inefficient compared to a hulk which is over 150%+ better than a retriever, there needs to be a ship in between the retriever and hulk and its already in the game.. the covetor, it just need to have it's requirements fixed to put it between the retriever and hulk.this will bring balance to the mining career path and once again make the coveter a useful ship players would actually use instead of skipping in favor of the hulk.thanks for reading and supporting this."
5/21/2009,"makes sense to me, although i hasten to add that i have mining lvl 2 and no other industry skills at all. part of the reason for that is the length of training into a half decent ship (covetor) for it to give a decent isk return on the investment in time.personally, and if anyone repeats this i will pod them, but i may be tempted to mine a bit in quieter (less pvp) times by poking some rocks for a change.this may go some way to encouraging mining and increasing the minerals brought into game through mining. therefore also reducing the 40% balance of minerals brought in via loot.it won't be a huge change i expect, but a collection of smaller balances, of which this could be one, offer a better overall solution.supported."
5/21/2009,"when we discussed revamping of mining at iceland, this was a major point. because a mining barge v requirement for a covetor is stupid, imo."
5/21/2009,"it's not stupid in my opinion, it should be there to be the buffer for those going towards a hulk.but if ccp could consider decreasing the skill requirement of the covertor to only require mining barge lvl 4, you would obtain a much steadier and progressive curve of development as you will enable the practical use of the covertor again in eve as it would then truly become the ""next-in-line"" after the retriever.as of what it stands now, its a major problem as the covertor is a pointless ship in eve and it realy deserves getting some light shed on it once more making it a ""next-in-line"" in the chain towards mining excellence."
5/21/2009,that's what i'm saying
5/21/2009,i fully support this.it shouldn't thou be posted as a suggestion but rather an issue as the progression bar of the mining path in eve is currently to broken compared to all the other paths a new character would prefer to take.even older characters who wishes to skill in the industrial section and go for mining would benefit immensely by this as it would bring balance to the miners.
5/21/2009,yeah i agree with you on that this is actually more of an issue rather than a suggestion and it should in my opinion be address as soon as possible.
5/21/2009,i pretty much agree with everything the op said.i as a retriever pilot fully support your proposal /signed
5/21/2009,"if you try to compare other types of professions such as those who prefer combat/mission running, they have a far more steady and balanced progression in the game where they can obtain more firepower and better ships just within days of creating their character and after a week or 2-3 they already have surpassed all the miners in terms of profit and progression since they won't have to spend over a month just to get their next-in-line ship upgrade.i believe that the current state of the miners progression needs to be attended quickly and hard to ensure that those who wishes to go down the miners path are able to enjoy their playtime and not being forced to sit in their station waiting for weeks until they can get a viable upgrade from the retriever."
5/21/2009,"i agree fully.there are more of such progression obstacles, like cruiser v requirements for the next series of fighting ships' progressions that can be looked at, but this indeed makes the covetor a useless ship. never had one, went directly to hulk.mika"
5/21/2009,"ya i agree there are also to many instances of requiring ""skill v"" as a secondary requirement for some ships.to fly the next class of ship should require level 3 or 4 of the current class. to get to the t2 forms of each should require level 4 of the current. if someone want to spend that 5-20 day space to get that last 5% of bonus then more power to them. all of type type 2 frigates should require rank 4 in frigates, general piloting + 1 or 2 other skills at rank 3 or 4. the type 2 destroyers have the insane requirements of frigates 5, destoryers 5 + several others.gallente frigate vdestroyers destroyers vspaceship commandspaceship command ivinterceptorsinterceptors ivevasive maneuveringevasive maneuvering vthe point should be to open up more options to the player base and only force specialization if they one the last 5-10% extra bonus."
5/21/2009,"i couldn't agree with you more aeryn, also this whole suggestion is about time we get some changes to this matter, its an issue more than it should be a suggestion."
5/21/2009,they either need to make covetors available at mining barges iv or hulks available at exhumers iv (if not v).the gap between covetor and hulk needs to be much wider than it is now....i'm in favor of making covetor come sooner...not later.
5/21/2009,"making the hulk available at exhumer lvl 4 would just worsen the matter. but yes, make the covertor available at mining barge iv is the best option as it would close the gap between retriever pilots and hulk pilots providing an upgrade in between those two ships."
5/21/2009,aye i agree
5/21/2009,quite so.
5/21/2009,"i can't say i'd support the making of hulk requiring a higher level of exhumers as i feel that it already takes long enough to be able to pilot a ship like that.but the matter needs to be focused on fixing the gap between what ship to look at once your in the retriever cause so far, the covertor is left in the dark and has ended up being a useless ship in eve as everyone just skips it going straight for the hulk wich takes just a few more days of skilling to obtain.if we could rally the support and get the mining barge skill required for the covertor lowered down to iv we would have shaved of over 20 days of skill training required to pilot it thus making it a viable next-in-line ship to obtain before starting to skill towards the hulk.to perhaps make this a lot more balanced it would be a good choice to add a requirement of spaceship command iv requirement to the covertor and raise the hulks spaceship requirement to lvl v instead of iv.by doing so there will be brought balance to the progression curve for a miners career path making it easier and survivable when trying to play this path in the game.this should be a equal terms of boosting and nerfing that should gain the support by not only the older players but new ones as well."
5/21/2009,"ok, i agree that we need more gradient for mining ships...but not this quote. not this quote at all.requiring v for t2 ships makes /perfect/ sense. just like how you require v for most t2 gear. t2 requires time and effort. taking something to iv in 4 days isn't time and effort, and most people wouldn't ever train a v skill again.honestly, i think the op is a wonderful idea, but this quote is completely ignorant to the fact that there's a reason the per-level boosts are small. maybe if they were bigger it'd work, but it wouldn't change the fact that if things were the way stated in the quote, no one would /ever/ train those skills to v.supportive to op."
5/21/2009,"some posts are getting off topic here i can agree to that.i'd like for more people to open their eyes and respond to this matter.this is an issue that needs to be addressed cause it's affecting a lot of peoples playtime, playstyle and in game experience which could be the turning point of whether or not a new player would even bother continue playing as one of eve's most basic profession needs an serious do over and this is how they can start. by fixing the biggest gap in the mining fleet.lower the mining barge level requirement on the covertor to lvl iv to make this ship a viable upgrade from the retriever on your path towards perfection in your chosen career path."
5/21/2009,"i agree completely, lowering the requirement for the covertor to 4 (both for mining barge, and for astrogeology) makes a lot of sense.this is kind of off topic, but what about adding a 3rd tier of mining barges, something that could truly be called a capital mining ship? the orca or rorq are all well and good, but they aren't actually for mining, they are for supporting miners. i would love to see a capital mining ship of some kind....anyway, full support for the covertor having it's skill requirements lowered!"
5/21/2009,"i support the op.covetor beeing reduced to mining barge lvl 4 makes a lot of sense.lvl5 is a nice barrier of entry for tech 2 gear, but most tech 1 stuff does not require lvl 5, and shouldn't. it would be nice to see another barge above hulk, perhaps requiring exhumers 4 or 5. something with 4 strip mining slots, a third low slot, and a nice shield tank capacity. call it a deep space mining barge. but this is another topic entirely :p"
5/21/2009,"lowering the astrogeology skill would just end up making the retriever a pointless ship to go for since the covetor would be a better alternativ since it would put the covetor/hulk case and make it into a retriever/covetor case.by just lowering the mining barge lvl requirement you put the covertor right in between the retriver and hulk in terms of skill training time it takes to obtain those.after you have skilled for the retriver you would have to endure 15.5 days roughly estimated before you could pilot a covertor if the mining barge requirement was lowered from v to iv.after that you would have to endure a little over 21 days of skill training given that you have by that time +3 implants, lvl iv t1 learning skills and iii t2 learning skills.it would bring balance into the mining barge flotilla.this is a matter that needs to be fixed not in the future, but now.for the future once we've gotten this changed, then we could start asking for a ship that could surpass even the hulk in terms of mining ;)"
5/21/2009,"i agree with what valkyrie aeris is saying about bringing balance to the system and not ending up making it to easy while doing so.it's obvious that we are not asking for some major buff or massive nerf here, just simply trying to raise the voices of the people to address a vital starting point in the whole system for bringing new life into the mining path of the game.i strictly believe that this isn't a massive change that could affect the entire eve universe, but it will change the game experience for people as they will finally have a more steady bar of development in their chosen career path while at the same time bringing the covertor back out there in the asteroid fields :)so let me hear you all give your thumbs up and lets get this change implemented!what do we want? lowered level requirements of the skill mining barge from v to iv on the covertor!when do we want it? !!yesterday!!"
5/21/2009,if we could get this fix implemented as soon as possible it would be the perfect step in the right direction for the ccp dev's making changes to the current mining system in eve which so many people desires that it gets a makeover.
5/21/2009,"thanks for picking out the negative in my statement. i was saying i agree that the cov should be a lvl 4 ship.i was just arguing with that other person about how ""t2 ships shouldn't take lvlv skills""i wholly agree with the fact that the cov, with the current skill requirements, is stupidly useless."
5/21/2009,"the are a few thing i can think of to add this carriers should have a new type of drone/fighter for planetary bombardment, say a bomber that fires once or twice then returns for ammo. ammo could be a thing the carrier pilot has to buy.also what if players could hire npc ships to help defend they're assets, obviously there would be a limit say 5, seems a bit boring just shooting static weapon emplacements. they could respawn after downtime and have a daily/weekly/monthly cost, or the is a sub orbital shipyard that makes them again after resources have been put into it. that or just buy them again after being destroyed like emplacements. just a thought. or what about this... say an enemy alliance wants to take over a moon base/asteroid base/colony they could go to the sub orbital station attack this into a state where they can use it and then put marines + armed planetary vehicles in it to take over the colony, this is an optional way to get the colony without blowing it to bits and paying for repairs. there would be a time delay on when they would win (if there was enough of an attacking force put down) obviously fights aren't won instantly and especally if your battleground is a city."

5/21/2009,anyone who doesn't support this because it would make missions easier to afk is an idiot. should miners be forced to reactivate their lasers after each cycle because it's too easy for them to afk currently? should producers be limited to creating a single item per production run? the benefits of introducing this feature far outweigh the negatives associated with yet another afk isk making method.

5/21/2009,"i find it interesting that i read thru 16 pages on this, and not one question regarding that stance ccp has about "" pushing more players into 0.0 "" ? i see what honestly looks like the same small groups of folks screaming at each other , all the while embracing this assumption that if there was even more stuff in 0.0, there would be a mass exodus into 0.0? no, i think you all relise why there are very few players exculsive to 0.0 and it isn't about isk itself. it's about being able to log on, and go play, without hassel, without uber-doom, without having to constantly look over your shoulder or wait around for enough other people that wanna do what you wanna do to be around. yes, i already hear the keyboards going at this, i'm such a n00b, ect ect. yet, i think you'll find that argument is the reason even most of you make money in empire, and blow it in 0.0. wanna make lowsec and 0.0 attractive? less hassel, less stress. simple to say, but extremly unpopular to admit. you wanted the biggest ships, best rocks, best ice , ect ect . . you got it , and your alone. no-one even wants to try going out there, because it's just not worth . . there time. not isk alone, but simply because it eats up time and stresses folks out to even try going out there. guessing this is where you'll start trolling and screaming carebear? you said it yourself, risk vs. reward. it's not that there isn't reward there, it's that stress and risk to even make the attempt isn't worth it to most players, because they just wanna play. in low-sec and moreso in 0.0, you just can't really do that, now can you ? you all wanted the pressure, guess what ? most other players don't. they wanna go shoot some bad guys, mine a few rocks, chatter with others and relax. so, while i do agree that you all could use more to do out there, and a few of the sugestions i see on here seem great in that direction, ccp's idea that if they keep just tossing candy out there, that more players will swarm out into it? no, not really. some revamping that might instead make it less stressful? that might be a better question."

5/21/2009,supported
5/21/2009,"absolutely unsupportable proposal. let me tell you why:if op is right, and the statistics are true, removing t1 loot from the game would:- **** up the economy for quite a long time, not just a short period- would raise hyper-inflation, and even when the stress is over, and markets are back to balance (long-long time), average prices (of anything) would be a way lot higher than nowadays. at least of those that are in any way connected with minerals.just to connect it to rl (as eve market is too much like rl). there is a global drought that takes 40% of the food production globally. that would kill millions, and would make food prices go skyhigh. and it's still not the same as in eve, when you know it's going to happen; like god (ccp) comes and sais: ""let there be drought"", and there is gonna be drought. all the wealthy would immediately buy as much as possible, not for using it, but to have profit on the prices rising, sucking out even more resources from the market. anyone who produces food in big quantity wouldn't bring it to the market for the same reason; both killing even more millions, or let's say probably close to a billion, thinking earthwise. anyone who produces food in smaller quantities also wouldn't bring their goods to the market, because their fear of death of starvation. market dies for quite a long period, producers and/or owners start bartering as money (isk) is not a good way to store your riches as it devaluates too quickly; meaning noone wants money for the food, everyone wants food for money. too many hungry eskimos and no seals nor whales.look at any of the rw's hyper-inflations, the problem is that whoever owns the goods don't want to sell them at any price, because if he doesn't spend his money immediately, he will loose quite a lot: the only viable option is bartering. being an economist and being hungarian (the country that produced the highest hyper-inflation on earth up to this day) i highly against this proposal.for further information hyper-inflation see:"
5/21/2009,"simple solution: replace all loot with refineables ( the thingies that drone npcs drop).industry will become more popular and profitable, since manufacture will be the only way to get t1 modules. missions would be still interesting since it wouldn't be actually nerfed, the only thing that changes is that players will depend more on manufacture to get modules that they need."
5/21/2009,why not slowly phase the loot out then.
5/21/2009,"since op has his problem with the t1 loot that is refined for minerals, this one would not be a solution for him, as far as i can guess. following the chain: since manufacturing needs minerals... you can finish it alone. :)on the other hand it would be quite ""nice"" for me (and other economists) to see what it would do, and how people and market would react on such a thing to happen. eve is already a bit short of trit, or at least their price history sais so. (long term rise in prices on a free and fully competitive market indicates shortage in that good and/or its substitute goods)but, still. i'm playing this game to have some entertainment, and would happily leave ""work"" behind when logging in. :) so i'm still unsupportive (is there such a word? :d )edit: reading through the first few posts again, i'm wondering what people are thinking about market reactions... named loot instead of simple t1 ones... haha. make named loot unprocessable... hahahahaha. let me guess: named items price drops as hell, and noone cares to buy t1 stuff. yes it solves the problem of the ""too much"" minerals, as noone would care to buy them for t1 production, since there would be no demand for simple t1 mods. btw: reality shows that simple t1 modules buy/sell order prices are quite balanced, while named ones are... meh. quite hectic. i'd say 80% of the loot i reprocess (or leave behind in space) are named ones. crap named ones tho."
5/21/2009,"i think this idea is a bit rash. i am against it.possibly mission loot should be dropped damaged? ccp could make damaged mods refine less effectively and they would have to be repaired before sale, thus making them marginally less profitable than manufactured items."
5/21/2009,"removing loot altogether would be very bad, economically. for a change like that something would have to be done to counter the reprocussions, such as giving existing asteroid belts a buff to cope with the large number of miners that will spawn from the economic backlash.as for it perminantly destroying the market; that likely won't happen. prices will increase dramaticly for maybe two weeks, but they will stabalize reletively quickly as more miners take to the belts.there was a ton of stuff being produced for nothing with the pos exploit, the aftermath of this change would be compareable to what happened when it was fixed."
5/21/2009,"there are several problems if you remove t1 loot:- reduced mineral intake;- increased mineral demand (you need to build the t1 module to build the t2 module);- increased use of building slots (see above);- unbalance in isk/material inflow in mission, even if the isk reward stay the same removing part of the loot the rapport change and the isk part of the total reward will go from 40% to 60%.all that say inflation + building slot shortage. not a good combination."
5/21/2009,"then what about the proposal of cutting reprocess of all loot in half? and keeping drone ore at full reprocess?this wouldn't hurt things nearly as much, and it would slowly help with the issue of how way too many minerals come from mission loot.it'd effectively cut mission minerals down to 20% instead of 40% (or 25% if you include drone loot with the 'full refine' bonus), thus making the impact much less painful.i'm still supportive of no meta 0 loot, but i would be perfectly fine with my proposal.current reprocessing percentages are waaaaaaaaaay too high. sure, they use the same numbers as refining ore, but they shouldn't. you should lose a lot when breaking a gun back down to basics.and before y'all argue that ""in the future we can refine way better""...current technology allows us to target objects way better than in eve, among many other things in eve that would've /improved/ instead of devolved (like scan probes, autopilot, etc.). they devolved for gameplay. reprocess should not be futuristically evolved, it should be balance to where it's not such a ridiculously easy way to get lowsec and nullsec ores.plus, eve has an economy that is based on de-inflation, and this is not caused by mission loot.. if anything, you wouldn't get hyper-inflation, you'd get true inflation, making the eve economy even more realistic. current eve economy works backwards..."
5/21/2009,"just figured i would comment on a few things..to combat the reduced mineral intake, mining needs to be boosted. in my opinion, it should be boosted a week or two before the t1 loot is removed, so there will become a glut of minerals right before the shortage hits, so it won't be felt as much. i would like to boost mining by adding in capital mining ships, but that's a topic for another thread. just assume for now that ccp can and does boost mining.the increased mineral demand is covered by there being more minerals, because ccp needs to boost mining...the increased use of building slots is a problem, but it's not a huge one. pos's can have building slots added, as can player owned stations, in addition, in high-sec stations that are away from the major market hubs, and off the major trade routes, there are tons of free (read, no wait at all) construction spots. research spots could use an increase, in my opinion, but i don't think the increased use of building slots would be a problem.as for missions being worth less, well, personally, i think that's a good thing, as they are currently drastically unbalanced as far as risk versus reward goes. they have a large reward, and very small risk. taking a bit of profit out of them in the form of removing the t1 loot would help balance out the risk/reward ratio."
5/21/2009,"^- this... is basically my opinion to what taking this loot out of missions would do. -^there is absolutely no reason for me to be able to run l4's all day long solo, with no possibility of dieing, and making nigh 1b, i stress solo, from making rigs (buying what very little salvage i need to make them), building industrial ships (which are overpriced for some reason that i have yet to figure out... look at the sigil, for reference), and basically paying for my own account, with isk, in a battlecruiser.with eve's /obsession/ with risk/reward, it fails super bad at missions. just yesterday we needed a ton of low and null minerals to finish building our capital ship in 0.0. since there were pirates roaming the area at that time, i, personally, ran some l4's, with an industrial following me for loot, and me dropping one launcher for a tractor beam to salvage.1 day.before that day we were about halfway done building it.1 day.1 person.in a battlecruiser (drake) ((l4's, according to ccp, are built to be done by battleships))reprocessed at the highest standings station i could find (i think it was like 99.5% net reprocess... wtf something doesn't make sense here)and right now the ship is under construction, and we need nothing else to finish it.imo, all of you arguing how much it would break the game, the game is already broken, and it needs a drastic fix."
5/21/2009,"move target painters(tp) from medium slots to high slots.reasons:-usually medium slots are needed for tank and tackle gear + mwd/ab + else , there is little room for a target painter. most rapiers/huginns never fit tp because they don't have the free slots to do so, even if their role/bonuses are for target painting to some extend. and caldari missile boats have to reduce their tank.-most ships that need tp usually have a free highslow this is true for caldari missile ships and even the huginn/rapier can free up a high slot easier than a med one if the want to fit tp.-tp effect is more like turret effect/neutralizers than other ewar effect it follows that it should be high slot item like turrets/neutralizers."
5/21/2009,supported of coursefeel free to add your opinion here
5/21/2009,"no. i have weapons, neuts and rr to fit in my highslots. tp's midslot position is fine because tank is overrated - it's only useful while you're being shot at, while gank is useful the entire fight."
5/21/2009,"rapier has i think mainly been used for it's webs, which were considerably better pre-qr and the speed changes. also perhaps because target painters did not have such a good role in a gang at that time. with the changes to bombers a painter is more useful than before and the new gang dynamic of recons/bombers/black ops are still being explored. i think over time we may see more tp instead of webs on black ops rapiers, perhaps a mix of different fits in gang.even allowing for that, i feel that changing tp to a high slot will unbalance things. tracking disruptors, damps, jammers are all mid slot items and the same could be argued for those. it would be a pretty significant boost to ewar ships, since they meant to be squishy and trade off ewar effectiveness vs. survivability."
5/21/2009,i support this idea.
5/21/2009,maky a version of target painter for high-slot with slightly higher effishiensy
5/21/2009,"not supported for what your asking... but i would say is offer a version of a target painter as a lowslotjust as turret ships have the ability to fit a tracking enhancer, there should be a lowslot module that would increase the speed of the explosion velocity (affects all missiles, where exposion radius only affects guided missiles)as far as the util highslot... no. tp is an ewar that all the gang can benefit from and is kept in the midslot on the basis that you cant have 1 ship that does it all... you have to sacrafice something if you want to fit that painter. granted it gimps some setups, such as a tping torp raven... you either have to sacrafice a part of your tank or propulsion mod or point"
5/21/2009,"this topic is intriguing if you take a deeper thought about.let's assume, not only the target painter would have to be high (power) slot, but all modules affecting another ship, no matter if positive or negative effect, would become high slot modules.medium and low slot modules would just be used for effects that affect your own ship and drones.then you have the choice to balance how your offensive capabilities work. e.g. either by using lots of guns (only usefull for yourself), or by a combination of guns and effects that weaken your opponent (usefull for your whole gang).even if this is not exactly what you asked support for, i'll support to see where the discussion will take us."
5/21/2009,"it's a neat idea in theory, but forcing all offensive utilities into the highslot makes a lot of ships entirely useless due to other ship being a better choice for this.it'd make all ships tanks, and take really weird tactics with as to who is doing damage, who is painting, and who is tackling or using other ewar.imo, highs are your damage and primary function (maybe they could add a special high powered ecm modules for ecm t2 ships, but this is hypocritical for me to say, and i don't fully support the idea) mids are your utility and shield, lows are your defensive and hull-effecting."
5/21/2009,no.... the tp is a utility at best... a bloody good one at that.moving it to high slots would disrupt a lot of ships that have issues with tracking but yield a ton of firepower... like a maelstrom for example.you need to remember that not everyone fits ships like you do.bad idea...
5/21/2009,"a) ccp is not skype - no stupid spy functions please :(b) no it won't work. mac spoofing is not very complicated (whatever a ""nic level ban"" is. i don't think such a thing exists for users behind the usual nat firewall.)"
5/21/2009,"isk selling is getting rediculous. we all know it. having the client report the hardware id of your network adapter would instantly make being caught selling isk a very expensive mistake - to the point that it would be far cheaper to sell plex.though if the adapter is sold on, there would need to be a way for legit players to appeal for an unban.another way to do it would be to hand out perminant gags to those caught - that would allow a legit player to play while the unban/ungag request goes through.edit: it's not a spy function. given current network architecture, the hardware id of your adapter isn't avaliable beyond direct network connections on your lan, so it's impossible for anyone to link any particular id to you."
5/21/2009,"i've seen at least three threads requesting different types of hotkey support for various aspects of the game. it needs attention. why don't we just have a macro system like every other mmo? for example:/orbit t1 30k/lock fleetassist/launch drone group1of course their would be limits on how they could be used, i.e. macros cannot call macros. i'm not really sure if there are any cases where you would want to string together multiple commands, but it wouldn't be abusive anyways. i've only been playing about a month (though i probably have like 250 hours of game time in since then) but this just seems obvious to me."
5/21/2009,"i agree with the ability to have more hotkey functions to the game .it would present an avenue for ""macro"" automation users to use to get more reliable input to the client, but it wouldn't allow doing anything you can't do in the ui already.

5/21/2009,"i agree with the op, but also feel it could be overpowered....butffxi solved this problem with a limited number of lines for macros, and no looping, etc.very limited macro-ing... yet very powerful.:thumpsup:"
5/21/2009,"obviously a feature like this would warrant a lot of testing to make sure it's not overpowered... but i like the idea of legitimate non-afk macros to simplify common tasks, especially potentially time-critical ones that require multiple steps to do by hand; this isn't supposed to be a twitch game, but the interface forces it to be sometimes (e.g., selecting, locking a target, and engaging modules; or selecting an escape point and warping away)."
5/21/2009,"as long as they're careful about it, and don't let players do too crazy of things, yes. other games have managed that balancing act just fine, and i'm sure ccp can too. this and a moddable ui are things eve needs desperately - no game this complex can be played anywhere near well enough with the standard ui, even if that standard ui was good, which eve's clearly isn't. supported."

5/21/2009,"oh, certainly a lot of bad custom uis get made, there's no doubt about that. thing is, you don't have to use those - you find the one you want and ignore the hundred you don't. and if one is just better, it's the one that'll pass by word of mouth, and it's the one that the most people will wind up using. and the reason why even a good default ui isn't good enough is that not everyone wants the same thing. there's room for improvements, but even the best defaults won't satisfy everybody, and so i want to see both improvements and room for customization."
5/21/2009,not supported.give them an inch... they will take a mile.there is just too many ways this could go wrong very quickly.i'm not saying this is a bad idea... its a rather good one... i'm not saying its stupid... i'm saying there are a lot of stupid things that could happen as a result of this proposal.

5/21/2009,"threre are some stations with big undock ports, make those and only those be dockable for capsmake caps bigger.. and some of the stations undock is small and cannot even fit bs, so ships spawn in middle of nowhere... the gallente high-sec noob stations."
5/21/2009,agreed. carriers need to be 3-4 times larger.
5/21/2009,"seriously, how hard is it to scale something based on the numbers they /already have/ :|sure, they say they're working on scale for ambulation, but from what i've seen, that only means stations will be made larger and higher res.this scale issue isn't even held by only capitals.all ships have this problem if you look at the ships' lengths."
5/21/2009,yes! lets have cap ships really freaking huge! :-)
5/21/2009,"i agree, not just caps but stations aswell."
5/21/2009,"you're forgetting that eve is a service provided by ccp for monitary gain. we pay ccp a monthly subscription fee in one way or another for this service. ccp are failing to apply q&a adiquitely to their service.as for ccp not being god; that's true. but they built eve, they know exactly how it works and they hold total control over it. that's as close to god as you can get.unless ccp have taken a rush of new substandard code monkeys and haven't noticed their entire q&a department has been drunk for months on end, there isn't much excuse for gamebreaking bugs like this.they even have a test server at their disposal to test for bugs. you have to admit; it takes the f-ing cake and eats it too."
5/21/2009,"hello zostera,to be honest, this isn't the first thread i've seen about this concept. however, the tos makes some of your ideas unfeasable. this part is:the forums are in need of a redesign, but it needs a total overhaul, not a minor one. from what i hear, this is currently being worked on by ccp."
5/21/2009,"the test server is one thing, and running certain patches flawlessly on them is al lwell and good but then when you try to do the same thing on the live server, that might be a little different. two totally different systems, even thought they run the same software, you got to take into account that on the live server, theres the issue of bandwidth, and occupancy on that server. im not saying that theres too many people on one server, actually its kindof cool that there are so many on one server and it works, im just saying that the issue of ""just because it works on the test server, it should work live"",..that concept is bs.its good that they work on things in the test server and i applaud them for it. i agree that ccp has in the past come thru for all of us, and when they do good, no one stands up and sais ""good job"" bu ttheres always a bunch of us, ""i included"" that will stand ther ein there face and ***** at them.however, ccp needs to be a bit more forthright with the issues, ie >""hay gang, theres a problem with the patch, were working on it, well give you more info this evening"", and give us an update!iknow for one, if i took my car in for repairs and the mechanic put me off on an update, i would pull my car out of that shop so fast,.....i run my own business, and i give my customers an update about every hour tha tim working for them, they appricate that, it shows them that you are working for them!,....ccp,...we pay you, you are working for us,...just give us an update, oh and by the way,...ccp, you guys do a great job keeping evep and running,...thank you-=+>xx<+=-"

5/21/2009,"the whole storyline part of the sleepers is that their civilization is long dead, and most of the actual sleepers are just broken malfunctioning hulls, only a few are still active and able to attack. because they are basically sentry drones on steroids, sleepers will never become proactive in such a way. it's fun to think about, but will never happen."
5/21/2009,"these sleepers should clear out the wormhole systems first ,starting with shotting down the stupid poses there. although the idea is good ,but i think storywise the sleepers are the least good candidates for such an attack , pirate factions/drones attacks/campaigns would be a much better choice."
5/21/2009,"maybe the sleepers themselves 'wake up' or 'come out of hiding' or whatever :3you forget that with a fiction universe, with the right storytelling you can make anything work."
5/21/2009,"horrible ideas imo, both of them. there is no need for a mass cloaking ship, simply because if the ship emitting the field is visible but every ship around it isnt visible, then wtf is the point? plus the ships already under the cloaking effects still being able to fire? incredibly overpowered, period.and a ship meant to act purely as primary... can someone say... battleship? tempest for example.horrible ideas, not presented in any kind of coherent manner, not supported."
5/21/2009,been playing ra3 ?been playing as the american faction ?your idea's sound awefully like the allies stelth tanks and assault destroyers!
5/21/2009,honestly the only new thing id accept cloak wise is the ability to cloak a pos.which would be humorous at best.but not this...not supported.
5/21/2009,"i support a revision for wardecs, not necessarily this particular concept. the revision should be made with the intention to make high-sec politics more interesting and possibly giving some leniency to newer players.i think there should be a corp ranking somewhere based on performance in wars (then again isn't this handled by killboards?).i think there should be some corporate/alliance ranking with concord which affects the price for wardeccing, i think this should be negatively affected by repeatedly beating up on newbie corps and/or negative average security ratings of pilots within the corp. (ie, it's cheaper to dec a corp who's naughty (according to concord) and more expensive to dec goody two-shoes).possibly an implementation similar to bounty only on the corp level as well.the idea is to make arbitrary griefing more difficult and merc/ bounty hunter activity more interesting.naturally the people who are looking for fights are going to hang out in low-sec and accrue negative sec, making them easier to wardec.i don't think there should be any absolute protection though, if you're a new corp your best defence is to stay off of the radar. besides, it's a learning experience when you get 'decced."
5/21/2009,"phoenix. i love the alpha capability, even if it is nearly impossible to play out this card in a large battle. revelation is just my second choice. i'm long enough in the game to seen lots of things nerfed/boosted. even if my favorite toy is not the best one, i can enjoy to play with it. they will change it 10 times either.this. two screws look better than one.the drawback is, you get reduced dmg on structures like neuts. it would make a lot of ppl unhappy. so it would have to be an additional ammo type, which is not a good idea too. defenders of a pos dont need to carry both ammo types, so the uphill fight gets worse for the attackers.what about a script for the siege module? to carry 1m<U+FFFD> more does not hurt. it has the nice itchiness to only be swappable when out of siege, which would force us to 'think first' and to plan which one to use in which phase in battle.even with both screws, i'm not sure if that is enough. how does the dmg on moving carriers/dreads/rorquals looks like? it would not be that good if they now get anihilated too easy whith an anti-supercap-weapon. webbing/painting should still be worth the effort there. did you have tried modified numbers in your tables? i think we will have to use the third screw 'supercap signature size/sensor strength' too.the use of scripts would also allow to balance the diffrent dread weapons. give each weapon type it's own script with specific attributes.n.b.: if we turn just one screw at once, we end up with odd side effects, like the last change to citadel speed. take a look at this thread in game development."
5/21/2009,"yes agreed, i wrote it between "" "" just to clarify the mean."
5/21/2009,"i would more prefer the ability to setup watchlist tabs.just as you can broadcast multiple things, you should be able to have a tab that only displays certain broadcasts.and to help limit lag you should be able to turn off loading the fleet members shield/armor/hull status and just have their name listed in the watch list so you dont have to scroll through a laggy fleet menu to find a needle in the haystack.i like some of the idea, but i cant fully support it because of it auto adding something i would prefer to manage manually"
5/21/2009,"one thing i'd like to see in wis (besides all the stuff ccp mentioned already) is better support for machinima (making movies using video game engines). walking in stations has a huge potential to make eve movies (like clear skies and such) a lot more immersive, so i hope ccp can add in some proper camera support."
5/21/2009,"so, you only play half the game?thats too bad......"
5/21/2009,"it will add a considerable new demographic to the game. one, that, quite honestly, i don't think will appreciate the intricacies of eve. my wifes best friend plays sims. that is the closest game i can think of to what walking in stations will be like - and there is a lot one can do in such a game, but it isn't nearly the same type of game that eve is. very different demographics apply to the people that play each - spreadsheets online, or hello kitty with purdy pictures?as such, my personal opinion is that ccp would be better off using the development that has gone into this so far, and working it in such a way as to more compliment the player base that currently exists. making it so that ships can land on planets, or do various npc and produced goods trading, etc, with even more markets. overall, i think the concept needs to be worked on, and once the concept is set, then go for the objective of walking around to be able to meet the objective."
5/21/2009,i can see my character getting drunk in station as i get drunk in real life and gambaling my isk away in some crappy card game against a two day old noob.
5/21/2009,"the isk / reward ratio is way out of whack, but ccp recognizes the issue. look at what they recently did with the rats - you now have rats that are in many ways equal to quite a few 0.0 locations. is it ideal, not even close, but it is an improvement. i think that soon you will see even more improvements and balancing to this sector of space. being a former low sec inhabitant, i recognize the benefits, as well as the pitfalls of low sec, and improving it is something that needs to happen."
5/21/2009,i was hoping for more substance on this issue from you. care to elaborate on actual ideas? simply saying you have lived there and ccp can handle things is not the greatest platform in my humble opinion.edit:i had no idea we were back in c&p.
5/21/2009,"well, part of it is that i don't see any way to effectively make low sec viable for mining on a large scale. many of the belts haven't been miend out in years, and the amounts of minerals (considering the value of trit and veldspare mining) is well worth it to actually mine. however, the population is dense enough (not dense stupid, but dense as in a lot of folks) that most low sec areas you cannot effectively secure from roaming folks, so the cost of a hulk vs the return on time isn't percieved as worth it. even if low sec areas developed clusters of gneiss, crokite, bistot or arc, or even mex, it still will probably not be worth it.one of my ideas is to move moon mins off of moons, and into probable sites similar to grav sites. you can then take your tier 4 mining barge and go into the site and mine out some cadmium, caesium, or even dispro. do this for all of eve. also, make it so that it is relatively easy to ninja mine in low sec. 20-30 min worth of mining and the site is played out. empire, you don't get any of these sites, and in 0.0, you get them, but they are larger - along the lines of 2-6 hours to effectively mine out. this would keep the relative value of the space coherent, allow for folks to do their thing, while still working to encourage them to move out of empire space. it also solves what i view as the largest problem in eve right now; the static, massive, passive income sources that only a few have a possibility to have.this is just one of my ideas. i have several. i also know that ccp is working on the issues, as they see and recognize them."
5/21/2009,"i'm in favor of more regions. it sure would set the population on its ear if there were more 0.0 regions that would kick off a frantic land grab. i'd add four more, two in the north and two in the south."
5/21/2009,"a frantic land grab that would set the players on their ears? obviously expansion of 0.0 space would see a frantic land grab by 0.0 players. the majority of players inhabit the hisec regions....tbh, we don't need more space. there are vast tracts of space under-utilised as it is. perhaps no minerals in high sec indicate that its time to go a little further afield to mine! besides, we just got an expansion of space...check out the wormhole near you!!!xavier"
5/21/2009,"crowded? in some ways definitely. the high sec ore belts are a good example. the question is though, is it that the distribution of players across high sec, low sec and 0.0 the real issue. there are a lot of places in eve that never see any players.i think ccp needs to see that for a lot of players the ability to log on and find ""the thing you like to do"" easily is getting hard for a sizable part of the player base.issler"
5/21/2009,"more people = better eve experience, generally.the issue isn't the number of people online (except as far as the servers can handle, but that is hardware that ccp can add to as needed), the issue is population distribution. a better balance of resources, including the removal of the static resources now in the game (promo & dispro moons in particular) by changing them to be non-static, along with a balancing of risk & reward in space, should help to alleviate a large part of the congestion. however, the large part of the eve population that will not even consider low sec or 0.0 because of the potential ""harm"" they may get.... well, there is only so much incentive you can give people. it is an issue, though, that needs to be worked on, and constantly addressed, not just looked at once and called ""done""."
5/21/2009,"static resources?in a realistic universe (well, a realistic virtual universe) there are some incredibly rare elements and compounds. it just happens that in eve they are the very rare moon minerals. that's the sort of realism that i like, as do many other players.those resources can hardly be described as static (in terms of the products they produce), as alchemy can produce the products also. it might not be the cheapest option, but it's probably cheaper than taking and then defending a dysprosium moon :)oh, and it'd also be a mistake to think that high prices for the rarer minerals is solely down to their scarcity. alliances can hold back the minerals and drive prices upwards...there are no doubt some vast stores about. market traders can also do the same...the end result of course is slightly higher prices for modules and ships etc. given that the game goes on pretty much as usual gives me the impressionthat it's not such a big deal as some make it out to be!"
5/21/2009,"static resources in an mmo environment are one of the most unbalancing game mechanics around. it is realistic? no, but neither are the mechanics in the game for flying around in space. it is just that unlike how the ships fly around, this mechanic isn't balances, fair, or fun for 99.99999% of the player base.it allows passive, huge amounts of wealth for only a select few. you need the wealth to keep the wealth, as you can only keep it if you have the resources to defend it, and you can only get those resources by having it. so, ya, it is a broken mechanic. if the people that had it had to actually stay at it, maintain it, keep it up, it might be different. but, that is not the case. nice derail, btw. ;)"
5/21/2009,"sorry, i though you meant whole numbers rather than actual digits. in this case, i obviously don't get what you're trying to ask as it doesn't seem to make any sense."
5/21/2009,"hi oz,will you continue to push for resolution for this issue?s&i interface improvementsthx"
5/21/2009,"most definitely, along with any other ways of simplifying what is an unnecessarily complex and time consuming ui."
5/21/2009,"i have used the ball gag that you gave me years ago, to force my minions to vote for you. for the sake of a good laugh, here is that image once again, ofc them damm ebil mods (love ya mitnal) will purge it soon enough :(please visit your user settings to re-enable images."
5/21/2009,"sorry, i will try to explain it better. this is an attempt to make the eve market system more like a real-life exchange trading system where there are predefined minimum bid increments. for example, if you wish to buy a crude oil futures contract, you will either have to outbid the existing buyers by at least $10 per contract or wait for all their buy orders to be filled before yours will be filled.since the eve market trades everything from minerals at 4 isk per unit to ships up to a billion isk or more, the problem is how to implement such a minimum bid increment. my proposal is probably the simplest implementation. when entering the price for a buy or sell order, you will be restricted to the number of significant digits you can enter. you will still be free to add as many zeros as you wish or place the decimal point where you want (except that you still can't have any increment smaller than 0.01 isk.)for example, valid prices for a raven would be 85.65 million, 85.66 million, 85.67 million, etc. under a 4 significant digit restriction. what happens when you enter an invalid price would be up to the developers, but they could either round it or truncate it or reject it altogether. i personally feel a 3 significant digit restriction would be feasible but probably hard to sell to most players, so a 4 digit implementation seems like the most painless way to get this in place."
5/21/2009,"i guess my answer to that is why would you want to limit the market? i understand the frustration of .01isk undercutting, but this type of limitation would imho do more harm than good. the eve market isn't a trade exchange, it's like walking into a local market and haggling with the vendors. one of eve's best features is it's open market - unless i can get some very very good arguments as to how such a system would improve the market, i can't say i would vote for it, let alone raise or champion it."
5/21/2009,"as a matter of fact, the eve market is a trade exchange and it isn't like your local market. the market system is set up to automatically execute trades with the ""best"" matching order which is what makes it an exchange. the contract system is more like the local market because you choose which seller you want to deal with.[although i freely admit that for most players not trading in hubs this is a non-issue. when you buy a something you look at both the price and how far you have to go to pick it up. when you sell stuff, you either put it on the market where it is or go take it to fill a buy order somewhere. it only matters when you have multiple buy or sell orders in the same station. so my proposal will not help the casual trader, but it won't hurt them either.]"

5/21/2009,"for those interested in heartstone's views on faction warfare, he recently post to our thread in the gunship forums: 3rd csm election: candidates for faction warfare"
5/21/2009,"doubtful they will acknowledge this publicly, but one assumes there will be many ""off the record"" discussions between erik and ankh if he is elected.i find myself torn. like most folks, i am not getting a strong sense that fw will be a strong focus of erik's term and the only other candidate i've considered was heartstone. but how can i vote for anyone who doesn't - you know - actually participate in fw at all?in the end, it doesn't look like much to choose from this time around (goumindong, why didn't you run again?). i like ankh's feistiness, it was one of the reasons i ended up voting for her in the past (i don't know why this girl doesn't pvp, she's got the scrappy nature for it!). ankh did such a good job and was dogged in getting things accomplished through the csm (never had much opinion of anyone else on these councils doing very much hard work, tbh). perhaps in the end that will be reason enough to vote for erik."
5/21/2009,"this is one of the reasons for me and bm's hostility. also, he comes and spams our militia chat with his alt, urging people to vote. that sort of gets under my skin. ankh also only participated in fw to exploit bugs in the system. why would it be so hard to program npcs to shoot all those not in friendly militia. hell, npc pirates happily throw their frigates against any sized ships.with erik coming from this same camp, i cannot seriously consider voting him. i think none of the csm candidates would move fw to direction i'd find good so i will cast the abstain vote.damar rocarionbrigadier general"
5/21/2009,"i'm more in favor of supporting and developing features that would be interesting to new players; goals to work for. for example, rebuilding the pos system, remarketing that as a selling point for eve- ""build your own starbase in remote corners of space! mine moons for precious construction materials! defend your property from interlopers! ...profit!""something to that effect. additions that will draw attention to the game, but not necessarily reducing the learning curve."
5/21/2009,"how do you feel about limiting the price increment on market orders, such as limiting all buy and sell orders to 3 or 4 significant digits? this would force traders to offer a significantly better price instead of just beating the old price by 0.01 isk."
5/21/2009,you've got my vote its rare that i run across someone sharing my odd views.but you share many of them good luck garthran.
5/21/2009,"if i understand your example correctly, you're saying make it so minimum increments are 100 or 1000 isk, instead of 0.01. if this is the case, i'd have to say i disagree. what would be the purpose from a roleplay standpoint? what about all those items that aren't worth 100 or 1000 isk per item, like single units of tritanium? what about ammunition?it just occurred to me that 3 or 4 significant digits in the current system might also be 1 or 10 isk. but then the difference is not significant enough. 10 isk changes would simply become the new 0.01 isk changes.i don't think that we need to punish the traders by restricting their abilities to compete."
5/21/2009,andy3021- thanks for your support!
5/21/2009,"no, what i mean is that when you enter the price in a market buy or sell order, only the first 3 or 4 digits of the number can be non-zero. thus the valid prices of battleships under a 4 significant digit restriction could be 85.61 million, 85.62 million, 85.63 million, etc. in other words, you couldn't sell your raven for 85,619,999.99 isk. any price under 100 isk would not be effected by a 4 digit restriction because they already have only 4 significant digits or less.i hope this clarifies it for you."
5/21/2009,"that does aid in clarifying for me, thank you. i understand much better what you mean now.it does sound like a great idea, in theory. but i just don't think its a process that would have place in eve. i may be wrong. this is just my opinion. but i'm not sure that pricing restrictions of that kind have a place in the eve market. the market will still deviate at the minimum level, and to most of eve, 10,000 isk is no more significant than 0.01 isk when buying a battleship."
5/21/2009,"if you went to an auction and bid $10 on an item and then somebody else bid $10 and then the auctioneer said ""sold to the last guy that bid $10"" you would think something was wrong wouldn't you? the two principles of any auction system are ""sold to the highest bidder"" and ""first come first served."" the point is that minimum bid increments are established to prevent someone from defeating the first-come principle by making a bid that is not significantly higher than an existing bid. whether or not we agree that 10,000 or 100,000 isk is significant when buying a battleship, clearly 0.01 isk is not significant.and make no mistake about it, the market system is just a variant of an auction system where the buyers make their bids known publicly and the seller comes along later to sell to the highest bidder.i realize this doesn't matter to most players. it only matters when there are multiple buyers and sellers in the same station so it is pretty much limited to traders in market hubs. and maybe a large number of those players like the 0.01 isk price wars because judging by their actions you could make that case.but i spend about 90% of my time in this stupid game dealing with the market and it just seems to me that it is so obviously broken. i have no expectation that ccp is ever going to fix this (and judging by icelanders' knowledge of financial markets i truly have no hope) but i've got two votes for csm and i would like to give them to someone with half a brain who can listen to and understand the issues that other players have to deal with. so good luck to you."
5/21/2009,"there is a minimum bid increment system already in place for auction contracts.what i'm basically reading is that you want people who are undercutting you on sales/outpricing you on buys to take more of a hit to their profits than they currently are. while understandable, i don't think that requires a game mechanic change. i think if playing the market is what you really have a passion for, there are workarounds. i know traders who update their orders 15, 20 times a day. if you want to play the competitive game in market hubs, that's the way you have to play it. changing the amount of money you have to alter your orders by into a big round number isn't going to change that. its just going to make people take more of a loss when they continue to play the 0.01 game as the 10,000 game."
5/21/2009,"15 to 20 times a day seems low to me and i don't want to play the market ""game"" i just want to sell my stuff so i can go back to playing the game of eve. ;-)look, i don't want to beat a dead horse, but if ccp designed the market so that players would sit in station and play 0.01 isk wars all day that would be fine. but if they intended the market to be a place where pilots could *efficiently* sell their stuff, they screwed up.if something is broken with the pew-pew part of the game it will get fixed, improved, and tinkered with endlessly. the devs don't really care that much about the boring parts of the game, so i turned to you as a self-labeled care-bear candidate to make my case."
5/21/2009,"i spend much of my time running missions and wormholes, and make most of my money reselling the loot that i gain from those activites. i don't really have difficulty with doing that. i find the market ui itself to be occasionally frustrating, and if you can point out specific issues you're having, i'd be happy to listen to your ideas for improving them. however, i think minimum price incrementing is going to anger many more people than its going to please."

5/21/2009,issue two i support fully as neutral remote repping is a pain in the rear end and a blight on high sec/low sec pvp. in 0.0 ofc it doesn't matter as much away from stations. issue one i am not so sure about. i can't really see a problem with your proposal beyond why would you get the rights to the loot but on the other hand i can't see many drawbacks from changing it without actually spending any time looking at the subject in question in detail. i would be loathe to support something that i haven't had time to look at the implications of. vote for me. don't vote for me. whichever you think but please vote for someone. let's have a good turnout this time
5/21/2009,"i agree with your concern and would support a change to the current system along the ways you suggested. players shouldn't continue to be able to hide behind being in an npc corp when they're looting another player's kill. agreed, in empire and lowsec an aggression tag needs to be tagged to those remote repping. in 0.0 space i don't see it as being a huge issue since it is either an npc station or they are friendly to the entity that controls the outpost. when it comes to stargates in 0.0 i'm pretty neutral on whether it should give aggression or not since you can just catch the guy on the other side. i believe i have your interests at heart, being that i am in a pvp alliance and i am familiar with piracy in empire as well. i want to encourage more players to venture into lowsec territories (via more incentives) which will in turn give the pirates more targets to play with."
5/21/2009,"i'd like to think i'd do a pretty good job of representing you. i spent several months doing the empire wardec thing back in the day, and am certainly interested in ideas on how to make the wardec system suck less - i don't have anything that can really be put onto paper, unfortunately, but if i see a workable idea i'll certainly jump on it. regarding your two ideas, i'm sort of torn on the first - i think it's a good idea, but i'm not entirely sure. maybe tying this into a wardec improvement would work, letting you have rights to kills you made legally, but not giving any rights to suicide gankers. that said, i'm totally in favour of the second. if you want to be in the fight, you should have to wait 30 seconds to dock/jump just like everyone else. if you think i'm your guy, i would certainly appreciate your vote. if you have any other questions, check out my site or drop me a line in-game."
5/21/2009,"i too, want your precious vote.i wholeheartedly agree.don't agree so much with this one if i read your suggestion correctly."
5/21/2009,"domi, domi!i want a domi!"

5/21/2009,"scary, but i agree with most people here. arties need some help, but it still must be done relative to other long range guns in the game."
5/21/2009,"bio/platformfirst and foremost, i am a pvper. i dont mine, i dont rat, i dont plex, and i dont build. my only occupation is 0.0 combat, both small gang and pos seizing. i am under the impression that eve was designed to be a combat environment with a secondary emphasis on everything else.so you seem to loath half the game?how could you possibly be a viable candidate if you could only represent 50% of the players and not all of them?"

5/21/2009,i understand your approach and support it. i agree with most of the items on your website and i like how you have presented it and i am supporting you for this csm.and i urge other voters to visit the website and the blog i mentioned above to see what they are voting for. good luck for you iluixxi and all the other candidates.
5/21/2009,"to be honest, i don't think retracted is the right word. you asked for my stance on the subject, and i gave it to you, honestly. i didn't pander to what i knew you wanted to hear, i told you my opinion.this is indicative of who i am and how i will behave in the csm. i will stand by issues i feel are important, i will listen to arguments and consider all sides of a discussion, and i will give my honest opinion. i am not a tool to represent any specific power bloc or demographic, and i am not out to disrupt the purpose of the csm by saying that one particular issue should be considered to be more important than all others."
5/21/2009,"by the way, thanks for this personal judgment. i would invite you to ask me questions that are important to you, or if you cannot think of pertinent questions i have not already answered, to perhaps hold your tongue.if you are so completely dissatisfied with the state of the csm, let me join others in suggesting that you run for yourself."
5/21/2009,"personally i would love to run for csm, finally giving new players a voice.unfortunately (well i consider it fortunate) i'm enlisted in the us military and i doubt they'd look kindly on going awol to attend a video game conference.anyways, i'm a little confused by your words:i have nothing to add to this.your words speak volumes about your character and intent. what that is exactly i am unsure."
5/21/2009,"if you'll read carefully, i think you'll find that none of those statements, even taken out of context as you have presented them here, are directly contradictory, though you seem happy to imagine that they are. however, this is the last i'll say on the matter, since you seem immediately ready to criticize but less forthcoming with constructive suggestions. this indicates to me that you will find fault, regardless of my response, and trying to convince you of anything else will be a waste of my time.fly safe."
5/21/2009,i can't vote either.that is: i click the button but nothing happens.i want to vote!1 million isk for the first person who gives me the right way to vote.abulurd bonifaceme meceo
5/21/2009,"being a rather new player i found this a rather simple process.1)eliminate those that didn't have a link from the eve csm page and you can easily take out half the candidates.2)eliminate candidates didn't have a page dedicated to what their positions were, that would be those with social networking sites as their page, etc. i don't want to wade through all that crap just to figure out what you have to say.3)eliminate the candidates with annoying webpages, sorry erik, going to your website only to have my ears assaulted by an obnoxious video didn't win me over.4)eliminate those who claim they don't have any specific things they want to see fixed. seriously if you don't have a position on something, hell anything, what is supposed to make me think you would be able to get anything done?5)eliminate any idiot who mentions the words ""transparency"" and ""accountability""that pretty much narrows down the list quite sufficiently. knock off the rest that personal preference gets rid of and it makes the process pretty simple.i personally was interested in a candidate that had more of the industry side as their focus, which very few even mentioned.so how did you all do it?"
5/21/2009,"following this criteria, none of the csm candidates qualify. and as you will see for a third time, voter turnout will be at an all time low. what was the voter turnout percentage last election? eight percent? how much of that eight percent was voter abstaining?well i'm hoping ccp will get the hint that the csm elections are fundamentally a popularity contest. the prize being a free trip to iceland and a gold csm logo attached to their forum name.i have high hopes for the csm process, but i also have high expectations. expectations that the csm candidates have, for the third time, fallen short."
5/21/2009,"you want to know how i picked? well i wanted to vote for a goon, so i looked at the various goons and picked the one with the best website and policies that were similar to my interests. small gang warfare in particular. for my alt i think i might pick the mm candidate.popularity contest seems about right. however i would vote for the people who are more knowledgeable about the game, not forum ho's and douche bags."
5/21/2009,"while i have not been as active ont he forums as i should be, i don't know what else i can add that my other fellow candidates have already said, but i will add my 2 cents1. new toys.while t2 salvage is currently only obtained from destroying t2 ships it is sound to say that would probably never change. salvage can only be created from destroying a ship, and i dont forsee how/why ccp would want to change that. the t2 rig market is already highly priced due to low supply and high demand2. cheaper toys. as was introduced to combat the moon mining monopoly, alchemy which was already been mentioned was put in place to be an alternative to the hard to find moon minerals. aside from ccp reseeding newer moons with more high end minerals there isn't much more that can be done. with reseeding, there would be morewars ad fightingover them, which would in turn drive up ship prices3. crowded mission hubswhile this is a pain, one possible solution is to move some more agents to ,lower sec space, and maybe increase the reqard to balance the risk of being in low sec. i for one would like to see something more along this line, even though i am mostly a carebear with my current activiites in evei hope some of my answers help in your descision"

5/22/2009,"playing the mature card now are we? :)ok, let's see how long it lasts before your alliance degenerates it into a smack 'u n00b u quit!1!'. and explain to me why the current mechanic is 'broken'. if you agressed or attack someone why would that automatically make you the owner of their possesion? just because you attack someone and managed to kill them doesn't mean you somehow legally own their stuff. eve isn't a prize-fighting game like counterstrike. eve is more real in the sense that you can agress and you can steal from someone else. loot isn't handed down to you because you dueled an opponent and won the tournament.the possessions still belong to the victim until you steal them. but you have to steal it first. it's more realistic and it's what makes eve so special and different from other mmos. it's a cruel world even for the cruelest of the cruelest."
5/22/2009,"i also would like to add that eve is a vicious cycle where the predators also become prey. and it's more fun that way. you could be the baddest killhog out there, but then a low-down dirty scoundrel comes along and dogs you just like you dogged your prey. it's what eve is all about. sure you'll get mad when you get dogged. it's natural. and the scoundrel will laugh at you just as you laughed at your prey. and in the end no one likes to be dogged. but it's what eve is all about :).when you blob some poor guy at a gate or station what do you tell him? ""you should have friends to help you"", right? well, should it not work for you as well? you should have friends there with you ready to steal the victim's loot. not everyone in your gank squad need to put out dps. you could have someone be the dedicated looter. in eve you need to think of all sides of the angle and be prepared to be attacked in your weakest side.and it's not like the loot stealer is getting away scott free. he is being flagged to the victim who now can kill him. exactly how it should be. i know it p**ses you off. but hey, what can i tell ya. you like to laugh and poke fun of the carebear you just ganked. i like to laugh and poke fun of you by stealing what you thought was your loot :). this, my friend, is what eve is all about."
5/22/2009,"no, the prize is up for grabs to anyone who can grab it. nobody is saying that this shouldn't be the case. and if anyone does, than they're ******ed. what people are saying here is that they'd like some way to legally (per concord) attempt to discourage the vulture from the picking scraps. is it reasonable that being a pvp loot thief has absolutely 0 risk and great rewards?that's a very valid point until you see that now i have to bring an extra guy along with my gang (putting another ship at risk for the vague possibility of him being able to serve his purpose in the gang), or sacrifice an existing part of my gangs dps/ewar/logistic etc in order to have him play space vaccuum (again putting someone in harm's way for the vague possibility of having him serve his purpose). do you really expect that to become a valid profession in eve? do you really believe that this is a fair balance of risk and reward for the hunters, or the hunted?edit:i would agree with you on this, except that you can not truthfully say that it is balanced game play. you need to be put at risk if you're going to pull from the wrecks of others in the scenario we're discussing. and no, being flagged to the victim doesn't always matter. besides, the guy just lost his ship.loot stealing is really funny, i agree with you. it's just broken."
5/22/2009,"what you say here doesn't make much sense. you admit that the loot should be up for grabs but then you add that you'd like to discourage other players from picking it. you can't have it both ways because you're not the owner of the loot until you steal it. but you must steal it first. now if what you'd like is for any loot stealer (including the aggressor) to be blinky to everyone else including bi-standers this makes a little more sense. and then the aggressor is opening up himself to becoming a target himself for stealing loot, which is a whole separate offense and rightfully so. this i could agree with.you invalidate your point as soon as you lock yourself with the mentality that everyone in your gang needs to physically engage in dps/ewar/etc. you're opening yourself up to loot thieves. when you pick up the loot that makes you a loot thief and you don't blink to anyone else but the owner of the wreck. so why would a bistander blink red to you if you haven't picked up the loot yourself? like i said, i think it's better if any loot thief picks up the loot he can be aggressed by anyone.but there is risk to the loot stealer. he is being flagged to the rightful owner and his corp members. if the victim chooses to do so he and his corp members can hunt down the loot thief and engage him. now i'd be willing to bet the victim would probably welcome loot stealers to steal his loot just to not give you the pleasure of taking it but that's a whole different story now :p. and it is a valid mechanic. just because you don't like it doesn't mean it isn't fair.you have to look at combat and stealing as two separate actions. you can pvp someone either through a war, or whatever. and then you can also choose to steal their wreck, a totally separate action which will cause you to agress the true owner of the wreck."
5/22/2009,@ matrix skye:simple risk -vs- reward ... as it stands the looter has no risk in looting the ship and reaps all rewards .... what exactly is so hard for you to understand ?or are you bumping my topic with your flawed arguments out of the kindness of your 
5/22/2009,"there is risk to the looter.what's so hard for you to understand about this?the looter is being flagged to the owner of the wreck as it should be. it p***es you off that someone else is beating you to stealing the loot and therefore being flagged to the owner, but that is not a reason to ask ccp to change the mechanics in your favor. the system is fair as it is now."
5/22/2009,lets see ... if you consider a pod a risk ... you should be playing hello kitty online ... pleanty of time to loot and be on your merry way because the original owner still has to get to a station ... dock up ... wait to jump in a ship ... undock and get back to the wreck.hmmmmm ... sounds like a huge risk to the looter ...
5/22/2009,"dont be idiotic, mr. jackhammer. if the victim happens to have a replacement ship in the system, or friends nearby, as you yourself admit he should have, then he is a threat.now if the victim chooses not to persue that is a call for him to make, not you.now if your argument is that the victim doesn't have friends/corp or doesn't have pvp ships and that the thief is just taking advantage of the situation (the fact that the victim is careless/weak/nonpvper), please explain to me how you yourself aren't taking advantage of that very same situation by attacking the victim."

5/22/2009,"we all agree with the point you're making already. we've been agreeing with it. the problem is that you're not arguing the point you think you are by posting this. what the supporters of this proposal are saying is that we want to have a stronger ability to balance the scales between risk and reward for people who act as vultures. i want you to still be able to loot ""my"" wreck from my kill. i think that it's a fine profession, in fact, if people want to do that. i just want to be able to point some revenge at you if you do. this isn't game breaking, there is precedence for this in the game's history that wasn't game breaking, this is a fair request.thanks for the chat on this, thanks for the trolling, and it's privaqueers, not privatears."
5/22/2009,"you are going round and round in circles. i'll point out your flaw once again:privatears attack a target, you gank it and then some. fair enough.target could have had friends, corpies, bigger ship, etc. in the end it's the victim's fault for not defending back. with me so far? it's no excuse that he was alone or that he's just a miner. in your opinion the risk, although practically non-existent, is there. agree? that is the privatears' defense, so you should agree with this so far.now, a ""vulture"" comes along and also takes advantage of the victim's inability to come back and protect its loot. and your take on it is that there is no risk? there is the same exact risk that your gank squad took, no more no less.it's just you want to be able to attack the vulture because you feel the defenseless target that you yourself attacked isn't able to defend itself. if that's the case, then might as well make it so that even if you're at war if you attack anyone in high sec, at war or not, you become flashy to everyone, meaning global timer for you. but of course you wouldn't agree with this because what you really want is just what benefits you and you alone."

5/22/2009,"they need there storage capacity to be more then doubled, battery consumes more powergreed and cpu then a capacitor recharger, and yet is 2 times less effective. medium and small capacitor batteries are at least moderately useful in small number of setup. large capacitor battery, when installed on myrmidon battlecruiser, gives the same effect as a t2 capacitor rehcarger. on dominix battleship, as it's capacitor is twice the sise on myrmidon, the battery is twice less effective then cap recharger. on tier 2 and 3 battleships it gets worse. there isn't a single worthfull battleship setup that uses batteries. that needs to be fixed. they consume allot of ship's resources and are nearly useless. the batteries should be useful together with capacitor rechargers to increase capacitor's recharge rate, as both increasing capacitor capacity, and increasing it's recharge rate increate overall power output. as you stack batteries they will become less useful, but would be used coupled with capacitor recharges to give capacitor recharge rate slightly above that achievable with capacitor recharges only, but at expense of grate cpu and powergreed consumption. at the moment that works only with cruisers. 750 of capacitor capacity (t2 battery) is only a 12.5% capacitor increase for dominix, that's a tier one battleship, making a t2 battery less useful then a t1 capacitor recharger, with recharger consuming no powergreed and tiny amount of cpu.the situation gets worse as we move on to hyperion. tier 3 battleships have 50% larger capacitor capacity (roughly) then tier 1 battleships, making capacitor batteries 33% less useful, which put's them below 10% mark. personally to me this system does not make sense and i believe it should be fixed."
5/22/2009,so... batteries suck...try not using them?
5/22/2009,yes they dont make sense for battleships or battle cruisers. i agree on some extra cap in those large batteries.
5/22/2009,"batteries should give much more capacitor capacity, but at the same time reduce recharge. the reason for that is that the batteries should serve as stability buffer during capacitor warfare. if your setup is not stable without the battery, it should not become stable with it, but it should hold out longer and withstand cap-warfare better. a recharge reduction would suffice, which more or less cancels out the recharge bonus due to the increase total capacity."
5/22/2009,"this would actually make some sense. i've seen a few hac setups that us large batteries, just for pure duration, but they should be way more usable than that."
5/22/2009,"'oversized' batteries in logistics ships are relatively common (ever tried to run a couple medium remote hull repairers on a cruiser sized hull? omgwtfbbqpwn capacitor batman)but you are right, putting a large battery on a battleship or battlecruiser is almost useless. how about an xl battery instead? but don't change the current mechanic of how a battery works please. a whole bunch of support cruiser stuff will stop working if this happens. (and, we likes us our remote hull repairers, yes we do)"
5/22/2009,"xlarge? sounds good to me, we got x-large shield boosters, why not batteries?that is not correct, they do not reduce recharge rate, the increase capacity. yes, it is much on crosuers, on bttleships it is below 12% which is nothing.they add durability and increase cap recharge rate, and current mecanic is fine and makes perfect sence, how? let me explain.you have 4000 capacitor recharging in 100 seconds (numbers are just to illustrate), that gives you recharge rate of 40 gj per second. now you add in battery with capachity of 2000, you capacitor becomes 6000, but still rehcarges in 100 seconds, so not you get 60gj per second. so it works both ways."
5/22/2009,"jin is merely suggesting that cap batteries should not actually give you more cap/sec as per the current mechanic..but should instead nerf your recharge rate so you are charging just as fast as you used to in relative gj/sec, but you just have more cap to work with. which i suppose would work in certain pvp situations. mind you, a cap booster is much more likely to be much more useful in such situations in the first place.so, supported, but please don't nerf the recharge rate with it."
5/22/2009,1st: we are not talking only from pvp perspective2nd: why should the cap be nerfed
5/22/2009,now that's an idea that can be supported.
5/22/2009,"which gives better income for macrominers, which in my opinion is not in any way the purpose of ccp.in case the belts get buffed, then yes, you're rite. but then again, it's good for the macrominers again. hisec belts are usually wiped clean even nowadays, so if no boost to them, then it results in serious shortage in minerals. 0.0 mining is not for the market, since low-end minerals are sold in such a quantity that it is not really worth hauling them to empire.i would love to see statistics about this, because without numbers it's hard to tell whether you're right or wrong (imo the later). i know it's just a weird guess, but i think all ferrogel reaching the market due to the pos exploit covers only a few days of hisec trit market. (real life analogy: a few stolen, thus relatively cheap rolls-royces wouldn't ruin the market of volkswagen for example). yes, for the few pos exploit users it gave (relatively) insane riches, but in the whole market it was not that insane, was just 1% or less relative to whole market potential. (just another weird guess)if you (all) look at the statistics in post #11 (ofcourse i don't know whether they are right) pyer, mexa and iso market would definately collapse, while trit and mega would suffer a long-term inflation (imo hyper one).if anyone has (gm or dev maybe?) exact numbers against (or along) my weird guesses, i think they'd be highly welcome!"
5/22/2009,"you wanna mine it? i don't. mining @$*<U+FFFD>%*! besides, you're forgetting about all those poor inventors that need those t1's to get better chances of success. the problem right now isn't that t1 is priced too low, but that minerals are priced too high to make t1 production possible.increasing the price of t1 will also raise the price of t2 (as you need those to make the t2), which is the last thing we need right now."
5/22/2009,"the biggest problem with t1 production is the price of trit, imo. but today's situation is quite close to a perfectly free and competitive market balancing itself (except the small shortage in trit)..."
5/22/2009,"all the above in a drake, no less cala trinchetto!so you are making 43.478.261,87 hour for 23 hours day. you are a robot? no eating, no sleeping, no bathroom?you have 20 agents at your disposal so you can get only the juiciest mission and refuse all the rest?never get a unwanted mission?if you want to tell tall stories, try to make them a bit credible.numbers and screenshot, please.what was your high quantity of high ends? 1.000? 2.000?on the average you get around 330 units of zydrine and 240 of megacyte for hour of mission running. a hulk mining gneiss will get at least 7.000 zydrine/hour and mining spoduman almost 6000 megacyte hour. and we are speaking of crap 0.0 ores, not the good one. so you think really that someone will belive your story?"
5/22/2009,"the numbers lavista gave are a 1 day snapshot of refining activity.it come from here so it is ""official"". it is debatable as in the ""loot"" voice is included the modules used for mineral compression and the ships brought from market under mineral price (notice that in the loot part there is morphite, something that is in not present in t1 modules), but it has a value, even if a lot of information are missing (mineral compression modules, ship reprocessing, number of players involved, ecc.). i suppose that the people saying ""0.0 is full of ore"" will be the first in the line for mining veldspar in 0.0, right?"
5/22/2009,no. this is the part where you have to make decisions about the equipment you bring to the fight.
5/22/2009,"of course it would be very important to heavily restrict what can and can't be done, but you must understand that we are talking about a few commands. add a few restrictions, and there isn't really any room for abuse, simply convenience. -macros cannot call macros-macros cannot wait/delay-macros are very limited in scope & length-macros cannot target based on name alone, i.e. no ""/lock veldspar /activate hi[1-3]""can anyone even think of something that would be abusive given those rules (and a reasonable set of commands)?what i really want for eve is for gameplay to feel smoother, and i think this would be a good step in that direction."
5/22/2009,i support this idea.are ccp employees simply turning into a bunch of lazy americans? i might as well go play world of warcraft at this rate. :)/signed and /bumped.
5/22/2009,"as someone with some insight into the development and maintainance of software, i agree that the nature and complexity of bugs, such as the ones specifically being discussed in the op, are not easily gauged from the outside and thus an immediate fix being forthcoming expediently in every case is too much to hope for. however another thing entirely is how these bugs made it through testing. i believe part of the reason such severe bugs have made it to tranquility lately is due to the accelerated schedule ccp announced at last fanfest - going from two exansions to three per year. less time developing = less time testing. most of us will probably agree that more content is not worth the game breaking every few months, but to be fair to ccp these are realities in software development and not introducing more content is comparable to suicide for mmos. personally, i agree that the current state of eve is not good enough, but i hope that this is indeed just ""growing pains"" from ccp adapting to a new work schedule. i also agree the communication about these issues should be a little better, however i believe ccp is already pretty good at communicating with the playerbase and that we should be thankful for that. a lot of developers would much rather release a statement than send an actual employee into the raging waters of the forums."
5/22/2009,"i cannot support what all the people said in that topic, its a bit to over the top at times, but i do agree that a bit more communication about this is needed. its a game breaking bug, and the reply of ""we cant reproduce it"" whas just stupid.this still gets a thumbs up becuase communication towards the player on a bug of this size is lacking."
5/22/2009,quality control
5/22/2009,communication is important to the game
5/22/2009,"it is often said that eve is a game still in beta, that can be seen as a bad thing, or an exciting opportunity.without good ccp player communication it is bad, because the ""joint development"" isn't effective.if however the communication is good, and this proposal is an attempt to suggest ways to do that, then the beta aspect becomes an exciting opportunity for all concerned. how many other mmo's offer players a chance to take part in the growth of their hobby, offer a chance to get their idea into game? how many games development teams have thousands of contributors?a little bit of work on this and eve can only become better."
5/22/2009,:'( you hurt my feelings.can we haz fix nao? or is the backend of eve so spaghettified that the devs can't make heads or tails of it? if the spaghettification is indeed strong with eve it would explain a lot.
5/22/2009,"that does not mean you can pull ccp around by their collective <reproductive organs> ....they know there is a problem, they just figured out whatheheck happened, they are fixing itwhining is not gonna make it happen faster.complaining that ""we pay their salery so wahhhhh"" is gonna make them knock off for the day to go raise a few at thepub....."
5/22/2009,"nice idea, i wsupprto it"
5/22/2009,"ok, i dont want to re-write the whole thing, but this idea started here:tell me again why....now, obviously this will take away from the ""low-sec"" crowd, so expect plenty of whines.but i feel it balances out the game a bit more. tell me what you think."
5/22/2009,"why bother with requiring a bounty at all, why not declare all players with a negative security status as fair game anywhere in empire space. there is little point on requiring people to place a 1 isk bounty just so that they can create more high sec targets."
5/22/2009,i think it would be better if ccp made 2 new ships in every t1 ship class. that way there is more veriation of slot layouts and setups.not so much the layout. but new ships that the average pilot can afford and fly!
5/22/2009,"i thought the first one sounded more like an arbiter out of starcraft, but then i've never played ra3. that said, no. there's a good reason cloaking doesn't work that way, and making people shoot at a ship that they don't even have targeted is a good way to **** them off, not make fleet battles more interesting. add that into the fact that you imply fleetmates would be able to rr while cloaked(in triage, no less, because they don't have to defend themselves from a fleet's firepower), and you have yourself something that looks a lot like an invincible death blob, which i'm not so much a fan of. the second sounds rather similar in effect. rr is too powerful and too omnipresent to remove an attacking fleet's options on where to point its dps."
5/22/2009,"the arbiter from starcraft jumped to my mind for the first one, too.both of these ideas rely on the idea that a ship can survive being primaried in a fleet battle. no matter how high your resistances, no matter how good your tank, if you are flying a non-capital ship in a fleet battle and are primaried, you are going to lose your ship very, very quickly. the proposed ships' value stems from their persistent presence on the battlefield - which is unrealistic, because in both cases they will be the enemy's very first primary target."
5/22/2009,"actually, it's very difficult. i welcome you to try it and to get anything other than random kills. the amount of effort it takes to get even a single non-random kill in highsec warfare is substantially more than the amount of effort it takes to avoid being killed. 90% of the difficulty of the kill occurs before the warp disruptor ever gets activated."
5/22/2009,"you said it well and i couldn't agree more. sandbox (open) game. sandbox (open) rules. don't like them, negotiate with the opposing side. most are reasonable. if they're not reasonable, get mercenaries, etc. the system works as it is. the way some of these guys go on, it's as if actually interacting with other people in an mmo is such a tragic experience."
5/22/2009,"what you're calling for here would unnecessarily damage mercenary alliances such as atomic battle penguins, repo, etc. it would be abused by those who can abuse it, and would only complicate what is currently a simple and fair system that encourages in-eve diplomacy and politics, which is in my opinion, a good thing.who are you to decide that arbitrary griefing is wrong? decreasing the ability of people to arbitrarily grief also decreases their freedom to act as they feel is suitable in a given situation. it inhibits the use of diplomacy and politics, and would take this game another step closer to being space-wow. for instance, if a person is salvaging your mission and you don't like that, you can wardec his corp and teach them a lesson, or even hire mercenaries to do it for you. they can wardec back, etc. etc. the freedom to wardec who you choose encourages a genuine use of politics in eve which is dynamic and unlike any other mmo out there."
5/22/2009,make it so the mothership itself has to target the enemy to use the bombers and it would be balanced!i love the idea though
5/22/2009,"good basic idea, but bad proposal.no support in this way."
5/22/2009,"i appreciate the thought and time that went into your response.that said, there's a problem with missions (which are not static) being run in lowsec. as you already pointed out, this is due to the population density and roving gangs. i do not see how making moon mats ""exploration"" sites (and thus vulnerable to the same roving gangs) is an improvement. in fact, i think you could argue that without moons and pos there would be virtually no point to lowsec, at all.i believe a better approach would be to put more power in the hands of players to defend their own space in this case. there's too much freedom for roving gangs to cause trouble ""just for the sake of pvp"" and not enough opportunity for ""anti-pies"" to retalliate. my vote will go towards whoever supports a player based anti-pirate feature. possibly being able to form gangs which do not receive any sec hit versus low-sec offenders. this might require a history to be kept of players sec status... the more often you've dropped below a certain level (say -5.0), the more of a target you're made to these ""concord sanctioned fleets."" to get in these gangs would require positive security above a certain level (say, 3.0), and can be renounced if that level drops a certain amount within some time frame."

5/22/2009,"the vast majority of things that are covered by the nda is just the initial responses ccp gives to issues raised by ccp - and for the most part these are summarized in public minutes a week later.my role, and that of the other take care advisors, is to provide as much data and different views as we can for erik to base his issue on, which erik can then use to write up his issue documents and use as material and arguments for discussion with the rest of the csm and with ccp.like factional warfare, if there is some concern from the fw players that hasn't been raised before, then people such as ol'summer bedlinnen and other fw people will likely pick it up quite fast, poke erik, and brief him what the problem is exactly. the entire thing behind take care is that while the csm you're going to vote for doesn't know everything, you do have a voice after you vote and can get the csm to work for you. the thing i can guarantee about erik is that he will put effort into getting your fw issues through, unlike the csm in the current council that vote down fw issues such as fw lag as unimportant.same thing with me and 0.0, while i've been in syndicate, delve, pure blind and providence, i've not been in any alliance that holds sov. needless to say, the sov mechanics and 0.0 warfare do have a number of issues, thus i went out to ask as many 0.0 players of their views and used my knowledge as game designer to analyze the problems and come up with potential solutions. that's why i've had several people mailing and convo'ing me saying: ""hey eva, this is what you need to know about the supercap issue!"". the take care system works, as these people came to me with their issues and concerns, rather than having the 0.0 people on the csm deal with the 0.0 issues exclusively. the csm should be there for all players, and most importantly, provide an opportunity for all players to get directly involved in the csm, and that's precisely the aim of take care.last, and these will be my only words about this topic, the claims by bad messenger and damar that i'm using exploits in factional warfare are blatant lies, and stem from envy for my successes while in the gallente militia as well as a desire to oppose any improvements to fw because they are the top dogs in the current ruleset and see any change as a threat to their position. i've never abused the cloaking exploit, in fact i've sent numerous emails about it to ccp and basically told them in the csm-ccp meeting that it's nothing less than a disgrace to ccp's reputation that such an exploit is still not fixed. the standings are working as intended. i find it odd that damar accuses me of exploiting, while he is bragging in the militia chat how he continously ganks mission runners in dodixie while circumventing the navy spawns through some loophole he and his corp are infamous for abusing. i'm not going to reply to further accusations and will report any follow-up on this to moderators as offtopic as such a discussion doesn't belong in erik's campaign thread. warfare & tactics that way ->ankhesentapemkahdivine commodore of the 24th imperial crusadeluminaire general of the federal defence unionmajor of the state protectorate"
5/22/2009,vote for vuk-good ideas...
5/22/2009,"hey, you definatly have my vote, i agree with having more npc's around, if anything, just for a bit of easy pew pew. however, i have just gotten into industry, i have been producing rigs and have just organised and run my first mining op in my corp with the intention of production. so i have a limited view, however, from that limited view, i think i would agree with claire. that is if what i am reading is correct.in reality, an object of significant worth in an auction, does go up with large bids. we are supposed to be in space, selling battleships to people who want to go out and destroy other battleships. if in realitly a person went into a auction to buy a battleship (just hear me out! lol!) and placed a bit of 0.01isk they would just laugh at them and ask them not to interupt in a serious business transaction.this is our chosen profession, and it is an important one. i expect this profession to be takes as seriously as 0.0 fights because it is the foundation to everything els.i would apreciate, if you do get in, to take a serious look at this and concider (if what i understood to be the argument) having a buying and selling system that would mimic reality.so as one of your voters. even if you dont address the above. good luck cuz u seem like a good representative for me in there :)"
5/22/2009,"okay, here's a deal for you guys- create an ideas thread, advertise it, drum up some support for it. this really is an interesting idea and i see what you're hoping to accomplish with it, i'm just not sure about actual implementation.when i get elected, show me the thread with your full idea and other people voicing support for it... and i'll try to push it at the first possible csm meeting. deal? i can't promise implementation, but if you can show me that its important, i'll do what i can to put it on the board :)."
5/22/2009,"this a very good application and campaign! because the text is clearly formatted and not too long and i understand all the points you listed while i am having problems to identify a clear goal in some other campaigns.i don't like the antropomorphic asteroid screaming thing though. i'd rather propose some sound of earthquakes coming from the asteroids every now and then or a crashing sound when large pieces of a rock are mined away.i also don't like all other points personally because they seem to be potential evil means against my general habit to fly with expensive stuff on autopilot through empire while i am afk-smoking on the window. i probably cannot elect you because this habit is one of my main sources of fun in eve.what do you think about some kind of cloaked dooms-day or mega smartbomb weapon on small pos towers in empire to add an unknown risk to war-deccers who don't want a fight but instead only steal the pos modules while the owner corp is offline for a few days or weeks (due to a withdrawal treatment against nicotine and alcohol for instance)? let's say, the cloaked dooms-day/mega smarty is activated as a big surprise as soon as the tower goes into reinforced and blows away everything in a range of 2000 km or so (except the pos itself of course). the dooms-day/mega smart has also a built-in pos shield recharge capability to make sure that the next attack will go the same way. (imagine for better understanding the pos belongs to a pirate corp and the war-deccers are greedy mission runners with high concord rating.) if you could support this and bring it to ccp for a quick implementation i might rethink my election decision."
5/22/2009,"hi pitboss, larkonis trassler, international man of mystery and ex privateer (pre nerf) here.i share your pain.i for one look back with a hint of bitterness at my time spent in privateers for the two reasons you have pointed out.i believe yes... the spoils of your kill should be yours. currently there is no way for the victor to correctly defend his spoils in an empire battle from scavengers and thieves.neutral remote repping is a pain in the arse. i would wholeheartedly welcome a change of the mechanics. if people wish to engage in battle then it should be flying their own colours, hiding behind the white flags and yellow and brown breeches of a neutral or npc corporation should no longer guarentee safety."
5/22/2009,"vote for omber zombie he is cool guy, and he just gave me rattlesnake to post this."
5/22/2009,"let me just make this very clear in advance. i'm not a candidate, but i have been a member of the first 2 csms.the issue you think is important, was indeed raised. the csm widely agreed that it was a good issue, and made a lot of sense.we brought it to ccp in iceland. however, we were met with some devs fundamentally disagreeing on the idea and some who liked it. however ccp promised to take up the discussion internally and figure out if it's possible from a technical point of view.it turns out that changing it to having a such effect, is not easy at all, and will take some serious work in the aggro system.so while it's a nice idea, i'm sad to tell you that it's not really likely to happen at all."

5/22/2009,"now that, ladies and gentlemen, is a bribe. well done."
5/23/2009,"as lavista vista has said, ccp see it as sub-optimal. after talking with him and finding out what exactly it means, they also think its lacking and can do better. so its in motion and we should see a new graphic eventually. thanks for the support and keep supporting this so ccp know they need to release something official about it :p"
5/23/2009,"that's gotta be one of the most ridiculous arguments i've ever heard.either you didn't read the op correctly, or you're stupid.woo, dealing with a logistics ship, fine, no one has a problem with logistics ships.op has a problem with people repping other people with no consequence.say i wardec you. you attack our fleet, and an alt corp's fleet with nothing but logistics ships come in.they can actively repair my fleet with no consequences, and you can do nothing about it unless you want to wardec the alt corp, which isn't a solution to a mistake in the game's current mechanics."
5/23/2009,ok .. let me break it down.i war dec a corporation .... one of its pilots decides to flaunt a ship i can easily kill infront of me.i start shooting the ship ... all of a sudden his alt (who is hugging a station -or- a warp gate) starts remote repping himhis alt is now aggressed to me ... leaving me the option to shoot the original target -or- shoot the remote repper.so if i shoot the remote repper ... he is allowed to dock up or jump through the gate anytime he feels comfortable ... he doesn't have to wait the normal 1 minute de-aggro to do so. in which i could probably kill him during that de-aggro time and punish him for sticking his nose in our war.if i ignore the repper ... i'm fighting a losing battle against a ship i can normally take.so what i'm asking for .. is the normal de-aggro 1 minute timer on the remote repper just like everyone else gets.
5/23/2009,"there's something hilarious about privateer alliance of all people complaining about the use of npc corp alts.however its a valid issue, so thumbs up."
5/23/2009,supported - it definitely needs fixing.
5/23/2009,supported.
5/23/2009,"no, i'm pointing out the flaw as to why your reasoning is wrong. you claim the risk 'practically' is non-existant because the victim now has to dock and get another ship or call corpmates to defend his loot. but that is how eve works. theoretically, when you gank a miner in an asteroid field he could bring corpmates to defend him against your gank squad. theoretically he can fit his barge with guns to fight you. theoretically, he can come back in a pvp ship to fight you again. but practically that rarely happens. but the risk is still there, isn't it? so now you come along and ask ccp to change a mechanic based on practical risk when your entire defense against you ganking noobs is that there is a theoretical risk.when it suits you, you use theoretical risk to defend your position. and when it suits you, you'll use practical risk (or the real risk) when it suits you. this, my friend, is double standard.mr. pitboss, you may be the boss of.... pits, i guess? but you're not the boss of me. you posted a thread in a public forum where it's open for debate, even for those that disagree with your views. mr. pitboss, you'll have to learn to accept that if you want to post your ideas here :)you have a wonderful nite!sincerely,matrix skye <3 <3 <3"
5/23/2009,i like it
5/23/2009,salvaging the offline tower as a new item would mean that new towers still need to be purchased while providing a source of income from the old tower as an incentive to go find and remove them.
5/23/2009,the requirements for the covertor indeed needs to be looked at by ccp to fix the gap between retriever and the next-in-line ship.good that someone spots exactly what needs to be done without suggesting some major unbalanced change to be made.this is just logical and nothing else.set the mining barge lvl requirement down to iv and a lot of people will rejoice.
5/23/2009,as a young character miner plodding through the training to finally get 3 strip miners and a worthwhile cargo hold i agree.the only reason to get a covertor now is if you can't afford a hulk.and the ore bonus for mining barge iv has made the retriever's inadequate cargohold issues even worse.if i could have that 3rd strip miner on the covetor for a month while training for the hulk i'd be able to afford it as soon as the training is complete.
5/23/2009,"covetor barge 4 prereq, supported"
5/23/2009,"as i understand it, the level 5's in the covetor requirements are because it was once the ultimate mining ship, before exhumers arrived and then became much cheaper.as someone who can fly a covetor, supporting lowering mining barge (or indeed, astrogeology) requirements to 4."
5/23/2009,"there need to be maintained a certain balance, lowering the astrogeology skill as well would be to much, you would then skip the retriever for the favoring of covertor, by just lowering the mining barge skill requirement to iv you maintain a balance and you even the curve in the different ship upgrades in a miners career."
5/23/2009,"that's why i said ""or astrogeology"". not both--a miner would still use the retriever for a month or so while waiting for the level 4 skill to reach 5."
5/23/2009,"judging on what implants and the learning skills, astrogeology takes about 2 weeks or more. the change would be to low in my opinion.mining barge from 4-5 takes abit over 3 weeks, thus changing that requirement down to 4 would create a sufficient gap between the covetor and the hulk wich should provide a proper buffer between them and not bring any further unbalance issues in the mining barge fleet.it's what atleast i think is the most logical solution :)"
5/23/2009,*bumps*does no one agree?i find this surprising =o.o=
5/23/2009,i wonder why there haven't been any missions with wh's of a limited nature :)
5/23/2009,i'm of the opinion that space is entirely to crapped up with gas already. the normal system skyboxes are entirely too bright for my taste. space should be much more empty than it is here in new eden.
5/23/2009,"agree on this, however having something interesting to look at in missions would not be bad."
5/23/2009,"my supposition, from a purely lay-woman's astronomical point of view, is that new eden isn't a galaxy in the way we think of the milky way. honestly, it looks more like a globular cluster, with most of the stars fairly close together. in which case, space would actually be considerably brighter than we're used to seeing it, simply because there's more light per unit volume.of course, given that it's so bright, i do wonder why a lot of the ships have headlights."
5/23/2009,"the sb's role was never to be a solo ship in any way, shape or form.ccp made this very clear when explaining how they were going to fix it (before the fix)bad at it? i disagree. i've killed plenty a frigate, destroyer /and/ cruiser with the old sb role.but in argument, i think it needed a role change. sb shouldn't be a solo ship, ever.but its new role it fails at worse than its old role..."
5/23/2009,"the new changes are pretty good imo, ok so they make it hard to be a omfgwtfsolopwnmobile, but get a friend in an arazu to point & sensor damp it, possibly another in a rapier to web it and unleash your torpedoes :)being a sb pilot whose done this a few times since the patch will validate the vast levels of fun this is :)"
5/23/2009,"we were promised an overhaul to many things, market with storefronts, mining, the list goes on...the industry expansion was dropped in favour of fw, medals, certificates etc. the only remnant to make it in was the orca, and then later a prettier look for roids.could the industrialists of eve get some information on when/if our promised expansion is going to roll around, or are we, the makers of all things that pew and don't pew, going to be ignored in favour of more pew?at the time i believe it was stated that storefronts were withdrawn for a better system in development and then they dropped off the radar entirely. i also believe it has been stated that the expansion schedule was full till 2012.sooooo....whatever happened to the industrial expansion"
5/23/2009,might as well support my own proposal before it disappears from sight
5/23/2009,i also support this as i feel this side of eve is slightly underdeveloped compared to combat.
5/23/2009,please? pretty please with a bow on top?it could include a lot of the things people bring up here (see flogging the dead horse).
5/23/2009,"yeah, i'd really like to know what happened to some of that stuff. a lot of it would be handy."
5/23/2009,supported with all my love...! plz ccp make us happy!!1
5/23/2009,"planets are a great start, but if you allow for small objectives such as complexes or pillars or society you're going to run into issues where a bunch of pirates with no territorial ambitions can directly influence a major power. dreads should be required to even begin the contesting of space, it's one of the larger military assets alliances would have."

5/23/2009,"dude, what were you on when you wrote this?(if the answer is nothing, then please revise the question to what should you have been on when you wrote this?)"
5/23/2009,"basically he want it to work like an armour plate, you get to run your mods for a bit longer since the battery provide you with a cap buffer, but once that buffer is used up, it's useless until it has been recharged/repped, so using your previous example, if you have a ship with 4000 cap and 100 second recharge time, giving you 40 cap/s, and add a cap battery that gives 2000 more cap, then your cap recharge time should go up to 150 seconds so that you still get 40 cap/second, but you now have 2000 extra cap buffer to run guns, reppers and whatever before capping out.i think it makes sense, but very hard to implement and not worth the effort. in the example above, you could easily calculate that the stats for the battery would have to be +2000 cap and +50% recharge time..but then you fit the same battery on your other bs where you have 6000 cap to start with and 120 second recharge time standard, aka 50 cap/s, which the battery change to 8000 cap in 180 seconds, or 44.444 cap/second. then you fit it on your bc with 2000 cap and 100 second recharge aka 20 cap/second, which get changed to 4000 cap in 150 seconds aka 26.67 cap/s. even if that could be worked around, it would make it harder to get them better balanced since you get more factors to calculate with."
5/23/2009,i agree with what your saying here but think you would need to increase the fitting requirements on them as well.a large t2 battery that currently gives 700 base cap i think should be increased up to 2000-3000 cap though its fitting requirements should be harsh enough to make it almost impossible to fit to a cruiser but still possible just seriously limits what else you could fit. ie not worth fitting on a cruiser. it would also be able to fit on bc and be a little less harsh but still not the best option in most cases.the medium battery would also get a buff from say the base 420 to 1300-1600 cap but agene having hard enough fittings that putting one on a frigs just would not be possible as is the case now. then doing the same for the small and micro battery'sthis would make them more useful then rechargers but at the cost of using a lot of your fitting grid/cpu. the use of rechargers would be used on setups that are tight for fitting.
5/23/2009,"yeah, you are right, so so far we have 2 options:1st as described above.2nd is to simply introduce xlarge batteries that have fitting requrments and capacity so that it makes sence for battlehips. steave435- i see what you mean, and that would be interesting, but would requre change of the entire system, not everyone might whant that, and it's increadebly complicated, imagine what will hapen if you add in capacitor flux coil, one more batteries, cap power relays and mwd, and then try to keep cap recharge the same. that would be extremly complicated."
5/23/2009,x-large batteries are a lot more desireable than the op's idea./support for that.
5/23/2009,"exactly, that's my point, it would be too complicated, so trying to give the batteries that ""buffer only"" functionality isn't viable, unless ccp can come up with a smart idea for once."
5/23/2009,sounds like you want a reversed cap flux coil. boost capacity and nerf recharge.
5/23/2009,"please allow us to repackage items in any corp hanger. office space, pos arrays, even ship based arrays (for consistency). it makes no sense that you can build packaged items at a pos, you can assemble them, you just cant disassemble them. w-space has made this a much more pressing matter than before."
5/23/2009,"i know nothing about the issue, but i see no obvious reasons for which this could be a bad idea, so supported."
5/23/2009,"you already can in offices, but yeah, this is kind of silly in pos arrays. this would also solve the problem being complained about a while back that it was a real pain to build a jf in a pos because it was near-impossible to get the packaged freighter in the array. i don't see anything this would break, so sure."
5/23/2009,didn't know about this.supported.
5/23/2009,sounds fine to me.support--isaac
5/23/2009,"i see no reason this shouldn't be in the game, as it doesn't offer any real advantage other than general logistical benefits (repackaging ships for jfs, stacking items in a corp hangar array, etc). supported."
5/23/2009,"i have noticed in wars if a player accidentally fires on an alliance mate, for example had him locked for repairs then didn't check target before firing guns, then they get a global criminal counter and either concorded in high sec or hit by gate guns in low sec. players should be authorized to engage alliance members freely as if they were corp members. this becomes an issue in other situations as well such as alliance mates wanting to test their ships against each other, would get criminal counter for shooting but cant exchange cans as cans are flagged at alliance level or if an alliance wants to hold a tournament in high sec on the main server."
5/23/2009,supporting my own topic obviously.
5/23/2009,"^ yes, please!"

5/23/2009,"people can already do all those functions if they download an ""unauthorized"" macro program. ccp should legitimize all macroing and make limitations to macro behavior inherent in game mechanics rather then in eula rules- especially as there is no system to detect and ban macros efficiently implemented in the game software.for example implement some way for people to sell items on the market at a range of prices rather then giving market macroers the upper hand- or allow macro mining, so cheaters dont get an unfair advantage- but if a player steals your stuff due to your inattentiveness... well that's eve for you.there's a lot of far reaching consequences and the idea will need a lot more thought and re-balancing but i think it's got a lot of potential for being really cool and useful and making eve more fun and reduce the headaches."
5/23/2009,"i think your proposal goes a bit too far - things like adjusting orders and mining without the player having to think are the sort of things macros specifically should not be able to do. a macro should look something like ""ctrl-click, macro button, and now i'm targeting him and orbit 500ing him with all my modules set on"". instantaneous, the result of a player's action, and a simplification of a complex, repetitious set of actions the player would otherwise have to take. introducing legal macro mining is exactly the sort of thing i don't want to see."
5/23/2009,"having been watching the ""reverse progress"" of darkfail, i have to conclude that letting people add to or alter the client in any way is just not a good idea.why not learn to work with what you have like everyone else in eve does? or you could apply to ccp as a ui designer.not supported.edit: spelling and grammar"
5/23/2009,"not supported.in certain other mmos, especially a certain popular one, macros and ui addons have almost become a requirement to remain competitive in the game. though eve online's ui is pretty horrible, all players are on the same relative playing field."
5/23/2009,"if you bugger up your own client, you're the only one who has to live with it. isn't that the whole eve philosophy - accepting the consequences of your own actions? i know dealing with whatever fail the devs throw at us is also the eve player's philosophy, but in that case it's more a matter of it being inevitable than of it being good. as for the ""or apply for a job"" bit, reminds me of a forum exchange one of my corpies had with a dev.dev: ""if you think you can do better, we have a job opening.""corpie: """

5/23/2009,"ccp isnt going to allow game breaking bugs to last for very long, even if they dont project an outward appearance of getting it done all right now. as for the forums, i think making devs read them is really too much to ask. but the csm and community managers are supposed to be the ones who do that work, so i think the biggest wants from the players are going to get heard either way."
5/23/2009,"this post has been cleared of inappropriate content.regards,the eve online moderation team"
5/23/2009,"part of the problem is that the forums currently offer no way of knowing that a dev has read a thread until they post in it. perhaps the ""reads"" column could be split into two, with a new column for dev reads?as has been said already however, if you want ccp to post more, then we as players first need to post better./ben"

5/23/2009,"i envision walking in stations to turn into something like habbo hotel at best.isn't this stuff really just testing for their next mmo anyways?anyways, i support any game mechanic that allows greifing in stations. beating people up in stations, blocking people in stations, etc etc. we should be allowed to carry weapons in stations and perhaps turn it into a first person shooter in stations. that would be awesome.(in stations)"
5/23/2009,i see what you did there; you made some letters all red.
5/23/2009,"hello, i think the crowded systems, like jita, should be expanded, there could be a specially designed station, which is about 3 times the size of a normal one, with more than one entrance/exit ramp, just to spread it out a bit... and then maybe a special permanent cyno jump out of juts to take some of the pressure off the stargate.just some thoughts."
5/23/2009,"you need large amounts of wealth to keep the wealth. true, since dysprosium moons are well sought after and need to be constantly defended against attack. given that this conflict requires ships, modules and the like (due to large losses incurred in such conflict), many players benefit as a result (due to sales). this conflict also benefits market traders (limiting resources entering markets due to disrupted supply etc).for the more lazy player, i could see your point regarding static minerals. not wanting to work towards goals (such as earning isk to buy the better t2 ships). they'd like cheap materials and modules so that they could quickly reach a higher 'level'. some players (myself included) like working towards goals. we also like the fact of a realistic economy that drives markets etc. look what happened when price caps on trit were removed...a doubling in price...we don't hear complaints about this from many.is this due to trit being a common mineral, and hence the complaints about rarer minerals really boils down to a degree of envy because they are inaccessible?xavier"
5/23/2009,"why do we have so much space that is under-utilized? could it be because the moon resources in eve are... *gasp* static? that there is little-to-no reason to bother with that space?how much more active would 0.0 be if the resources were not static? if they had to be constantly sought after? the higher end moons could shift around over the course of months, this would encourage infiltrating your neighbors and exploration."
5/23/2009,"actually, venture into low sec and you'll see vast tracts of this space under-utilised.static resources refers to amount available in-game to be mined etc. you aren't proposing anything else but changing the location of these resources. or are you proposing to change the volume and location? as i pointed out, the product made from these resources are available via alchemy...how does changing the location of the resources make them more fought after? i'm intrigued to know your thinking here- how do you propose to overcome the numerous issues that constantly changing locations will throw up???with the advent of t3, and the accessibility of the materials to any player (so long as you can find a wh) will go some way to overcoming any percieved shortage of rare minerals.xavier"
5/23/2009,"why do i get the feeling you're responding just to get your name out, and not to let people know your ideas? whetever, i'll bite.rare moon material location mostly, but volume to a smaller extent.i have not participated in alchemy. from what i've heard, it's not worth the time and next to useless. do you actually defend alchemy? just being able to do something, doesn't make it worthwhile.supposedly there are changes to sov and pos in the works, so this might all not matter... but how does removing static resources not increase conflict? especially if the time scale for them moving isn't in days, but maybe weeks, or several months. the end issue is that your defenses/network guarding that rare moon will only last so long, before that space isn't as valuable anymore, and you will be encouraged to move. as it is now, you set up shop, hunker down, and collect profits for years (or until someone steals your alliance).i don't propose to know every detail, simply that the options for new players are extremely limited when it comes to 0.0. you either join a large ""established"" alliance, or you fight over the scraps those large alliances don't care about. non-static resources will encourage more movement and unknown, promote exploration, and open up a lot of opportunities for all of eves player base, not just someone who locked down a moon years ago.this is also an extention of more risk/reward scenarios. there is always a greater risk in moving around, and that should be rewarded. rewarding people for growing stagnant without change is... well, not the eve i want to play."
5/23/2009,"why do i get the feeling you're responding just to get your name out, and not to let people know your ideas? whetever, i'll bite.i'm happy to let players know my ideas- i'm a little fixated on the rare moon minerals since i trade them in volume....i have not participated in alchemy. from what i've heard, it's not worth the time and next to useless. do you actually defend alchemy? just being able to do something, doesn't make it worthwhile.alchemy offers another route to producing products required for the construction of modules/ships. it is labor intensive, requires a high degree of organisation (pos refuelling/silos etc); it is worthwhile if you depend on large volumes of products which are continually either inflating in price or just hard to get (more on this lower). its far cheaper than defending a dysprosium moon, however, and the quantity you produce depends solely on the scale of the operation. clearly, players carrying out such operations will have checked their figures carefully....but, knowing many high-end ship manufacturers, supply is the single biggest limiting factor (they'll pay a little more for a constant and dependable supply). hence, alchemy allows access to products which otherwise are limited by the supply of the rarer moon minerals.volumes of both the rare minerals themselves, and the products, are controlled by two main interests; the alliances/corps with access to the moons themselves, and the market traders. supply lines are often disrupted due to wars etc. indeed, supply to empire is also dependant on the alliance/corp demand for the minerals (as they also build ships/modules etc). we can safely say that the excess makes it to empire. volumes can't be all that bad, given that ships and modules are still being built and meeting demand. prices, on the otherhand, have increased pretty dramatically in the past 6 months.this is due to market trading. you and i know that the supply/demand balance determines prices. traders with vast capital can buy up stocks on markets, then relist it at a higher price. the ceiling price for any specific item/mineral is easily determined. what i found was that much of the rare minerals and products from these were vastly undervalued. now prices reflect the rarity and susceptibility of supply for many of these rarer minerals. what this boils down for consumers of end-products requiring rare mins and their products is slightly higher prices. however, prices are significantly cheaper than pre-invention (remember when cruise missle launcher ii's were 12 mil a pop?). what we see today is not actually as bad as its made out to be...supposedly there are changes to sov and pos in the works, so this might all not matter... but how does removing static resources not increase conflict? especially if the time scale for them moving isn't in days, but maybe weeks, or several months. the end issue is that your defenses/network guarding that rare moon will only last so long, before that space isn't as valuable anymore, and you will be encouraged to move. as it is now, you set up shop, hunker down, and collect profits for years (or until someone steals your alliance).adding this layer of complexity to the current situation isn't, imo, going to solve the problems of conflict and unoccupied space. jump bridges effectively allow 0.0 dwellers to bypass large tracts of space. having to search through this space constantly for minerals, moving setups and the like would just be a timesink...sov limitations for competitors and jump bridges would mean that most space still not utilised. conflict already occurs between the large alliances for the moons and space. maybe the problem isn't where the minerals are, but how other mechanics allow those areas to be effectively inaccessible?"
5/23/2009,"...promote exploration, and open up a lot of opportunities for all of eves player base, not just someone who locked down a moon years ago.wh space is an attempt to do just this i believe. given that t3 is dependant on wh stuff, maybe we can read into the implementation that ccp are moving away from a dependance on static resource feeds? a similar thing occurred with t2 bpo with the implementation of invention. alchemy is also an attempt to do this. i'm sure ccp is monitoring the effects within game of these changes and will make adjustments if required. i'm also sure that the csm will be feeding back at the request of the playerbase should things start to be limiting..."
5/23/2009,"not having used alchemy does not mean i am ignorant to how it works. simply put, the amount of time it takes to manage alchemy processes is another advantage holders of the static resources receive. far cheaper than holding a dysprosium moon? i seriously doubt this. while costs potentially can be huge when under siege, i think it is much more likely that profit is made in 0.0 more often than lost.i'm just going to quote this here... so using jump bridges to skip over large amounts of space is a way of utilizing that space? making them stop through there and look around is a time sink and is not utilizing that space?i've intentionally avoided t3 discussions, as that is a new market and has yet to establish itself. wh space does not provide sovereignty (see, space empires), or markets (see, requires travel out of wh space), and as such, i do not think plays into the ""crowded or not"" discussion... the number of players who live there permanently is very, very few."
5/23/2009,"sorry if i wasn't clear: i think jump bridges allowing players to bypass large tracts of space is not ideal! and holding off seiges is expensive, in terms of ship losses etc. they might generate good income most of the time, but i bet some of the time it costs dearly....as you say, rewards should increase with risks. however, given that there are serious problems with other mechanics (such as sov), i'm not sure that moving resources about is going to solve the problems.wh space is exactly an answer to limited resources etc...it allows any player to jump in and participate. i'm not suggesting you have to live there permanently, although there is nothing stopping corps doing so since exits into the rest of the universe are there also."

5/23/2009,"you may think so, but really they are very related. if you worked as a developer/tester/etc in game development you would know that.the problem is people in gsm make the same ignorant assumption you just did, so in the end they waste time that could be used making eve a better quality game that could make ccp more profits because its player base is happier and more willing to get their friends involved."
5/23/2009,"and yet you still have not added anything useful to the conversation, and have wasted our time trying to tear the discussion down without the use of logic or hard data."
5/23/2009,"fair enough.not what the csm does. not even close.i find your obvious implication that the current testers are not ""real testers"" to be counterproductive and misinformed, and probably related to a personal bad experience of yours with a bug in game. i've worked in the industry, and the reality is that no amount of game testing is going to catch every bug every time.that's not what the csm does, and even if it did, and a policy like this was enacted, what do you think would be the positive effect we would get out of this? so you could personally vent your frustration at someone in specific versus ccp as a whole?not what the csm does. not even close.i didn't bother spelling it all out in my first posts, as it's pretty obvious to those of us readers that have any idea what's going on :-)"
5/23/2009,"why would you vote for me? ****, is it even possible?"
5/23/2009,"first of all, my initial list was just the standard wild stuff to get peoples minds going; i know the csm cant walk on into ccp's main office and start giving orders. it would be sweet, but yeah i know its not possible and i sort of expected people to have the intelligence to understand that.since that does not seem to be the case, let me explain further:i also have extensive experience in the industry, working for companies you can buy shares in if you are into the stock market, not dinky little private companies.with that in mind, i do not see a really big qa presence in the game. i see a little black box testing for ""happy path"", but no white box, daily continual build integration, bvt, regression, etc testing. thus, in my mind with my years of experience, they do not do ""real"" testing as defined by the software development life cycle standards. traditionally, in fan fests past only devs where spoken of and qa never really existed. i suspect it was because they simply did not exist until i started complaining about it publicly on the forum, and have yet to have this disproved.csm works with ccp to make the game better and allow the customers to give ccp input to do so. this is exactly what csm does and should be doing, but as stated earlier many of them do not understand the dev/qa/pm roles and how they work together in software development, so they do not even try.as i said above, i expected people to have some intelligence in regards to my most brash statements; clearly your need to further explain your point of view and take them seriously either proved i made a mistake in this regard, simply did not communicate my intentions clearly enough, or simply over estimated the intelligence of the people who would reply. either way, a mistake i will do my best to learn from."

5/23/2009,"the csm is a complete and utter pile of whitewash foisted off on the players by ccp to lead them to believe we (the players) actually have some input into the game. ccp has a long history of totally ignoring anything the players state (such as the players doing bug testing etc on sisi who report bugs to ccp which promptly get ignore, or report that 'planned' game mechanic changes actually break or destroy entire ship classes etc). those who believe the csm actually do anything other than waste the air that they breath... i have a bridge to sell you on mars, it's in perfect condition, can be used to support several hundred vehicles and can be repackaged into a pocket sized square for easy transport. only 1 billion iskies! just send your isk to this character and i will see to it that your bridges location (exact spatial and chronological co-ordinates) gets sent to you via eve-mail.~sb"

5/24/2009,"dear mr. skye, it seems that your whole argument revolves around your hatred towards privateers. that's sad. btw, this issues doesn't only effect us, fw for example could greatly benefit from these changes."
5/24/2009,you're spinning the issue again. and you keep avoiding the question. you claim there is no risk to a loot stealer. so then allow me to ask you again.what is the risk to a gang that catches a miner or missioner (whether it be a wartarget or out in lo sec) in an asteroid field or deadspace?and compare your answer to this quesiton:what is the risk to a loot stealer that steals loot from a wreck that doesn't belong to him?if you answer these questions sincerely and honestly you'll notice that either for both you point out practical risk or for both you point out theoretical risk.
5/24/2009,break it down more ... because you're assuming we're in a gang ... 1v1you attack a target you're at war with ... you've spent your time tracking them down ... you attack them ... you're running the risk of losing your ship ... many a times i've attacked a target 1v1 and got in over my head and lost my shipin empire ... all 3 of us in a field ... victim is in a pod victor is in a shiploot thief is a shipwhat exactly is the loot thief's risk .... ah yeah now i see it ... he risks having his feelings hurt because i dont thank him for taking my reward for my hard work
5/24/2009,"probing a target down does not put you in practical risk and you know it. :). that's virtually non-existent risk. the only risk is you losing your time. now im not saying youre wrong. but what im saying is if youre going to claim practical non-existent risk is risk then stop saying that loot thieves have no risk, because they do :).even assuming that you jump on a miner or mission-runner 1v1 you will have the upper hand. if you dont then youre doing it wrong . mission ship or mining ship rarely has scrambler/disruptor. so if youre losing ships to them many times then wow, youre either full of lose or sh**. choose one. and here you just make it very clear that you have a problem with non-practical risk with loot thieves. but you dont have a problem with the non-practical virtually non-existent risk in you attacking a miner or mission runner. this is very hypocritical of you. mind you eve is a game where even if the risk is non-practical it still is valid no matter how improbable it is. for example gate camps. youre familiar with these as you run them occasionally :). sure, there is the risk that a war target will call for reinforcements and they will make it on time to save him from the impending doom of your gate camp. but practically that rarely happens. yet the risk is still there.just because the victim chooses not to come back to defend his wreck (not yours) doesnt mean the risk isnt there. and you definitely cant get mad because the loot stealer got to the loot before you did. you can fix this problem easily, as said before; get a dedicated looter. problem solved. if youre too lazy or too unmotivated to loot or assign a looter, then you dont deserve that loot anyway. very simple."
5/24/2009,a thread about salvaging is never complete without matrix skye white knighting for the missionrunners of new eden and misrepresenting the facts.
5/24/2009,"there isn't enough risk for loot thieves. for all other actions in game that a player takes that involves another player, there is a fairly balanced risk that it'll blow up in their face. loot thief empties the wreck and then can instantly dock or warp away without anyone doing anything, unless the original owner returns in time to reclaim the materials. we both know how likely this is. there are options for dealing with people's actions in everything else in eve, why not this? i want my spoils of war, and i want the bastard that stole from me to be flagged so i at least have the legal option to hand him his ass for mucking about with my fun. this is not too much to ask.the only people that act as dedicated looters in pvp are the vultures that stumble upon an opportunity to take the spoils from someone else. no pvp gang worth a **** is ever going to assign a dedicated looter. putting all the loot in one place to be destroyed? ******ed. expecting anyone to accept that job, when there are actually fun things they could be doing? really ******ed.and what about jita, or similar high traffic systems? you think a dedicated looter is going to win more times than not against all the neutrals that swarm anything that moves, waiting for a wreck? you idea is a good one, and good strategy, but you can't honestly believe that this is an emergent profession in eve's pvp gangs. if you tell me it is, you're blowing smoke up my ass. one person in a gang may be chosen to pick loot, but that's for after the pew pew is finished. nobody but the criminally insane will choose such a narrow game play role that basically excludes them from anything fun. join me again to chase our own tails?"

5/24/2009,"yes, that is more or less what i meant.cap rechargers are mostly used to make a setup more or less capstable.cap boosters are mostly used to slot-efficiently run stuff that is not needed all the time for short durations.cap batteries are... mostly not used, unless they accidentally happen to do exactly what cap rechargers are used for in single freak setups.instead cap batteries should neither make things much more capstable, nor should they run things in short regular bursts. instead they should keep stuff running in one long burst. a cap booster can be used over and over again, until it runs out of charges. a cap battery cannot be run over and over. once it is empty, it is empty until the capacitor recharges through other means.with the discussed modification (capacitor capacity up, recharge down) they would allow two things that are currently not quite possible:1. make a ship very resistant to capacity warfare through combination of battery and recharger.2. allow a ship to run a very strong burst capacitor through combination of battery and booster with a lot of surplus safety.this would be useful both for pvp and for pve. less for pve, but still useful if you know what you are doing."
5/24/2009,"i dont like the idea of having useless modules, but making things like cap fluxes and large cap batteries usable might need a lot more research and number crumching. with more useful cap mods available people will be able to fit more powerful longer lasting tanks then they could before, etc etc. it would have wide reaching consequences."

5/24/2009,"i don't know anything about darkfall, so please enlighten me. what is wrong with ui modification? how did they do it differently then world of warcraft? all the wow people i know of like their iu mods. so some for eve would be pretty cool to have.the pvp macro i agree with, but macro mining is probably the only thing that will make mining popular and level the playing field between the people who use the only easy way to cheat at eve, and the non-cheating players. they talk about revamping mining and aside from turning it into some minigame to keep people busy, macroing is the easiest solution. there are still consequences to macro mining- macro miners get their ore stolen and get their ships killed, in highsec and lowsec respectively.a quick google search can get you set up with all the tools you need to macro already pretty easily, with low risk and high reward, but all those options are out of the reach of someone who wants to play the game within the rules. maybe if you want to prevent some really annoying consequences of macros, do not include pixel detection as a function, but other then that i think ccp should open the interface up more to the playerbase. ccp mentioned that the client is simply a ""dumb terminal"", so hacking it really does nothing except allow you to macro.also it would save ccp and the players a lot of headaches if ccp just released tools for players to use to make their own interface mods. all the complaints about the corporate interface, market interface, etc etc, would be pretty much solved overnight without additional effort by ccp. of course there will be consequences to this but i think its worth working through them because i'd like to be able to customize my ui more then just being able to turn it hot pink."
5/24/2009,"so, how would this have any influence at all? instead of calling another macro they just copy the contents of the other macro."
5/24/2009,"let me clarify by mentioning something i forgot to:-macros cannot use conditional logic (it cannot do anything but execute commands sequentially)about addons: in wow, addons made the game better. they let players fill in gaps the programmers neglected to, and in that way accelerated game development. they were mandatory, but towards the end addons really improved only how information was presented to you - and i don't think anyone can deny that players should be able to control that to whatever degree they wish.furthermore, i wasn't talking about addons. if ccp wanted to make an api and add some addon support, that's a separate issue. all i want is the ability to not have to ""right click> select orbit> scroll to 30k> click again"". that's ******ed. this is a game that's considered ""hardcore"" and i find myself clicking all over the screen in the midst of combat. that is fail. you should never have to click except when you are selecting targets."

5/24/2009,"on behalf of rolos:just wanted to provide a little feedback on the patching system. though it's nice to have a torrent based autopatcher (i think...), there are quite a few small things to improve on to make it a better experience for many of the eve userbase.1. patch notes are great to read, but why not download the update while the user is reading them? there could be a small bar at the bottom providing small details, with a show details button to add more functionality and information.2. as it's a standalone patcher, and a torrent using one, there should be options common to torrent clients such as utorrent and azureus, such as the ability to pause downloads, restart them, or stop them in order to redownload the patch without having to close the autopatcher. 3. related to the last point, bandwidth control would also be a coveted option. myself and many other eve players do not have internet connections that allow multitasking on the internet (inability to read email at any real speed, or do anything else requiring the internet without ridiculous slowdowns whilst downloading). this would allow us to keep our lives going whilst preparing to play our game. options for control could include setting download and upload limits (for seeders, see next point).4. seeders are people that have finished downloading or are in the process of downloading a file, and are uploading the bits to others trying to acquire said file. they would unload strain from ccp servers and mirrors, saving bandwidth and letting these resources be used for more important things, like the game itself.4. allow us to download a .torrent file instead of the autopatcher. it's smaller, more versatile, and easier. plus you wouldn't have to do coding for the torrent application itself, and could just skin another application. or build the autopatcher as a module for the client, running as a separate program instead of having to be downloaded each time a patch comes out. this could also help people seed.5. look to utorrent for inspiration on the matter of torrent applications. it's lightweight, extremely fast, easy to use, and popular.6. a patch folder should be created in the eve directory to store patch files, if this system or similiar is implemented. it will make it easier to find the files (for users), and allows for easier backing up of said files.read and reply :)"

5/24/2009,"thanks for all your support, guys!"
5/24/2009,"you have my vote garthran,i'm like you i play eve for the enjoyment of the game,i started playing in sept '05,i don't enjoy the pvp aspect of the game but have taken part. i have played and still play many mmo's but i always keep returning to eve. i would enjoy seeing what you could bring to the csm with the mindset i've seen in your posts. best of luck and i hope to see what new outlook you bring to the csm."
5/24/2009,"hi i was looking through this thread, i am looking for 1 simple thing to happen to the mining... the ore crystal color should change with whatever crystal you use in your strip miner.. right now it's all 1 yellow color (although the fire effect against the rock is very pretty)1st: it would be pretty...2nd: it would easily distinguish which rock your gang members are mining on an op. 3rd: you could easily tell which beam is working on which rock. just 3 benefits of the color changes (think light sabers in star wars :) ) the 2nd thing in eve that i am looking to see changed is the ability to change font size in eve mail... that is getting on my last nerve! i'm practically blind!! and that pica 4 point is just killing my eyeswell that's enough, i hope i have given you something to think about. thankyou for your timerachel orefinder"
5/24/2009,"he would have also had my vote, perhaps it would have made the csm a little less of the darius show it seems to be currently."
5/24/2009,"i agree. scams are rampant and it is totally unrealistic. in real life you can tell the police and they will go after the scam artist. in eve there is no such justice. worse in eve the criminal is protected. (i consulted a real lawyer and this is my understanding of he said)in addition if the scam grows large enough to where you can easily determine that it would be worth real life money they could be found liable. the person who scammed my corp is in this forum buying and selling billions and yet i have to wonder how much of that is ill gotten gains.first, the conversation from isk to any currency can be established through the in game selling of game time cards. since ccp manages that market and recieves money from the selling of the gtcs they benefit directly. so they benefit from the crime which makes them a party.if a scam were to ever raise to the level of a gtc which is about 700 million isk or about $35 us they could be in trouble. example above, assume that the person mentioned above, whom i say purchase something for 40billion isk. that would be $1866 dollars that could potentially be linked to a criminal act.if players loose that much isk you have lost real money without ""consideration"" which is a legal term where you must benefit from the contract. if you do not benefit in some way the contract is not legal.another way is if the contract is out of balance to where one side greatly benefits at the expense of another then the contract is not legal.no contract can be written that sanctions an illegal act. so in the above conditions the eula may not protect ccp. further, they could be liable because they are protecting the offending person while profiting from the scam directly.the fact that its a game also does not protect ccp. again, because they accept real money, or manage the exchange of real money for in game money they have opened the door to liability.all the legal stuff aside its just damn bad to run a business that sanctions such actions."
5/24/2009,"regarding isk evemail spammers:i agree with the restricting trial accounts ideas in this thread. trial accounts should automatically be prevented from sending evemails or speaking in local, etc after x number of spam complaints are lodged against them(of course a later gm investigation can sort out the abusers of this), and there should be a max number of trial accounts one single computer can log into in a certain period of time(computer defined as same install information and ip address). something along those lines should reduce the volume without punishing legitimate users.regarding ""legal"" sc/pammers: i think the ""calling the 19999999isk 19.9 mil"" change was a step in the right direction. some sort of limit on the amount of links someone can put in local chat might help but no matter what you do jita local is going to be utter and complete trash anyways. any trial account restriction probably wont stop these guys. implementing something similar to what the market has, to filter out orders that are ridiculously high, might be the best solution. if i see one tritanium up for a bil the contract will warn me that it's ""x% above average going rate on contracts for this item"", and i guess the going rates will be calculated from the past few days of contracts that were completed."
5/24/2009,"i judged that most of the candidates responses would be similar to mine, and i'm simply not famous enough to draw attention unless my answer was exactly what you wanted to hear. and, as issler said, i wouldn't want to give an answer that is not indicative of my personal feelings, so i opted to allow you to exclude me from your considerations.garthran"
5/25/2009,"i fully support the needed ability to change font size both larger and smaller. i change back and forth from a 24"" screen to a 14"" and i need a larger font for the 24"" and smaller font for the 14""------"

5/25/2009,"full support. and i've seen guys from the author's alliance [privateers] doing exactly this outside stations, after which they dock immediately.[ingame since beta testing.]"
5/25/2009,but still can't figure out how to click the 'support' button ...
5/25/2009,"this thread should have died months ago. maybe someone needs to come up with a better/more balanced idea since obviously the op's has not succeeded in raising enough support.as it is, the current suggestion will likely imbalance the situation more than it is currently skewed. imagine:a young capsuleer encounters a deserted battlefield. some wrecks have not been looted, possibly due to them not yielding anything worth taking for the veteran combatants. short on .isk, the young capsuleer cannot resist the temptation.a corporate pilot has barely survived an ambush by a rival corporation's roamer. the battle has cost him and he feels entitled to the loot the aggressor has left behind. woe him, as a specialized human vulture in a fast ship has been waiting for this moment and will now quickly swoop in and ransack all the best loot on the field.suicide gankers have just ganked a mining op by a alliance friendly to you. one of their ilk has waited at a safe distance and is now coming in to collect the spoils of their efforts. you will not let this injustice stand and hurry over to deny them.neither the current system nor the one proposed here likely works out in all these situation to everyone's satisfaction. things to consider:- why should shooting a ship make you the legal new owner of the spoils?- why should stealing property automatically give anyone the right to kill you and your crew?consider this from the perspective of those that decide what is right and what isn't in empire space: the empires. maybe an empire - would consider a ship's property forfeit under certain circumstances?- would give a capsuleer the exclusive right to salvage under certain other circumstances?- would not intervene at all in such trivial matters?discuss, but better: make a new thread."
5/25/2009,don't try to necro my thread ... still plenty of discussion and support going on here ...alot more interest and activity than the majority out there
5/25/2009,i'm sure that mission-running ship or mining ship had a real good chance at popping your pvp gank-squad
5/25/2009,although i should be considered a weapon of mass destruction ...one person does not constitute a 'gank squad'read the quote ... 3 different people in a field with 3 different agendas get over yourself btw its funny you're assuming that the person in the field is running a mission or mining ... welcome to eve ... there are a few more reasons to be in a field ... but those you constantly state are the only ones that help your argument and make him look all soooo defenseless.
5/25/2009,"wow - you guys have been discussing this for more than a year now - how long do this things usually take to be accepted or rejected?it seems to be that at the moment, the game mechanic is skewed in favour of the looter - but equally, i think the suggested solutions on the front page put the favour far too much in the favour of the winner of a fight. if those were implmented, wouldn't it make it far more viable to suicide gank someone, then come back in another ship and sweep up all the loot because you know no one else would pinch it while you were getting in a new ship?also, it doesn't seem realistic. if this were a real scenario, the loot and salvage would be available to anyone who turned up. it should be possible to play as a rouge type character, sneaking in and stealing the loot.equally, in a real scenario, if you'd just won the fight, then you'd be able to start shooting any looter that turned up, without fear of concord intervention. i liked the idea someone suggested about any player that loots from a player wreck loses their concord protection for a short time. adds risk to the looter, but also doesn't just hand the loot to the winner of a fight on a silver plate."

5/25/2009,/signedthis and fuel bricks could just save poss :)
5/25/2009,"totally supported. it is ridiculous that someone can effectively moon-squat for zero cost, yet because they are in highsec, for anyone else to clean up requires a full-on wardec. this is not balanced, either in relation to what happens in lowsec (you can go straight in and blow up the tower), not in relation to any other corp game mechanics (you don't pay your office rent for a month? you're kicked out)."
5/25/2009,"idea as ""detailed"" (or rather not detailed) by op not supported.make some effort to flesh out an idea, dammit - who exactly should be able to unanchor it at which cost to what benefit under which circumstances?"
5/25/2009,i like that idea
5/25/2009,supported
5/25/2009,good ideas!
5/25/2009,"that's a problem of 2 things in eve, it's economy, and it's sov. if you were to fix the economy so that losing a ship actually hurt you financially, even a frigate to more of an extent than it does now, you'd see progress. if you then fixed the sov so that defending entities actually had reason to fear losing their space easily, then you'd see even more progress.take a look at the alliance size rankings, you'll find about 70 alliances over 500 members. how many of those do you see holding a pocket of space. maybe 20. everyone wanted the game to be a cookie cutter cake walk were combat was more about how many ships can i throw at you rather than how will you fight against me. dd were added to compensate for this massive failure, but what happened was, nobody cared about the ships they were losing, only the ability to have the fun fights that fleets could now have with 30 backup ships per pilot waiting. dd ended good fights for most attacking alliances, so rather than attack, most would rather defend now. mom's and titans were added, but the dev's didn't think about the rule of 10 which means anything major and new added should always be 10x more than what is currently a high price. titans were meant to be alliance goals, yet now you have random people self funding them on a whim. imagine if they cost 400 bil rather than 40, you wouldn't see them in the same light. now, every alliance has several, but their original intent was for a select few... those willing to work together. truth be told, i don't blame the devs for trying to make money. i do blame them for not trying to find a balance between what they once had and what they've created. what's really a shame is that now that we have these 1000v1000 player epic and potential fights and servers that can actually hold them, nobody is willing to take them because of the ****ed up mechanics. it's almost funny that the dev's can't hide behind the lag issue anymore, now they have to address their own errors, and that's going to be a much bigger challenge."
5/25/2009,"i'm really a bit amazed. nothing in this thread makes any difference.it all comes down to ""i'm suggesting this and that because when push comes to shove my guys are fine because it already is our strategy to pump over a dozen titans into a system to achieve objectives without a fight. once the mechanisms change we can just bring a dozen more to achieve the same result"".what is the real problem here? the ship, the doomsday, or players?"
5/25/2009,"i might support this if the vuk could re-phrase his op to make clear, exactly what he is proposing. as it is, all i get are a general idea (make supercaps stronger), some links to other ideas and suggestions to maybe do this or that or why not this, too?p.s.: is it really still possible to edit an op in this section?"
5/25/2009,"you're assuming this is the only change expected. it's not, it's one on a long road to 0.0 recovery and revamp. however, it makes no sence to pool in sov mechanics, insurance, ratting, pos and all the other crap into this thread. you start small, and work one problem at a time."
5/25/2009,"no, it's not an assumption. 0.0 in more respects then one needs a complete revamp. it would - as digi pointed out elsewhere - a complete expansion to do that, this however is not commercially feasible. 0.0 is just not that big of a niche to warrant such a marketing investment.so, yes, it'll have to be step by step. the first danger of this is that we have often seen ccp come up with something only to implement it at a much later time when circumstances and player behaviour have changed so much that the changes come across as ""kneejerk"" behaviour, instead of a sound gradual approach.the second danger is that both on a technical level, as well as on a customer level (behaviour) everything is so complex and interconnected that doing things step by step gets very close to coming off as somewhat incompatible with ccp's recently adopted development method. while it enables them to pump out a lot in relatively short time, it does not provide much depth or a lot of room for preventing issues that arise from complexity.having said that, we all know ccp wants to do a good job, i just worry a bit that it is vulnerable to dropping pieces during design or implementation. look at apocrypha expansion for example, or the recent jumpbug drama.ya know, as long as all those little steps on that big road deal just with features and not with how we (ab)use them and go nuts with them, it's just pushing the problem ahead of us. at least that's how it feels to me.besides that, by the time a small step hits us, we're well beyond the situation during which that step was designed."
5/25/2009,"this whole thread is about balancing the fleet, make a proper suggestion that doesn't unbalance the fleet even more than what it already is, i like your setup there, but there is one problem that just makes it all to easy for new beginners or old players moving into mining career and thats the fact that you've set the covetor one level to low making it unbalanced. there need to be a certain buffer between the retriver and the covetor at the same time we provide a proper buffer between the covetor and the hulk.i suggest it like this:mining barge1 - first tier mining barge2 - retriever3 - na4 - coveter5 - naexhumers1 - first tier t2 barge2 - second tier t2 barge3 - hulk4 - na5 - nathen we don't ask of to much and it remains a proper buffer that will bring a proper balance to the mining barge flotilla and doesn't make it to easy nor to hard, it's just perfect ;)"
5/25/2009,i support system suggested above
5/25/2009,"full support to reducing the skill requirement for a covetor in order to make them, once again, a viable stop along the career path.[ingame since beta testing -- i remember mining in a vexor because i couldn't afford a battleship yet.]***related issue -- named t1 mining lasers [meta level 3, etc.] are approximately useless, even on an osprey. there are way too many t2s at far too low a price in the game."
5/25/2009,"/signedas a newbie player like you describe, i've not long had my retriever and i'm much enjoying it - but i've started the learning parth towards the covertor, because i assumed the progression curve was balanced and that it'd be a good stepping stone to the hulk. now i've read this, i'm switching my plan to go straight for hulk.i should have run the numbers i guess, but even so, i'd have been disapointed to have handed over the cash for a covetor and then discover how little was required to get the hulk."

5/25/2009,"once your using primarily t2 gear, it's easy to forget how useful t1 drops can be to players just starting out or just moving to a new area, where production doesn't necessarily match demand. a fair few players rely on those t1 drops to equip their ships, test new loadouts, and so on.removing 40% of the ""legitimate"" mineral flow also increases the proportion of the mineral flow that comes from macro miners."
5/25/2009,the reason for your request is basically sound but even i will concede that it should be done as part of a proper industry/mining expansion.
5/25/2009,but it decreases the amount that come from sweatshop ratters and missioners...
5/25/2009,"balance is the key to success --overall, loot could be reduced by 1/2 with little effect on game play, but it has to be done with some forethought.maybe 10 thru 08 systems and equal level sites and missions, loot tables retain t1 ordinary mods [meta level 1]. new players actually use these mods when they're starting out.in 05 thru 07 [plus sites/missions of equal difficulty], meta level 1 mods aren't in loot tables, but level 3 mods are addedin low sec, only meta level 3 and 4 mods spawn with faction or officer mods from the odd elite rat only.and in deep space, only meta level 4, faction, and officer mods spawn at all.***reducing the loot tables by 1/2 or more would reduce the isk added every day to the game and thus would put downward pressure on prices [players would generate fewer resources per day of play and thus could afford to pay less].this would partly compensate for the isk added via the addition of salvage to the game and the net impact of w-space systems.[for those who are interested, i've been ingame since beta testing so i do have some experience to guide my suggestions.]"
5/25/2009,i'd mine veldspar in 0.0 more if the roids didn't insta pop once they got some attention.having roids pop every 2.3 minutes is a pain to manage especially if running multiple hulks. did it once... never again. i'll buy trit or not build stuff before i mine veld again :p
5/25/2009,"so, you think too much minerals are being generated from reprocessing t1 loot? in that case it seems you should argue that certain items yield too much minerals. removing those things from loot tables although obviously npc ships can be expected to have equipped just that before blown to bits seems unreasonable, especially since you do not offer a good in-game reason for this change.not supported.edit: good to see that your proposal is more important than all the others, though, you having so kindly labled it thus."

5/25/2009,"i have clearly not paid this section of the forums enough attention in the past. i feel i would like to amend this, yet i am slightly confused as to how this is supposed to work. if there is a faq or similar, please point the way, i have not seen it.as far as i could gather, this section is reserved for a player to present a concrete, well-considered proposal to the general community, having it dicussed by their peers and hoping it to be supported by enough of them with a thumbs up. then, if a certain amount of votes in support are garnered, or if the proposal finds the personal support of a current csm member, the csm will have to discuss and vote for the proposal to be presented to cpp. correct?now, i wonder about some things:- i see threads starting with [proposal], [issue], [suggestion], [idea], [request], and other, similar ones. is that all the same or are these threads to be regarded differently for some reason?- i see threads just stating a general opinion about an issue or offering a variety of possible solutions to a problem. does it make sense to support such things if you generally agree, seeing as this could only be presented to cpp by the csm with great difficulty?- i see players voicing their opposition to some proposals without offering any reasons or discussion. does that negatively impact on the likelihood that a proposal will be taken up by the csm?- i see ops being edited by their authors after people already stated their support. shouldn't the author make a new thread if he or she wants to change or amend his or her proposal?- i see players discussing proposals and then voicing their support not for the original proposal but actually for certain points that came up in that discussion. are they aware that they are really supporting the original proposal as suggested in the op?- i see proposals that were originally proposed more than a year ago still generating discussion and still garnering some sporadic support. a lot has happened in that past year - can such an issue still be taken up by the csm?- i see some issues being raised again and again. some of them have even been rejected by either the csm or cpp in the past. does it make sense to raise such issues once more?- i see the csm has made a really nice wiki that is much more structured and user-friendly to get an idea what has been discussed before. thanks. will it ever be brought up to date again, and/or include a faq that answers questions such as these?"

5/25/2009,"sure why not, it could be alot more accurate than most killboards."
5/25/2009,"i support the idea of more communication from ccp and transgaming. speaking as someone who used the previous, official, linux client the amount of feedback on it from the people developing the thing was simply attrocious. i also see the same thing in the mac sub-forum. ""two weeks until premium content"" and then the plug being pulled on the whole client springs to mind. we need to know what you are doing. if you introduce a major bug we'd like to see details of when a fix is due, how the progress on this fix is working... when the fix is sent out for testing. even 140 odd characters used in a twitter feed would be suffcient."
5/25/2009,"might as well give them a break.now if you could combine this with a right click on character in local to report them for isk spam, instead of making a petition that lags you to death, that included what they said in its autop generated non laggy report?"
5/25/2009,"i can feel your pain, but i think it will be mostly worthless to have somebody monitor the channels for bots. the people who do spam recycle their characters at a rate that would put to shame even the most devout ecologist.imho, they should give details about the legal and illegal methods of acquiring isk as an emphasized part of the account creation process. the mere knowledge that there are completely legal methods of acquiring isk would both virtually eliminate the illegal spammers and aid those of us who pay for our accounts using etcs."

5/25/2009,"i see advetisement, ow, looks like cool game, let's get the trial... ok, rookie channel, ok, guys, how do you do missions? what? i am a rookie and i cannot ask questions in rookie channel? then who is gonna talk in rookie channel, whta is it for? this is a very big problem. edit: reported 2 spammers."
5/25/2009,that would be true. but i still think some one would end up buying it from isk sellers. as they really don't know what is leagal or not.not quite shure this would work. i don't think that a isd member can mute or ban.
5/25/2009,"i started a 21 day trial just to see how the new player experience was (much better than the past!)... in my 21 days i filed 47 isk spam petitions from the rookie channel and 6 or so from the corp channel... and that's only putting in a few minutes to set up training ques each day!yes, ccp definately needs to take a look at the rookie channel, even if all they do is hire a few new low wage interns who do nothing but watch the channel and r-click = ban spammers on sight.no need to conduct an investigation, no need for anyone to file a petition, the spammer is just gone, end of story.they also need to implement the r-click 'spam' option that instablocks the spammer (from whatever channel) for the individual who used the selection. when enough spam reports add up the person is gagged for a rather lengthy period of time (think a few hours). if this continues, they're banned pending an investigation.enough said."
5/25/2009,"two fairly easy (labour-unintensive) possible solutions, surprised no one has implemented similar options before -maintain a database of isk selling sites. any message in a public channel that includes one of those addresses is auto-censored. could auto-censor on other common isk-seller terms too.anyone who is blocked by 5 or more people in rookie chat within 30 seconds is prevented from posting to that chat again pending review by isd or staff."
5/25/2009,just add a tool for volunteers to easily silence trial accounts only from talking in public channels.
5/25/2009,"this tbh, we already have rookie channel ""mentors""? i seem to remember some from my early days in eve.if the mentors could right click ban it would solve the problem, allowing other people to right click report with an auto ban/review would open up a method of griefing so not in favour of that."
5/25/2009,"the problem with this is the same problem with the text-only spam filtering in email. it works for about 5 minutes. consider this:www.eveonline.comwww.eveonline.comthey pretty much look exactly to you don't they? but i can assure you the software sees something completely different.all that aside, i do support the absolute banning, without possibility of revocation, those found to be buying and/or selling isk from an unacceptable source."
5/25/2009,"remove rookie channel or allow players willing to stay in there to stay in there and be pm'd by ""rookies"" who actually need help. most answers to things can be answered in the evelopedia or should be. perhaps if people read they will find their answer. have you gone through the new player system recently? it's pretty informative. it's not hard to create work arounds that suffice. this more so detriments or stops isk sellers and spam scams versus forcing new players to convo people and ask. not a big problem at all.again, nerf trial accounts speaking ability."
5/25/2009,"this is not a problem with links, because links have to be resolveable by a dns server. if a dns server doesn't resolve them to the right ip address, they don't work. and dns server code is public domain. in fact, you could be really clever and use a dns server to store your database of isk sellers. every link in a public message gets resolved on your special dns server - if it returns the ip address of a known isk seller or a flag value showing the link is known to be an isk seller the message gets blocked."
5/25/2009,"personaly i beleave that ecm how it is now ( even after the change) are still most powerfull module in the game and must be complitely revisited. but i will leave hereby without any more propose to change it in any way... since there have been plenty of topics relating this heavy discussion.what i strogly beleave is that what make this module close to ( i win ) hardware is that it can be very successfully used on the biger ship clases then it own hull class.what i want to purpose here is that the ecm effects must be seperated by ship classes where it can be successfully used without changing module it self.so generely speaking it will looks like this:all frigat hull ecm ships (include t2 versions) will be only succesfull by jamming they own class hulls + destroyer classbut not on higher hull classes as cruiser/battlecruiser/battleship hull'sall cruiser hull ecm based ships will be succesfull on it is own hull class ( including t2 and t3 versions) + battlecruiser hull and smaler hulls then its own class.still wont be successfull on the bigger class then its own, in this case battleship hull and above.the battleship hull ecm based ship will be the only counterpart to it is own hull class ( and below {bc}cruiser/frigat). in short.... if you want to use ecm successfully on the bigger class hull then its own you have to bring size capable ship to do so. otherwise you will have stick to your own class hull to be usefull on jamming.i beleave this will solve lost of frustrations and actualy balancing this module in the way how it fits in game.apologies for bad english... i did my best."
5/25/2009,ofc i support this idea since it was brouth by me.
5/25/2009,wow...no...no other mechanic forces this. even weapon systems to a degree....this is just a terrible idea. no support.--isaac
5/25/2009,"no, we already have sensor strength to enforce a similar mechanic, and this is an absurd and unnecessary mechanic. not supported."
5/25/2009,and that is exactly the problem since sensor strength of battleship hull class is way to weak vs target jamming strength of the falcon or even blackbird cruiser hull class.at the moment how it is now the battleship class hull have chance from low to zero to counter lower class ships jamming strength... and that is what make the ecm so powerfull in curent state.
5/25/2009,"if you are not content with the performance of your battleship, i suggest you pay less for it next time or buy another ship entirely. if there are none that suit your needs, suggest the gods of invention gift someone, somewhere with a blueprint according to your own ideas.not supported."
5/25/2009,"blackbird, 1 of each racial, 2 sda, vs dominix:0 eccm = 81.6%1 eccm = 54.5%2 eccm = 33.9%so yeah, a single cruiser can disable a single battleship(barring those pesky hammerhead ii that have a tendency to rip said cruiser a new one) most of the time, unless the battleship uses countermeasures, in which case the cruiser isn't in such a nice position at all. remember, jamming ships only get jamming, nothing else about them is any good. yes, in ideal circumstances they do nicely, but if anything goes wrong, they're screwed."
5/25/2009,"well how about it please? the few ""upbeat"" songs in the game cant be listened to regularly in the jukebox.67 songs of low tempo melodrama can induce narcolepsy couple examples i could find"

5/25/2009,"i was just thinking of how much effort the human race undertakes in real life in the attempt to research all aspects of the space, its history, its nature and composition. eve on the contrary, despite its well educated playerbase, and despite the fact that there are so many research and science related npc corps around, is only about ships or modules. all aspects of the game, including the industry and also the research that can be done is all about modules and ships, narrowing it down to combat in the end as the one and only motto of the game. while this isnt wrong, the immersion of the game could be much deeper if we could also get into researching eve<U+FFFD>s universe itself (ingame lore anyone??).now on to the questions of: what would be the point of it all, and what should the rewards be. then: should it be implemented as a standalone thing, or should it heavily interfere with the other professions that we can already go after? and then: how could it be implemented without to much effort on the devs side, and with generating a good cost-benefit ratio regarding the development process. and finally: how would it be, gameplay-wise?1. first off: the point of it would be to generate income, or it would be a meaningless profession, as much as this principle counts for all the other professions too. but it would be another way to generate income, thus making the game even more fun. its simple as that. the more different things we can do in-game, the more fun it is.2.what should the rewards be? see paragraph 1. with the added reward of having accomplished something towards understanding the universe and new eden a little bit more.3.at first it should be a standalone thing, to not overcomplicate things. trading with npc goods is also a standalone thing, and can be fun every now and then. so i cant see any issue of having another standalone game feature.my definition for standalone: doesnt interfere with other game features, other than letting the player generate isk (if they chose to spend their time doing science jobs, instead of, lets say, running lvl 4 missions)although they could combine science related activities with some npc killing as well. would spice up things. but ill elaborate on that in paragraph 4.4. how could it be implemented: i would say by implementing science related tasks or jobs that are given out by npc<U+FFFD>s. there was once this idea about scientific ships. yea, those could be brought on the table here again. accomplishing these tasks would require an appropriate scientific ship. the scientific ships, as much as the scientific tasks, could come in two, up to five tiers (depends on how much effort the devs would be willing to put into it). as much as we have five tiers of missions....for example if you wanted to accomplish a tier 4 scientific task, you couldnt finish it unless you had a tier 4 scientific ship. lower ships just couldnt handle the difficulty and/or complexity of the given task.a scientific ship would have some combat abilities to fight off unforeseen threats, but also have the capability to fit specialized laboratories and scanners."
5/25/2009,"5. how would a scientific task look like?here comes the real essence of my idea: these tasks could be anything, from very simple to very advanced. some examples for simple tasks: go to sun x in solarsystem x and research the exact chemical makeup of it. or: we have received information about increased sunspot activity at sun x in solarsystem x. go there and research if it could be a threat to nearby stations.or: we have received information about an unknown species of asteroids in location x in solarsystem y. go there and research the chemical makeup of them. (uh oh as soon you warp there a bunch of guristas with their own reasearch convoy shows up, looks like they are interested in the makeup of those roids as well. now youll have to do some pew pew before you can get on with the research)the possibilities are endless.more advanced tasks would deal more and more with the universal aspects of the universe / new eden, while simple tasks would deal with local aspects of the solar system or planetary systems.more advanced tasks could be similar to escalations: the agent first sends you to a specific location, but then the task escalates on to new locations in different solar systems. you get the idea."
5/25/2009,"intriguing.needs to have the bones fleshed out, but i would train for something like this. it would be different and fun."
5/25/2009,"maybe? it's the sort of wacky mini-profession eve can add easily, but i have concerns about dev time, and your proposal is rather lacking in meat. it might be a good idea, but it's a lot of work and thus a very low priority. i'd say take it to f+i, play around with it a little, and see if you can get some support there. the devs do sometimes read it, you might get them thinking along those lines. that said, this is a little bit too far off in the distance to really justify a csm endorsement, i'd say. no thumb, even if i am intrigued."
5/25/2009,"tonyg's ""popularity"" in player's community is second only to t20's reputation, and the latter is no longer with ccp. as was pointed out elsewhere by other players, it is amusing (to say the least) that one of the top marketing people at ccp is generating so much negative feelings amongst the arguably most loyal customer base. putting tonyg in charge of retconning the eve's canon is wrong on every level."
5/25/2009,most definitely.need for credibility and consistency > tonyg's ego > eve lore > tonyg's literary abilities
5/25/2009,"i think it would be really cool to see some dread guristas, blood raider, khanid navy, angel, gistii, ect, carriers, motherships, and dreads. just give them a new paintjob if you dont have the time to make new models, give them some sick bonuses, and make them cost a bunch of lp for a blue print.id buy one. caldari navy chimera/wyvern, weeeeee!"
5/25/2009,"you're going to need a far better reason than ""because it'd be cool"" before i support this. yeah, it'd be cool in a narrow sense, but how are the existing faction ships cool if every ship has a half-dozen faction variants? i'm not totally opposed to making new faction ships, but game design isn't about pleasing people in the short term, it's about pleasing them in the long term. just throwing around bigger and shinier every time you get bored is a terrible way to do that."
5/25/2009,it would be easy to implement and would give people more goals to work for. i have run out of things to train almost. may as well throw in some faction caps...people have money to spend ya know.
5/25/2009,"faction ships have nothing to do with training. faction ships have about the same skill requirements as their t1-counterpart. and capital ships needs a revision. as such, adding faction ships is pointless. ccp also have a lot of other things to do, which will benefit the game more than just ""fuzz"", which this is."
5/25/2009,are you going to cry?
5/25/2009,"anyway, there are navy issue cruisers and battleships, so why cant ccp just change the color of the carriers/dreads, give them a 10% boost or something across the board on shields/armor/structure, call it a navy version, and give us all something else to slave towards with our isk.i would like the option of spending 5-10x the normal isk on a navy issue version"
5/25/2009,/signed for humorous terminator reference
5/25/2009,"funny, i was just thinking about this the other day. fully support this, would spice things up for sure. imagine the tears from someone being afk losing a costly ship to sleepers."
5/25/2009,"i dont like the idea. it seem to undermine the efforts made in wormhole space and smells like greed, as if battling sleepers in highsec would lead to sleeper rig components."
5/25/2009,that is all. the rampant inflation will only continue. ( i.e. mission runners income )i recognize things like lp store items and skills are already huge isk sinks. however i believe we need more isk sinks weather direct or indirect.i could type something more credible and lengthy. but post your thoughts below.
5/25/2009,"if ccp thinks that the current level of monetary inflation is unsustainable for the economy, they will do something about it."
5/25/2009,"fair enough, they do have an economist on board. regardless, i've been a marketeer for over a year now... and soon things like titans may not be so expensive and out of reach as they used to be or intended to be. ( from my experience at least watching market trends.)"
5/25/2009,"i see your point entirely. but the fact that there's virtually unlimited supply of isk and minerals, creates a deflationary effect, which is inherent to this system. that goes for any mmo, basically."
5/25/2009,unlike most mmos eve has great costs and risks on ships. think about it... in wow you die.. it cost's a penny effort to fix your crap. here if you lose a decent ship it takes quite a bit of money to replace it. i believe ccp is already focused on this with their economist.
5/25/2009,the ironic thing is that insurance is a giant source of inflation
5/25/2009,"yeah, i know. eve is the only game i can think of where pvp is inflationary and pve is deflationary. that said, aside from the fallout to the reactor exploit, there's no inflation in eve as of the last info we have. the trend has historically been slow deflation. if that changes, i'm sure they have ways to deal with it."
5/25/2009,"flog the dead horse and have done with it,a pos should work the same as a station"
5/25/2009,"the problem with this is the same problem that caused the pos exploit. if the items are stored in a different location, the module has to make a status check, aka a database call, on whether the raw materials are present in the other location, and the other location (the pos tower, in this case) has to respond with another pipe of data.this might not seem like much, but considering how many poses are in service and the amount of modules the poses contain, the number of database calls would be disabling to the servers. the devs made a shortcut to just save two calls per hour, and that cost them a huge mistake in the game's economic history.while it might seem like a good idea, this concept is completely unfeasible. sorry, but i cannot support it due to the overhead required."
5/25/2009,"i know i've talked to you in-game, but this should probably be addressed in thread too. i don't think you've quite got what i'm asking for here. there would be no need to check multiple places when starting a job(i agree, that would break the database), because there wouldn't be multiple places to check. the pos would have exactly one hangar, and thus there would only be one check. i'm not a dev, and i don't know for a fact that this can be done. but my intuition, which isn't usually too terrible, says it can probably be done. a fair number of people, including one of your fellow csmers, seem to agree. i think it's worth asking the question, since that's really what the csm is best at. the csm have brought up topics before where the initial idea was rejected but another path to the same solution was found. one of my topics started as ""change ammo in all guns at once"" and ended as weapon grouping - not the same thing, but the same ultimate result, and instead of causing lag it actually reduced it. in that case, we didn't get what we asked for, but we certainly got what we wanted. if this thread ends up in the same place, i'll be more than happy, but we can't do that if we use lines like ""well, i'm not sure it's possible"". if you know it's impossible, fine, reject me. i don't see any way for anyone outside ccp to know whether it is or not - if you have info on this topic, let me know, and point me to it if it's not under nda. but from what i can tell, this is all guesswork. we both want it to be done, i think there's a good chance it can be done in a reasonable amount of time without breaking anything, you don't, but neither of us really knows. let's ask the people who do."
5/25/2009,"be that as it may, sooner or later the devs will have no choice but rework the entire pos coding.since they insist on making us depend on poses more and more, there will be more people using them - and getting annoyed, eventually perhaps to a point of leaving the game.instead of chosing to ignore the issue until it's too late (and knee-jerk hotfixes are applied) they should man up and fix it.just saying ""it's too much work, it's too much work"" over and over again won't help.ignorance may be bliss, but it doesn't fix problems. i tried, more than once..."
5/25/2009,"hi omber,what is your stance on aggression flags for salvaging wrecks?"
5/25/2009,"i should go find my exact quote from the minutes this was discussed in, but in general my idea was to have time limited flags for both the corp of the people who owned the original ship destroyed and the corp of the people that destroyed it, something like 5 minutes. whoever salvaged/looted it first got the stuff. after that time limit expired, the wreck became available to everyone to loot/salvage."

5/25/2009,"part 2 i think is a valid complaint that should be addressed. yet another tiny flaw in the eve ui that needs correction, and i'm all for that.part 1, while interesting, is a minor cosmetic change that, really, would only do so much for the game. however, that doesn't mean i'm against it. like i've told some others, if its important to you, flesh is out, make an ideas thread, pull together some support for it. give me a link to that thread. if you can show me popular support, i'll support it in the csm."
5/25/2009,"i must say, despite disagreeing with some of the concepts herschel puts forward, he does seem to be the one that cares most about the game and its future. i submitted my lone vote for him, and look forward to his term on the council if others agree with me."

5/25/2009,my view: they're garbage and need a complete ui overhaul.
5/25/2009,this.
5/25/2009,"erik certainly does and he also has some interesting plans for 0.0 infrastructure development that would benefit providence immensely, i'd say.that and he's a roleplayer, what else do you want?"
5/25/2009,maybe erik to actually speak for himself?
5/25/2009,"erik assigned me to do his forum talking, the complaining about it is getting old now.it the message that's important, not the messenger. if you want to hear him speak, watch the movie."
5/25/2009,"i agree. the roles and permissions interface is confusing and needs an overhaul. in fact, a great deal of the ui needs an overhaul.however, pirate mining crystals would be pretty cool ;)"
5/25/2009,"i think corp tools are pretty decent atm, and a lot of people don't make full use of them. however the interface is absolutely terrible and really needs a look at.off-topic - mitnal"
5/25/2009,i say screw it all lets have a drink. i think corps need a better interface when it comes to giving roles and their explanations. my first time being a director i wish i had a guide book. i know eve has a step learning curve and that is what brought me to the game but this is a part of the game that can have a huge affect on many people in the game and needs to be clearer. more control over certain such as pos control and general actions that have a wide spread affect on many character is needed and a clearer explanation of the roles.
5/25/2009,cleaned.off-topic posts removed.
5/25/2009,"since i speak for myself, and always will- corp ui stuff is pretty good (could do with a few tweaks and changes) but the interface is confusing and needs work.xavier"
5/25/2009,"this should be brought up, i do not think this is working as intended. you cannot inject a skill before the prerequisites are obtained.meaning, for example, towards the end of his skill queue, my character will be done learning instant recall iv in approximately 21 hours. afterwards, i want to train eidetic memory i, ii, and iii. there is room on the queue for at least rank i and ii- but i can't put them in the queue, because the skill isn't injected.normally the last skill that fits can run over the 24 hour limit, but in this instance, my queue is smaller than 24 hours and is going to inconvenience me. to get around it, i have to train less efficiently, or train a skill i don't really want to be training right now.proposed fix: let any skill be injected. only check if the requirements are met when it's put in the skill training queue, so that, when i queue all the prerequisites, i can immediately queue into the appropriate skill.if ccp does not want free skill injection, perhaps instead let ""yellow circles"" suffice for injection, but green checkmarks are required to actually train the skill to level 1. to prevent injection of every prerequisite, turn 0 sp ""injected"" skill to ""orange circles"", and once it has at least 1 sp (meaning the prerequisites have all been met), it will be a yellow circle in other skills requirements, and those skills will be injectable."
5/25/2009,"i have found this occasionally frustrating... but i see too much potential for workarounds. no, its not optimal to have to wait until instant recall iv is done in order to queue up eidetic memory i... but you have 2 options- queue up another skill until it will be convenient for you to change it, or log on to change it when instant recall iv is done, just like you would have had to prior to the skill queue.your idea has some merit, i'm not going to say its a bad idea... but i'm not seeing implementation as likely.the skill queue is a serious improvement. it means you don't have to sit online for 4 hours while you train a bunch of skills to level 1. it means that you can set most skills to start up to 24 hours before the previous skill finishes, making 4:00 am alarms for skillchanges much less necessary.other candidates may disagree with me, but my opinion is that you should mostly just be thankful for the skill queue as it currently is.garthran"
5/25/2009,"kids these days don't know they're born tbh... in my day we didn't have a skill queue, or double training speed for new characters, or a fancy pants tutorial.i do feel your pain sometimes... but that's just the way it goes. the skill queue is an amazing system and i think ccp didn't want the process to be completely automated and afk. you're still going to have to wait to learn the good stuff i'm afraid."
5/25/2009,"this was already raised on the assembly hall. i fully agree with you - something this fundamental to the game really ought to be given the easiest ui possible, not the ""log in at 4 am"" nonsense of yore - but this is the wrong forum and redundant."

5/26/2009,"i get the feeling i'm being trolled, but just in case...don't you ever read patch notes? or look in the game development forum? ships get tweaked in almost every patch. recent examples being the naglfar, falcon and rook, and stealth bombers. stealth bombers in particular were quite drastically changed. the problem with the current afs is that they are very expensive for a frigate hull yet don't receive the 4 bonuses that all other t2 ships get. making an even more expensive version is a terrible solution, and there is no precedent for that kind of approach to balancing."
5/26/2009,"supported, concept is good, but the devil is in the details."
5/26/2009,"i would like to lend support for this topic. the assault frigates need their rightful forth bonus. granted i don't know what it would be (i've only flown the enyo and ishkur during my carrer, and the ishkur recently)i would try like a combat utility and ecm drone bonus for the ishkur; but even that might be too much."
5/26/2009,"yeah, they are really underpowered."
5/26/2009,"not trolling you, just stating my opinion out of principle. things in a persistent world should not be changed unless absolutely necessary. a poorly designed ship could easily be succeeded by a new, improved version whose advantages are actually worth the slightly highere price. or it could be succeeded by a new, much cheaper version profiting from a significant production shortcut, getting things in balance as well.mind, your solution is clearly simpler and more conventional, but i just don't think it is the best way to introduce change into a virtual world."
5/26/2009,full aggression penalties should be applied.
5/26/2009,absolutely valid! dual flagging to can owner and destroyer of ship looks like valid solution.
5/26/2009,"i can see what these guys are trying to say to a point. however, i do not believe the solution is completely valid. if operating in high sec it is a fact that concord does not allow one to destroy another pilot's ship without them getting involved. even if that person is a loot thief, you do not have the right to attack them without concord intervention except in the case if it is your loot because you just got wacked bye someone. blowing someone up does not mean you now own their stuff.one crime does not allow another crime to be valid. it does seem though that the crime of stealing is somewhat being allowed without much risk. so, what is there to be done? how about all crimes in high sec be considered felonies, so to speak, thus allowing all pilots to utilize citizen arrest for crimes (blowing up offenders ship). attacking someone, you flash red to all. stealing from someone, you flash red to all. a war dec nullifies all involvement from concord and standard citizens. meaning, if someone comes along and steals loot from the wreck of someone's war target, they in essence are making themselves war targets by getting involved in the dispute.i guess what it boils down to is the policy does seem to need some re-examing to determine what is fair and balanced for everyone."
5/26/2009,"absolutely, but if you're gonna plan a robbery, you have to also plan your escape and how dangerous it becomes getting away from the scene also."

5/26/2009,"as someone who is rather underwhelmed by the fact that all the training i've done to utilize increasingly specialized forms of mining technology only gets me a few more percentage points in yield per hour, i offer complete support to all the changes proposed by the op.the idea of using a survey scanner to see which asteroids have the best ""density"" of the type of ore(s) you are looking for, and picking those asteroids to mine while ignoring those of lesser quality, makes far more sense than the current method whereby you simply vacuum up every pebble in sight because there's no significant variation between them, moving from belt to belt as you clear them of recently-spawned gravel until you are out of time or fall asleep from boredom.analyzing a massive boulder consisting of a multitude of strata including different ores in varying richness, picking the crystals appropriate for harvesting the ore or ores that are most useful or profitable to you, and deciding when to stop mining those ores from a certain body - not when your mining laser ""finds it a pale shadow"" but when you decide that the yield you're getting has fallen below the point of profitability - would make a far more interactive system of mining than the current system which encourages macro-mining due to the sheer repetitiveness and lack of decision-making involved. and add to that the idea of having to locate these large asteroids in the first place, some of which may have been passed over by other fellow miners due to a poor composition or other reasons, and you might even achieve a bit of excitement once in a while when you scan some unprepossessing rock and suddenly realize that you've ""struck gold"" and will be raking in valuable ore at a rate approaching the theoretical maximum yield of your mining systems for an extended period of time.../support"
5/26/2009,"why aren't you running for csm for the last month or so i have mined more or less everyday in the same stationless 0.5 khanid system, so naturally i mine the same belt(s), keeping my own mining spreadsheet i have noticed a trend, now these are the numbers i've pulled for fiery kernite;5794 +7097 +7097 +7097 +4545 +7097 +4545 +2787 +7097 +2787 +5794 +7083 +2787these are the numbers for dense veldspar;55558 +39415 +60536 +10272 +60536 +10272 +29324 +60535 +10273 +21993 +46052 +60535 +10273 +46052 +55558 +20200notice how i have the exact same numbers pop up again and again. f.ker 7097 5 times, 4545 twice, 5794 twice, 2787 three times.as i jetcan mine the numbers for dense veldspar are less similar as it tends to ""overflow"" into the next jetcan and i input the two different values as opposed to putting in the ""day"" amount, but even so; 60535/60536 4 times, 46052 twice, 55558 twice.if it's at the point where i am mining not only the same belts, but precisely the same roids then yes; mining needs an overhaul.if i was completely and utterly anal i could keep a spreadsheet that showed each individual roid and set-up a plan to mine each roid from most profitable to least profitable, warping from precise bookmark to precise bookmark to mine one or two roids then move to the next, till all veld in the system is gone, then scor, then ker, with my orca/hauler keeping up behind me, no need to worry about a tank, no need to worry about drones, i'd only be spending 2 or three minutes in each bookmark anyway.with that kind of precise and complete predictability where is the incentive not to macro.[/end rant 1][begin rant 2]also i would like to add that there is a need for greater diversity in mining ships, only six ships in total and two support ships! not to mention that the retriever and hulk are the only ones used (except mackinaws with ice mining).if i fly missions or 0.0 blob then i have a choice of 6 frigates, 4 crusiers and 3 battleships per race, plus at least 1 tech 2 per ship and then add in faction variaties and i have at least 30 ships per race to fly around in, then add in support, logistics and command ships and that blows out to 40+ ships per race, each with it's own specific purpose and bonuses, so i can have a highly specialised 0.0 blob flying around.rather than just having ore as the be-all-and-end-all of mining maybe we could have 1 or 2 other npc mining factions with bpo/bpc's that have bonuses to specific types of roid (like a skiff has +60% to merc per level, maybe we could have one that was +10% to veld per level) and they should have a different skill tree so that mining-barge and exhumer belong to ore ships, but (for example) high sec specialists frigate and high sec specialists crusier belong to the high sec specialists ships separate and distinct from ore skill tree. we could also have mining modules and euipment made by another 1 or 2 different npc corps. ore can't possible be the only corp in the eveverse that has a stake in mining!sorry if i got a bit off topic from the op, got a bit caught up in it. wow only 668 characters left!!"

5/26/2009,why dont we remove moderation completely from coad?
5/26/2009,"the approach i raised during the 1st csm, was to have a self-moderation system, whereby players awarded a value to individual ops and replies; eg. 1-5 stars. players who accurately rated good posts got more weighting to their stars (up to a max of range 1-5). players who consistently rated poor content as good got less weighting to their stars (down to a rating of 0.01 to 0.05).n00b characters got a 0 weighting on their scores until they rated eg. 200 posts.any user can filter based on certain star ratingstaking this ""rating"" and ""weighting of your rating"" principle, you could further refine the calculation model to handle more complex attempts to abuse the system eg. alliance/corps have 0 weighting and 0 gain on rating posts by their own alliance/corp members.players rating threads that are later locked get their rating reduced to noob level againweighting for each player is per-forum. so someone uber on market forum doesn't mean uber on caod[*]i'm sure you can thing of some more simple rules?the whole weighting could be calculated off-line and applied en-mass; it might not even need to be as complex as requiring weighting if just the alliance/corp 0 value thing was used. once the model was right, that would pretty much enable players to clean it up!"
5/26/2009,"as often as this seems to come up and the major issue most people have against it is the visual identification of tech two ships, it would seem that the simple answer is if you don't want to see custom ships you don't have too. i started playing this game with premium graphics, and when i loaded eve to my laptop and noticed my comet had writing on it i was bummed out that it didn't have it in the updated skins. the only explanation i could think of for making the navy comet less cool was that it was eventually going to be allowed to be customized. most games have some ability to customize, and with the release of t3 ships we see a really cool ability to customize a ship based on how you build it. in other mmo's you change your armour and it changes it on your character. i always thought that it would be cool if the iteron started as a long ship with a cockpit section and a drive section and that cargo modules could be added to the middle to make it longer, something very much like what is done with the t3 cruisers for the most part, but not having any way to make something reflect you seems to limit the fun factor. everyone likes to customize even a little, i want my vexors to be black with green and yellow accents all dark in colour, that would be wicked. stamping it with a cooperate logo would be cool as well. for some reason i highly doubt that it would be tough to do, and for those that complain that the visual identification of a t2 ship is more important, just add the button to turn it off, were not all pirates, or 0.0 combatants.another thing i noticed was a request to have a mark to show who made the ship, maybe if something like this was in say the notes section with the logo of the constructing corp with a link to the corps info would be kinda cool. and wouldn't be visually detracting on the ship.oh, and no i don't agree with hello kitty geddons though they look wicked outside the game i don't know that they are needed in the game."
5/26/2009,we are pod pilots after all. it would seem that perhaps we want to stand out differently than all the others. i agree that some form of customizing should be implemented.
5/26/2009,"while not exactly new, this has alwas been a good idea. however, that's what the op is: an idea, not a proposal. if you want this to be taken seriously as a proposal to the csm, develop and expand your thoughts based on the discussion and feedack in this thread. make sure you find out what compromise a majority of posters would agree on. then propose a clean set of features you would like to see implemented/considered by the csm and ccp.what i would support:- corp and alliance logos on two fixed spots per ship- a small selection of colour schemes/patterns per ship- a choice of two colours from an 8 or 16 bit palette- display of custom colours and logos both optional and independent- paint job loads on grid at lowest possible priority- making sure that t2 ships still looked clearly more advanced than their t1 counterparts by having neater patterns and cooler normal maps/reflections/whatever.as to the sceptics:- you are not forced to see what you don't wish to see, simply uncheck the box. - distinguishing ship classes by their colour is just lazy. no sensible captain would colour his/her ship to suit your ease of targetting.- this proposal will not cause increased lag unless your local pc cannot handle it, in which case i suggest you reduce your settings- if humankind ever freely and individually travels the stars as thry do in eve, you can bet they will colour their ships most obnoxiously no matter how harsh and gritty their lives. - i expect the work to develop such a feature would take no more than one hour per ship, and some more to come up with an interface and qa the whole thing. not exactly huge amounts for a feature many players have been clamoring for ever since the beta."
5/26/2009,"almost a year has passed since the introduction of factional warfare. numerous issues about fw problems have been raised through the csm, and the player community have provided hundreds of helpful suggestions and discussions on improvements to the state of fw. despite all this, nothing has been done about fw since it's introduction, despite all of ccp's promises before and after fw's introduction. features that were not complete at release still lie broken and unfinished, and numerous promises made before fw launch are still unmet (consequences to system occupancy, unique missions where player standing affects outcome, unique rewards obtained only through fw, etc).now with the caldari almost occupying all of gallente space (and they'll have it all by the time this issue gets through), it would be nice if ccp revisits fw.another point that frustrates many fw players is the fact that ccp doesn't seem to have any interest in fixing bugs and problems related to fw. the lag is a constant problem and we've had promises that it would be fixed ""soon(tm) for the past 5 months now. since apocrypha, players exploit a bug in the cloaking mechanics to easily capture the npc plexes and ccp does nothing to fix it and so far has not even declared it an exploit. complexes still don't spawn as intended despite this issue being brought up in january. alliances still cannot participate in fw while the csm has raised this issue since the beginning...csm3 should take this issue to iceland and convince ccp to allocate a higher priority to fixing fw problems, and properly finish fw instead of leaving it to rot in it's current pre-nerfed and incomplete state.some related issues:unfinished expansionsshort list of problems with the game mechanicsthird time alliances in fw had to be brought up"

5/26/2009,hooray for the old intro.
5/26/2009,+zillionbackstory should be there !!!!!
5/26/2009,not supported.
5/26/2009,not supporting this proposal.i'd actually would like another solution to the bigger issue you portray. make high end mining more profitable by adding some of the rare moon minerals as an by product of the mined ores. this will have to be balance to not ruin the moons as the profitability of them gives reasons for fight. but it has to be balanced so that t2 ships will be more affordable again.
5/26/2009,"currently ships are nerfed and occasionally boosted as a result of whining on the forum. i am proposing a better, method, based upon the assumption that all ships within a class eg hac or battlecruiser, should be equally popular. if one ship is much more popular than others, like the falcon was until recently, then it should be nerfed.ccp should monitor how popular each ship is - how many are built - then every week adjust each ship to boost the unpopular ships and nerf the popular. agility, and hit points would be automatically adjusted until all ships are equally popular. if after 6 weeks with a 10% boost to both agility and hp a ship is still less popular then another ship of the same class which has had a 10% nerf to its agility and hp, then ccp should take some other action, like changing a ship bonus.auto balancing should only apply to popular ships - t1 frigates to bs, t2 frigates and cruisers. it is important that people can switch between ships of the same class, if people can only fly ships of one race, then ship popularity does not have much significance."
5/26/2009,"while a good idea, i think it would make it a total pain for the market in general. with demand comes supply, and constantly shifting the demand would cause people to hoarde ships and when balance swapped to less popular ships for builders, prices to skyrocket. on top of that, a lot of ships are geared for specific tasks that aren't always relevant to combat."
5/26/2009,equality through mediocrity... almost always a bad appproach. no support.
5/26/2009,"this is a bad idea. no, not just a bad idea, it's a really bad idea. in fact it's one of the worse ideas i have ever read on this forum. and that's saying something.people get upset now when the devs ""tweak"" things every 6 months or so. just think of the excrement storm that would happen if the devs ""tweaked"" once a week.heck, why not just come out and say for every race there is only one type of frigate, bc, bs, command ship, recon, cov ops, etc and be done with it? this will save the devs from tweaking every week and get all the whining out of the way in one sitting. this might actually get rid of a lot of lag when a lot of people leave cause the choice for ships has been drastically reduced. two birds, one stone so to speak."
5/26/2009,"i see why you want it, but i don't think it's the right approach. hp and agility aren't always the right things to balance, and forcing balance to be done by auto-adjusting those stats could lead to some really perverse situations. what we want is for the devs to do it a bit quicker(though not too much, there is such a thing as overcorrection), not for it to be taken out of their hands."
5/26/2009,i hate ur face
5/26/2009,except the popularity of a ship is absolutely no indicator of whether it's well-balanced or not.
5/26/2009,popularity is the worst type of indicator of balancing.... how blindly ignorant can you get?that's like saying one week frigates are the new bling bling and then shuttles.lets try using our heads before we post ideas ok?
5/26/2009,here's a thought - let's toss out all the ships but one.no more problems.
5/26/2009,"you mean this isn't how they do it now?minmatar popular => speed nerffalcons popular => ew nerfwatch out, we amarr are next ..."
5/26/2009,"that would be a valid argument for removing the probes form the directional scanner entirely, but that is not an excuse for a bad interface affecting gameplay. currently, you can see probes on the directional scanner, but cannot do so and use filtering at the same time. this is silly, and would be a relatively easy fix.bumped and supported"
5/26/2009,"serenity steele from eve-maps.com just sent an email to their database that is not can-spam act compliant.i'd hate to see this candidate get benefit from this illegal action.i like their maps, they might be good people, but breaking the law to get votes in a computer game is wrong.among other faults, no unsubscribe link was included."
5/26/2009,"the email also contains links which say such apparently neutral things as ""do not let your voice go to waste - vote!"" that when clicked appear to directly cast a vote for steele rather than leading merely to the voting page. so it seems he's being grossly dishonest in addition to annoying the hell out of us with his unsolicited spam.says a lot about the candidate imho."
5/26/2009,"this canidate needs to be stopped/punished. they might be a good people, but this was not a good move.i don't look forward to the spam-fest next election if this gets allowed."
5/26/2009,"well, he abused my faith in providing his website with his email. i signed up for the outpost alerts, which i have stopped receiving it seems long ago."
5/26/2009,so that's what it is. so it's not even an active double-optin list.this guy seriously need to get acquainted with his anti-spam laws.
5/26/2009,did he ask for approval to direct link the vote submission?please do not discuss this on the forums - mitnal
5/26/2009,"i can understand if you take issue to me using the eve-maps mailing list, because it doesn't relate to directly to the map book. i had diverse reactions from ""i already voted for you"" to ""good luck"" to your reaction. please consider the following in your judgement:- it is my own emailing list and domain name- i used for my own csm campaign to promoting my avatar/author of the book- it's the only message not related directly to the maps i've sent in 3 years.- the email is from my private email address on the domainin my first campaign, i appended my campaign message to the bottom of an outpost alert email, rather than making a dedicated email about it. like the first time, i'll use more discretion in the future!it is legalfor the points about it being ""illegal"", this is incorrect;the can spam act refers to commercial messages (which my email was not) and it explicitly states ""the fccs ban also does not cover non-commercial messages, such as messages about candidates for public office. "" regardless of the non-requirement; - you signed-up to my mailing list- the subject clearly stated ""eve's future: vote for serenity steele""- it was clear who the email was from- the email has a valid reply address- you can unsubscribe on the site or simply reply. you're right, i didn't add a specific unsubscribe link as it was from me personally - my bad.it is not trick codethe email contains 3 external references: my avatar:"
5/26/2009,"i wasnt going to vote at all, and then i got his email. so i start thinking about the great work he did with the maps, and thought ""why not?"". but instead of following the link, i opened the csm candidate list on the eve website to check out the other candidates. after that, i voted for serenity, with my both accounts. its said that everybody complains when someone allegedly does something wrong; but nobody notices when someone surelly does something right. good job serenity steele."
5/26/2009,"as far as i can see from his post, he did nothing wrong. however, i do worry that other candidates might use trickery such as that described earlier to get people to vote without their consent."
5/26/2009,"i've had a friend in goonswarm claim that when he tried to vote for erik, it was told that he had already voted, when he's sure he has not.worth investigating..."
5/26/2009,"drugs are bad, m'kay?"
5/26/2009,wasn't she dutch?
5/26/2009,i think we should ban goonswarm for thisthanks for all the tips for my next csm run guys
5/26/2009,what if your tax returns contained a leaflet for the major ruling party?ccp should remove serenity steele from the candidates list for pulling a stunt like this.voting should be based on the ideals of candidates and not mis usage of an in game service.
5/26/2009,"government is supposed to be impartial, eve maps is not. those two situations are not comparable. and this stunt is no worse than ""vote for me because i'm a girl"", ""vote for me because i'll bribe you"", or any of a dozen other stunts csm candidates pull all the time. i think it's a bit sleazy, but not enough to really influence my vote(even if i hadn't already voted for myself). bring it to the attention of people who will care, sure, but it's not even close to on par with including political literature in tax documents."
5/26/2009,"you bring up a good point, and another candidate brought up one as well (i'm not going to say who to maintain impartiality to my comments).first of all, the majority of eve players that i've met don't give a flying stick about who is elected for various reasons (don't care, don't believe in the system, believe it's a ccp conspiracy, etc, etc, etc). i'm one of the rare people who actually took the time to review every single candidate with a web link on the voting page (this should be a hint to future candidates!), spending a good few hours with each one to see who is the best. because it took over 24 hours, i decided to make an entire mailing list that was 20 mails deep, which covered the redeaming features of my ten most favorite candidates, and forwarded its access to all my friends, corporation, alliance, and allied corps/alliances for them to make an informed decision.most people won't take the time to do it, and thus i've come to the realization that the system is broken; if it takes me 24 hours to speak with just above half of the candidates, then i can guarantee that the majority of people on eve won't take the time to make an informed decision, instead voting along corporate lines (goonswarm, pandemic legion, band of brothers for example will get someone in guaranteed as long as they have full-alliance support), by the candidate's home country, the coolness of their avatar, or simply clicking the candidate at the top of the list (another complaint of mine).sure, there are those that spam e-mails to vote for them. i've seen another offer isk. however, i have come to the conclusion that it is necessary, because unless ccp and the csm find a way to make voting more appealing (or mandatory?), these 'underhanded' methods are here to stay, and i dare say i encourage it, especially for those who are from a small corporation, are in npc corporations, and those who have no backing except for their charms.the only way i can see voting to become more popular, is to move the entire process ingame. make an ingame applet for voting. have ingame ccp-lead debates. have ingame candidate question periods. have eve radio maintain its interviews of candidates. upgrade the voting page to include a summary of the person's platform rather than just the name, avatar, and corp of the person (and their webpage). and most importantly, have the candidate list randomize in order for every time someone accesses the voting page.maybe then we'll see even better participation. so, before picking on ss or any other candidate about using underhanded tactics for votes, ask yourself this question: if they did not use these underhanded tactics, would you have voted? for the majority, that answer would be no, unfortunately."
5/26/2009,"damn, i know i'm a bore, but i'd really like some answers, ye who care to advance the cause of mmo democracy."
5/26/2009,"in the context menu for market orders ""cancel"" and ""modify"" are positioned right next to each other on the top of the menu. this will occasionally lead to unintended cancellations in the slight lag that happens when a transaction is registered, causing the entire orders view to update.the suggestion is then to add a confirmation pop-up to the ""cancel"" option, of course with the usual never-show-this-window-again check-box for those who want the old behaviour."
5/26/2009,"as long as it's optional, yes."
5/26/2009,yes.
5/26/2009,"note: this was intended te posted under my main character, jalxanrecently i came across a very akward, frustrating, and scary situation while fighting in a war with my alliance. it was two wartargets against myself in a scorpion, and an alliance member in a command ship. the battle was going well; we had almost taken down one of the two wartargets. however, the second wartarget launched drones against my ship.intentionally, also because i was an ecm ship, i was far away from the fight because i had smartbombs, for the intention of taking out enemy drones. i intentionally kept at least 15km away from neutral shipping; this was a calculated risk.however, when the enemy sent his drones after me, one of my ally's drones followed them. i did not see it enter my firing solution until it was too late. in the end, it blew me up, and i took a massive standings hit for killing my ally's drone, ship, and pod (though ccp fixed the latter).my issue isn't to do with the standings, but rather the entire friendly fire mechanic. first of all, i've noticed that corporations are not affected by friendly fire in terms of concord response. however, alliance members are in an odd difference. i believe this is to prevent griefing alliances from shooting down new corporations in a large scale form of wreck and asset looting.however, i have an idea that would not only fix that, but also fix other situations where this is debilitating; say, those who want to test their tanks, or have a duel. it goes something like this:two players, two corporations, two alliances, or any combination of the three wish to shoot amonst each other. to do so, they do the following:1. both parties set each other to +10 (+5?) standings. in other words, eve considers both parties to be best friends.2. one party sends a ""concord-sanctioned criminal imunity"" (or some sort of lingo) request to the other, which the other party has to accept.once this is done, both parties may shoot at each other. this way, if two alliances are at war with one target, they can accidentally shoot one another with area of effect weapons. or, even have a planned skirmish (for example, when i was arranging my alliance to have a rookie-ship war competition). or, have a duel against one person. the list goes on. the point is, is that both parties can shoot one another. this request would cost nothing and have no maintenance cost, unlike the war decloration, and will also last as long as both sides have consent.to prevent this mechanic from causing griefing, every person within the agreement (two players, a member from either corporation, or a member from either alliance) can click a ""cease concord-sanctioned criminal immunity"" button, which will end the immunity for anyone involved. any person within this immunity will get a warning message stating that the immunity has been revolked, and that any further actions will cause a swift concord response. in addition, all weapons in each participant's ship will get a server-side deactivation of all offensive module cycles to prevent weapons from maintaining their fire (if doing so). and finally, the concord response will be delayed for a short period, to allow non-instant weapons to hit their mark (smartbombs, missiles, etc).as i said, this will solve many problems, and will also make corporation-level griefing obsolete as well. the mutual standings requirement is a safeguard to protect one person from accidentally accepting a mutual pvp request. if one accepts a request with their mutual standings at +5 or +10 (whichever is accepted), then there's no real excuse if that person loses their ship, especially without knowing."
5/26/2009,"voting no based on the title. i already know this is a bad idea. sorry.edit: ok you posted now.the idea is fine, but it's kind of like telling someone how to build a wrist watch when they ask what time it is. why shouldn't you just be able to have friendly pew pew with your alliance mates? is the above mentioned griefing really so prevalent? no, you're a doo doo head. fail failfailfailfepicepicfailepicfailepicfailpicepifaile"
5/26/2009,"finished, sorry about the posting frakup.i ask you to read the finished proposal please. i know it's a touchy subject, but i think it's worth reading."
5/26/2009,just read the title and kinda figured what you want to propose. we dont want to turn this game into wow.
5/26/2009,crappy title? yesstupid idiot assuming proposal is hinged on the title alone? hilarious level of epic fail-ness.op should change title or you'll have even more morons making the same conclusion.supported only if alliance friendly fire is permitted during war-dec... and only in that case.
5/26/2009,"okay, what do you suggest? i can still change it.also, thanks for the vote of confidence."
5/26/2009,best i could come up with would be [issue]alliance friendly fire during war-dec causes concord
5/26/2009,"hmm. perhaps that could work, thanks. :)"
5/26/2009,logos rule and we want the logo. please sir can we have more!!!
5/26/2009,"no opting out, eve is a pvp game from market, to industry, to combat... all pvp."
5/26/2009,aye
5/26/2009,of course it is. and controlling intell is a valuable pvp tactic. no one can limit or control what people post to private killboards. this is as it should be. there's even a good deal of false information out there. the creation of a 100% accurate and official killboard would provide way too much easy intell.
5/26/2009,definitely not.
5/26/2009,i agree with verone.
5/26/2009,what happened to this?
5/26/2009,bigger is better.
5/26/2009,"coad is a place all alliances come together and talk. it should be a section of the forums dedicated to free speech.if one alliance want to make assshats of themselves let them. people will quickly see who are the mature of the bunch in eve.my proposal is to lighten severly moderation of coad.moderators will only remove personal attacks, ****ographic pictures... etc"
5/26/2009,remove alt posting and you get my vote.anyone who posts with a stupidly obvious alt name like that.. should be shot for there arrogance.post with your main..idiot./in before flame fest.
5/26/2009,"yes, let's make caod even worse than it already is.no, that's a terrible idea."
5/26/2009,"while i agree that coad should be a place where alliances should be able to get together and discuss with one another, what goes on in their now is not discussion - it's crap.clean up coad, and then we can discuss changing it's moderation policies."
5/26/2009,"it would be tremendously bad business for ccp to allow something like the gatebug persist for very long, yes, but as i interpreted it, the central matter of this thread is the proposal of a clearer forum structure for providing ccp with feedback."
5/26/2009,"if ccp has bad communication, then all the rest of the companies have no communication whatsoever.in fact, i think that ccp devs go forward with more stuff and in more ways than any other company out there."
5/26/2009,"exactly.the argument is not that ccp is worse than other people, it is that the communication could be improved."
5/26/2009,it is a big problem. i started a trial account recently to check out some of the new training time bonuses and and try some fits. the rookie channel was so busy that it was almost impossible to read or respond to anything.
5/26/2009,would suggest that those voting in this thread go vote in this thread which was created earlier:
5/26/2009,make high end mining more profitable by adding some of the rare moon minerals as an by product of refining the mined ores. this will have to be balance to not ruin the moons as the profitability of them gives reasons for fight. so although profitability will go dow they still have to be rare and worth fighting for. the goal is to balance t2 modules and especially ships to an affordable level 10 mill for a interceptor and 80 mill for a hac. prices of course are open for discussion.
5/26/2009,bump
5/26/2009,"not gonna happen.. if ccp tried to apply any logic to electronics/ecm, then the bigger ships that have more space for larger more powerful computer control systems would actually lock faster than anything smaller not vice versa."
5/26/2009,"i do not agree with the op. not only does sensor strength all ready work this out, but a blackbird jamming a bs still needs other ships to attack said bs to actually take him down. even a scorpion jamming another bs is going to have to be fitted awesomely and have good luck to take out another bs by himself. the ecm ships are good at what they do, jamming, but their offense is poor at best. i think it works out in the end, and then add drones to the mess and it's a whole new ball game."
5/26/2009,"supported, also put more upbeat songs in versus ambient. ;pedit in: some music i can't find on the jukeboxgallente thememission02mission 3mission 4mission 5dronei know there is more :p"
5/26/2009,i would like to see these added to the jukebox too.
5/26/2009,i completely agree that lowsec is a total wasteland most of the time but the majority player population living in highsec has no incentive to venture into no mans land just to become easy bait for roving squads of overpowered players.i've composed an idea as a starting point on how to balance low sec territories in empire space that adds some rp value to the game as well as making a small compromise to benefit players wishing to explore

5/26/2009,1 vote from me.
5/26/2009,"voted for heartstone, he is sufficiently independent to have my trust, and at the same time appears to have a concrete plan that points this game in a good direction."
5/26/2009,"actually, this was the time that the skill queue was taken to a csm meeting with jade as principal supporter, it was voted through to a ccp/csm meeting, and at that meeting given high priority. ccp agreed to examine the skill queue and explore ways for implementation (csm/ccp meeting minutes). eight months later, a skill queue was introduced with the march 2009 expansion. in programming terms, given the other hurdles to overcome (ghost training etc) this is quick implementation.are you saying that you repreated raised this issue, despite the csm assigning it high priority and ccp agreeing to examine it in depth (and obviously find a solution)?given that you have stated elsewhere in the forums that players that forum post aren't the sort erik should be responding to, can you enlighten me as to how he will discuss/support/propose issues on the forums? or can you confirm that this will be your responsibility, as take care party will be elected (with erik being the representative this csm term)."
5/26/2009,"i'm not going to reply to troll baits. just calling us the ""take credit"" party is shows your colors.your post simply has so many factual errors it isn't even funny, and that you're larkonis' alt/friend is easily deducted from the last part of your post.post with your main."
5/26/2009,"sorry, take care- no troll intended! edited to correct.could you point out the factual errors of my post regarding skill queue? all the information is easily obtained via the evewiki and forum posts.additionally, can you address the last part of my post? i am considering voting, but would need to be assured that erik will be active in the forums as csm rep (and not have a spokesperson doing this task)."
5/26/2009,"first of all the skill queue was given a medium-high priority by the csm, not high.a lot more went on behind the scenes than can be found on these forums. for example, it reads from the minutes that ""noah (ccp) indicated ccp's awareness of the player frustrations with the ~6 hour duration skill trainings. however, ccp strongly believes that switching skill training is an activity that encourages players to log into the game and play.""this is the part where my contribution comes into play, changing ccps perception of this matter, and proving that players are not logging in and playing more due to having to change skills.i did some research and wrote a document about this, it's a bit long but the conclusion is already reflected in the mk2 issue, it basically is that people are just inconvenienced by the skill completion time, and if they log in at an inconvenient time they only do so to change the skill, not to play. in addition, players used to be very selective in what skill to train. if they wanted to train skill a and b, they would not because these skills happened to end at an inconvenient time, so instead they would train skill c, which is a skill they did not want as much, just because it happened to complete at a certain time.of course csm1 raised the issue, it was the first issue of the csm and it was supported by everyone. however, ccp repeatedly said to the csm that they'll ""look into the issue"" but then either doesn't implement it at all or give it such a low priority that it still hasn't seen any resources allocated to it. this happens with high-priority issues as well. thus it was extra important to remove any reservations ccp might have had towards the skill queue, which i considered one of the most important issues at that time.i'd appreciate it if that was truly your intention, but i have serious doubts regarding your consideration, due to you calling us the ""take credit"" party (which is what larkonis and supporters call us) and directly referring to my response to a post by larkonis which was removed by a moderator due to trolling."
5/26/2009,"thanks for the response! can you point me in the direction of the relevant paperwork? from the evewiki, it reads as if the csm1 raised issue, gave it priority and ccp then worked on a solution and implemented it within the year.just because my question may have been percieved to be from someone you may not like/agree with, does that make the question any less valid? i read the posts (from all parties, including yours) and am seriously wondering about this question."
5/26/2009,"sure, it's part of the documentation that i haven't wikified yet, i'll dig it up when i get home.well, it's one of the reasons why take care conducts most of it's discussions with the players ingame or through email. forum debates tend to be circular and require much more time, while leaving too much room for (intentional) misinterpretation of the things said.between this post and my last one, i've had conversations with three people in game already, discussing factional warfare, the corp/alliance ui, supercaps, 0.0 improvements, walking in stations and many other topics. during my time on the csm i've had hundreds of emails to my private address regarding eve features and issues, and eve-mail from at least 500 different players. not to mention all the people that started conversations.i think answering those players and discussing with them is more productive than nitpicking at some forum, where a lot of people are just looking for a cheapshot at their perceived opponents. a lot of players unfortunately avoid these forums due to the hostile attitude and trolling here, but that doesn't make their issues any less valid. take care doesn't ignore the forums, we just use alternative means of communication to complement it. means which are easily accessible to everyone, as i'd say that for a lot of people, sending an e(ve)-mail has a lower barrier to participation than posting at these forums."
5/26/2009,"the forum, however is a public discussion of ideas and views. since the csm are a publicly elected body and their dealings are supposed to be open, doesn't it make sense that the forums are the logical place to conduct discussions? eve-mails tend to be between two parties, forums between many.my question was whether erik or a tc spokesperson (you or another) will be doing the forum posting/discussion if elected onto csm (considering the opinion of the forum you have expressed)."
5/26/2009,"issues have to be on the forum for a minium of 7 days of discussion before the csm is even allowed to raise it. so anything we do will have to be public, and open for discussion, which we will actively participate in. we're currently working out the stucture with the advisors, if we will have regularly scheduled meetings they will either be public where people can join in the channel or we'll release minutes afterwards. we want to be an open organisation, not some club of elitists that meets behind closed doors."
5/26/2009,"wtf. are you two freaks going absolutely nuts now? you start off with very basic knowledge of eve, requiring you to hire ""advisers"" to raise you to a level a regular experienced csm candidate has. now, instead of getting good advisors, non constructive - mitnaloh and for gloating over the skill queue: it's nothing people really needed, and you didn't have to ""push"" anything, any other csm candidate would vote for it."
5/26/2009,"issues have to be on the forum for a minium of 7 days of discussion before the csm is even allowed to raise it. so anything we do will have to be public, and open for discussion, which we will actively participate in.can i infer from the above comment that it may not be erik, as csm rep, commenting on issues and such raised in assembly hall and jita park forums? advisors or nominated spokepersons from take care may be performing this role?"
5/26/2009,"erik is anks catspaw, there was never any real pretense otherwise. hopefully erik will actually try and be a good candidate when he is on the csm."
5/26/2009,at the meetings in iceland are you going to have some sort of batphone to communicate with ankheriojwporewr or will you try to memorize enough material that you can try to present and defend an idea as though it was your own.
5/26/2009,"i am assuming that this has to be some sort of rule the ""take care"" party has created for itself for issues they choose to raise. i can tell you this was definitely not enforced in csm ii.issler"

5/26/2009,"sup meridus! i made a thread about this in the other section weeks ago because all the candidates failed to mention fw as being a primary concern to them. so as it stands that all appear to fail to capture my vote. i don't want a half assed attempt but someone that has an fw record of both plexing and pvpings. candy asses sitting on capture points and fleeing at the first sign of trouble is not in fw on the same level as i,therefore they know nothing about what i want in a candidate. 3rd person campaigning is also bs. you want my vote you need to speak to me, not have someone else talking for you. now as for fw....people say its supposed to be a stepping stone to 0.0 but thats bs to me. 0.0 is not and should not be the end game of a ""sandbox"" game. it should be up to the players to determine what they want. if you want 0.0 then go to 0.0 or join a 0.0 training alliance, they do exist. ccp made sure fw was prenerfed and nerfed bad. they left it that way and i think thats pathetic. in a way i feel this is soe all over again. why give us wormholes when the other project is still in serious need of beign fleshed out?? fw does need rewards but also changes. fw should make players want to move out to lowsec, not just as part of a fleet or to plex but live out there. yet its far easier to live in hisec and go to lowsec for the fight. i know cuase thats what i do. its not necessarily a bad thing but theres little choice. either stay in lowsec and have a much smaller isk flow or spent part of your time in empire and have a greater isk flow. i want more to lure me out to lowsec full time. why do people go to 0.0? some say the pvp while most i have met in my time in game say the isk. so it makes little sense that 0.0 has loads of isk to be had as well as pvp. empire has isk but virtually no pvp other then ganking and wardecs. so why does the inbetween area have less isk then the zero pvp zone but the ability to have the same level of pvp as 0.0 but without bubbles and titans? clearly fw is flawed on the ""reward"" aspect. its something i have actually argued against but why would an empire expect someone to fight on its behalf for free? we aren't all mimtards so why treat us as slaves? yeah i dont want anyone abusing fw but lets face it, 0.0-empire gets abused so its nothing new. lets not forget that unlike empire fw is an agreement to be someone's target. so if people wanted to run fw missions for phat profits then they can bring their shiny cnrs out. people will kill them , that right there levels the abusers in ways that are impossible in empire. flying 10jumps behind enemy lines is a risk, yet theres no reward. i liked the idea of fw missions but found how stupid it was, not the way it was done but the level of reward was pathetic. staying safe in empire and only going 1 or 2 jumps brought far more in rewards then fw missions, that is a joke! fw missions should be 2 to 3 times greater in the level of reward due to the actual risk involved. if players are able to do 100s of fw missions unscathed then thats the fault of the defending milita, not game mechanics. the player still assumed the risk and had no control of his destination when pulling the mission. 0.0 is a self sustaining enviroment. they have a lot more isk and greater ore then fw. would it make sense for ccp and players to suggest that 0.0 players head back to empire to rebuild their wallets? absolutely not! why is it true for fw players? pvp is its own reward. sure it is. however the same can be said for 0.0 so lets strip them of their high value moons and rats and great faction drops. lets strip them of their morph as well as the best ice in the game. if you think thats stupid then ask why fw that is at the very least between 0.0 and empire has less reward for its risk. allow players to have a self sustaining enviroment and they will stay. they will find more of a reason to fight other then another km."
5/26/2009,"giving them a reason to stay and the means to stay in fw creates a new home for them. a home for those that find empire to be a snooze fest but 0.0 to be anything but they hoped for.to me fw is a lot like what eve should have been to start with. 4 large empires fighting it out while giving players room to find their own path, if they so choose it. empires would not expect people to fight for them for free. in rl nations pay their troops. they equip them, they do not ask them to supply their own weapons. mercenaries command huge sums of money for the same job. yet in eve people are supposed to fight for free, why? i don't want some ******* that joined fw to hide in the furthest corner of empire space and receive isk for zero risk. what i do want to see is players bagging some isk in other ways. such as kills. if you kill a wt of a certain class ship you get a bounty as you would with rats. the empire wants us to destroy hostile assets and we don't get free ships so how do you motivate the masses? most people are not out for gaining the biggest epeen, yeah i said it. having the bigger epeen isn't a bad thing nor is it wrong to want to have those bragging rights. however most people aren't like that, as annoying as it is, so we need to give them another reason to kill! ccp has a doctor in number crunching, right? get him to find the average value of each ship and come up with a formula for busting that value into a reward to be paid to those that kill it. a value that is under average production costs but reasonable enough for players to want it. again the reason there should be a bounty is we don't get paid to sit around like npcs. we gotta go out there and earn our isk. we are supposed to be supplemental forces, right? if people have to kill for isk t hat is under production costs of their targets they cannot abuse it. you could pop 20 frigs that took 200k to make and recieve 100isk for each one. if you try to abuse that you end up losing 100k per ship. simple enough,right? i want to say that i do not need the isk. however i cannot speak for other militia members or my targets. i can say that people are interested in rewards for their efforts. volunteers are few in most fields in rl so it shows how willing people are to do stuff for free. its a game, sure but the losses are permanent. helping people fund their pvp is to help lift pvp up in all aspects of the game. it comes down to a question of if you want more carebears in eve or more pvpers? make fw increasingly pvp friendly by allowing players to earn their isk outside of empire and you will see the number of pvpers grow. keep fw as it is and see the number of pvpers shrink. not all disenfranchised fw members will go to 0.0 for various reasons. so even if you want to see fw as a stepping stone to 0.0 but want to hate on fw ,or leave it to die on its own ,just because you are in 0.0 is to smash your own stepping stone. fw could be so much more but ccp doesn't care. 0.0 players also fail to see how it could help their groups out. pirates don't see how it can bring them a supply of targets that didn't exist a year ago. maybe they do but they don't speak up, instead they look down upon fw. so it ends up being one big circle jerk that will restore the old status quo and leave eve the lifeless game it was beforehand. fw should bring the eve storyline to life. without a storyline that is alive we are left with nothing more then 4 flavors of ships with a half assed reason why they are different to begin with.blah, i could go on about fw but its late..."
5/26/2009,"i agree with having to kill the rats in a plex. speed tanking it is moronic and makes no sense. if you want to remove an enemy you have to find a way to remove them and running around is not a way. i disagree that people would be able to farm plexes like missions. people will see tasty targets float into the plexes and that will get the pvpers out there,quick! pvpers having the ability to shoot at farmers is the best way to solve the problem of farmers! so give us a reward for capturing plexes in enemy territory. its not our fault if the enemy didn't show, we still assumed the risk and we still did the job. if you get killed or flee before the job is done you get nothing! rather balanced to me since the players are the ones to balance it. if player were given a bounty for killing wts then there is a motivation to go out and kill! no reward, no need for the risk. i'd still go but not everyone will. we need to look not at the willing but those on the fence. i remember reading that in wwi or wwii that only 10% of the troops did 90% of the damage. they looked at those 10%ers to find ways to make the 90% more like those who wuld fight. basically the 10% had less fear and more motivation. so motivation >fear=fight. so increasing the motivation increased the numbers of those willing to fight. in fw and only fw we attempt to twist that around. instead of realizing that the 90% lack the motivation we look for ways to decrease it or stifle the building up of what will motivate. why do we wish to flog ourselves? do we really have some kind of self administered stigma that we must whip out of ourselves since we are not in 0.0 but want to pvp? 0.0 does not flog itself for having drone regions, officer spawns, rare ore and moons worth maintaining a capfleet to defend. why the hell should we????! if people want zero risk and all reward, stay in empire and out of milita. if you want all of the 0.0 experience, head out there. if you want to take losses and have to retreat to empire to rebuild, join fw?? nah, that doesn't sound right to me. fw should have its own rewards, rewards just like empire, just like 0.0. we have our risks, so wheres our rewards? give us our rewards and we will have many more people out there pvping instead of hiding in empire space. from there they can choose if pvping>hiding. if so they can stay in fw and get their rewards for their risk and only if they take up the risks. or they can go 0.0 or pirate. either way you pull one carebear out and show him what eve has to offer. eve is about pvping, not just grinding l4s, right? so to build up fw into something far more attractive then l4 grinding is to reinforce the idea that pvp= eve = pvp. so lets give those 90% players something to act more like the 10%ers."
5/26/2009,"well, failure to vote won't make anything better, and certainly won't get you the representation you want.remember that anyone, including you, can be an advisor in take care and we currently have two fw advisors already. based on my history you can clearly see the amount of fw-related issues i raised and the content of them, which goes way beyond my personal playstyle. if there is anything you want to see raised all you have to do is send erik or me or any other advisor an email or convo any of us.we're not here to run off with your votes, we're here to give you a voice once the elections are over."
5/26/2009,thanks to all of you. your support is much appreciated.
5/26/2009,dear csm candidates.thanks for all the interest. i've received a winning offer.
5/26/2009,"since the candidates have no way to verify that you have indeed voted for them, don't expect any offers or interest.plus you are supposed to pay the csm for their time spent to improve your game, not the other way around."
5/26/2009,"ah well, so long as your not against the idea of buying votes thats great. if you get in you can maybe get ccp to put vote buying on contracts?"
5/26/2009,"i also feel buying votes is wrong.. though i know some have done that this election. personally i think it shouldn't be allowed to pay for votes, as in real life if it is proven against any member and they are in power they should loose their position they got through bought votesno i am not bitter because i cant do it i think its immoral and wrong and wouldn't do it even if i had the isk to sink into it"
5/26/2009,the problem with vote buying is there is no way to verify the person paid actually voted. my personal advice is to offer your votes for sale and take all the iskies you can get....
5/26/2009,"did people actually buy into the idea that it was a chick?? either way the number of threads where i saw mindless,pointless garbage in an attempt to be funny and cute assures us all that i will not vote for cat. saying one thing and doing another is as voter friendly as edwards banging some chick on the side. back that up with ""im for the poor peoplez,lolz"" while sitting in a massive mansion while your neighbors live in a shack. as for your job, you could be working at tacobell, india's numerous ""help desk"" phonelines or anywhere else. it smacks of a resume,white washed,fuzzy story as opposed to presenting is real **** that makes us think you might be worth voting for. also,guys trying to rp chicks ......seriously, wtf?"
5/26/2009,"your vote has been registered. we thank you for your participation.please do wear cat ears when you go to iceland and leave them on as you're discussing csm business around the table. that is all, thanks."
5/26/2009,yarrrrr
5/26/2009,"+2 votes from me, i do not agree with all of the proposals but larkonis is definitely the champion of piracy and small gang pvp."
5/26/2009,"i'm having trouble finding any news about the results of this meeting. did it occur? did ccp elaborate on this issue (or anything else, for that matter)?"
5/27/2009,"i see you point, however there is not really any point arguing it as ccp have been changing things this way ever since the game started. the fact of the matter is in mmos it becomes quickly apparent where there is an imbalance, and whilst persistance would be nice, you can't let it get in the way of fixing problems. so many fads have come and gone: -every ship having a multispectral ecm in the mids -> ecm nerfed except on dedicated ecm boats-being able to fit cruise missiles into kestrels -> nerfed-being able to run multiple mwds -> nerfed-interceptors being able to fly at 30km/s -> nerfedyou see my point? there has never been persistance in eve. trying to do so now is completely pointless. there will always be things that are overpowered and underpowered. ignoring them would eventually kill the game."
5/27/2009,let um get cocorded for now on nuff said
5/27/2009,"area of effect weapons will just be stacked on top of each other, whatever they are, to the point we have exactly the same problem as we have now with titansfocused anti-capital weapons are the way to go :)"
5/27/2009,"this is what needs to be changed here, the covetor needs to be there before people go for the hulk"
5/27/2009,like the ideas.
5/27/2009,"yeah, yeah..."
5/27/2009,update:this is the writeup i'm about to submit for some meeting. i think i worded it to avoid any misunderstandings such as there have been in this thread.
5/27/2009,hmmmmmmmmmmm i think i will support myself
5/27/2009,common request. it's also a stupid question.christ no if i want to play client-modification online.
5/27/2009,"ok you can stick with the ccp default, i hope you like it"
5/27/2009,i support this only if mazzilliu will allow me to use his mod.
5/27/2009,my current modification to the eve interface is a bright pink backgrounds and hot pink buttons and pastel pink text background. soooo there you go
5/27/2009,"will ill be to lazy to learn how to do this, but i think its a great idea. usually the people share their work,so everbody could use that alteration he likes the most, or none at all.supported."
5/27/2009,"the problem with mods/addons is that since they do make things easier, they by default create either unbalance or an arms race of who has the most effective tools. while i agree that creating balance by bad ui is not the right way to design things, fixing the ui with mods for ""elite"" players, is an even worse issue, especially in a pvp oriented game.myself, i love the fact that eve is free of the mod/addon update hell after each patch, even knowing there are number of things i'd like to get access to. please keep eve clean, but also please, develop the ui on the official client.besides, eve has enough bugs to not need mods to bring more *grin*."
5/27/2009,"cliet modifications, are and should remain against the eula and a bannable offence. i won't mention any names, but i recall someone being able to fit more low-slot modules than the ship allowed by alteration of the python code.the client obviously has out-going data streams, if you allow modification of the client that control these streams then reprecussions are unforseen.i really think controlling any drawback of this idea is more hassle than it's worth for ccp programmers. sorry"
5/27/2009,"thats something that means you need to move that calculation to the server, and any other vital calculations like that. even despite those minor exploits(there was/is? a coming-out-of-warp at max speed hack too), and no punkbuster or gameguard or whatever running, the (memory editing type of)hacking problem in eve doesnt seem very widespread. so allowing legit client modification should not cause any world ending consequences.anyways, ccp can choose between allowing player run modification, or taking endless suggestion and debate about whether the zoom button should be bright pink or green and why cant you fix it you are a horrible company etc etc.as for the poster concerned itll result in an ""arms race"", i dont see that ever happening. in a place where players can share things openly and the same tools are available to everbody, the best ones will be the most popular, and specialized ui issues like the colorblind population and nearsighted and the deaf will get their concerns addressed as well, without requiring everyone else use the same ui.anyways the default ui will just be this one. we can only get better from here."
5/27/2009,hell no
5/27/2009,"i made this a major part of my csm campaign in the last two races, so obviously i'm for it. assuming it's done sensibly(i.e., don't let people add low slots through client mods - seriously, you call that a counterargument?), it would be the single best change ccp could make to the game, bar none."
5/27/2009,i agree with this sentiment.
5/27/2009,"i'm with the ""no"" side of the argument on this issue, as much as i would love to be on the other side.moving the exploitable items back server side instead of client side is going to add an amzing amount of calculations to the servers for the 30-50k people that are normally logged on. you think jita or large fleet battles lag now?the fact that there are and continue to be exploitable benefits of hacking the client (the aforementioned max speed after warp thing, for instance) means that opening it up for player development only opens it up for abuse. i don't mind being beaten by a smarter player. being beaten by a better programmer is another matter."
5/27/2009,"i still reckon legit modification could very much result in ""world-ending"" consequences. in fact, something that doesn't even require a calculation sent to the server is the password that you type in. a client loaded with add-ons, of which just 1 could be hostile could result in the sensitive information getting in the wrong hands. not only do i see potential alterations to in-game items, but also a whole new form of meta-gaming. ""hi friend in kenzoku, would you like to download this modification to your client? it definitely wasn't made by a goon alt"""
5/27/2009,"that's a pretty freaking huge ""if"" hersch.... with a lot of baggage to go with it.it would need to be defined down to the t.... and sorry to say.... not likely to take place here considering the individuals proposing this.i don't mind a clean up.... but with how its worded... too risky."
5/27/2009,"this is a game that has the potential to have well over 50k people on the same server, and you want the server to do more calculations?!? would you like it to discern pi to the last digit for you as well?sorry, i am strongly against this. a modifiable ui, maybe. an open-source code, you have to be kidding me."
5/27/2009,"a customizable ui is sorely needed.but anything more than that, not really."
5/27/2009,the idea is logical since the current ui is a nightmare and an example to student ui designers how not to design an ui. but its opening a can of worms when it comes to abuse and exploits if its not designed properly. i don't think ccp will be able to plug those holes right from the bat.
5/27/2009,"it's easy to poke fun at ccp, and they really do deserve it sometimes, but they can do good work if they have a reason to. you're right that this could be bad - if you don't keep an eye on it, it can rapidly go from being a very good thing to a very bad thing. my understanding is that the macro/modder side of the game is something that gets tweaked frequently on games that allow it in order to keep it to utility and not necessity or absurdity. but that said, if they do it right, it would solve so many problems - probably half to 2/3 of the outstanding complaints about eve could be solved without ccp lifting a finger if this was done. browser sucks? someone rams firefox in that hole, complete with an addon that gives trusted sites all the info you could ever ask for - think of what sort of fleet coordination tools you can put into place with that amount of power at your sisposal. mail client sucks? not once you download a mail addon that integrates it into your computer's mail client, complete with sentbox, multiple addressing, contact list, and all the other usual and unusual feature requests. think the corp interface is a pile of steaming dung? rewrite it, change it all you like, and make it into whatever you think is the slickest thing imaginable. the game would be far more playable and immensely less frustrating, and ccp would never have to do a thing again in order to keep it that way, freeing them up to make a newbie-friendly default without worrying much about us vets, and put people onto the game mechanics that need changing. as far as i'm concerned, this is a no-brainer, and the only serious way to code an interface for a mmo."
5/27/2009,fw is where it's at!wake up ccp!
5/27/2009,i think it's more accurate to say that fw is where it could be ... if ccp paid more attention to the unfortunate problems that currently plague it.
5/27/2009,2
5/27/2009,omg! that's terrible. poor chap/signed
5/27/2009,"supporting as well, i actually just made a post regarding this on shc especially related to doomsdays.the one change i would make to the proposal would be to add a few extra sub-groups within the ""effects"" tree, so for instance you could allow the display of doomsdays while not rendering things like sensor boosters to reduce lag, or disabling the hardener effects while preserving the booster/repper effects.i think simply moving dds to turret effects wouldnt help quite as much since many players have these disabled in fleet fights as well to reduce lag.that said, a good start as it is ."
5/27/2009,"ya there really should fix and final add the allaince features to the pos if there granted the ""roles"" they should be able to use the pos like they was the corp the put it there...and yes a better why to protect pos from spys would be great"
5/27/2009,"i support this idea greatly. the new intro states we are demi gods, but if i am a god that doesnt deserve a lick of paint then i just feel small and insignificant.i agree to the idea of preset colours and patterns, so that players cant end up causing too much lag with this. having the corp logo would be an amazing idea as it would be like a sign of loyalty and proudness. either way, i say fight for this."
5/27/2009,"yes!even if it is only a way to cover those ugly white stripes on caldari ships, they look like the painter was drunken while doing it (no straight borders...)"
5/27/2009,"/emote facepalmyou don't get it do you? lag! want me to repeat that again? laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaggggggg! l - a - g! and for what?/emote doublefacepalmso you can ""change the clothes"" on you ship? go play second life if you wanna change clothes in a game.and before you try to tell me that it wont cause lag: yes it will! ccp has said so (god has spoken), it has been brought up by the csm and ccp tried it, it caused lag, does not work, you can not have it, go away, second life is that way ->kthxbai/not supported"
5/27/2009,links or stfu.
5/27/2009,ya some paint would be nice
5/27/2009,i like the idea of adding corp logos to a ship i also like the4 idea of a predefined 2 tone color scheme layout that all you would be allowed to do is select 2 colors from a pallate and they would be applies to your ship in the pre-determined pattern based on your ship (each ship would have a pre determined pattern (and the t2 ships would get a spiffier pattern) i support these ideas i do not however support the idea of completely customised ship patterns and such cause really the last thing we need to see is a horde of hello kitty kestrels flying around
5/27/2009,"fw is the most fun in the game atm yet ccp have said they don't want to spend any time on it and don't want it to impact other gameplay at all...... the rewards are non-existent apart from standings, which is fine, but the feature needs some serious work all the same.fw is great ccp. it's not a side-game. finish it."
5/27/2009,signed. i support this
5/27/2009,/signed
5/27/2009,word.
5/27/2009,i concur.the fw missions are terrible and rewards really slim compared to those available elsewhere in eve. fw needs love.
5/27/2009,fix it
5/27/2009,supported
5/27/2009,"i disagree with the op. 0.0 is very rewarding for those who are willing to take the risk, and it is a lot more profitable then empire space. the mining is much better and more profitable. the ratting is a lot more lucrative and now the denizens of 0.0 got wormholes and everything that comes with it. i do support the idea of improving 0.0 but not the way the op proposes. i want to see 0.0 made more accessible to newbs. there should be pvp bots that new people can practice with, and wormholes should be made available in empire space. moreover, there are by far more pressing issues for ccp to work on. ships need to be balanced, performance needs to be improved, missions should be made more interesting and diverse, the list goes on and on.so basically i support op's idea, but not right now."
5/27/2009,"wormholes are available in all space, including empire."
5/27/2009,lol epic ^ ummm still waiting for that logo btw ccp
5/27/2009,check out my face!and... logo please
5/27/2009,me wantsa logo!
5/27/2009,logo pic is wildly inappropriate! thats the reason we dont have it
5/27/2009,this... ccp why do you hate wi? logo now please!
5/27/2009,"they want to review it several times, because this logo is so awesome they can't let it go and have to look at it every day.. and each time they look at it, they forget what they were doing because the logo is so awesome, and so this logo never gets added..that must be it.."
5/27/2009,"you may want to discretely link in the source file here, in case they just misplaced it and none of them knows where the original upload went :p"
5/27/2009,how about that logo
5/27/2009,! indeed
5/27/2009,"there are 1,792 toons in the wildly inappropriate alliance.do ccp plan to wait until each and every one of them posts in this thread to ask for our logo before they do what they promised back in january?"
5/27/2009,logo logo logo logo logo logo logo logo logo redhead redhead logo logo logo logo logo
5/27/2009,gives us our logo or i will uselessly shake my fist at you in frustration!you have been warned.
5/27/2009,"yes, the old one also gave the game back story. and what is the point of all these new graphics but to increase immersion.and having a back story will help immersion a lot."
5/27/2009,"i agree, the new one is not immersive at all. the old intro made people feel sorry for the matar, or jealous of the gallente, or entranced by the power of the amarr. but all the new intro does is say. wellcome to eve, lots of other people play this game so its going to be hard for you, hope youve got some balls.the old intry would be better i feel."
5/27/2009,"yeah, bring back the old one."
5/27/2009,"didn't think the old intro was extremely good. but the generic, chest-beating new one with demigods and other overblown nonsense is so bad i'd settle for a mediocre one any time."
5/27/2009,"i like the new intro. it has spunk. and the new new player experience is somewhat more story-immersive than before (taking you on a walking - er, warping - tour of the galaxy) to compensate.the old intro, while very cool, set up false expectations, i think - the new intro better primes new players for the real deal they're about to get.that said, i'm a sucker for good plot and would love to see the backstory better integrated, especially for beginners."
5/27/2009,i quite like the new one. but i didn't have the same excitement while watching it as the old one :3+1
5/27/2009,"i like the new one, but i miss the back story. it really gave a sense of the immense ammount of time that has passed between now and eve."
5/27/2009,supporting this ancient idea
5/27/2009,/signed for the launchers and the plates being visable!
5/27/2009,"firstly, vuk's thread about supercaps is excellent and i fully support nearly all his ideas. there is however a simple 'fix' in the meantime which could be applied pending a total supercap revamp (or indeed as part of it). i think many of us can appreciate that area-of effect dd's have had their day, but titan pilots rightly want something fun to do with their shiny toys (without breaking the game for everyone else)... so...replace area-of-effect dd with focused dd1) remove area of effect dd completely2) replace with 'focused dd' (think death star) with a 60 second rof and 1m+ raw damage per shot, and 200km range 3) retain all the logistical qualities which make titans coolthe focused dd fire can use a certain percentage of the cap to prevent insta-jump outs after execution. the idea is that titans become a potent anti-capital platforms, without the game breaking area of effect dd intact.and it keeps the ship cool and worthwhile (and fun)this would have to be accompanied by a boost to ms/titan hp (which is needed as per vuk's post) to prevent ms being two-volleyed or something equally ridiculous"
5/27/2009,titans are meant to be anti-blob weapon..let them stay anti-blob..
5/27/2009,"titans come in blobs these days, and especially when used under cynojammers most reasonable people can see they are imbalanced to the point of being game-breakingit wont be long before 20-30 titans are able to dd and kill a capital fleet, we're already seeing 15 titans together at once... in this situation, there is no place for the area-of-effect dd anymore"
5/27/2009,you are a horrible troll and worse battlefeild commentator but this is a very good idea and one i proposed about about a year ago. your concept here is much better than my original and thus i fully support this.however before this can be effective ccp needs to resolve the issue of big # lag otherwise the massive fleet fights that result from this change will be utterly miserable lagfests and will ruin the game.
5/27/2009,what a stupid ideal.would mean what the titain gets to shoot on ship and kill it then get blobed by the group his dd would have normal taken out.cause if this new death ray you want was put it and useing enough cap to stop it from jumping out ...would mean would only get what 2 ship kills what every 30 to 40 mins for a titain like said stupid ideal.then again uks blob are getting small now a days
5/27/2009,"to be fair, we've actually grown in size since forcing your alliance out of catch, but we're digressing here ;)back on topic:the cap usage would prevent the titan jumping out, but not warping out - so of course people could use them in 'drive-by' attacks on capital ships, for example (against seiged dreads it would be particularly effective)this negates your point about 'getting killed by the blob his dd would have taken out' -- this isnt a ship to be used solo, it would have a support fleet covering himwhat it provides, is a phenomenal (and scary) anti-capital platform which can one-shot most dreads/carriers... it is not without risk, and nor should it bebut it removes the game-breaking area-of-effect dd, and keeps titans fun, whilst adding an interesting new dynamic to capital ship combatedit: oh, and i support my idea of course :)"
5/27/2009,dd is not game breaking hell you can tank dd's now if you know how to set up for it.course you wont be able to do much of anything eles but you can live through a dd blast.as far as a 1 hit 1 kill. in stead if screwing up the titain more than it already is lets add that 1 hit feature to the dread.since that is suppose to be a huge flying cannon anyway up the dps the dread does and youd get this maybe even make it were a couple of dread using the power can pop a titainor they could introduce a t2 version that is built for that purpose
5/27/2009,"if its so easy to move around now, whats the big deal in lowering the clone jump timer?"
5/27/2009,because people who actually prefer this game to hello kitty think jump clones are a joke.
5/27/2009,i support this
5/27/2009,jumpclones are awesome
5/27/2009,ofcourse they pirates dont like this ideal the would be harder to camp ppl in stations.........i like it alot myself we dont pay money to sit in stations all day
5/27/2009,"i just thought this up, so i apologize if it isn't just an awesome idea with a huge list of supporting factors, but just give it a thought.it seems to me that if moon mining was changed slightly so that towers outside of an alliances home space (constellation/region) were either more expensive to keep running (the ****ty option) or unable to get sov 3 (or some other nerf, basically making them harder to hold) then 0.0 would spice up a bit. a problem we see all over 0.0 is that a few big landlords hold most of the highend dysprosium and promethium, some areas (current goonspace) is estimated at over 400b a month moon income. groups like pl have highends well outside their home in fountain, some in cloud ring, syndicate, and lowsec near fountain. while these big alliances will still retain the ability to defend these towers with their huge current wealth, making it harder to hold onto moons where they dont control the space around (i.e. satellite moongold, or npc regions/lowsec) will make smaller entities get to take potshots at holding some highends more often. discuss?pre-edit: changed all jewgold to moongold, and to clarify that this isnt targetted against gs and pl, its just i just read what gs makes off their space and i know pl has alot of moons out of their region. :)"
5/27/2009,"wouldn't this affect the small alliances and corps as well as the big ones? if yes - how exactly does it make things tougher on the big guys? if it's an equal challenge, and the big alliances still have more resources, doesn't this end up being the same as now?"
5/27/2009,or just make moon minerals finite and randomize the respawns ;)
5/27/2009,"not sure how this should be reworked if at all but ya,somthing does need to be done to give smaller allaince's some kind of chance aginst larger and the mulitpe-enitys they bring against them...smaller groups need some way to get the assests they need to be able to stand agaainst the big guys.and if it can be done with out reverting to underhanded way the big guys do things they better"
5/27/2009,"well, notice how pl doesnt own the constellations in cloud ring around their moons, or control the systems surrounding their moons in other non fountain areas, if they aren't of strategic or financial gain? well this would require them to make holding far away moons, that even though still make money, much harder to justify due to the higher cost to maintain them. a possible solution could be moons in npc regions would have no way of getting the regular fuel rate or hp amount or whatsohaveyou, they would always require an amount that would make them not very justifiable for a large 0.0 entity, whereas a smaller entity that may live out of that region could see a point in holding them, as even the reduced income would be a bit for them, and being small, they wouldnt have the need for a large pos network to waste isk and fuel on.then 0.0 regions would need adjoining systems to the said r64 to get a reasonable fuel requirement (or hp buffer or whatever).basically, the aim of this idea is to make taking far away moons and holding them a discouraging idea. any other ideas?"
5/27/2009,guess could also add a limit to how many moon a allaince could hold to.factor it in on how many corps you have in allaince like 10 moons per corp or somthing......then again that kinda rewards the bigger ones more.......and upping the cost dont really help out either cuase the big one can afford to pay pretty much anything
5/27/2009,"correct, which is why i would also like the towers to be easier to kill when you dont control the space directly around them. there are alot of really competent small alliances out there that have small cap fleets and could knock on r64 moons every now and again and if they werent worth nearly as much due to their npc location or just remote location, bigger guys wouldn't put up much of a fight.limiting moons by alliance would just make people make more alt alliances. making moons in lowsec and npc sov easier to take helps out budding groups, and really doesn't harm the big alliances that have plenty of good gold in their own space :)so yes, this is a stealth little guy buff idea."
5/27/2009,"this is by far one of the most horrible ideas in a long time.i can more or less grasp the basic concept that seems to be buried deep inside the suggestion, but it is not like a hidden jewel. more like a 1 cent coin in a pile of manure. no matter how i turn it, it doesn't look pretty, nor does it make much sense at all and i can think of a seemingly endless list of complications with it. starting with the general distribution of race preference, which directly influences global ship model popularity. however, i don't even think there is much to actually debate about this. it would just plain suck like hard vacuum and mess everything up completely."
5/27/2009,bad bad bad ideal they nerf enough already in-fact they need to stop with that crap.if you dont have the skills and the know how to fit ya ship to fight against more exp ppl then stay the hell out the way.us vets getting sick and tried getting nerfed everytime we turn around cause some damn noob who only gonna play the game for bout 2 months and quit cause it to hard for them bithced moan and grips to ccp to nerf us.
5/27/2009,"if it's something that shows up on the scanner at all, you should be able to filter it. supported."
5/27/2009,i approve of this proposal
5/27/2009,i support this.
5/27/2009,"you did? i know some say a serious candidate should be convinced to be the best choice and thus vote accordingly, but i still believe it lacks style on several levels. slightly disappointed."
5/27/2009,you're missing the point i tried to make. candidates that are prominent on eve forums tend to get elected more because their names are familiar. so if you start exploiting the fact that you provide for an in game service you're relying on that instead of what you stand for. makes me wonder why serenity didn't run (and get elected) for the 2nd term.besides there are enough governments that control radio/tv and try to brainwash the citizens so they will vote for them again. people are so used to this they start to think its normal in an internet spaceship game as well.but even when csm is some sort of popularity contest doesn't mean they can try and influence ccp into changing things because players care about it. just that ccp should pay more attention to them since these 2 terms they should have taken the csm more seriously. several csm members wrote that they would liked that ccp got involved more.
5/27/2009,sounds very much like someones implemented the hack.1. this round of voting should be dropped.2. the expoits in the voting system should be fixed.3. rules should be set for anti-spamming.so currently we can safely bet that at least one of the candidates to be elected will be due to fraud.
5/27/2009,"your list? i though i owned my email address. i only gave you limited permission to use it to send me outpost alerts.only message makes it ok? this isn't a volume issue.you messed up, it was a mistake.so you didn't even send it from the list i subscribed to, nice.just play fair.next election i look forward to flood of spam and hacks.thanks for setting the trend."
5/27/2009,"funnily enough in your ""point-by-point"" rebuttal, i noticed that you somehow missed this one, so i though you might want another go."
5/27/2009,bastards eh
5/27/2009,"well lets be selective with what we all read.yes can-spam was created for commercial and specifically sexual emails. however it's the regulation the industry as a whole likes to abide by as a ""best practices"" even for non-commercial mails.i think you can agree that using one list to promote another thing, with no out-out mechanism, is in the spirit of spam and not something all users will accept.generally if you don't want to have your isp blocked on all the anti-spam lists (which are automatically configured on many routers) then it's a good idea to play nice. you might not be charged under can-spam but you'll still be screwed."
5/27/2009,"i delibrately didn't run for 2 reasons:- the meeting in reykjavik would be in the dead-middle of winter, and i'm not so keen on going anywhere that cold.- the 2nd csm was predicted as needing (and did) continue to deal with small fixes. i'm interested in dealing with future / universe shaping ideas.but it was mostly the winter thing ;)"
5/27/2009,"this would probably be a good thing, but i don't think ccp wants to spend the time coding the tools necessary. as with so many other things, they could do it a lot better if they had the time and inclination. the shuffling of candidate names is important, and i'm amazed that they still haven't done it - ballot position massively skews electoral results. i ran because i think i have good ideas and would do a good job as a csm member, and because i think i'd like having the job(yeah, i'm a geek). i vote for myself because i think i have good ideas and would do a good job as a csm member, and because i think i'd like having the job. there is no other candidate i want more to be on the council, and i think it has a chance of mattering, and as such i cast all my votes for myself. i don't claim to be the only one who would do a good job, or the only one worthy of a seat. i won't name names, but i have several people in mind who i'm sure will be great csm members if elected. that said, i'm running because i'd like to win, and as such i'm going to do what i can to see to it that i do, including casting both votes for myself. it might be different if i thought i was guaranteed to win, or guaranteed to lose, but i'd like to think i'm somewhere in the middle, and as such that i'm not throwing my votes away. true, but candidates use all sorts of things to get elected. politicians strive mightily to be seen by the general public as someone they could share a beer with - a completely irrelevant piece of information, but a major part of why a lot of people get elected. works the same way in eve - i don't intend to disparage the candidates abilities, but dj and vuk won on the backs of their alliance leadership, hardin won because he created half the alliances in the game, and i could attribute half a dozen other winners to simple and obvious constituencies. that's not all they had going for them, but i'd wager the recognition and trust level from their in-game actions was the difference between their resounding victories and likely defeat. the fact that serenity is trying to use his in-game contacts - which presumably worked for him in csm 1 - to win a seat on csm 3 is hardly surprising."
5/27/2009,iirc an analysis of the 1st csm revealed that there was no correlation between position in the list and actual votes received. i'd suggest run it again with 1/2/3 csm results. the ultimate question is: even if there is some bias; is there sufficient bias based on ballot position to get anyone elected (or stop someone being elected).
5/27/2009,"hey, what do i have to do with this? *waves arms around wildly*"
5/27/2009,"uhm... not sure if it's been mentioned yet but the can-spam act is a us law, and is therefore completely unrelated to any of the rest of the world.not that i agree or disagree with the voting tactics in question, but i just thought i'd point it out.especially since ccp is based in iceland with servers in the uk. /me holds his tounge before he starts ranting about how americans think they control the world."
5/27/2009,"you know...i actually forgot that we didn't for a minute. that aside, you make a good point. unless serenity himself is actually in the us, the law really doesn't apply in the first place, since he exists outside the jurisdiction of us courts."
5/27/2009,"which industry would that be exactly? the ""maps for space games industry"" i presume, since that's the one serenity belongs to?that aside, let's look at the actual act.here's a snippet from the fcc's website you'll notice every single reference there is dealing strictly with commercial email. so the first test is: is this email commercial in nature? if the answer is no, then regardless of the fact that the email may be junk it doesn't meet the established legal definition of spam."
5/27/2009,"so what does the act specifically do?so...let's see what applies:1. false or misleading header information: since i haven't seen the email, i can't comment on this, but since you immediaely knew who it was from, i'm guessing the header points back to the same person.2. false or misleading subject lines in commercial email: not a commercial email, doesn't apply.3. opt out of future commercial email: not a commercial email, doesn't apply.in fact, pretty much the rest of the act specifically addresses only commercial email. which we have already established this was not.you may not agree with what serenity did, and that's fine. but don't try and cover your dislike with the shroud of a law that doesn't apply."
5/27/2009,look..... while you whiners and morons are screaming.... ask yourself one question if you have the courage to sawllow your frakking pride.did you subscribe to his list or not?if you said yes..... your sol and should stfu.this is not the place to complain about it... take it up with the server provider/owner and kindly don't let the door hit you on the way out.end of discussion.even if you said no.... this is yet again... beyond eve's jurisdictional right.that's like telling everyone that you hate my guts because i refused to give you a free fix-it at the shop and that should deny me the right to run for csm.... are you really that moronic?
5/27/2009,/threadyou can argue about semantics and the can-act spam definition but it all boils down to adding unsolicited information to a newsletter for a personal gain. and since other candidates have this opportunity it just gives an unfair advantage. just use the means everybody else has and explain the people why you think you're good enough to represent the players in the csm.
5/27/2009,do you actually read before spouting off your opinions or are you just heer for grins?if your subscribed to the newsletter... then its your own damn fault... end the subscription.stop whining.
5/27/2009,"that's not the point. serenity's mailing list was for outpost updates - people joined it to get emailed about new outposts, not to get emailed csm advertisements. there's a certain obligation there to keep your mails topical. i don't think anyone would have objected to a ""by the way..."" at the bottom of one of the mails, but a specific advertisement mail being sent out? that's a bit shadier."
5/27/2009,regardless... they should take it up with the guy himself and his own website.this has nothing to do with eve itself or assembly hall.no one is obligated to vote after getting spammed as they put it.that's like dragging anyone one persons real life into the equation and to use that as a basis for disqualification....it would be different if it was actual spam...if i had gotten it... i still would have issues bringing it up here....a: it wouldn't do squatb: its a waste of timec: i can do far more damage by having the idiot shut down than whining about it here.
5/27/2009,"actually, it was the op who started that line of debate by suggesting that the email violated that act.i'm not debating if the email should or shouldn't have been sent. frankly, as far as i am concerned, if ccp decides it violates the rules of the csm election process, they can remove serenity from the running at will - they are, after all, the ones who decided he could be a candidate in the first place.however, by bringing up the argument that the email violated the us can-spam act, the op made it seem as if the sender may have knowingly engaged in an (in the us) illegal activity, which is a far more serious charge than breaking the rules of an internet spaceship game."
5/27/2009,bingo... i can get why someone would be put off... but thats not the point.the point is... your arguing over something that has nothing to do with eve itself other than the guy running for csm.ccp couldn't control or enforce such things because they have no control over it.. and it would be stupidly insane to enforce such a thing....anyone and there mother would be pushing for accusations and what not.either you report him to the fcc or you report him to abuse for spamming... ccp has no jurisdiction nor does csm or this board.this is nothing more than a whine thread.... sorry to say.ps: and imho.... if you subscribed to the newsletter....its your own damn fault... if the newsletter is abusing its sub... then you take it up with them..debating the issue here would warrant the topic being moved off this board. the csm thing is coincidental...
5/27/2009,"it should probably have gone into jita park, i agree, since it's an election issue and not an actual csm topic. i haven't reported it because i don't like moving threads after they get big. barring that, it's a fine topic - salacious rumours about a candidate breaking the laws of a country he doesn't even live in are always good fun, and standard grist for the mill during an election."
5/27/2009,"salacious. i love that word. i'd vote for you herschel just for that, if i hadn't already voted for you for something else.(now that should start a few rumors )"
5/27/2009,go.
5/27/2009,"sounds like a damn fine idea to me, and would make life in a noobie corp slightly less painful. which might mean i can recruit one or two of them!"
5/27/2009,its quite hard to fight these scumbags but ccp seriously should look into harsher means to stop this.a single right-click option to report spammers should be considered. now you have to do like 5 mouse clicks and type a msg which makes most people not bother. abuse should get the option removed (for a month or so).trial/buddy toons should be limited to a few channels only and not allowed to post links etc. it might limit the new players a bit more but in regard of the scale of the abuse of these types of accounts it important to let them enjoy the game and not get ticked off by these low lives.another thing i came up with might be that ccp designs some kind of ai in the client that keeps track of communication and check its against a set of rules and signals a heads up when it finds patterns common for isk spammers. what rules should remain a secret and constantly adapted so that its almost impossible to circumvent them.
5/27/2009,"wrong. i explained how it wasn't an addon. that's a separate issue. all i was talking about were a limited amount of commands, and the only reason i say that is because there are alot of different aspects of the game that need hotkey support, and this could take care of it all in one fell swoop. stop being lazy? how is petitioning for game improvements lazy? hotkeys aren't lazy, aren't some kind of luxury, they're standard fare for mmos these days. again, being forced to click is stupid.i know all those 5 year players are probably fine with laggy-ui-clickfest, and are afraid of the game being homogenized into wow, but i think improving the ui, that thing which is one of the most cited flaws with this game, is a worthwhile goal."
5/27/2009,hotkey - a shortcut of keys mapped to do a functionnow.. how is that not being lazy again?i get what your saying.. ui needs improvement... but stop being a damned hypocrite about it and start clearing up your contradictions.
5/27/2009,i think generally it is a support sink to take presure off ccp.user ***** to the csm.csm takes all the slack.csm does the ground work.the csm *****es to ccp.ccp ignores the csm.
5/27/2009,"the tags mean nothing - someone started [issue] on the first day, it stuck for a while, and then people started doing wacky things. i'd like to think general issues make sense for some topics. sometimes you have a specific proposal, sometimes you've identified something you consider a problem, don't have a single good solution, and want ccp to think about it for you(since ultimately, they'll have to anyways). the csm has generally taken them and presented a spread of options to ccp, and this seems to have worked decently. proposals are taken up if and only if a csm member raises them. support and opposition posts exist to try to convince the nine of them. depends on the edit - minor clarifications are fine imo, major changes are not. that said, because of the last thread, getting a bunch of thumbs by lying to people is a bad tactic. supporting a discussion is sketchy - sometimes the csm will pick up on the idea you support, sometimes they won't. this needs some clarification, imo. there is no statute of limitations on issues being raised. that said, most of those year-old threads already have been raised. i'd love to see ccp make a csm member an assembly hall mod, just so that threads can be tagged with a status. it doesn't make sense, but it happens, because not everyone knows all the threads raised in the past. usually i, or someone else who knows the history, will sort it out quickly though. i believe that ankh's wiki is being ported onto evelopedia, and that future updates will be there. i don't know for sure what her plans are with regard to her personally-hosted wiki are, though. hope this helps."
5/27/2009,"thanks for your answers, herschel. this clears up some, but not all.how about the next csm sat down and agreed to some guidelines for this section, then put an faq in there for everyone to purview?"
5/27/2009,"it's one of the things i'm planning on doing if i'm elected. for that matter, might even submit a draft version to the csm if i'm not. some actual codification of what goes here and what the csm wants to see in a proposal might be quite valuable. of course, the people who make the worst threads will probably never read those rules, but still, it'll at least make it easier to yell at them."
5/27/2009,"while setting up a faq/guideline might be handy (and it is imho), the csm is fairly open so each csm can decide how it wants to handle this area. so, while one csm might want to do things one way, the next might want to do something completely different.the only hard rules are that a topic needs to be here for at least 7 days before being raised in a csm meeting, and that the topic either has to have a % support of the total voter count from the current election cycle or a csm 'champion' for it to be raised at csm level.generally, the amount of support for the issue being raised is looked at, along with any comments/arguments or edits to the op. the actual issue getting raised can be identical to the op, much more indepth, or even less indepth, it rally depends on who decides to champion it and what they think they can get to pass through the csm.as for porting ankhe's wiki - it's about 90% done (and i now have rsi), and the evelopedia mods have recently agreed to a new bunch of categorizations for csm to use to make it all a bit better. when i get some time i'm going to go back through and edit all the past topics so that it's a little easier to read. in regards to csm's moderating this area - i would love it and it has been asked for, just not officially through the csm (raising the topic etc.). i spent a little time at the beginning of csm 2 going through old issues that had been dealt with and reporting them to get locked to stop them being continually bumped, but quite honestly the amount of time it started to take was getting ridiculous, so i concentrated on the evelopedia instead."
5/27/2009,"quick tips:1: don't treat it like a #####ing board...2: don't do 1 hit post wonders.... you'll look like a total moron/idiot... if your going to post... bother to participate.3: don't make demands. ""i demand you do this!"" is not how you make a proposal or idea.4: csm is not an all powerful group of players who can do anything you want.... this doesn't make them useless either.... until you get that straight... you'll never get it figured out.5: think about your idea and how it effects things 3 months down.... then 6 months... then 1 year.... then 3 years.... you'll be surprised that 9 times out of 10... most ideas are shot down just due to age.6: take both sides respectively before proposing... how does it effect this group.. that group? most ideas are selfish...and self centered as most people only come here to complain about an issue.7: keep an open mind.... don't assume the title really means what the proposal says.8: don't just react... read.... sit back... .think about it.. then respond.9: and for the love of all things good... don't repost or repeat ideas.10: posting with an alt is disrespectful and ridiculous in this context.11: alt supporting is an insult and should be a ban-able offense.... but it isn't... just don't do it."
5/27/2009,"yes, definately would like a verification for these, just lost another bigger broker fee... and of course it has to be user configurable if there is the popup or not. advanced version would be include a user-configurable treshold for broker fee, so that only big order cancels get verified. not sure if this would be truly useful or not, just a thought."
5/27/2009,"i found this thread in a search and am reviving it... especially this bit:that is why i was searching. i can't believe more people aren't complaining of this problem. at certain angles, especially in the orange nebula systems, the background completely washes out the tactical display when you mouse over a module. it's annoying in the extreme. (before you ask, my gamma is actually set a little low -- i don't like washed out screens, but prefer deep, rich colors. playing with it didn't seem to help the situation either way.)i don't mind having complex nebula backgrounds there as a toggle option for the people who want them, but i prefer dark black space and lots of stars. it is rather.... empty, you know. and i've got to believe that a civilization which can build ships capable of crossing a star system in a few seconds wouldn't have any real problems designing a functional tactical interface. perhaps an option to toggle the interface draw colors??"
5/27/2009,sorry for the double; forgot to put my thumbs up thingie in.
5/27/2009,"adding the background nebulas and such as actual distant 3d objects would not add any more load to the client than the current gas cloud and such effects do close up. this would provide a 'real' sense of place, instead of just being in another seemingly randomly colored system."
5/27/2009,i love backgrounds.
5/27/2009,"/signed.all we have atm are clouds, more clouds and even more clouds, in all colors and their mother.they need to look at hubble photos and then implement backgrounds that look like those."
5/27/2009,"concord sanctioned mail certificate blablablah... no thanks.mutual +10 standing concord immunity, yes please! i don't think there's a need for the concord sanction...snip. setting someone to +10 actually takes some effort, and you shouldn't set people to +10 unless you mean it./signed"
5/27/2009,"as it usually happen, pilot notice that the license is over by the fact of impossibility to login to the game. when there are several accounts owned, the license tracking going to be the real headache. the offer is to add the pilot license expiration date to the general pilot profile sheet."
5/27/2009,"this has been suggested before. the problem is that the financial server is separate from the login server. the only query done is when you log in, a single request is sent: ""is this account active?"" ccp said they're looking to a solution towards this, but they have to be very careful with the coding. it may happen soon, or it may not happen if they can't get the code to work without bogging down the system."
5/27/2009,and this is why the new topic button shouldn't be available right next to the reply to topic button.
5/27/2009,give wi her logo anyway!!! it's about damn time!
5/27/2009,"i don't. but then, who am i?"
5/27/2009,"it's desirable that erik participates in these discussions himself as he also has to discuss the issues within the csm prior to voting, and in the discussions with ccp, and i'll definately urge him to do so.it's one of the main rules in the founding documents of the csm and enforced by ccp. it was occasionally broken in csm2 though."
5/27/2009,got my vote this time around. good luck!
5/27/2009,"that wasnt my wife, it was plague black and his prank calls.thanx for all support ladies. if i win lets go and nuke jita to celebrate. i will ask for reinforced node tho (not that matters anyway)"
5/27/2009,"good luck to all of the candidates in anticipation of the results.thanks for everyone that participated in these elections, either as candidate or by voting!"
5/27/2009,what she said.had great fun discussing stuff and will be sad to see some not making the cut.
5/27/2009,"and here i was telling everyone it was over at downtime. well then. in any case, best of luck to all candidates, and i'm looking forward to seeing how it all shakes out."
5/27/2009,it took a week last time to announce the results right?i wish bad luck on everybody except me and that pirate guy and that other couple of guys i liked
5/27/2009,ccp mentioned somethign about an official announcement being made tomorrow on the original dev blog.
5/27/2009,"thursday the 29th which is an incorrect date. ;) * may, 29th, thursday. a permanent announcement made about the results of the third csm elections.* may, 31st, saturday. the third csm meets online for the first time.i hope they clear up the meeting date issue so that multiple people don't miss it."
5/27/2009,"so, will ccp send us candidates a mail, or do we find out with the rest of eve?"
5/27/2009,you should get a mail a day or two in advance.
5/27/2009,"may, 29th, thursday 2014 is a perfectly valid date for me, please check your calendar."
5/27/2009,i never got such an email last time. maybe it's only the winners that get it?
5/27/2009,wats a csm?
5/27/2009,so it's soon then.
5/27/2009,"i'd like to thank everyone who asked me questions, criticized me, voted for me, or voted against me. the only way the csm can improve eve for more people is if more people participate. so all participation is welcome :)"
5/27/2009,a vote for the industrialists and rational thought.
5/27/2009,"ank, i have to ask where your friend is. if hes supposed to be following up on the push for getting fw the attention it needs, why hasn't he shown up here?"
5/27/2009,2
5/28/2009,yes
5/28/2009,up she goes keep it alive attn: forum dev's please sticky this

5/28/2009,"totally supported. i agree it does need a sticky, and it does need all the support this can get.the lens effect is cool and all, but we see it everywhere. and i truly miss the huge flashes of white light and lightning that represented the cavalry or incoming death. it really gave an epic sense to a capital or capital fleet arriving on the scene.ps. when you all sign this, make sure you click the support button too to show them we're serious"

5/28/2009,"let us assume a small to medium sized alliance wants to carve a system or two off from a bigger powerblock for itself.also assume the systems are jammed and the defenders have a titan or two.right now it works pretty much along the lines of this... attackers have to use sub-caps under a jammer, defenders dd them at every opportunity, ideally on jump in, and the sub-capital fleet gets massacred or cannot effectively stay on grid at the jammer due to the two titans poking their noses out of the shield...invasion over.change titans to an anti-capital platform.attackers deploy their sub-capital fleet to hit the jammer, defenders must deploy a sub-capital fleet to defend it. end result - a big fight for everyone. numbers and blobs might happen, but at least it's a chance and good attacker with well thought out tactics can overcome the numbers.jammer goes down, attackers caps jump in. defenders cap jump in. defenders decide to deploy titans to do horrible stuff to attackers caps. motherships are deployed to rep the titans, attackers support tries to tackle it and get warp in for it's dreads or they snipe. dreads stay out of siege and get reps. with good tactics they might win and kill a titan. if the defenders blob then the attackers maybe should have brought more people through good use of diplomacy. either way, a big fight happens.titan's can't just boom the hostile sub-caps off the field and the change introduces effective counters to any tactic employed by either side.more fighting.more fun.role for motherships.no more ""200 people sitting around for 2 hours then jumping into a bubbled gate and getting dd'ed en-masse"".yes this is a pretty simplistic outline, but i think it is fundamentally sound. and yes fiddle about with titan hitpoints and mothership repping and so on to create a nice synergy between the classes. end result, sub-caps fight sub-caps and caps and supercaps fight caps and supercaps. depoly either and there is a counter. don't want your caps focused on by a titan or two, then bring sub-caps and force your opponent to do the same, slow the pace of war for sure. want a quick war and fast tower kills, then deploy your caps, but do it knowing that titans will be a threat and obvious risk."
5/28/2009,"maybe this wasn't clarified, or maybe it needs to be addressed differently, dunno:titans are immune to ewar.... this is not ewar. hence, titans can hurt other titans by hitting each other with these effects. 20% chance to lose a dd on a titan b/c another one dd you is a good reason not to stack these up. that said, it's an absolute must that moms be allowed to repair heat damaged ships per my thread. otherwise, if a titan lost a dd, it would have to unfit, and transport to a station to get refit, or have multiple backups in it's hanger to refit..... and that honestly wouldn't be so bad imo.keep in mind, a titan would be stuck on grid for a limited time, so it's not like you can warp one in, fire, warp another in, fire... there would be a series of delays involved to launch constant dd.so to say people are stacking dd is to also say stacking dd gimp titans more. this also means to use a titan to save other caps is litterally a last ditch effort, not a common occurance."
5/28/2009,"the main principal we disagree on is the ship class titans are used to counter. i don't believe a large area-of-effect weapon which effectively disables hundreds of pilots at the click of a button can *ever* be considered balanced, or needed. or fun. in short, i don't agree it should be an anti-support ship with an area of effect weapon.i believe the titan would be more balanced in an anti-capital role, with its logistics capabilities fully intact. and it would still be tactically extremely useful, not to mention fun."
5/28/2009,"yes, thats pretty much what i was thinking too!"
5/28/2009,"all that does is shift the problem to the next problem. first of all we would immediately switch back to the good old strategy of ""all hands on deck and through that gate"" (and keep in mind that these days we have a lot more people then before to pump into a system). we still need something to keep us on our toes and away from the easy road of mass conventional ship blobs so we do not have to fight (or even so we cannot fight because **** lags out with 1500+ people).secondly it will make us push even harder on the capital front, making us require more and more and more capitals to do more grinding. at the same time we will spam more pos to force more grinding. and we will build more and more titans because we face an even stronger capital ship trend.all the ideas sound nice, but you have to put it in a perspective of how mad people really are. let's look at an example :p do you think mm or anyone up north would scale down their focus on titans and capitals in general with such changes? no, the strategem changes so they adapt. the nett result is that - while the paradigm has shifted - the strategic need arises for more pilots in conventional, capital and supercapital ships.i think this guy has a big point. ""titans are like nuclear weapons, except they cause zero fallout so there is zero reason to think about using them twice.""they are fine in small to medium environments, but we got to make it hurt to use them, so that we will not deliberately go nuts as it would be shooting ourselves in the foot.although, in this idea i do like the hindthought of going nuts and burning both hostiles and your own space, scorched earth or something like that."
5/28/2009,"picture the scene... you and your plucky fleet of brave outlaws are cutting around low security space in a light role fleet composing of hacs/interceptors and one or two logistics for good measure. hell, maybe you even have one outlaw in your gang. danger strikes... you run afoul of some wartargets or pirates on a gate... one man screams for reps, but he's an outlaw. the plucky logistics pilots rep him up and are flagged. fail cascade ensues.what i propose:gcc is only incured if rending assistance to another player who has gcc.what this enables for outlaws, either as corps or individuals within corps is more versatility when fighting on gates vs war targets or other outlaws. keep in mind the number of outlaws within faction warfare etc and this has far wider benefits than the odd outlaw who turns to a bit of anti piracy at the weekend.although a lot of you can hurf blurf and say 'you did the crime, take the punishment' the current system still leaves outlaws at a disadvantage when facing legitimate war targets."
5/28/2009,supporting dis.
5/28/2009,"""....aiding and abetting(sp?) an criminal....""as to my position on this... remains to be seen."
5/28/2009,"i'm broadly in support of the proposal but have some additional comments regarding lowsec mining. mining in lowsec is too risky for the proposal to help lure miners into it. as well as the rock revamp there need to be a couple, at least, of new ships designed for the purpose of mining in hostile space. something along the lines of what transport ships are to industrials. if a miner knew, that if they bought one of these ships, they had a good chance of escaping an individual pirate it might encourage them to venture into lowsec."
5/28/2009,"yeah, pretty much. also- all those concerns about exploits can be solved or not even be an issue depending on the way ccp implements the tools. i think possible doomsday scenarios caused by implementing something horribly isnt a proper counterargument to implementing something. ccp doesnt have to release the whole client. ccp can release some ui modification tool that just lets people do limited things to the client, or release a limited programming environment so people could alter the ui within the confines of the existing game client. how its done isnt what this proposal is about, and we'll just have to assume it won't be done by releasing the source code."
5/28/2009,"only if i can write an addon so i can play the gaming using a hacked control pad from steel battlelion and put a cardboard box over my head to pretend i am in a real space ship, yes i am dungar hth."
5/28/2009,"supporting this, since this would be the best addition the game can currently get.also to the naysayers, i bet most of the lag in eve is caused by database latencies, moving a couple basic math calculations to the server shouldn't make any difference at all."
5/28/2009,"no.. yet another reason i left wow was all the mods that were becoming ""necessary"" to play. yes, the igb sucks, yes mail system is annoying.. yes there are many ui things that could be better. but i dont want a mod ""arms race"". i have to run eve without anything else as it is or i start having problems. i can run 2 clients right now but i have to have nothing else running and turn off all effects in game . if i soo much as open firefox or any other program before eve, i need to reboot or i will eventually crash either the client or my whole system. there are others in the same boat playing right now, i've talked to some of them. before you claim that an arms race wont happen really think hard and honestly about it... mods happen and soon corps will be requiring mods for all members, which will lead to enemies requiring something to match or counter that mod, which will lead too.. well you get the picture..."
5/28/2009,i'm down.
5/28/2009,"again, what this says to me is that ccp makes such a bad ui that it's not even close to competitive against what players can make. an arms race is just fine by me - oh no, people striving to make eve even easier for me to play? the horror!your point about system resource use is one that i'd be at least a little concerned about - my machine chokes on two clients too, and i'd probably refrain form using mods that required a lot out of my system. that said, again, it'd be my choice, and it's not like players can't create lightwight mods. i can choose to play with the crap ccp gives me, or i can choose to modify to my heart's content. the worst case here - mods are crap and you don't want to use them - is exactly the status quo. the best case is us actually having a game that might be worthy of an adjective better than ""marginally playable""."
5/28/2009,well i think this is not possible. the game si written in python (or at least great part) and i quess ui is in python as well (why not if the game is in python). so the only way to allow people to modify ui would be exposing some part of python and this is point where it ends because python is quite powerfull and it's hard to set some borders and limit set of availiable functions to 'safe' ones. with python exposed you could easily write your own tools that give you advantages over another players ( i can imagine autopilot that can even dock/undock ). i think if they rewrite the game to c++ and use lua (for example) as scripting language + puting all gui stuff to xml then we might have customizable gui otherwise it's impossible.^^ well and it's not going to happen since they already paid programmers to write it in python
5/28/2009,"i am sure that the issue has been brought a number of times before but being a new player i wonder why the feature is still missing.of course i am talking about the amount of armor, shield, energy logistics have contributed to the battle. if the amount is recorded into the kill mails somehow then many players would enjoy flying logistics and this would result in much longer lasting and satisfying battles.this could basically be done by adding the player to the kill mail if he has repped a player who had aggro on the target/damage dealers in the km; same thing seems to work when repping someone in empire - then the repper gets aggro too.healing (or armor/shield rep as it is known in eve) and buffing (or warfare bonuses) are very old and well known concept in most of the mmorpg world.a wise developer would make people comfortable playing ""healers"" since this makes the game much more deeper and interesting for everybody.playing healing character is not that rewarding in most of the games (compared to the damage dealers) but in eve it is even worst. virtually you get no record for your contribution to the battle.people just like the recognition for the job they have done and when it is missing they would prefer other ships to fly."
5/28/2009,got a point. i dont see why not.. give recognition where its due.

5/28/2009,"this is an issue? and why can't you...idk...give out some ideas? right now, my ship i use is a caldari moa. works wonder on clouds...don't see the reason to add a new ship for the sake of it.--isaac"
5/28/2009,"the only reason i support this ideais because i strongly thinkthat ccp should give more attention to specific professions out therelike salvaging/looting ( some ppl make a living out of this in 0.0 or empire )gas mining ( the moa is a nice alternative but a specific ship wouldn't hurt )i also think that ccp is neglecting the fact that people are willing to train fora certain race /ship ( cross training etc )maybe they should look into some kind of parralelle training like caldari/gallente with the moa/rokh ectminmatar/caldari , this way they wouldn't forcibly need to make a ship for every race .eventually expand the pirate ships , create some new pirate ships with a dedicated purpose."
5/28/2009,it does make sense that sometime after the advent of gas mining a specialized ship would be built by *someone* to get the edge on the new industry.
5/28/2009,"after you've woken up in the morning to check your market orders, see if that important mail has arrived or to take your industrial goods out the oven and start to move them around, you load up the client and log in, ready to start a new day.except because you run multiple accounts and you're very tired, you typed in the wrong user-name and the wrong set of characters load up.you close the client and start again, this time putting in the correct details.the only two options available at this time are ""enter game"" (which i don't want to do because it's the wrong account) and ""terminate character"" (which whilst freeing up a slot after 10 hours so i can make a new alt to do whatever it was i wanted to do, seems a little extreme given the circumstances) ;-)wouldn't a ""back to login screen"" button be neat?yes i know you can press escape and then ""log off"" but... lazy?it wouldn't be very hard to implement, surely?"
5/28/2009,"or, better yet, make ""log off"" actually log you off, and only log you off, instead of, y'know, restarting the client.but i'm guessing there's a reason ccp terminates the client to log off. i hope."
5/28/2009,"yes, this needs to be implemented."
5/28/2009,the client used to have this but it turned out to be broken after a patch some day so they removed it.would be nice if they fixed it once more. but that has been requested quite a few times.

5/28/2009,"supported in its full beauty.i am not yet sure, how a ui can look like that will smoothly allow the management of so many different privileges. then again, that is something which ccp's designers will have to think about.next to a usable ui, the learning curve for new ceos must not rise. possibly, the title slots which we have today could be preset with sensible privilege profiles as a starting point.i would like to add that standing and address book management are not satisfactory either."
5/28/2009,"ccp has said so? where? also, you're an idiot.done properly, it won't lag. christ.edit: this is the millionth thread about this.fake edit: actually drawing on the ship is bad (""hur hur hur look at me guies i drew a giant space peniz on mah erebus hur hur hur""). changing color schemes, sure, why not."

5/28/2009,"so, this is thread #256 about ship customization coming to an end, having had some support, negligible opposition but no effect at all. what gives?problem could be this op not actually being a formal proposal but just the ol' idea thrown in once more. it seems more likely that if a poster of some reknown (possibly: former csm member or such) would post a good, formal proposal based on what seems the least common ground found in this thread, support will be much greater and so will visibility and lifetime of the thread. i know some of the current csm candidates have agreed on supporting this issue in their campaigns, and they could certainly be pestered to bring the issue up again given a decent proposal and more than 15 thumbs in support."
5/28/2009,"fw has so much potential; it's sad to see the lack of attention it's getting. if ccp isn't sure how to go about addressing the issue, i'm sure there are any number of players interested in brainstorming for ideas to use as starting points (and a number of ideas are already out there)."
5/28/2009,"please finish fw ccp. as a newer player i have had a blast in fw, but after a few weeks it has become apparent that fw is incomplete and i have stopped participating as much. also, the lag is disappointing and i do not have the isk to throw ships away to lagfests."
5/28/2009,"for the past few years the main feature of the large expansions are worthless. they sounds good on paper before implementation and getting us all excited, but very disappointing after release. these expansions are nothing but marketing tricks to keep the old players waiting a few months more and get new ones ofc. with that in mind it is quite understandable that the devs are not caring of the past expansions, but concentrating to future ones instead.this strategy may bring success short term, but miserably fails on the long run."
5/28/2009,"feature bloat is a problem that effects traditional software schemes where users purchase a license, then need features to convince them to buy a new version a year later.eve is an asp subscription setup. this is designed to eliminate feature bloat through having your users pay for constant development, ensuring old bugs are fixed before new features are introduced. keeping the existing customers happy before reaching out for new ones with silly features.it provides cash for further development from the existing user-base without needing to add stupid features just to get the cash-flow to pay programmers and support for another year. eve shouldn't suffer from this problem.evemail needs an update.bugs and ui problems from 2004 need fixing.we don't need another t3.we don't want another ship.we wouldn't mind the stuff you've already put in working first.you're in this subscription model, you don't have the problem of upgrades and feature bloat. why buy into that problem just so you can recruit a few users with a press release on mmorpg.whatever.....it's 5 times easier to keep an existing customer then it is to recruit a new one."
5/28/2009,fw ftw
5/28/2009,"as i have sketched during my campaign, i want fw to grow into something really big.the empires are at war! this part of the game should attract and bind a lot more infrastructure and influence a lot more pilots than it currently does. this is not supposed to mean that everyone shall fight. no ! supply, resources, and trade should be required for and affected by the war. also as a ""natural"" correction measure to avoid one empire to ""win"". ""game over"" would not be good for the evolution of the backstory.as well, i want standing to play a major role. it may be the lever or binding element to a greater fw picture, that will eventually reach alliance space as well."

5/28/2009,"sounds good, also nice for w-space actions."
5/28/2009,that could be addressed and should be.. just because drones arent mainstream in a faction does not mean factions wont make drone boats.. makes sense that they would at least try to create a ship to match/counter an opposing faction's.

5/28/2009,"oh dear god yes, it would help so much after fights, especially capital fights / posses."
5/28/2009,"since factional warfare began individual corps within the militias have been able to be targeted for aggression from people outside of the factional warfare arena. this is how it should be. the issue however is that the militia mates of the targeted corps can do nothing to help their militia mates except a counter dec of their own which, if spread around the various corps in a militia would soon send the price of decs skyrocketing.militia's aren't, as ccp has stated before, meant to be alliances and as such i do not believe that the answer is to cause the war deccing of one corp to be considered a deccing of all corps. instead i think that the best solution to this would be that if a corp decs a militia corp the other player corps within the militia are given the option to dec the aggressor back for free as the cost of the war dec is paid for by the militia itself. this would also not take a slot up on either the counter deccing corps war dec limit or the corp that initiated the aggression. this would allow the militia corps to defend a entity at their own choice and wouldn't result in the abuses that could be seen if the militia was treated like an alliance as an entity therefore still allowing the safety experienced by corps in fw now if they so chose or allow those corps who wish to help thier friends to do so without cost or penalty beyond exposing themselves to harm."
5/28/2009,and i support my own thingy.
5/28/2009,i think this makes sense.
5/28/2009,imho.... fw should not be in any complicate form or fashion or choice as stated above.put simply... if you join any one of the 4 militia empires as an indivdual or corp... you will automatically put in an metaphorical alliance... the alliance that being the militia.if your in the militia.... that militia is automatically made a war target to the opposing militia's along with its allies.minmatar would be against amarr and caldari.... and so forth and so forth.this removes the need for war-dec'ing and messing with alliances....i mean what else would one expect when you join the military? the governments political stance becomes your own by due process.no need to make it any more complicated than that.

5/28/2009,"i was reading the new ideas from csm on how to improve 0.0 here:incentivizing 0.0and i got something special through my mind...if we are moving sovereignty holding from moon pos to planetary pos, and we are trying to avoid dread blobbing, we should focus on the blobbing problem instead of giving pos more and more healing points.the main idea: the proposal is to create a ""focused deflection field array"". its deflection field redirects part of the damage inflicted to the pos to a ramdom aggressing target (automatic mode). if you assume control over it, you should be able to focus the deflected damage to a specific target. simple: as more dps the pos takes, the more it will deflect.balancing: by limiting the number of dreads shooting at a pos by a certain number carefully choosen by ccp, blobbing would not be so efficient anymore. by using this new array, as more dreads fire at the pos, the larger is the risk of loosing one of them, which just entered siege mode (10 min). the attacking fleet would be composed by more repair ships, which should be there to heal the damaged dreads after they leave siege. on the other hand, deflected damage can be easily decreased by the attackers by simply stopping to fire at the pos, or by reducing the number of dreads shooting at it.sovereignty holding: people are complaining a lot that it would be better to replace that lots of moon pos holding the sovereignty by a few planetary pos. these new planetary pos have high strategic value and deserve higher defensive/aggressive capabilities. you now that increasing the pos hp would just require a bigger blobbing to destroy it. that's not the idea. the planetary pos should be more aggressive. if the enemy wants to use blobbing, there should be economical consequences.fitting: the new array should use lots of cpu (e.g. 5000). currently, defensive structures does not use much cpu, and industrial pos would really not benefit of such an array, due to the high cpu usage. maybe just some valuable moon pos with good materials (like dysprosium, promethium, etc), since these are strategic resources for strong alliances, and thus deserve better defensive capabilities too. furthermore: the proposal is just a pos array, so it is optional, you fit it only if you want to economy: should the array have a strontium fuel bay to burn some fuel? or maybe burn lots of something else? using such module on a well fitted pos should be somehow more expensive, specially if its main usage is pos warfare. this would also help ccp to improve the market, giving miners some more jobs. remember: planetary pos might cause a huge impact on ice market, people will unanchor lots of moon pos which used to hold sovereignty, this must be counter-balanced.ccp work: this does not seem to be hard to implement. it is a new single pos structure. it would be easy to ask for lots of new stuff for the planetary pos. but a single array might be the the first step to change the sovereignty holding system.that's it, thanks a lot for reading, and please comment."
5/28/2009,so you want to make 0.0 more popular by making it even harder to attack and by making pos sieges even more like pulling teeth for those involved? i can't imagine that working well.

5/28/2009,"right now, in wh space, you will find about 1 in 4 systems have at least one pos within them (best guess, based off first hand experience). there is no effective way to attack or remove these pos due to the stront timers. due to the nature of wh space, a wormhole very rarely lasts more than the time it takes for a tower to exit reinforced. additionally, the mass of ships that enter a wh and are able to effectively assault a pos are likely to destabilize the wh itself, and find a large portion of the fleet trapped in wh space.considering that the owner of the pos is always guaranteed to have access to non-wh space, they will almost guaranteed be able to find and bring in additional stront once their tower shields regenerate. i would say that this is an undesirable condition. the solution is to change the way poss work. i understand that ccp will be looking at revising sov with the next patch, and as such there is a strong chance that they will also be looking into poss. removing stront completely is also unrealistic, as obviously there needs to be the ability for people to defend themselves. i would recommend looking at a combination as to the defensive ability of pos (weekend the amounts of shields hp so that you dont need as many ships) along with increasing the consumption amount of stront during reinforced periods. if stront consumption changes are not an option, keeping the lenth of time a wh remains open would remain open is also a possibility (but, this can impact the current wh spawning balance significantly as well)."
5/28/2009,not supported.your logic is contradicting....the owner has to scan for an exit.... the owner has to find an exit that gets him to where he needs to go... and the owner has to scan for an entrance back to the pos.i don't care who you are.... everyone has as much the same chance as anyone else to get in... or out of the wh safely let alone within the same region.i was apart of an alliance that had a hell of a time just getting out.... never mind getting in. they would find exits alright.... smack dab in the middle of 0.0 or worse.never anywhere near high sec... and if they did... it would be a long ways off from where they need to get too.you should spend more time researching whs before making a massive suggestion to changing a mechanic such as stront.the owner is just as likely to not get back in time or have supplies let alone the tools to keep it up.
5/28/2009,"there is no way to effectively attack it to begin with though.you bring in 25 bs's (for a large tower - that isn't a lot). you close the wormhole behind you due to mass. you reinforce the pos. you now sit for 1d 16h waiting for the timer to run out. now, even if the wh doesn't close due to mass, it closed due to time expiring on the wh (i haven't seen any last more than 36 hours). you kill the pos, but are now trapped. congrats. it isn't possible to effectively assult the pos. the attackers need to have a reasonable chance of surviving and getting home. they don't. that is the issue."
5/28/2009,"that is a whole different ""kettle of fish"".pos take downs have always been plagued with issues.the only way you would be able to do such a thing is to squeez a cap fleet into whs from 0.0.... good luck doing that.the pos mechanics for defenses are too strong imo but we don't want to nerf them either.don't use whs as an excuse to getting the job done.... just use it as a amplification of the problem already present in real space."
5/28/2009,"i think you're being pessimistic here. first off, you can't get trapped in a wormhole - there's always a way out. bring a covops to scan you a way back out. second, you don't even need to leave the bs in place - leave the covops inside, a few hours before it comes out, scan down a hole move your fleet to it, jump through. if that's not big enough, repeat the process. if you're assaulting a large pos, you really ought to have the ability to keep a spare man on hand to do your scanning, and he'll be cloaked and safed so there's no real risk of losing him. this is a concern, but you're overstating it horribly."
5/28/2009,how economical is it exactly to run a large deathstar/****star in wormhole space anyways? there's no minerals to create passive income and the only income at all comes from ratting.
5/28/2009,don't troll things you obviously have no bloody idea what your talking about.whs may not be 0.0 but it is just as every bit as profitable.the trick is transportation... it may not be popular as its quite frustrating to nail down a consistent pattern for ingress/egress.
5/28/2009,you neeed to realize that in 0.0 this is a complementary source of income for some playersi dont think removing the modules from the loot table would helpor maybe in empire it would but for 0.0 it would be a major issue
5/28/2009,"/signed.1)i don't know why every race can see gallente/amarr/minmatar fit and we have to think about what caldari perhaps got on their ships...2)it's a very important detail, seeing missiles be dropped by random spot is very... bad"
5/28/2009,"ok, you can even tank 2 or 3 if you fly the right thing and fit it well, but have you found anything that can tank 8-10? no, i didn't think so.titans are no longer doing as they were supposed to do. they were supposed to be the jewel in an alliances fleet, the flagship and a statement of power. now they're being used in large blobs which is game breaking for everybody else, something must be done, and this idea is as good as any i've seen"
5/28/2009,"its a neat idea, but problem:you can fire once per minute, at worst it takes 4 mins to kill a dread (4mil ehp).i deploy 4 titans on grid so they can one-volley any dread. how are you going to kill my titans now?its a nice idea, but lets face it, it makes them neigh on invincible in groups."
5/28/2009,"yes, yes a thousand times yes."
5/28/2009,bring 50 battleships and couple of dictors? of course it's a shocking idea for capitals online
5/28/2009,"support for deathstar like guns!still, not one minute rof but 5 minute rof :) no one-hit dreads plz.yue"
5/28/2009,whines incoming from people that don't want their i win button nerfed
5/28/2009,"you'd deploy more dreads - deploying 10 to kill 5 titans wouldn't work (the dreads would die)deploying 50 to kill 5 titans... you'd lose some, but the titans would die :)this is a sensible balance - titans cost a lot more than dreads, you shouldn't be able to take an equal number of dreads, to an equal number of titans, and expect to win the fight ;)"
5/28/2009,"titan gangs alphastriking dreadnoughts with death rays once every minute is, if anything, even more unbalanced than titan gangs with 250km aoe weapons popping subcaps once per hour (especially as, unlike dreads, subcaps can warp out before the dd hits)."
5/28/2009,"still supporting, as i already wrote it in vuk's topic also.i think area dd should be kept, but with much less dmg output (fighting off drones/fighters/frigs) and with some tactical bonus (like an ecm burst), and focused dd should instapop a dread (or any non supercapital) to maintain balance. a couple of dreads kill of a titan pretty swiftly if the titan's solo, but the titan should be able to send to hell a few of them before going down even if he's solo.and yes. titans were meant to be fleet command ships (look at their bonuses), with antiblob capabilities, but these days none of its bonuses nor the clone vat bay and ship hanger is used (at all!). people use only dd, and it shows that dd is way too much overpowered."
5/28/2009,"not when titans can be killed by a large bs fleet without fear of dd ;)risk/reward/balance is effectively re-written, but still very much there"
5/28/2009,"i give support for this but with one minor modification.do not move target painters to high slot. make a new weapon modification or sensor equipment that sits in the high slot and gives similar bonuses.we already have sensor equipment that goes in high slot, auto target array. just make one that puts a secondary lock on a target so you can get better triangulation or some such reason."
5/28/2009,"not remotely supported. this idea is almost beyond ridiculous.where do you get these ""most of x fit x"" ideas from?a rapier/huginn pilot chooses to either be disrupt-capable or not. even with usual mwd-lse-lse tank this leaves three slots for either triple webs/2 webs+painter/whatever. and given the relatively poor damage output of either the split system huginn or 2-3 gun rapier what sane recon pilot is going to dump that slot for a friggin tp?oh...and the tp is an indirect form of ewar. it does no damage, drains no cap...actually it does nothing offensive at all unless certain weapon types are fired at the selected target.and tough noogies on boohoo caldari. which is what i rather suspect you are trying to buff.go away."
5/28/2009,"24 hours is just too long.20 hours would be about right. 20 hours would allow you to jump somewhere late at night, and permit you to jump back at a reasonable hour the next day."
5/28/2009,who ever said this needed any fixing?
5/28/2009,people that aren't biased.
5/28/2009,i guess thats for the current csm to decide
5/28/2009,so if one of these competent small alliances doesn't control the space around thier tower doesn't that make it easier for a big alliance to come in and stomp on them?
5/28/2009,"minerals being finite is reasonable, however moons are pretty big celestial ojects so depleting them should logically be a very long process.randomising respawns i find harder to justifying since moons logically (i know it's a game so physics can be bent but...) don't just turn up or suddenly change their mineral composition.also a bit unfortunate if you are small alliance living quietly and suddenly have 3 dyspro moons and a horde of larger alliances on your doorstep.personally i would go for a combo of reducing current yield form a moon and introducing random comet spawns from deep space that have maybe a one month duration. we already have a mechanic for it with wormholes."
5/28/2009,"so that nobody bothers to fight for a valuable region, they just sit in their own corner and wait for the respawn dice to fall in their favour?to the op, how do you intend to define 'home space', exactly? if pandemic legion want to control dyspro moons scattered throughout the west, they could just declare 'our home space is fountain and cloud ring' and jump through whatever sovereignty hoops were set up to make it happen. the fact that pl have been able to occupy the moons in cloud ring and syndicate and aridia and prevent anyone else from taking them away suggests that they do control those regions, doesn't it?"
5/28/2009,"i believe the current system of nerfing ships is really bad, but the op's idea of autobalance is plain worse. no support.instead, what should happen when a faction invents a new, overpowered weapon? the other factions should invent a counter to it. instead of reducing what's in the game by nerfing, boost what's in the game.how do you explain from an rpg point of view that the caldari could build ecm that reaches 250km and now they can't anymore, did space change, did physics?now plz don't hit me i know the proposals i'm making are not well thought through; they would lead to further imbalances. still maybe you can see my point and make something of it.for example, the speed of the vagabond was (and still is!) overpowered by far. now while speed nerf was a good thing, in my proposal the other races should have invented web-bonus ships, web bubbles or maybe a ship with a nice tracking bonus.playing the falcon was a unique, fun!, experience that required training and preparation. i made around 250 bookmarks to fly my falcon efficiently in my region, and now i'm primaried while being 70km from the fight. falcon dies.instead, the other races should have increased their eccm abilities, improved the basic electronics or constructed an interceptor that could come at me and be immune to ecm (for a while?)."
5/28/2009,everyone should only fly noob ships.
5/28/2009,"ok here's my 5 cents on the filter system:first of all i like the corpmate filter idea in the op, but as it won't happen how about you guys just scrap the 2 week limit on corp-internal contracts and make it possible to set them to infinite? corpie-special-offers problem solved.the x-jump filter is very nice and fun on filtering sell orders, but completely worthless on filtering buy orders. i dunno if ccp just didn't think of this, but filtering buy orders will remove ranged buyorders in stations more than x jumps away, even when your own station is in range!so for example i'm buying in a 10 jumps range per buy order and i want to see whether i'm still highest bidder. turning filter on to 10 jumps and then wondering why i'm still not buying crap? cause there's a regional buy order 15 jumps away.:("
5/28/2009,"salvage has a corporate tag on it. it belongs to the corp. if wrecks aren't owned by anyone, why do they have a ownership tag on them, and why can't you use tractor beams on other people's wrecks?likewise, calling ninja salvaging a profession is like calling can flipping a profession. its greifing, which i have absolutely no problem with, but its greifing without any risk whatsoever. a person that salvages a tagged wreck should be flashy to that corp for 15 minutes. this wouldn't end ninja salvaging, it would just make it have some negatives. if you don't like ever being flashy, go use your scanning skills to find plexes and anomalies.insofar as the argument about how much time it takes to train scanning skills goes, its pretty obvious that it takes much longer to train combat skills, and scanning skills were meant for scanning ss's and for finding anomalies/plexes (sorry, but if you want to compare all lvl 5 scanning skills, you need to compare them to a all level 5 combat skills... yea, bout that...). i really can't even understand the logic behind the current ccp stance... the fact is that you are destroying (or looting, however you look at it) the wreck when you salvage it, and the wreck is a corporate-tagged entity. a corporation should be allowed to protect its assets. bring ninja salvaging in line with the rest of the game; you salvage it, you get aggro. the other solution is to take tags off wrecks... i thought they didn't belong to anyone anyways? does the loot in the wreck belong to someone then or is that up for grabs also? it just doesn't make sense.in my personal opinion, deadspace should operate like low sec, in that you can attack and concord won't come, but you get global aggro if you initiate combat. i mean, 'deadspace'? isn't the point that its a pocket of space that no one is supposed to know about except the people that scan it or the agent thats gives out the bookmark? but that's probably way to unpopular"

5/28/2009,"hehe, thanks!i'm not much of a forum warrior, i read a lot and talk little.as for how i pulled it off, i've tried to get more personal with people. with no big alliance backer, and not being famous in addition to being relatively young, i believe that was the right approach. took more effort, but ultimately apparently was worth it. and i'll definately work productively with all other csm members who are willing to have discussions about the topics they bring up (or others bring up). i'm not the holder of universal truth, but i'm far from an idiot too. i believe the best policies are forged through combinations of efforts and constructive criticism. i think there's a good mix of people in the csm 3, some of whom are verifiably of a collaborative nature, so i'm looking forward to seeing how it all pans out :-)and thanks again for the votes!"

5/29/2009,"however many people are attacking or defending it always boils down to initially jumping through a gate. even with the current dd mechanic we see some factions stuffing 1400 people plus titans into local to defend a system from time to time.however let us not forget that the vast majority of battles in eve involve 300 pilots or less, and the work done on improving server performance means those fights are generally pretty lag free. removing the current dd mechanic would mean those fights are likely to happen more often under a jammer.even in the larger fights, better to have a laggy fight than no fight at all?people are already doing this, ""capitals are the new battleships"" is often said but maybe overstates the case, however dreads and carriers have an effective counter in themselves.with regard to tower spam, well it already happens with towers on every moon in 50 moon systems.whatever you do with titans, those two facts remain.... numbers count, and you need the 51%. server performance will continue to improve to manage the former, and sov mechanic changes will take care of the last. let us hope that those things are considered alongside a supercap redesign.more fights, less dissapointing boom."
5/29/2009,"well vuk, there's alot of decent thoughts, and well presented.. but it doesn't seem complete yet, and tbh, it seems to be quite far from complete. you're on the right track, and a nice compilation (i like how you pulled in yaay's idea and gave him credit for it, for example).i'll elaborate;hp buff on all supercaps - i think most players agree that this is needed. we start to see people that even set up traps for titans, one of the latest ones comes to mind, where support that are one-two jumps out won't even reach the kill in time to get to fire on it/get on the killmail. it's pretty ridicilous considering the time/isk investment for those ships. in this example you're just stating something necessary - /support on this.mothership vs titan roles - this is where your ideas arn't really 'complete' or halfdone right now. the mothership idea is basicly do let it play more of a logistic role, which is interesting/intriguing, but you don't provide a full solution to it.in the titan case, you provide yaay's idea, which is interesting as well but still not complete. by removing/nerfing the dd, it affect alot of players skill training, not just the current role. if it's removed, it needs to have an important new role for the titans. the suggested idea is interesting, but more like the remote ecm burst - an o****-button instead of an offensive weapon. would you train it to lv5? i'd get it to lv4 and no further.it'd need some more thoughts on what titans would get instead, since well yah, most of us agrees that the dd is over the top today. but titans are damn squishy, and having ""just"" the portal, and the new idea.. would reduce them to a logistic ships. they'd be a passive ship that sat at pos, just like the motherships.as for the olympians.. that does sounds like a role the titans could fill. we don't need new supercaps, fix the ones we have first. and if titans loses their dd, why not give them this role? so what am i saying?the ideas you present are good, but unless it has a ""full package"", i can't give you any support/approval. it's quite massive changes to the pilots.i'll give you that i like how you are thinking of ways to make the motherships more aggressive, and instead of giving them damage, to give them more health/a unique repair/support role. it might just put them on the field again.finish your ideas, give a full package, and if it seems reasonable (you're on the right track), i'll definately support it."
5/29/2009,"you wouldn't train dd 5 if the difference was 40 heat damage vs 32 heat dmg at lvl 4? that's like titan pilots now choosing lvl 4 dd, which is incredibly easy to tank vs lvl 5 dd which is much harder. in a lot of ways, this type of dd would be nothing like an eccm burst. it has 2 lingering affect, and 2 obnoxious effects. it's still dealing damage, but massively reduced... depending on the dd type, it might not even make it through a bs shields. heat damage is not a quick fix which means people are going to struggle to overload their weapons and mwd's in hairy situations. neuting is going to provide more of a role for minmatar and caldari boats in fleets, since atm, they have the worst sniping abilities. and warp scrambling is going to avoid hit and run capabilities if you do get hit by the dd, allowing mop up fleets to get on grid and react immediately and to some good effect while exposing the titan for more time after a dd is fired. that to me is the greatest effect since you will likely never see a pack of rouge titans launching dd after dd with little or no support fleet anymore."

5/29/2009,"mods helped kill wow's fun factor.if you can't play with what ccp gives you, request something else or play something else."
5/29/2009,i like how all the criticism is either:1. eve shouldn't do it because wow does it.2. i don't understand the concept of a dumb terminal and think that it well let people hax hurr hurr.suck it up and let us mod already.
5/29/2009,"sorry, anyone who mods the game for themselves instead of putting their ideas up for public discussion is taking the game too seriously for my liking.not supported./ben"
5/29/2009,hello no. the only way for that to even remotely work would be a model along the lines of apple's ipod software market. not touching that with a 10au pole.
5/29/2009,"if i see more than just pl and goons supporting this - and pl guys even with standardized messages, than i'll support it too, but so far it looks like pl/goon pushing their own agenda of getting yet another advantage in a full pvp game where every advantage counts."
5/29/2009,"most of the criticism on the other hand is either ""no it wont work because ccp will allow us to make hacks"" or ""no everyone will hog all the good mods for themselves"", and standard assembly hall troll posts. so do we like the bad interface of eve or something now?so someone should come up with some valid reason why ccp shouldnt allow players to modify the interface, and saying something from the above paragraph isnt a valid reason. a bad idea is a bad idea, but throwing illogical and/or unsupported criticisms around doesnt make a lot of sense."
5/29/2009,"could we get away from this goon/pl forum bashing. lets bash them ingame ;)yeah, even they have good idea sometimes. and i think a lot of people would like this idea implemented. not to do it themselves, but so that some goonspy could leak their newest interface xdkidding aside, i am sure that some great work would be done, and then shared. and a lot of people would get something they like more then the current."
5/29/2009,"think of it as ccp giving us the tools and framework to add features to the ui that the player base would find useful. some examples would be: filters for chat channels, removing portraits from channel lists (and leaving just the name), changing the ****ing font to something more readable.why is this a bad thing?"
5/29/2009,*raises hand*

5/29/2009,"standings in local also was a goon project that helped you a lot, you didn't release it, but ccp still leveled the playing field by releasing something similar.and before you give another example in the grid-fu pdf file, that was released because your enemies knew of it, and it didn't matter at that point. :)"
5/29/2009,"the local portraits had to be updated based on the corp membership, constantly, with some dude doing tons of work. its physically not possible for them to provide it for everybody.grid fu was an exploit.also i dont have any idea why you think that all the programming talent is within the ranks of big alliances and nobody outside a big alliance will do any work, and nobody is interested in making a name for themself by making the best ui ever.also nobody shares eve api apps. the only good api apps are in the hands of pl."
5/29/2009,"the logserver change that broke bacon also severely crippled the portrait pack.not that the pack is needed anymore, since ccp said ""hey, good idea"" and implemented their (better due to lack of upkeep) version.to build off of what mazz says (in the bit i quoted). i know we don't trust api programs built out of house, we're always concerned about spies. and the web based api using programs we develop in house are linked to our auth system. it isn't something easily exported for general use.none of this has to do with ui scripting, though. it was merely a point to demonstrate that we do release stuff to the general public."

5/29/2009,i don't like it. there are perfectly good drones floating around all over space these days. people should be able to scoop 'em up and put them to good use.

5/29/2009,if you dissconnect drones should automaticly return to the drone bay but if the ship warps out before they retur then when you log back in you should be able to reconnect to them like a probe
5/29/2009,i agree with this. the op is a bandaid fix for a problem that shouldn't be there.
5/29/2009,"i agree with the idea that you should be able to reconnect to your drones in the event of a disconnect or warp out and warp back (since they end up looking the same to the drones).i could especially see this as being useful for carrier pilots, since they may not even be on the grid with the drones when they d/c (i think?).but scooping unattended (i.e. uncontrolled) drones shouldn't be a flaggable offense. fix the real problem, don't compound the error."

5/29/2009,yes
5/29/2009,good idea but this has to go with a a password on corporate and capital ship hangars.
5/29/2009,"as we all know, ccp put some new agents in the game in apocrypha 1.1, and the list has just come out.the totals:2x gallente navy1x fed intel4x caldari navy6x corporate police force2x spacelane patrol1x ishukone watch1x sukuuvestaa1x hyasyoda1x lai dai protection service4x brutor tribethus the totals stand at:3x gallente16x caldari4x minmatar0x amarrnow, ccp's reasoning is ""most people run missions for caldari, so let's add more caldari agents to spread out the population"".i say this is the wrong approach. most people run missions for caldari because they have the best and the most agents allowing selective missioning, turning down less-profitable missions and moving on to the next agent. only caldari can afford this very profitable selective missioning, because of the sheer amount of agents (they currently have almost as much l4 combat agents as the rest of the empires combined).instead of making mission running more viable by adding more agents of the other races, they went the opposite way and just made the situation even more extreme. this is extremely bad game design, instead of encouraging players to truly spread out more and consider running missions for non-caldari agents, they make running l4 missions for caldari agents even more profitable.let's look at the best agents that have been added:gallente: l4 q18 in 0.7 space, the cat(ch) being that this agent has the potential to send players to old man star, which is lowsec factional warfare space. it also has 4 adjacent systems which makes the odds rather high to be sent out of system.gallente: l4 q16 in 0.7 space, one system next door....... and it's in solitude, good luck running your mission ship through 0.0 to get there. (okay this is a nice and welcome boost to the people that live in solitude though, like me!)minmatar: l4 q15 in 0.8 space... no lowsec and only two adjacent systems though.now the caldari:kia isatoh l4 q18 0.6, three adjacent systems of which one lowsec... sucks right? wrong! no stations in adjacent systems so this one won't send you out of solar system at all! if he does send you 2 jumps out to lowsec, then just go to uuhulanen where you'll find your next l4 agent.konuoma ichodan l4 q17 0.5, one adjacent systemurpiluola samiwa l4 q16 0.6, one adjacent systemsotrentaira isara l4 q15 0.5, two adjacent systems with stations, can send into lowsec (2 jumps away)oduma onnajus l4 q18 0.7, three adjacent systemshunen arekila l4 q16 0.7, four adjacent systemsso instead of adding l4 agents to the factions that need them (amarr, gallente, minmatar and how about sisters of eve which have a grand total of 2 l4 agents in highsec?), ccp decides to boost caldari even more. yeah that makes it really hard to choose who to run missions for, and really makes me wonder why so many players run missions for caldari and hardly anyone for amarr... another thing that indicates this wrong approach is ccp adding agents for the corps that already have plenty of them, instead of making other corporations more viable by adding some more combat-agents to them.this issue demands 23 new highsec l4 agents added... for each non-caldari faction.edit: this is the wishlist of agents. if they let me, i'll punch them into the database myself. i tried to keep things balanced as much as possible, and introduced a few small mission hubs (nothing as unbalanced as the caldari already have) for the various factions. i also added some agents for some of the problematic corps (mainly minmatar). the rest of the agents are just solitary l4 agents in out-of-the-way systems.while i was creating this list, i noticed that amarr and especially minmatar really lack 0.5 systems with stations in them. usually if there was a goodlooking 0.5 system, it had only caldari stations in it, even in amarr/gallente/minmatar space!"
5/29/2009,"i'll agree it is a bit on the edge, especially given then debate on level 4's and low sec, but this new agent seed strikes me as a stopgap solution they are trying to see if they can further a trend with it.the idea is to tempt people away from their normal current high sec overpopulated mission hubs, quite possibly with a hindthought of hoping the people running the industry in such overpopulated hubs will follow the mission runs to alternate locations.probably that is why there's an overweight of caldari involved.if it works it may indeed lessen the stress on some places, and smarty indy folks may very well discover new geographical niche markets."
5/29/2009,never thought i'd agree with someone who campaigned to be elected on a 'i got boobs and a mini' campaign and who is what some ppl call a 'glorified pure carebear'. :(
5/29/2009,"i do agree with most things but another reason for alot of people mission running for caldari is that there are alot more caldari pilots out there who fly mainly caldari ships, and in doing so would prefer caldari items from the lp store and thus run but on the main part i do agree that agents for other races are indeed lacking for the amount of lvl 4's in high sec but mainly for higher quality agents missions for the caldari corporations and the fact that caldari are getting alot more new agents where as amarr get nothing.... zilch all ... nada....witch over all does not encourage people to do missions for the other races at all"
5/29/2009,this move will entice players using amarr agents to switch to caldari as they already have high standings with the faction and would have a easy time getting to the best agents.adding several high quality amarr agents would have got the opposite effect.
5/29/2009,"agreed. ccp really need to stop making caldari best at all the pve activities (see w-space, missions, ratting, caldari pos, etc."
5/29/2009,"i think all factions should be on equal terms. if a majority decides to roam caldari space and faces problems doing so, these problems are the result of their own decisions. they should not get a bonus for that. adding more agents is fine with me, but it should affect all factions equally.if there are more attractive mission hubs for other factions, more players will eventually grind their standing up, to run missions elsewhere."
5/29/2009,yarly.
5/29/2009,"signedthe existing mission system does not scale. there is no real intensive to move to the lower quality, or more dangerous missions agents."
5/29/2009,agreed
5/29/2009,"redistributing current agents would have likely been a better choice to solve the issue they were attempting to solve.as for adding agents, these agents offer nothing different from the agents they are counterparts to. they did not add combat or additional high level agents to r&d corporations as an example.in general ccp needs to sit down and figure out what they want their mission system to be and what ""end-game"" they want the pve dedicated player to have. it isn't a gateway to factional warfare or 0.0 missioning; players are simply not taken along that path."
5/29/2009,updating op with a list of agents i think should be added to make the other factions somewhat more competitive without being unbalanced.
5/29/2009,agreed said the same thing on vent last night ^^
5/29/2009,"agreed. while having more high-security level 4 agents in space is nice, the distribution really needs work in focusing on the other 3 races for pve. just because crapdari are the masters of pve (apparently) does not mean that nobody does missions in any other race of ship, nor with any other faction.supported."
5/29/2009,"a half support from me.neglecting one faction over another should not happen.however, you dismissal that agents should be added to lowsec instead of highsec is a mistake.edit: so is this the tone for eriks csm term, his master answering for him, just as it was for the elective campaign?"
5/29/2009,i agree also
5/29/2009,"ccp was looking for a stopgap solution to lag, which this proposal isn't. that said, if they're looking for a long-term solution, this is the way to go. make the other factions half as good at highsec missioning as the caldari, and you won't have nearly the same problems with everyone living in caldspace that you do at present. also, in a similar vein, can we get a batch of caldari lowsec agents like the other factions get? put l4q20 agents in systems like ienakkamon and saranen, and see if you can't move some of those caldari missioners to lowsec. won't be many who go, of course, but there should at least be the option, like the other factions get."
5/29/2009,ccp asks the community's opinion on other things in advance. why not with this idiocy?
5/29/2009,more agents for the depopulated races will not suddenly cause a massive change in mission runner distribution.more agents for caldari will reduce the load on the busiest mission systems. this is a good change although they could have added the same numbers all around.

5/29/2009,"sounds sensible to me, means limiting exploitation by those fighting against your militia without exposing themselves to counter-attacks by your militia."
5/29/2009,ironic perhaps - but we've always felt that lowering the entry barrier for wars in this theatre is a good thing. the proposal makes sense to me. happy to support it.
5/29/2009,well done on getting elected larkonis - how do you feel about making this one of your first issues to formally promote at the csm level ?
5/29/2009,"it would be very helpful if the skill that affects the fitting requirements of a module (not only the skill needed to install and operate it in the first place) was listed in the module description. most of the time, you simply have to find out somehow, because it is often a riddle, wrapped in an enigma.guns would list ""weapons upgrades"" and ""advanced weapons upgrades"", but it would be most helpful for the less obvious modules and skills like electronics upgrades and their likes. they often just list some ""eg's"", which usually leave out half of the affected systems.eft already does it. why can't eve itself do it ingame?"
5/29/2009,"as long as they figure out a clean way to display the data, yes. probably stick it as a list below the requisites list.edit: i read this proposal as being what cardinality said. please, list all affecting skills."

5/29/2009,"i would think that pos assaults would look a very different in w-space compared to known space, because of the large fleet logistic difficulties described in this thread. instead of a direct assault on the pos, what about a ""seige"" of the system to starve out the pos and it's defenders. don't attack the tower - scan down and camp the wormholes and scan down and attack the defenders any time they leave the pos. don't allow them to bring in more fuel. when the pos runs dry and the shields drop, or when you pod the last defender out of the system - you win."
5/29/2009,this
5/29/2009,what!? are you saying the players have to think about things and suffer the consequences if they do not? what an outrage!
5/29/2009,"hi there. i must say that with the changes presented in apoc 1.2 ccp dropped the ball.while i agree that making war targets blinky on overview was pretty cool the fact that you made outlaws 'non blinky' was not.another issue is the fact that 'player has positive standing' is now below 'player is outlaw' on the default overview, leading to some hilarious mistakes immeadiately post patch (fortunately none involving my corporation).so:reset the 'blinkyness' of outlaws.place player has positive standing above 'player is outlaw' on the default overview settings."
5/29/2009,supporting my own topic.
5/29/2009,agreed
5/29/2009,agreed.for new players it is far more important for them to know that someone is blue than if they are an outlaw.outlaws are always a threat unless they are blue.thus the logical order would see new players informed immediately whether or not a potential threat is blue- and thus not a threat.
5/29/2009,meh really.you have to click like 4 buttons to fix itso not worth their time arguing with ccp on why they were tards when they made the change. but its here now and easily fixablenot supported
5/29/2009,"i agree, take it back to as it was!"
5/29/2009,"although it is easy to fix the overview, you need to know that it needs fixing in the first place which is why it needs to be changed back for all the people that don't read the forums."
5/29/2009,supported.
5/29/2009,"we've all been victims of bad directions when double clicking. not *quite* heading off just where we wanted. or, even worse, trying to coordinate cloaked ship operations.what i'd like to propose is a right click in space (or even a series of text boxes under the center panel) where you could input a couple angles and a speed. angles are based on local ship space and speed in meters/second. they update as you wander around, but, you can type in there and hit the little 'navigate' button that should be right there.0,0,100 is 100 meters per second directly at the sun.180,0,100 is 100 meters per second directly away from the sun.90,0,100 is 100 meters per second at a tangent to the sun if one were to circumscribe a circle around the sun passing through the ship aligned as closely to the system ecliptic as possible. (or, as aligned to the same plane as the tactical overlay ends up being at) where the sun would be off to the left of your ship.180,0,100 is 100 meters per second at a tangent as above, except the sun would be off to the right of your ship.or, if not based off the sun's position. at least off the cardinal points provided by the tactical overlay. just so that we can get more precise movement in space. (imagine the pretty lines you could make with ships turning in formation!)fc's could call out directions and have the squad all hare off in the same direction (or, even better...punch in a direction and get the 'squad/wing/fleet' to align with him) freeing them up from having to navigate and instead concentrate on managing their targets, remote rep, cap, and everything else involved in a small gang fight. (and for the devs, imagine the fewer calls out from the 20-30 clients asking to get their directions changed, when you can get one poke from one client to align and move a bunch at once)120 mark 30 at 1/4 impulse mr. sulu."

5/29/2009,"it looks like a good group, and i wish them all the best of luck in their term."
5/29/2009,i congrat the csm council.however i think it should not be allowed to have more than one member from thesame alliance
5/29/2009,i take it you're personally removing pos warfare from the game then.
5/29/2009,"...by making empire space even more unbearable than 0.0, i assume?"
5/29/2009,"i am wondering how everyone could ever live in 0.0 when clearly the large alliance will always control that space just as they do today. since a lot of the new csm are members of large alliances maybe making everyone be in a large alliance is the plan. by the way, i can get anyone that wants to join goonswarm in for just 500 million isks, contact me for details... sadly i am worried this election will mean not getting low sec fixed or addressing some basic issues like volume of ore in high sec.i hope i am wrong but not a lot of carebear candidates made the slate.issler"
5/29/2009,"what?the csm is four 0.0 players, four empire highsec players, and an empire lowsec player. that's a good group right there."
5/29/2009,"congratulations new councillors!i wish csm 3.0 all the best in good wisdom and so on.i'm happy to see meissa, sophie, vuk and omber made it to csm 3 to continue what we builded and ofcourse congratz to the new chairman who also was csm in csm 1.0i hope to see you all on fanfest!o7 extreme (1st alternate csm 2.0)"
5/29/2009,yes congrats to those who got elected. i hope you will take to heart the many great idea's of the community and keep us informed with upcoming changes and information when it becomes available.
5/29/2009,the girl platform worked.
5/29/2009,"thanks extreme,been a pleasure during csm 2. maybe at csm 4...next time think about putting up sexy pics, you may become chair[wo]man!however if you're going down that route, i'll put nekid pics of my ex-gf... the more votes i get, the more i'll put... now that sounds like a plan :p"
5/29/2009,congrats new csm'rs now get to work telling ccp about all thr problems. if you don't get them fixed i will not vote for you next time
5/29/2009,"chair sounds like a ton of work... are there any perks for getting third place? or for that matter, is there any difference between 2nd through 8th?"
5/29/2009,"yup, 2nd place is receiving much more isk and items from eve shop as reward then 8th place."
5/29/2009,"congradulations and to ccp: i suggest you have fresh ripe pineapples waiting in tribute, you do not want to anger our one and true lord"
5/29/2009,pineappletinis at fanfest?
5/29/2009,"try again when my ceo isn't running, you might get my vote then, and maybe some others too.thanks for trying anyway."
5/29/2009,"sorry to see that you didn't make it in, despite our occasional clashes during the campaigning you were definitely someone who deserved being on the council."
5/29/2009,where can i find the lsit of winners and how many votes they got?
5/29/2009,"me, i got all the votes."

5/29/2009,nice to see an actual reply by you and not by your master.
5/29/2009,"congratulations erik, i was quite sure from the start that you guys are not to be underestimated"
5/29/2009,did you or your puppet master write that?
5/29/2009,"awww... too bad, that! :(so, what's the ratio of pvp alliance kids vs. carebears on the council, now?still, i suspect some of the elected members will be similarly present on the council as they were in this forum, so i guess we'll see you up there instead a lot! :)would love to lend a hand with your party, if you'll have me, btw."
5/29/2009,"so looking at the results it seems the winners were biased towards being members of large alliances and largely pvp focused. i don't see the carebear representative i hoped to be elected to be. in the case of the take care party i expect that erik will largely be similar to ahk, who he replaces, i'd suggest reviewing the meeting minutes to figure out what to expect there.at any rate, it gives me the time i really need to get the party idea truly launched, expect more annoucements about that this summer, with plenty of time before the elections begin to get some activties and ideas sorted.again, thanks to everyone that supported me,issler"

5/30/2009,just posting to show my support for this thread. so far i've had limited piloting time in my vengeance. not yet able to give my full educated support for or against the issue at hand because there's a lot of good arguments/discussion going back and forth in this thread. definitely worth a bookmark and looking forward to more views from experienced af pilots out there.regards.
5/30/2009,1
5/30/2009,support because right now theres no point in getting into an enyo if you can fly a ranis which outclasses it in everything except for a nonspeed tank.
5/30/2009,"supported!you enter in a fight: you are not neutral anymore. we need to start doing something about the neutrals who take sides.doing it repeatedly...would that not usually involve that party into the war, if there is a war going on ? just one thought to making war decs more dynamic and uncontrollable (both for the aggressor as for the aggressed).and is there not also an improvement potential with ""neutral"" trafficker alliance war support out of high-sec ? that one is more tricky so solve, though. i will suggest something in another thread later."
5/30/2009,"while the boss has rendered me many a wreck over the years, in this i have to agree... having seen a singe abaddon sitting on a station under the fire of no less than 7 bs and assorted support being repped by not one but six neutral reppers/logis, and watching each of those dock & immediately undock as soon as they were jammed or engaged, it gets insanely frustrating.not only are they 100% immune to retribution for supporting our war target, they can break ecm, escape drones, are invulnerable to damage, and all the while continue to foul the entire field pointlessly.[option]if a neutral provides support for a hostile, that individual gets flagged as a war target for the duration of the target's war.i'm all for war declarations flagging individuals, so that jumping corp does not shed said flag, this would just be an extension of that."
5/30/2009,supported.
5/30/2009,"supported, long overdue"
5/30/2009,supported
5/30/2009,"this one party goes hand in hand with this topic, but i digress. drone users are at a serious disadvantage when fighting under sentries. although i have on occassion launched wave after wave of light t1 drones as chaff to buy me precious seconds to escape before my armour melts it is quite an irritation when fighting in a larger gang after about 60 seconds half your drones are gone, removing significant capability from your gang, more often than not one volley'd by the guns, so any attempt at management are fruitless.again... you may hurf blurf and say... well you shouldn't be outlaw. but this would make more incentive for those dastardly pirates to stand and fight on a gate so you can crush their bones and plunder their booty and get saucy with their wenches.i understand this may have further complications with reference to hisec suicide ganking/concord etc. would it be all that hard to just remove the kill switch for drones from all gate guns but not concord?sentry guns no longer agro the drones of players who have a gcc/are aggro'd to that faction's navy."
5/30/2009,"as always, supporting my own topic."
5/30/2009,"a big disadvantage to all pilots, yet gallente ships ones especialy."
5/30/2009,"meh im not too sure about this one, i like the idea that a pirate gatecamp is at a disadvantage when it comes to stuff like that, all i know is that when im solo engaging outlaws there drons being killed has saved me a few times, pirates generally camp or roam near systems they live in from my experience and the fact youre fighting them on their turf should make the advantage swing back too them, although im sure there would be a good alternative to clumsy gate gun agro mechanics you havnt given me one i can support yet, so fire away,"
5/30/2009,not supported.exploits mechanics in favor of outlaws.if drones no longer got aggro... then they could continue to do things for as long as the owner's tanks holds out.you expect to be an outlaw then you should expect your job to come at a price.gate camp somewhere else where there are no gate guns or fewer gate guns at that rate.
5/30/2009,there are exactly two things sentry guns do to any camp involving several pirate ships:1. it prevents them from using frigate sized ships2. it prevents them from using dronesi dont think it is that good of an idea to remove one of the few uses sentry guns still have.
5/30/2009,this won't be very popular. and would make sentry aggro mostly pointless for anyone with a clue. stealth domi/ishtar boost?and rather than encouraging blobbing/camping gates how about looking at other means to encourage combat away from stations/gates etc?not overly supported without further justification.
5/30/2009,"i've never really liked how eve's aggro rules work - more things should shoot drones, and drone stats(or spare drone bay capacity) should be built on the premise that they're going to get shot now and then. sleepers are a step in the right direction in this regard, as far as i'm concerned. the upshot of this is that i think you're going the wrong way to find a solution. don't make sentries not shoot drones, make them stop being stupid cheating npcs. get rid of their infinite tracking, to give drones some actual survivability, and give them some sensible aggro rules as opposed to just random, and the drones might well be a reasonable option."
5/30/2009,supported because carebears get to keep their drones in missions so why cant outlaws keep theirs when their gate camping? change the agro or nerf drones in missions.
5/30/2009,not supported.get away from the sentries if you want to use drones.
5/30/2009,"domis are cheap, boost their lowsec usabilityone difficulty is that drones still need to be aggroed in highsec"
5/30/2009,missions don't involve gate camping.... comparing an orange to an apple - epic fail
5/30/2009,"funny statement, targets are to be found at sentries 90% of the time."
5/30/2009,sorry this would make rr domis way too op
5/30/2009,"qftno this would make things very unbalanced, and i happen to be a geddon pilot who uses drones allot even i see why this is a big no noxz"
5/30/2009,"as a non-alliance pilot i would like to say, hell ****ing no. the eve-server seems to be becoming super-capitals online.there are too many of these ships already, there are completely unbalanced in their favor--unless of course you have fleets of hundreds of ships or dozens and dozens of capitals.no ****ing thanks."
5/30/2009,"an anti cap role would just make titans the new dreds, the area of effect poroposal is sound, it would be a big decision to deploy titans after a change like this, as it should be, the problem really is multiple dds, and this also covers that issue"
5/30/2009,supported.
5/30/2009,"i support the lack of gun aggro , thumbs up to that, but i'm not sure if the rring ship shouldn't become outlaw flagged for repping an outlaw for a certain time period.now while i agree it's unfair to the blinky pie that the logistics gets gun aggro i'm not sure if it's fair to everyone else that the logistics does not become outlaw flagged for repping an outlaw, if that makes sense."
5/30/2009,supported
5/30/2009,"good lord yes, supporting the heck out of this!!!there's nothing so frustrating as having my own corpmate come under fire at a gate (he's -10) and be completely unable to lend assistance with my logi (i'm -10, too, but he's in my corp!).now, if i'm in corp b, he's in another corp/alliance entirely and -10, and i choose to rep him... well, i deserve the sec hit, but not the gcc if he is not the initiating combatant!!!granted, i should not be allowed to jump/dock for the requisite time period after repping him... if he's in my corp or not."
5/30/2009,i like that.
5/30/2009,yep.
5/30/2009,makes sense since helping someone kill someone with a gcc shouldnt be illegal.
5/30/2009,"supported.no sense in receiving a gcc for repping an outlaw who is currently not doing anything. you can rep neutrals in highsec with no complications practically, why this one?"
5/30/2009,supported.
5/30/2009,"excellent suggestion, i love it!"
5/30/2009,"yes, yes, yes! thank you for summarizing the mining suggestions and bringing up a fantastic new system. especially the ""easy to tweak after implementation"" is important for any revolutionary approach.two additional thoughts:* i want to tie the security rating of a system to the ""marshal"" idea and make the value implied by the effectiveness of marshal work in the jurisdiction (constellation) where the system is in.* i would toss in another sensation to mining: sound ! a mining scanner would be needed to detect the desired ore, and you need to screen the rock, moving the scanner probe around, listening to the loudest beep or quickest beep-beep-beep where to start to drill. now try and program a macro for that."
5/30/2009,"the idea of using sound is really cool.but the needs of the hearing impaired (or even people whose computers are in living rooms and family rooms amongst other family activities), would have to be considered."
5/30/2009,thank you for your support of this idea - i assume this means the issue will be raised at the first meeting of the 3rd csm ?i am eagerly awaiting the conclusion of your encounters with ccp.
5/30/2009,"thank you, ankhe and the take care party. response to...new dev blog: new level 4 agents"
5/30/2009,"people make mistakes. and those mistakes shouldn't cost them valuable training time over the course of a year.like plex's, this item will be purchasable from the eve store, and grant its buyer a card granting some kind of experimental neural remap treatment.hey, neural remapping was just recently invented, it would make sense for some technological advancement to be in experimentation. i personally didn't have any regrets upon my neural remap, but i have heard many a stories of people screwing up their remaps. if that were to happen to me, i'd be very frustrated. situations like these will never be avoidable, but they should be treatable.you can throw in the argument of people starting out characters before we had remaps and that this wasn't an issue. however bear in mind that by the time newbies realized they had made a mistake, it was alright for them to recreate a character with very low sp losses. however when your high sp char gets its remapping messed up due to a lack of concentration in the right moment, you can't just go ahead and recreate, and frustration ensues.these neural remaps shouldn't be easily obtained, as they could be abused for faster skill training. but hey if it pays for ccp that's fine. maybe makes those remaps usable only once every few months."
5/30/2009,this is dangerous grounds....your going to snuff out people who don't have the money to re-do and give favor to those who couldn't care less about costs and give them an unfiar advantage.not supported.
5/30/2009,"this is more than a little bit crazy. i'm fine with isk buying, but you shouldn't be able to buy your way around a hard cap. not supported."
5/30/2009,not supported
5/30/2009,"no.there has been a solution to the ""oh noes i have the wrong attributes"" problem for years: delete your char and create a new one. please do not let eve become an ""item shop"" game."
5/30/2009,not supported.you just know something is a bad idea when a marketeer loves it.
5/30/2009,i would like to also add that being able to change the axis of our orbits manually would be nice
5/30/2009,"i'd rather have something like a key combo which increases/decreases orbit distance by a specified amount.but still, op's suggestion would be a decent compromise."
5/30/2009,"let me quote about grid-fu being an exploit :it was only prohibited around pos towers, which means that in every other situation, it is still being used.as for trust, this is exactly why it should be in the hands of regular players. you may not trust 3rd party programs built ""out of house"" but what is to say that we should trust 3rd party programs made by some 0.0 paranoid alliance about spies; alliances like these have time and time again proven they will stop at nothing from a metagaming pov to reach their objectives ... or must i remind you of why this forum now has a feature for disabling the viewing of pics and signatures ?"

5/30/2009,"client-side mods should be limited to the visual expression of the client to the user, with plug-ins focusing only on display data.no data that gives information that the game does not require... such as that new face in local or automated scan modes alerting of probes within x range, ect.so, the color blind can have a plugin that suits them, and the deaf, ect. data-mining applets and macro behaviors would, as ever, be a eula violation.likewise ccp should implement client side thread monitoring specifically to watch for macro behavior."
5/30/2009,"supported, with the reservation that it should not be a top priority. as i see it, the ui as it is currently works, but upgrades would be handy. if community made mods can be integrated without too much work on the part of ccp, then i am in favor. if a project such as this one was to push future gameplay additions, such as ambulation of planetary landing, back too much, i would not be in favor."

5/30/2009,"fw needs boost. i am baffled to what lengths we are willing to go in the struggle to ""fix"" fw. now we are suggesting ccp the right server layout ? oh my god. you know, if ccp were attributing the right level of attention to fw then they would well be able to fix hardware issues related to fw.what i want the other csm, and eventually ccp, to understand is the end-game potential which fw has. once the vision is big enough and shared, resources will flow to it.thumbs up to every fw issue on the board!"
5/30/2009,thumbs up.i dunno if this has been worked on (i think i've seen less desyncs) or if it's just a general low-sec issue but w/e it still gets unacceptably laggy when anything resembling a fight happens.
5/30/2009,"i remember tryin fw once. was with a small fleet looking for trouble, when trouble found us. fight started to go badly, so i warped to a station. long story short, i died about a minute later with my ship not having registered any of the commands i had given it during that time. good times. never played fw after that.i thought the general lag fix and ccps promise to investigate the later issues, would have produced something more concrete at this point. can't blame people who find fw lacking at the moment even though i'm out of it. hope it gets fixed and developed before it goes belly up. thumbs up."
5/30/2009,"for many new players fw is their first taste of pvp; does ccp think people are going to want to move on from it to the 0.0 ""endgame"", as ccp intends, when their experience of pvp is a horrendous lag fest even with 30 man a side fleets?"
5/30/2009,you are so full of yourself it's not funny anymore.the issue was knocked back as it had already been raised and ccp acknowledged they were tying to fix the situation already. raising it again would have been a complete waste of time.

5/30/2009,"yeah... logical...ctrl-q quits the game, closes the client, no 'are you sure'.ctrl-l (or whatever) quits the current character session and returns you to the character selection screen.they may not have implemented this due to caching the character data and having to dump it to bring up the selection again, but then... i don't have a clue."
5/30/2009,"putting aside the tickling association of the ""one shield password"" mechanics with the pseudo-physical foundation in star trek's shield harmonics, i like the standing attribute as an optional second choice for access.let us discuss this issue together with the corp and alliance tool overhaul which suggests a refactoring of the access rights and privileges. that would also take into account raukho's and zostera's worries as to hangar access."

5/30/2009,"you are quite wrong on this. you are prolly too politically correct to write or even realize this, but the (sad?) truth is that most people run for caldari rather than other factions because most people are lazy, unimaginative, plain stupid, or any combination of these most basic human virtues.you can already make much more isk from amarr and minmatar agents than you can make off caldari ones, yet everyone and their dog sticks to caldari for mission running. heck, many cattle don't even realize that there are other corps than caldari navy that you can run missions for.adding more agents for the other faction will not change that at all. there are more than enough rarely used agents out there already. especially amarr has some very good agent running locations as well, but they are not nearly as heavily congested as the caldari ones.and to cherry-pick missions you don't really need a multi-agent system (though that makes it easier), you just need some 7.5 faction standing.i will agree though that definitely gallente and maybe also minmatar could use a little help when it comes to good highsec agents. seems every fool running gallente missions goes to dodixie, so those numpties need an obvious alternative. but far more of these people in caldari space, so adding more caldari agents than other faction ones is definitely the correct approach.you cannot educate people that do not want to be educated. but you can ease the load these people place on each other and the rest of the universe. which is exactly what ccp is doing by adding tons of caldari agents.not that i would mind a few more agents for other factions in general. decent l4 khanid in highsec for example would be very welcome."
5/30/2009,"i can certainly agree. if there are too many people in caldari space, emphasize agents in other space (gallente, amarr, etc) to encourage people to spread out."
5/30/2009,"edited for grammar :-}the basis for pve must be right. empires should be kind of leveled.then again, i am wondering if it is the neutral undisputable static db which makes pilots (and i mean the big massive majority of mission runners, who leandro disrespectfully calls ""cattle"") move or stay in a certain area, let alone choose their race to begin with. or would you not deem possible there are other, more subtle yet more powerful forces at work: like ""my friends suggested that i do missions here"".while i agree with ankhe's suggestion, should we not also think about a more dynamic approach to agents?- why do agents have to stay in one station? don't they have a private life?!- why do agents have a fixed quality? don't they participate in personnel progress programmes of their companies?!- why do agents have a fixed quality when it comes to your standing? don't you have favoured suppliers in your company?!and one final thought: you want to spread out pilots? how about more mission rewards of the kind: ""you did a great job. here is the corporate card of a colleague of mine, who is in need of a talented pilot just like you!"" using personal standing towards that agent now in order to making him available to the pilot in question."
5/30/2009,"(cross post from dev blog : as per op request) i'm sure others can validate the stats below, however here are a few stats for people to look at, with a break down of all agents by faction, for basic agents (r&d, event, story line, fw, tutorial, etc excluded).factionname agentcount------------------------------ -----------caldari state 133minmatar republic 114gallente federation 113amarr empire 89ammatar mandate 48over all this shows that amarr is in some serious need of love over all agent levels, although you could argue that ammatar mandate is a sub set of ammar, but thats a moot point.now, lets look at the number of level 4 agents, by faction regardless of divisionfactionname agentcount------------------------------ -----------caldari state 25minmatar republic 19ammatar mandate 17amarr empire 15gallente federation 15this isnt too bad ammar actually has the best ratio of level 4's to the other main factions, with amattar mandate best over all, with a staggering 35% of agents being level 4, caldari has 18% of its agents at level 4, and gallante is the worst with 13%.now filtering for the following divisionsdivisionname--------------------commandintelligenceinternal securitysecuritysurveillancewe get the following statsfactionname agentcount------------------------------ -----------caldari state 18minmatar republic 16ammatar mandate 14amarr empire 12gallente federation 11the same trend continues, with ammatar having the best ratio and gallante having the worst.however with the new agent counts this moves a little and and increases the overall number of caldari level 4's to over 30. what im trying to show is that if ccp want people to move around eve and populate more of eves systems and factions, then its about time they stopped focusing on caldari and make other factions as attractive to the pve community."
5/30/2009,"bug thumbs up for this ccp facepalm... they really stepped in it deep this time.caldari l4 agents need to be moved more homogenously in their systems, and the other factions need to have an equity of agents similarly spread throughout their space.while i may not be a fan of pushing l4 into lowsec, they should all have at least the potential of lowsec missions.likewise, warring factions should have their corps moved to allied territory (minmatar corps in amarr space should be relocated to gallente or minmatar space, likewise with amarr corps in minmatar space). many of these are, inexplicably, science corps (core complexion, creodron, et al)."
5/30/2009,"the thing is, if people do their homework, at least minmatar and amarr agents already are more attractive. quite a bit more in fact. but people are ignorant about that because as i said above, people in general are lazy and other not very favorable things. and of course after they are told by their buddies with the same mindset that caldari is good, they never bother to do their own research, run caldari missions too and tell their own buddies about it, and so it spreads. and the people smart enough to run missions where the grass is greener are also smart enough to not try to encourage everyone to do the same, so the cattle herd doesn't get a whiff of that green grass and tramples it.and that actually serves both sides, the cattle don't know what they are missing, and the more professional mission runners can continue to get richer undisturbed.so serving caldari a lot more agents while adding a few to the other factions seems to be prudent.the only thing i can think of to really move the lazy mission runner blob somewhere else would be to move jita and the caldari starter systems there :palso if you count ammatar as amarr (which you damn well should imho) you need to do the same for khanid."

5/30/2009,"i agree, with the point you made, and i did forget about the khanid, soe and interbus so for completeness here we are :total agents for khanid = 44total agents for soe = 68total agents for interbus = 38khanid lvl 4 agents = 14soe lvl 4 agents = 7interbus lvl 4 agents = 5with combat division filters as per original postkhanid lvl 4 agents = 14soe lvl 4 agents = 0interbus lvl 4 agents = 2statistically, caldari level 4's are jumping from 25 to 41 level 4 agents, thats a 64% increase, and makes them double the next nearest single faction, minmatar 23, with an increase of 21%, gallante are getting a 20% increase to 18 agents, and ammar get nothing. i personally dont think there is a need for more level 4 agents, but there is a need for a more even distribution of the existing lvl 4 agents around the universe, say no more than 1 level 4 agent within 2 jumps of another agent of simular level, which would also break up a lot of the mission hubs.i also believe that these new agents could have been more evenly distrubuted around the factions, say 3 each for the main factions and the other 11 split between the minor factions, such as soe and interbus, khanid, and the pirate factions.edit : minmatar agent increases corrected."

5/30/2009,"the status quoif you run missions nowadays, you do get isk, lp and standing gains automatically adjusted up/down according to mission completion times, and additionally adjusted by agent quality, skills, standings and system security rating... but the bounty/loot/salvage rewards are pretty much fixed depending on actual mission you run (barring some minor randomness).the real issuethe real isue is that no matter what you do, a significant portion of the income from missions is non-adjustable.we could argue all day long about how this is a good thing or a bad thing or how some missions should be moved from certain security ratings to others or restricted in time or many other possible ""solutions"" - but all of those do require some serious ccp effort each and every time any change is supposed to be made, precisely because missions lack a ""fine-tuning"" method.a cautionary note - read carefullythis is not an ""exact amounts"" nerf/buff proposal for mission-running.it is simply a proposal for the introduction of a system which would enable fine-tuning rewards according to whatever criteria the ccp developers would desire later.sure, the new system could be used afterwards to balance the rewards any way ccp sees fit, anything from fixed-rate adjustments (using the exact same coefficients the lp rewards are adjusted with), or maybe some higher security-rating based adjustments factors, up to a fully self-balancing automated system that would balance the rewards of each individual agent or groups of agents across the eve universe.the thing is, that is something that can be decided upon later, and quickly modified if (or when) needed with minimal additional effort on ccp's part.how exactly the system will be used immediately after implementation if not the issue of this proposal.this proposal only seeks to address the lack of a fine-tuning instrument for ccp's developers.the actual proposal - it's much simpler than you'd thinklike already mentioned, right now, all isk rewards from bounties are fixed, and while loot drops and salvage obtained is random, there are some ""loot tables"" which describe the average loot dropped and salvage obtainable from any particular npc kill.all i am proposing to do would be to add a new, intermediate table, which would contain a modifier variable (the ""useful number"" on it can take values ranging from, say, 0.01 to 100, just setting some arbitrary boundaries here, not fixed in stone, could be 0.1 and 10 or even 0 and infinity, doesn't really matter) for every individual agent.that modifier variable would simply adjust (lower or rise, depending on whether the modifier is below or above 1) all the isk bounties for npc rats in missions spawned from that agent, as well as adjusting either the chance, the quantity, or both chance and quantity of loot and salvage drops corresponding to the wrecks generated by the npc rats from missions spawned by that agent.the disadvantageobviously, there is a computing cost associated, since every time a npc is destroyed or wreck is salvaged, an additional database call is made on top of existing ones.however, in the grand scheme of things, these calls should account for a tiny percentage of the total computing power used, and it is my firm belief the small amount of extra processing needed is more than outweighed by the potential benefits of this system.the advantagesthis way, if ccp decides ""ok, agent x should give rewards 3 times higher than average"" (or, say, 2 times lower than average), all they have to do is modify a single variable corresponding to that agent (to 3.00, or in the second case, to 0.50), and all possible revenue sources from that particular agent will be automatically adjusted accordingly.how exactly will the amounts of the modifiers be determined is not a primary issue right now, but if you have ideas about that too, feel free to voice them."
5/30/2009,"this was the original, detailed, unpolished version of the idea (click me)it's a bit more complicated and a work in progress as you see it there, this here is just the distilled and simplified version, just the ""barebones"" of that much more complex proposal - the start of it, if you will.let me give you one simpler example...suppose the following would be the way the modifier table would be populated:if (agent location security rating > 0.5) then modifier for that agent = 0.7if (agent location security rating <= 0.5) then modifier for that agent = 1.5if (agent location security rating <= 0.0) then modifier for that agent = 3.0in this particular rudimentary example, all income for highsec agents would be decreased by 30%, income from lowsec agents would be increased 50%, while income from 0.0 agents would be tripled.so, a lowsec mission runner will not only receive the higher isk/lp he gets now at the mission completion, but npc ratsinside the mission would also have 50% higher bounties and drop 50% more loot on average.now, i am not saying this is the way the modifier list should be populated, i was just giving a very simple example that is easy to understand.of course, as a start, you could just as well initialize it as above, but with 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2 values (unchanged for highsec, 10% extra in lowsec, 20% extra in 0.0) just to see how the system works, offering negligible initial boosts but still noticeable.like i said, ""how exactly will the amounts of the modifiers be determined is not an issue right now."" - how ccp chooses to adjust the modifiers later on, that's a completely different issue.and also, i said that ccp can ""balance the rewards any way they see fit, anything from fixed-rate adjustments (using the exact same coefficients the lp rewards are adjusted with), or maybe some higher security-rating based adjustments factors, up to a fully self-balancing automated system that would balance the rewards of each individual agent or groups of agents across the eve universe"".__the reason to do it on a ""per agent"" basis is because you can enter as many rules as you want.you could have implemented it on a regional basis, or a secrating basis, or any other rule, but having the table itself on the agent level makes the most programming sense.i mean, why bother with implementing a coarse grain system then go back on it to recode it if/when a finer grain is needed, if you simply can implement the system for the finest possible grain but set the initial table values on a level as coarse as you desire it, then refine it later with minimal extra coding ?---=== tl;dr : summary + example ===---make mission npc rat bounties variable (increasing as secrating goes down).do the same for their loot drops and wreck salvage.this means ""boost lowsec mission income"".if you disagree with anything in particular about the proposal, just remember, this thread is not really about the amounts of boosting and/or nerfing needed in any particular area of the game.it's about the possibility to make those adjustments in the first place, by coding the system which would enable these adjustments to be made at all."
5/30/2009,"i cannot agree with this topic. it would only cause people to swarm to certain agents and leave others alone, which is exactly what ccp doesn't want to happen.i'm in favor of removing quality modifiers completely, or reducing their impact. however, this too wouldn't solve the problem.mission agents are a sticky subject. they need an overhaul, but they do work acceptably, so ccp is focusing on the more important topics (scanning, 0.0 sovereignty, and hopefully mining will be looked at soon (tm) )."
5/30/2009,this....mission running is plauged with swarming of hubs due to quality... and honestly quality is a total sham... salvage is salvage is salvage.mission agents should be re-seeded in such a way to prevent swarming of hubs and even out the spread in such a way that people could relocate if systems got too busy.modifiers would only make it worse.
5/30/2009,"if i read you correctly, you're basically suggesting that rat bounties be modifiable by agent. this seems...pointless. people are willing to change agents for fairly small differences in income, i see no reason why you'd need to have this mod apply. also, since your proposal doesn't actually suggest that ccp do anything, you're basically suggesting that they add a variable, which will remain unused, to increase database calls in a way invisible to the player, so that they have the option to do something that they don't need to do in future. i have no idea what problem you're trying to solve here, but i feel quite confident that this won't do the trick. not supported."

5/30/2009,"as matters currently stand mission running is the only limitless source of income in eve that is open to all players from the moment they subscribe.missions are not a limited resource and thus there are serious implications for the eve economy and particularly detrimental effect on other professions in eve; chiefly mining, trading and industry.the unlimited nature and ungated income that missionrunning as a profession creates (aside from manhours) and the net effect this has on eve create sources of isk that lack appropriate sinks.as a direct result of the way mission agent quality scales (and the spread of mission agents concentrating them in certain areas and amongst certain factions) to mission rewards certain systems in eve have become 'missionrunner hubs'- or to put it another way, hundreds of people crammed into a single system generating crippling amounts of lag and latency issues while de-populating vast other areas of the game.i propose:-a lowering of base mission rewards (isk and lp) across each available level of mission.-a dynamic, incremental rewards system where faster mission completion time gives increased mission rewards; lp and isk and better standings gains.-removal of all t1 meta 0 loot from missions.-storyline missions give significantly increased rewards; increased isk, loyalty points and a percentile chance of being rewarded with a faction goodies (ammo and/or modules).this would maintain missionrunning as a viable and lucrative profession, but reward those whom make an effort to excel at it or have invested significant sp or isk into pimped missionrunning boats.it would penalize the afk missionrunners and macroers that like to play eve offline.it would benefit traders and miners directly.it will encourage people to gang up to complete missions as fast as possible, to the point where the gain in profitability was ruled out by a smaller slice of the cake- more player interaction is good.further:-there are a limited number of missions each agent can give out each 24 hours.-as a mission agent reaches the end of his quota, the missions he offers have reduced isk and lp rewards by a sliding percentile scale- supply and demand, its a hirers market out there and mission agents no longer have trouble fulfilling high priority assignments for their corporation.-there is a flat, artificial cap on the number of missions that are allowed to be active in each system, for each level of mission available. the above is intended to directly force the breakup of mission runner hubs and even out the population over new eden.it will encourage competition for resources between players and indeed corporations, in a resource that previously was without end- more player interaction is good.the exact nature (the numbers, threshold and cuttoff points) are not worth discussing here, but on principle i offer this idea as a soloution."
5/30/2009,reserved
5/30/2009,"while i do not agree with everything you say, i support the discussion on this subject and agree that agents should have variable quality which goes down when more players use the same agent. a hard limit on missions per system goes a bit too far, but reducing rewards based on supply and demand is certainly worth looking into.csm1 raised this issue long ago, with ccp saying that in the short run they plan to add more agents (okay we've just seen how ""short term"" that is, and how that worked out - not) and in the long run they do want something along these lines.lowering the amount of reprocessable minerals from missions is also something i would support as it devaluates the low-sec minerals and negatively affects the miner profession.ideally i would like to see the casual player (the type that only runs one or two missions per day and doesn't play every day) largely unaffected, as the people earning <10m per hour through missions aren't the ones that are causing the problems.edit: didn't think i'd support one of your topics, but i suppose this gets my thumbs-up on the principle of the discussion, not necessarily all your solutions."
5/30/2009,"mission running is the one thing anyone can do in eve. hell, its an integral part of a new players initial game experience and the most easily accessible 'handle' from other mmo's for someone to get aquainted with the game and have a frame of reference.making missions a painful experience for new players, or the casual missioner would be a mistake.having many more mission agents evenly spread around eve would be the ideal situation in my mind. someone should be able to find a mission if they look hard enough: granted it may not be the level 4, or agent they were hoping for, or of lower quality than is ideal. the agent may be in lowsec or 0.0 or a part of highsec they have never been to- but there should always be options open for people, even if said options convince a player to broaden their horizons and do something other than missionrunning for the time being!i am in great favor of a hard (or perhaps dynamic) cap on missions offered, per mission level per system- it is the only real way to effect the breakup of missionrunner hubs. other more conservative solutions would only lead to re-establishment of hubs in other areas and resumption of the same problems a month after changes."
5/30/2009,"the thing is however, that people often run missions because they can log into the game, and immediately talk to their agent, and get a mission. this opposed to exploration, of which a lot of time is first spent looking for a signature.for casual players that only have one hour available, there should be something they can immediately do upon logging into the game. perhaps have the agent have one reserved mission per player per day is a solution, but that sounds way too much like wow's daily quests... that or something tied into standing in some way, which would also prevent people repeatedly rejecting missions even taking the standing hits (because faction standing always entitles them to more missions even with low corp/agent standing) to get a more profitable mission."
5/30/2009,yes
5/30/2009,"....wow or not that does make sense. having one guaranteed mission of each mission level a day is logical from a rp point of view.i can imagine the system functioning much as the storyline or interlinking mission evemails from agents.edit: that is to say it would probably necessitate some form of travel, limiting that to 2-4 jumps to ensure people rent clustered together shouldn't be hard. each downtime missions could be assigned and viewed through the missions or expeditions tab- saving thousands of evemails, with mission location determined on player position at downtime."
5/30/2009,"oh and one more thing i'd like to discuss here, is how to introduce scalable income sources (those that increase according to the amount of players) in low-sec and 0.0, which are preferable to running highsec missions.i've always wanted to see alliances making use of and developing their space, allowing the more carebear type of players to live there under some degree of alliance protection, for mutual benefit. i had that ""crazy 0.0"" idea a long time ago with player ""citizens"" being able to construct small anchorables, which would provide trade goods. alliance outposts consume these trade goods. if alliance outpost gets enough trade goods, it attracts agents or whatever, for which the players can run missions. alliance gets a cut of the mission-runner income as protection money of which the pvpers can get paid. something along those lines. pvpers can then raid opposing alliance space and attempt to destroy the small anchorable structures or kill mission runners.still thinking on how to make low-sec more attractive though, i'm sure you have brighter ideas than i."
5/30/2009,"i'd rather see a separation of agent quality, system security rating, and reward amount. agent quality should only effect the standings required to access that agent.rewards would be based upon how many missions that agent has given out recently. agents that have given a lot of missions (high-sec hubs), would have almost no isk or lp reward (but still bounties). agents that haven't given many missions (low-sec or 0.0), would give large lp/isk rewards.this would spread the population, as after a period of equilibrium, most high-sec agents would have similar rewards, most low-sec would be another tier, and 0.0 would be a 3rd tier of rewards."

5/30/2009,"any refurbishment of missions on the scale suggested in the op will have major issues. thats the point.as far as refined ideas, i don't want to get too in depth with this- i suggested it as a topic i would like addressed by the csm and brought to the forfront as a suggestion for something ccp game dev should focus on.the level of detai one would go into in say the game development or features and discussion forums would be counterproductive here:people would argue endlessly about the specifics.but hey, issue not supported."
5/30/2009,"i agree with most of the op's proposals, buy stopping those that mission *****, without unduly affecting the occasional mission runner, or the guy that needs a quick boost to faction or corp standings or just a quick income boost to get a new ship. i like the idea of dropping income/bounties/lp, based on number of missions run, though i would not have a cap per agent, more a cap per toon per agent, otherwise those in the us tz will be severely disadvantaged as the asia/euro zones will have cherry picked all the missions. as a miner im all in favor of removing meta 0 items from missions, especially the higher level missions, as it will help make low/null sec a little more desirable and lucrative place for the high ends, and also push some of the mid/high end ores up in value and make them worth mining again.personally the way to defeat afk missioners is simply introduce the sleeper ai into the missions, it shouldnt be that difficult as the routines now exist, and they're pretty effective, and challenging."

5/30/2009,"fixing lag isn't really the main consequence of what is intended from the op, but an additional benefit from breaking up the overcrowded mr hubs."
5/30/2009,"what is your primary purpose in doing this, then?"
5/30/2009,its all in the op
5/30/2009,"currently all races get an additional 10% bonus to a specific armour resist on all t1 ships, this corresponds with their greatest enemies preferred damage type so caldari get 10% thermal, gallente 10% kinetic, amarr 10% explosive, minmatar 10% em.this is all well and good but it's of limited use to shield tankers.keep in mind that the number of 'resistance points' on a t1 ship's shields is 110 and on it's armour it's 130 (including the racial bonus), so perhaps slip a default 10% base em resist on their to start with.now i know shield tanking is not armour tanking. shield tanks are by default stronger slot for slot but it makes no sense from a lolrp perspective for ship designers not to buff a ship's shield so it corresponds with the damage of their greatest enemy.add a flat 10% bonus to the shields of all t1 vessels in the following fashion:amarr: explosive resistancecaldari: thermal resistancegallente: kinetic resistanceminmatar: em resistance"
5/30/2009,supporting my own topic yo.
5/30/2009,"well the rp argument doesnt work too well, mainly because why would amarr desighners concentrate so much on shields, if youre idea were to go through it would make more sense to have it put on the ships tank, but anyway the pinicle of shield and armor resistances is t2 right?"
5/30/2009,not supported.not every race is a shield tanker by nature.particularly amarr and gallente.minmatar do both when it suits them... but mostly shields... caldari are definatly shield tankers.
5/30/2009,"and why would the caldari designers concentrate so much on armour systems?if you read the op and maybe actually played the game you'd realise all t1 ships have a racial bonus to a specific armour resist but not to shields.and not every race is an armour tanker by nature... please explain to me why caldari ships would have a natural extra resistance applied to armour but not shields.as i pointed out, shields have a combined total of 110 resistance points... armour has 130 resistance points."
5/30/2009,"maybee im just angry at the ninja drake boost this entails, i see what youre saying and yes i think its unfair that caldari and some minmitar loose out on the extra resist, im just not sure if a blanket shield resist is the answer, also i dont see any problems with shield tanks as they are, i think the fact they are generally stronger and also self repairing more than makes up for slightly less resists.and dude insulting youre voter's lol?"
5/30/2009,"well then why not change that? caldari and minmatar lose their 10% armor resist, gain 10% shield resist. provide the sort of balance you're looking for in a more rp-friendly way."
5/30/2009,"you have a good point, however shields have the benefit of passive regeneration and i'd like to know how much that compensates."
5/30/2009,"alternatively, you could drop 10% from the ""self"" damage type and add 10% to the ""enemy"" damage type.an exception should probably be made for amarr ships (you can't drop 10% em, or can you ? i mean, theoretically, you could have -10% em resists, the formulae should still work, but it's just unheard of for the time being).so, you have... from the usual 0%em/50%explo/40%kinetic/20%thermal...caldari : 30% kinetic, 30% thermalgallente : 10% thermal, 50% kineticminmatar : 40% explosive, 10% emamarr : either -10% em and 60% explosive, or 30% kinetic and 60% explosiveto be honest, i'd really prefer the shields to remain exactly the way they are right now instead of doing it like described above."
5/30/2009,did you forget to drink your quafe?seriously.... its not that hard to figure out.armor is non-regenerating without rep's.... shields regenerate with our without reps.it's natural for armor to have a higher resistance due to that.... hell even a kid can figure that out.add to that... each race has a certain style and flavor in materials.and are likely to slap on a particular resistance as a result... doesn't mean they favor the tech... just manufactured that way.
5/30/2009,maybe their should be a 5% bonus to shield strength instead of 10 or maybe give ships that are designed to shield tank a shield shield resistance (not 10% because like previously said shields regenerate) instead of an armor one.
5/30/2009,"any base resist change would probably necessitate nerfing shield recharge slightly.i do not want to see the drake get tankier for 'free', nor shield buffers in general become even more effective than they currently are.not signed"
5/30/2009,"batteries suck. please fix. they don't need to be as good as turrets, i get that they're a compromise. in their current implementation, they're dire."
5/30/2009,"launchers, also, don't get a damage bonus. torp launchers get a measly 3x, cruise get at most 1.15 for faction, whereas a laser battery (for example) may get a multiple of +17 or more!!!that simply makes no sense. a single laser battery throws out the equivalent of an entire ship, where it takes 6 cruise launchers to equal 1 raven.there also needs to be more launcher types (small launchers using ham/heavy, defender launchers, ect).and yes, they should remain online like any other weapon system."
5/30/2009,"very simply proposal here which would make a massive difference to the eve market and create or help support the trading career. please do these things, they in fact would be not only very simple, but hugely useful.add: a lower timescale graph, maybe a 6 or 12 hour graph and hopfully down to an hour graph. this will allow easier spoting of minerals and products on market while evening out trade inneficiencies.2. with the added fine timescales make the graphs scalable.3. add in atleast another few options for the graph. a traditional western line graph and a candle stick graph which is infinitly more useful then the current graph even though they use the same method. also add in maybe a bar graph.4. allow customization of macd lines that are currently in, also add in an oscillator and other graphing tools such as boillinger bands or elliot wave patterns.5. for minerals and other products allower 4 decimal points so that they can be traded more efficiently.but! what does this all mean and what does this do?1. it allows traders to use proper tools to trade on the market - this helps and builds a whole career and associated careers to the trder profession.2. allows more clarity and easier use of market graph instead of the mess we have now.3. allows traders to see much more detailed information so that we can even out price inneficiencies and this will stabalize the markek and make sure products are worth there ""true"" price.but how would ccp be able to do this?i imagine that they could easily convert there current graph system to be able to display these, they are all very simple concepts and ideas with simple mathmatical forumlas behind them (normally not more then 5-6 short lines and some only 1-2 lines).this would help traders and people buying off the market all over eve, would satisfy some of the demand for a carebear expansion or update and help build the trader career! please consider this and if you like the above ideas post/bump/approve this. thanks and sorry for any bad english."
5/30/2009,"i don't think they want to store data in hourly increments - that adds a lot of trash to the servers. more graph types and analysis tools, and scalable graphs, i'm for. four decimal points i'm against - it might make sense for trit/pyer in some ways, but it'd be ugly and stupid in most other contexts. while i agree with the idea of better analysis tools, it seems a low priority because of the existence of the data export, and the ideas i disagree with here are enough to dissuade me from supporting the ones i do kind of like."
5/30/2009,"i know that the csm voting is done and all but i have an idea for the police force in low-sec and a possible working system. i don't have a clear example of this but let's say someone has an alignment of 5.0. they could then attack someone with an alignment of -.5 and below. if their alignment is 4.0 then they can attack someone -2 and below. also in pvp, killing pirates will add alignment points to the characters status if they are engaging a player who they are allowed to attack. this way, a character can choose to go after pirates and raise their security rating at the same time with concord.to add additional depth, much like the characters displayed on the signs in space, concord can have field offcies set up with special agents who will allow players to select from a list of random pirates who frequent certain areas and be paid by concord to hunt them down and destroy their ship for a reward and an additional bonus for podding the player. this will add an an interesting dimension to the game play that takes place in low sec. it will no longer just be a place for pirates, but also for those seeking justice."

5/30/2009,"started by looking into all the candidates and what there stances were. when it came to looking into you the most i could find was your first post stating what you wanted to do and implement. that was about it where as other candidates really went all out trying to attract voters with various web pages and other informative gubbins. just didn't think this time round you were really giving it all your all to get voted in and concluded you may not have been able to give your all if elected. if you round next time round i won't be writing you off sraight away, short version bit more in game experience lot more effort (and possibly the use of shiny things to draw attention?=p) and you may well be a serious runner. good luck cat"
5/30/2009,"you know i would have liked to have seen cat elected and chosen as the secretary so all the minutes began with ""hi csm here."""
5/30/2009,"so i thought maybe i was wrong so i went back and checked again. none of the candidates would claim industry, trade or mining as their focus. lets look at them using data from their own campaign pages:dierdra vaal - pvp (from dierda's website - my 6 page document on guns for hire (bounty hunters and mercenaries) took me quite a while to make.)vuk lau - 0.0 - big alliance (i actually like vuk alot but he is no carebear )mazzilliu - first issue mentioned was pos warfare - seems smart but not a carebearzastrow j - goonfleeterik finnegan - take care party - fw and medals if ank is any indication - hope i am proven wrong. avalloc - goonfleetomber zombie - likely most rounded player in terms of knowledge - not a carebear - but who i would have voted for if i wasn't running (actually i would have split my votes between oz and vuk, both impressed me in iceland)larkonis trassler - pvp - not a carebearmeissa anunthiel - 20+ plus years of software development experience? (right started at age 12??), well at least a software engineer which could be good, but clearly not a carebearso i don't think anyone there would be a representative of the casual players and pve types i had hoped to represent. we also no longer have a csm member that is as focused on the economy as lavista vista was previously. may not matter, but would have been nice to see someone running with that as a major part of their focus.i do think everyone of those folks is bright and has the best intentions for eve, will take the job of csm seriously and will do well for the folks they represent. the question is how many of them will think about the other segments in eve.issler"
5/30/2009,balances out the fact that there was way too many carebears in the 2nd csm for anything to get done.
5/30/2009,i'd love you to point out any evidence you have that carebears in the second csm kept anything from getting done. my point is that a very large segment of the player base ended up with no representation this term. it will take a while to see if that matters at all.issler
5/30/2009,"while i wont be posting them on the forums myself, i'm always open to support properly constructed carebear topics and bring them to the council."

5/31/2009,worst font ever. ever.jjiill1| etc are all the same character.
5/31/2009,supporting this
5/31/2009,definitely this.
5/31/2009,"hawk: 5% missile damageharpy: 5% shield resistanceishkur: 5% drone tracking or 5% drone mwd speed? honestly, i have no idea.enyo: 5% light hybrid damagewolf: 7.5% light projectile trackingjaguar: 7.5% light projectile trackingvengeance: move 5% armor resist to frigate bonus and add 5% rocket damage to afretribution: 5% light laser damagebottom notes:1. it would be more natural to give ships rof bonus instead of 2nd damage bonus, but this could be bad for server considering small guns have already high rof.2. swap falloff and optimal for minmatar ships. jaguar is natural ac boat and wolf is more suited for sniping.3. 2nd damage bonus for enyo and retribution could be overpowered? i'm not sure. considering taranis has 3 guns and dual damage bonus and crusader has already 4 guns. also all hacs have rof and damage bonuses with equal amount of hardpoints. obvious exceptions are eagle with double sniper bonus and ishtar droneboat.4. why is jaguar the only ship with 3 gun hardpoints? except enyo of course, but full flight of light drones makes up to it."
5/31/2009,"not supported unless it refers to only neutral alts.you're in a rr gang, you get completely blobbed so the order is given to deaggro and prepare to jump. so instead of just sitting there trying to keep your friends alive, you hope you all make it out alive? i agree there is a problem with neutral logistics, but this fix will also ****up normal rr gangs."
5/31/2009,"so you sacrifice one to the pvp gods, he tries to keep the rest alive and the rest de-aggro.sux not to have the 'i win' button all the time"
5/31/2009,supporting this and bringing it up at csm meeting #1
5/31/2009,not supported because this effects the way logistics ships in general work in pvp roaming or what not as it is logistics are usable they can still die and you can also scare that guys alt off or jam it ffs then kill him but if you change this logistics ships will become useless they dont have the survivability to be used most of the time without leaving the options open and trust me logistics ships still die i have lost a few.i suggest all of you that voted to support this go try flying a logistics ship in whatever situation you want 5 man hac gang 10 man bs gang whatever and see how long you survive if you allways stay put it wont be long most cases trust me. while logistics alts are an issue there are ways of dealing with them. and people will still play docking games and infact because you wont get them aggroed you will end up now with less chance of killing them.btw just to clarify i have never flown logistics in neutral/npc corp i am allways in the corp that is at war.
5/31/2009,supported. aggression mechanics need a serious look. you undock and engage or assist you should expect to face a fight. less stupid station games the better imo.
5/31/2009,supported.rr alt spoonery is pretty spoon.
5/31/2009,awesome ... thanks csm erik finnegan and csm dierdra vaal for responding and letting us know where you stand on this issue.
5/31/2009,btw you wont get rid of neutral logistics alts doing this they will just sit out of drone/scram/web range (so around 60-70kms off) aligned with a stab on all your going to do is as i said earlier screw up normal logistics pilots and in the end you will make it harder not easier to kill your station hugging prey and their logistics alts. also this would effect remote repping bs gangs rather than being able to try and disengage and tank it out then jump you would just have to accept your going to die and sit there (while jumping may seem cowardly not your fault if idiots dont have a way to tackle you on the other side). also would have to change remote sensor boosting/eccm mechanics at the sam time (might alter some pirates play styles).i also find it ammusing having just realised whos started this thread given privateers love their alts with remote sensor boosting ect last time i checked.you should look more towards finding a way to make it a pain to use neutral alts not to make remote repping give agression and therefore invalidate logistics as a ship class. one potential way is to extend the agression timer for out of war related remote repping to say an hour or perhaps 2 making it a huge time sink for that alt or even for a day for helping a war target you become a target for 24 hours. im sure there are other potential solutions just im sorry but screwing up logistics just so a few station huggers actually stay docked rather than fooling around is not worth it.also just for a second assume as things are you briefly shoot the logistics so they dock up/run you then have a decent time frame 40-50 seconds (if you take into account lag from the jump both ways/docking (loading system/station) + logistics decloaking then relocking most of the time that will not far off what you need to kill that person plus if the logistics decloaks/moves staright away after undocking/jumping you have 30 seconds to kill them before they can bug out again so either your going to get time to kill them or you get another 30 seconds on top of the 40-50 to kill your opponent so is it really that bad? infact if you cant kill them that quickly they can just deaggro then dock/jump themselves.
5/31/2009,supportededit:it is annoying when you have a group of neutrels following the ship ur pvping against at 0m waiting to grab the loot with no repercussions. i was fighting a war in a mission hub and this was terrible with a swarm of neutrels hugged targets waiting just to swip the loot then sit there while you can't do anything.
5/31/2009,supported 100%pvpers need more reward!
5/31/2009,supported.
5/31/2009,"can't support this one, sorry. only reason i launch drones in the presence of sentries is to absorb sentry fire, otherwise they stay in the drone bay. this isn't a new mechanic, anyone who flies a domi/ishtar knows about these restrictions and must adapt/use a different ship."
5/31/2009,"choose your battles wisely m8... this one doesn't really make sense, although it would save me a lot of drones"
5/31/2009,sentries not shooting the drones = sentries shooting the drone user./support
5/31/2009,only if you are lazy .
5/31/2009,supported.yet another arbitrary restriction placed on people but more importantly also one that gimps droneboats.
5/31/2009,supported. i wanna fly myrmidon in gatecamps
5/31/2009,"cool beans, so it's ok for anti pirates to bring rr domi gangs to fight pirates but not for the pirates themselves to use them?i think people have images here of huge permanant camps of domi's and ishtars with multiple sentry drones deployed in a transversal reducing r@pe matrix around the gate. not the case.you can be an elitist about the issue all you want. fact is 95% of combat happens on gates or stations. any time we've sat at a planet for an enemy gang to come into us they just do one, probably convinced it's going to be a hotdrop.having been in many hilarious situations where i have been unable to engage a juicy target either at a gate or station due to my drone heavy loadout, or the several times where i've been in a bs gang frantically rr'ing enemy fighters from a downed carrier while we get some haulers on the job i must say this is something that needs looking at.this won't make any real difference in terms of capability to those dreaded pirate camps. the unwise solo player will still be dead either way."
5/31/2009,either this or make sentries track their targets
5/31/2009,screw it why not
5/31/2009,drone ships need lots of love.
5/31/2009,"no i don't support this as it would make rr domis fleets a little too imba.i do however think that sentry guns should have significantly reduced damage to drones and other small targets. to give players a chance at using their drones through skillfull management. in the area of 3-4 volleys to kill a unbonused heavy dronesentries should be there to make gate fighting in low sec more difficult, but not impossible for certain classes of ships."
5/31/2009,"the part i bolded for you is the real issue. seriously. why follow the herd mentality of nullsec (i.e. da blob on da gate/da blob on da station/da blob on the pos) and further encourage similar brainless ""push-butan"" in losec?instead of buffing for the lazy....proper incentive for smarter hisec dwellers to risk losec for whatever reason is the way forward. along with ****canning all pos shields (and take the ****ing things out of wh's altogether).the part in italics...boohoo. also lol. and boohoo again.yes the number of camps in losec has always been made out far worse than reality. by a mile. a country mile. but the silliness in rancer and other hisec-losec junctions (woohoo awesome corp gets 14k kills of which 12k are shuttles go doodz ) kinda puts folks off.it's simple.nuke pos shields. period. all of them.buff losec rewards for those that wish to risk it.oh...remove local and make it just a count of active pilots. everywhere.and i'll have that pony and flying pig.good luck.**edit**i forgot...open up hisec to outlaws without mommy/daddy aggro babysitters. concord is so silly. and outlaws being automatic targets anyway thanks to sec status can choose whether or not to risk a visit....just like the various ""lol-antipie"" types feel free to drop into losec with t1 pap blob."
5/31/2009,"as a non-drone ship pilot that like to indulge in the odd low-sec escapade i like the way that things currently operate. drones are not a significant percentage of my dps or ability and for such operations i usually just fill the bay with whatever light drones are cheapest at the time.the time it takes for sentries to cycle after destroying (well, insta-popping) a done is awesome and allows me a much greater window of oppourtunity when it comes to the gank...that said, however, removing sentry aggression from drones will be a bonus. a bonus to those that i am trying to gank, a bonus that want to give it a try but are drone based and a boost to those that want to combat pirates that aren't outlaws (yes, we do exist).supported."
5/31/2009,"supported all the way.gallente are at a huge disadvantage with the sentry guns shooting at drones. sentry guns don't shoot missiles down, they don't shoot energy weapons so they break, so why shoot one of gallente's main damage dealing weapons?"
5/31/2009,"support all the way, domi needs some love."
5/31/2009,"definitely. gallente pilots are at a major disadvantage at gates, and that's wrong.alternatively, make sentry guns shoot down missiles."
5/31/2009,supported

5/31/2009,yes!
5/31/2009,supported. not sure what else to say because any counter argument is just silly in my opinion.
5/31/2009,sounds like a plan!
5/31/2009,"suggested this ages ago and got ignored/misunderstood. so, yeah."
5/31/2009,supported.
5/31/2009,yay logistics boost....win
5/31/2009,argee with this not so much because of the logistics ships issue (and i fly logistics alot) but more because an outlaw cant even remote rep his own drones (normal ships not that important but fighters are a diffrent issue mainly due to cost) without getting global crim which tbh is just plain stupid.btw if you do fly logistics legitimately (i.e. player corp not hiding from wars to remote rep) go read pitboss' neutral/alt remote repping thread and make them see that giving remote repping an agression countdown would screw up logistics.
5/31/2009,"well, i appreciate your enthusiasm. then again, this proposal will potentially consume much energy of ccp. thus, i would like to discuss with you, and your mastermind nyphur, before shooting it to a csm meeting; and i am referring to the regular meetings, where we build the list for iceland.mining has been discussed in iceland early this year. ccp was really vague, seems like they have something, which did not finish for apocrypha, and the csm did not really throw in much. at least it appears to me that the real trigger, which excites everyone's passion, has not yet been found. seems like mining is not tied to the end-game, thus a lack of interest from the big players. and i am not sure if they would be so fond of seeing mining regain importance?please join us in the ig channel take care for live discussion."
5/31/2009,"total revamps often win me over just for nevelty's sake, and mining really needs love. solid concept, here."
5/31/2009,"i don't understand why the empires don't all have an equal distribution of agents, imo, within their prime fiction.caldari - r&d, corporate, ect.minmatar - combatgallente - mixedamarr - internal security, et al.but the total number of agents should be identical, as should their relative qualities and distributions.and their agents should be in their own space, or the space of their allies, not in wholly enemy empire space."
5/31/2009,nerf caldari.
5/31/2009,a fine proposal even if i doubt it will still get meaningful support at this stage.
5/31/2009,"just petition it as ask to have the previous balances reset.and hope.and pray.oh, and offering sexual services or beer might help a little..."
5/31/2009,lol no
5/31/2009,having a cash shop sort of system is not a good direction for eve to go
5/31/2009,not supported
5/31/2009,"definitely not supported. i remapped to a more balanced approach because of expected training. i'm now not really planning to make the full use of this... ah well, them's the breaks. next time i'll be more careful to ensure that my year ahead is planned correctly."
5/31/2009,"100% supported. everyone saying that it will result in more hacks or that you would be worried you would get your account pw stolen are all paranoid idiots.being able to change the various aspects of the ui such as where the module bars are located, adding a percentage symbol to targeted ships hp and so on would only benefit the players. it would not require any more calculations done by the client or any additional data/commands sent to the server and thusly no more likelyhood of a ""hack"" being developed. also the rules of don't download anything that you dont trust not to be a keylogger still applies. if you download a ""addon"" from www.eve-hacks.rus then you deserve to have to account stolen."
5/31/2009,"i don't think anyone really wants ""walking in stations"", it's a nice thought and we're kinda interested but really for the game it just sounds like a time/isk sink.instead i'm sure we could all benefit from any time assigned to that non-critical feature to be reassigned to ui improvements such as a new (and working) evemail interface.there are many important things being skipped over in favour of features no one has requested. which in-turn add nothing to the game.if these eye-candy patches are released before bug-fixes and ui improvements, i think i'll stop my subscriptions ahead of more inaction."
5/31/2009,maybe with all the time saved they could get around to picking a better font for eve :-)
5/31/2009,maybe if you bothered to read and pay attention you'd know this is a waste of time as the dev's working on ambulation are not a part of the main core of eve...it's a different department entirely.
5/31/2009,"regardless, that department uses resources at ccp that can be allotted to better, more useful projects. i'd much rather see a new ship class or faster deployment of dynamic, hidden roid belts than walking in stations.oh, and btw, ccp, make hidden roid belts so that you have to run several scans and move your ship around to find the belt, rather than dropping one probe and getting warpins on all of them."
5/31/2009,"this game is like a 1940s russian tank the very best, innovative, groundbreakingbut shot out so fast its crammed full of rough edges, bugs, imbalances, etc etc ccp needs to fix whats wrong with eve currently rather than introduce ambulation (which none of its current customer base paid to play)"
5/31/2009,"umm, no. we do not get the ability to dictate ccp policy. have a problem with that? too bad. i have loads of problems with other developers of other games, but do you hear me whining? no. ccp can do whatever it wants. you can quit the game in protest or go back to playing like you already are.--isaac"
5/31/2009,"they are developing a vampire mmo and thought it would be nice to use the engine for something else, so they develop ambulation, too. of course they could stop every involvement in eve and focus on their more important core task. i can't see how this would help the eve codebase tbh.and: no."
5/31/2009,"i would rather see the time, effort and money put into ambulation used elsewhere on critical game areas."
5/31/2009,"ambulation is a musthave.why?because its one step to making eve mmo sci-fi game, not only just internet spaceship game. which is awesome.maybe it has small use at the moment ,but thats the plan to add things slowly."
5/31/2009,"not supported.too much dev time, money and manpower invested into a mechanic which is deep into production (which i'll agree could have been better used to refine the existing game). ambulation is a framework for which future ccp products will launch from; its unlikely to be stopped even if feedback from the eve playerbase was resoundingly negative. accept it and move on."
5/31/2009,not supported.it's a good feature and will bring in a lot of new players.
5/31/2009,"while it's kind of fun to rag on ambulation, there's not a snowball's chance in hell of ccp abandoning this feature, certainly not at this late stage. asking for it would be a waste of the csm's time, and a pointless insult to ccp. not supported."
5/31/2009,supported in full. usability - to say the least - is a must.
5/31/2009,"supporting this, because twice now we've killed a freighter belonging to someone who is seen (macro) hauling in the area, and its been full of kernite"
5/31/2009,agree but first can we get fricking pos to work off aliance standings as well as corp or a second tick box option for alliance standings to be used.
5/31/2009,what do you think will be more likely to get this stuff implemented? bundling or as separate issues with their own levels of support? well go with whatever is best.
5/31/2009,tend to support. pos mechanics need a change and this is one of the many areas and directions in which it could be changed for the better.
5/31/2009,i would support a dual system whereby you can set access via pw and via standings or choose only to operate via standings.
5/31/2009,"supporting this because oh man it is needed. of course, keep the password option but ultimately standings allowing access would make things a lot easier."
5/31/2009,csm needs to go slap some sense into ccp
5/31/2009,2
5/31/2009,i just noticed that ccp completely ignored this csm thread about this topic:
5/31/2009,"makes indeed more sense to spread out people by adding more and better agents in other faction space rather then adding more caldari agents, simply because caldari space is more crowded and more people start of as caldari.especially talking about level 4 mission runners is some group where u should expect from those players (even if they mindless run missions in there whole eve career) to look around in high sec for more and better agents. even if u take the aproach that they are paying you money to give them what they want on a shiny plate ;p"
5/31/2009,"this thread is just as stupid/idiotic as the orginal devblog.the op is actually *agreeing* with the dev decision to add l4 agents to the game in high sec. this doesn't solve anything or help anything.who cares about the distribution of more l4 agents between the races? the fact that more l4 agents are being added *at all* is the problem.we need to be removing reward for no risk from the game, not adding to it. i don't support the op's idea at all. simply changing the distribution of the new l4 agents isn't the answer. not adding any new l4 agents is the correct solution.move all of the high quality l4 agents to lowsec, spread them out, and make sure that the l3 agents are also evenly spread out and dispersed. people who endure the risk of missioning in lowsec should be rewarded. everyone else should have to suffer the consequences of remaining in high sec like a bunch of sissies and deal with the reduced income.i've run plenty of missions, if for no other reason than to better understand my targets and to get bookmarks so that i could better kill mission runners (before they changed the probing mechanics). i don't get killed while doing so because i'm not an idiot carebear who's so lazy that they can't pay attention to the game. if you're getting killed while running missions then it's because you're too stupid to live, not because the game is too difficult or unfair."
5/31/2009,"as the poster above, i too think both the devblog and op have the wrong approach to the problem.we need dynamic agent quality, where it moves gradually over months based on how many missions the agent has been handing out compared to others. thus the agent quality will drop to a point where mission runners will start considering moving to other systems, eventually reaching an equilibrium between agent quality and location quality."
5/31/2009,89 + 48 = 137moot point indeed.
5/31/2009,"yawn, another ""move any l4q1+ agent to lowsec so me and my bunch of corpies can has some easy kills against pve fit cnr's since that's all the sissy mission runners use"" comment.tbh with the chars i've got i could probably make as much money mining as i do running l4 but i prefer to mission.mission mechanics need a major overhaul.give players some variety in the missions they run, i look at eve-survival and haven't done a huge number of the missions listed as they are for other factions and minmy / gallente don't like me much increase the ai of mission rats, but don't make it sleeper ai where they have your drones for lunch, or as 'difficult' as 0.0 (although living in 0.0 is easier than lowsec imo) and a properly set up system you can chain belt rats and earn more money than missions with less risk, you have intel channels, local and as soon as you see anyone you don't know in local you scurry off to the safety of your pos shields (you did allign when you got into the belt didn't you?)i've lived in lowsec, lived in 0.0 and lived in empire. i've retired to empire for a bit of downtime as i play eve to enjoy myself, to not have to worry about other players ganking me in lowsec, not to have to keep numerous chat channels open to see who's coming my way in 0.0.so if you don't like the way eve is going, then you know where the door is, and can i has your stuff"
5/31/2009,agreed!
5/31/2009,"as for those that want to move all l4 agents to lowsec period, go away. those that think the current mission system is flawed and that lowsec/0.0 needs to be more lucrative, and the current mission system needs dynamic qualities which drop if more people run missions and so on, i agree, but there are two other proposal threads for that to discuss things such as that in.based on ccps response to csm1, this is just the first step and the mission system will be overhauled in the future.that's because csm2 voted this issue down and ccp never got it.sigh...csm3 will hopefully do a lot better."
5/31/2009,i mostly agree with youhowever you are completly neglecting lowsec and 0.0as for bellum and people like him who are talking out of their intergalactic assfor most people doing lvl4's is a way to fund pvpwhat you want is to have oportunitys that have greater rewards in lowsec and 0.0 to give you more targets to probe out and killnot having less overall targets because they get borred of it all... because whiney little *****es like you demand that that for the comparativly small amount of players who engage in your elected profession the majority has to suffer
5/31/2009,"really mate you're heading down a dangerous road. the plain fact is that the whole mission systems needs reworking from the ground up. the more ""band aid"" changes that are made, then the greater the pain will be when the whole festering mess has to be ripped off.given that, why slate ccp for applying a small, easy band-aid rather than a larger, more time consuming band-aid?"
5/31/2009,"agree that the way it is being done is screwey i would also like to point out from a minmatar perspective yes atleast they are getting agents unlike amarr but 2 of them are administration (none of the gallente/caldari are admin or similarly lower % combat mission agent types) and only 1 has a posistive quality (one of the administartions) the rest are at 0 (second admin), -7, -11 which seems a bit out of whack in comparison to me."
5/31/2009,"""this issue demands 23 new highsec l4 agents added... for each non-caldari faction.""sounds good - as a first step.bust just adding more agents is not good enough. it would be a first step, maybe.what we really need is a dynamic agent quality system, get rid of the fixed quality system. but that would be a different issue."
5/31/2009,"what about if agents give only a limited ammount of missions per player per day? like for example 10 missions for a -20 and 5 missions for a +20 agent?that way mission runners would have to move around doing missions, thus spreading the ammount of mission runners to a wider areal."
5/31/2009,"give amarr at least one decent highsec agent.the best one for amarr navy is a q -7 with 2 adjacent jumps, one of which is lowsec."
5/31/2009,"ccp's decision here seems to have come completely irrelevant of the whole debate. it looks a lot more like a step in an ongoing evolution of agent services within empire space, this step being focused on alleviating stress in high sec (with the aim to create more mini hubs by encouraging people to spread out) in line with the distribution of population of that part of eve's population per race and playstyle.it is dumb because of the timing and context of the emo debate.it is smart because it really is needed in light of an ongoing growth of the mission runner population. plus for the first time ccp is actually taking the angle here of abusing people's own mindsets to achieve results, which is not a discouraging thing in my opinion.it would have been nice if it had been paired with a similar initiative in providing a batch of agents in low sec at the same time. that would have saved a lot of emo."
5/31/2009,"while ccp movement is dumb even to their standard... this thread does nothing to help fix the real problem with level 4 or missioning: it goes agaisnt the core of game because there isn't any real competition on them between players.remove the whole quality thing, make them give limited missions per day (easier to control the biggest isk faucet also) and quality a fuction of usage. that to start with,m then add sleeper ai and totally revamp them, and epic missions allready damn it. then, only then, maybe it would be wise to add new agents ."
5/31/2009,"i totally agree with the op. as agents are now its hard to resist to do missions for caladari because they simply have the best agents and the most of them.as passionated amarr player, id love to do missions for khanid or ammatar but they simply have no usefull agent at all. look for amarr navy, ammator navy or khanid navy l4s with kill mission that are not right at or in low sec. there are none.and afaik its the same for the minmatar faction.so the problem is not with caldari having to few agents, but the other factions (especially minor factions) having totally crap agents.and ccps attempt goes totally in the wrong direction."
5/31/2009,ankhesentapemkah allready got my vote on this.
5/31/2009,for years mission agents and their distribution are in dire need of support.
5/31/2009,"make quality dynamic already.each downtime, rank the agents at each level in order of the number missions run for them in the last 30 days.least used 2.5% get q20 till next downtime, next 2.5% get q19, all the way down to the most used at q-20.problem solved."
5/31/2009,supporting this. all our (eve university) directors agree the corp management tools are currently not sufficient.
5/31/2009,"while i do agree with most of what you said, having ceo reading my personal mail is stupid.thats like saying that ceo should have access to your wallet, and your hangar. no thanks, i'd like to keep my private stuff private."
5/31/2009,"i posted a thread recently addressing my ideas for improving fw and would like to repost them here, if for no other reason than - if i post it enough - at some point there must be a dev response of some kind:a.) wardec mechanics which allow pirate corps to 'cherry pick' individual fw player corps without drawing aggression from the rest of the militia.this fix would mean nothing more than making all four militia factions into alliances insofar as wardec game mechanics are concerned. can't dec one corp within without deccing them all. hell, it'd probably involve changing one line of code for each militia.b.) provide a real advantage to establishing sovereignty. deny station services (but allow docking) to enemy combatants in non-militia (npc corp) stations and disallow docking altogether in militia-labeled stations.doesn't have to be complicated, doesn't need any new set of rules. just use the nullsec docking code for fw with those stations that are militia in nature (those having the respective militia in their names - tribal liberation force logisitics plant, 24th imperial crusade testing facilities, etc.). if you don't have occupancy, your militia can't dock in those stations. you could still dock in any non-militia stations in any system (quafe company warehouse, etc.) regardless of occupancy, but perhaps with station services cut off to whichever militia does not have system occupancy. perhaps cutting off station services in npc stations might be seen as too extreme, i don't know.some faction warfare systems have npc corp stations in them, others do not. systems which have only militia stations will be something for enemies to consider when flying through an enemy-occupied system -- and give them a good reason for taking said systems themselves.this would make fw a little bit more like 0.0-with-training-wheels, as ccp say they intend. if you are ""behind enemy lines"" roaming or fighting in enemy occupied space, it will not be so easy to just dock up and get repairs (or avoid fights).c.) plex spawning. insure the mechanics are such that plexes spawn more evenly throughout the day and in plenty of out-of-the-way fw systems to encourage more solo and small gang roaming outside the major pipes (kamela/kourm/auga/amamake, tama/suj/heyd/oms).this requires no further explanation, as most everyone - ccp included - agree the plex spawning mechanics are fubared at the moment. as far as cloaking and speedtanking the plexes, the solution there is also a simple one: one must destroy all npcs in a plex in order to finish said plex. you can still run the timer down, cloak up and speed tank all you like, but it will just keep flashing ""0.00 seconds"" until someone finishes off any and all rats.(continued)"
5/31/2009,"d.) establish modest loyalty point awards for fw activity. this should be low enough that high-level mission running is still far more lucrative to dissuade farming, yet provide enough incentive to plex, thus opening more pvp opportunities in more systems not in the main pipes mentioned above.taking a couple minor plexes down might grant enough lps to buy faction ammo, for example. changing sovereignty (or successfully defending a bunker) should grant enough lp to purchase faction frigates. faction cruisers and other significant rewards should be the result of accumulating larger amounts of lp.i don't think giving actual isk rewards would be the way to go with this at all. it should be loyalty point based for such items as may be purchased only in the faction store. and to avoid farming, make taking a major unrestricted plex scale to about 2/3 what a single level iv mission would earn a high sec carebear, and scale all lp rewards for lesser plexes down from there.remember that this is not like mission running. if these changes are implemented, you'll have to not only kill all the rats in a plex but do so with potentially scores of wts searching through many of these systems looking to gank you. as always, make offensive plexing more rewarding then defensive plexing."
5/31/2009,sheesh - another ankhe thread i find worth supporting.
5/31/2009,"not supported.it's not ccps responsability to hold people's hands or get them to grow up. keep in mind eve's development is one of trends, open this can of worm and it'll open the door for a range of confirmation tracks over time. no thanks.a nice reminder paired with account subscription timer would do fine. you have 9 days remaining on your addiction, and your password is 6 years old.still, maybe it is sometimes a little bit their job to help people grow up, going over a number of posts here makes me a tad fearful for this csm round. if this is how cases will be tackled ... far from good."
5/31/2009,"forced passwords, especially those that don't let you set passwords you've used in the past result in weaker and weaker passwords as the users have more and more trouble remembering what they've changed it to.my password is fine, if yours is easy or you use the same pass at other sites then that's your problem."
5/31/2009,"nothing, and i mean nothing, puts me more off a game or service than forcing me to change passwords or a specific password standard.i don't want to suffer because others are too stupid/lazy/greedy to look after themselves.no sign"
5/31/2009,people also need to exercise better judgment in choice of pw.11 letter alpha numeric case sensitive with an enforced change every month should prevent a lot of the current issues.
5/31/2009,"oh god, not more passwords. it really would infuriate me to have to change them constantly on all my accounts with each having a different password (presently at four). maybe ccp could send a mailing reminder to change your password biannually with a link to the account management page. hardware dongles/authenticators seem to work for another mmo, i have friends very happy with blizz's authenticator.i wouldn't be opposed to the idea that if passwords are not changed say annually, that a small administrative fee could be charged for account recovery."
5/31/2009,this to be honest. i can't believe this is the first thing you raise as csm mazz
5/31/2009,if you knew me better you would have been surprised it was only second or maybe third issue i posted
5/31/2009,"it won't hurt, i guess."
5/31/2009,poor wardec mechanics have pushed many good corps out of factionwar on all sides.
5/31/2009,good idea
5/31/2009,"you are confused about what is being suggested.as per current example: the star fraction (an alliance, not part of any of the militias) is war deccing individual corporations within the amarr faction/alliance/militia. other corporations within the amarr faction/alliance/militia must pay to war dec back the star fraction in order to support their comrades against a non-gallente/minmatar threat.what you are proposing is that the factions be made into true alliances which would interact with non-aligned player alliances in some way. declaring war on pie inc would be declaring war on the amarr empire as an example."
5/31/2009,would be a benefit to all concerned
5/31/2009,this seems perfectly reasonable.
5/31/2009,"given the recent postings on other websites, and the existence of a document outlining how to manipulate the grid, could ccp be asked to look at this issue and explain how they will improve the situation (or what they are currently doing, as i suspect they are aware of this problem). admitedly, this might be something that can't easily be fixed...."
5/31/2009,"who cares? using those tactics in overpowering manner (such as to shrink the grid of a pos to prevent sniping) is already deemed an exploit.using those tactics to simply ensure your bs fleet is able to load a grid before engaging, instead of going from ""coming out of warp"" to appearing in their clone station's medical bay in the 10minutes it takes to load grid otherwise, doesn't create an unfair advantage. actually it equalizes the unfair advantage those already on grid possess over the guys who have yet to load it."
5/31/2009,"creating advantageous configurations of grid for aggressors is okay then?i realise the solution may be involved; however, that isn't to say it shouldn't be looked at. it may be a consequence of exisiting grid mechanics, but it doesn't follow that you use the limitations of the mechanics for advantage."
5/31/2009,i think this is a great example of home field advantage. the opposing side could also take advantage of this if they decided to put in the same amount of time and effort. i can easily imagine opposing cov-ops squads trying to prep the battlespace. this seems like a great example of the depth of eve to me.
5/31/2009,"that'd be great, if the defenders knew about it. many assume the method is known by most..."
5/31/2009,well it is publically documented now and everyone can read it.
5/31/2009,"on one hand, i like the idea of battlespace preparation, advance work providing concrete rewards, and all that stuff. on the other hand, this seems like exactly the wrong way of doing that - forcing people to exploit mechanics in undocumented ways to do hilariously nonsensical things is a terrible game mechanic. if they were to create something similar as an actual, intended mechanic, with proper balance considerations and documentation, i might support it. but the status quo is not a good one."
5/31/2009,"hmm... to make this official the only thing someone has to do is make a wiki article about this tactic. if ccp doesn't pull the article, it is official. or at least official enough for me."
5/31/2009,"theres not a whole lot you can do with grid fu that's useful. if you shrink a grid down around a pos to prevent sniping, you would need a ****load of covopses or else its obvious what youre doing and your objects in space can be shot down or petitioned.pl knew about grid fu a long time before this document was released and havent really made a lot of practical use of it. also i really doubt that ccp still have the capability to change that sort of code anymore.i used to experiment with it, and i tried probably every grid manipulation method in that document and made one of my own as well. the two main problems with using it in a combat situation is that 1. they take quite a while to execute, and 2. they are completely foiled by an object left in a certain place that you can't destroy. so you would need at least an hour's warning before a battle, and you would need to have the resources to drop invisible undestroyable objects- for example covopses. you would need over a dozen covopses, or twice as much to account for people crashing and logging out, and then you would need to coordinate positions of cloaked ships, which isnt so easy in itself."
5/31/2009,what needs improving?it's a non-issue imo.popping over a grid in the middle of a fight is kind of annoying. i'm glad they do scale dynamically to whatever extent they do.
5/31/2009,i must have been hallucinating the use of gridload bm's then
5/31/2009,"(i edited the post i think after these replies were made, so if you want check back on it)also in combat you can use/create a grid loading bookmark without having to intentionally expand the grid. the size of the grid is usually large enough for something like that already."
5/31/2009,"hehe, last night we were discussing it with a few people, which ended up with placing bets on who would start downplaying grid manipulation first :plook, grid manipulation has been a tactical tool for years now, while the majority of the regular players has no clues what is going on, the smarter folks can easily put it to advantage without this taking a lot of work or even time. especially in fluid operations where there is a lot of movement simple tag teaming between scouts is enough, in more static environments it takes even less tag teaming.grid manipulation is not even something which arose after ccp introduced pos, even when people were playing station ping pong this was a common method, around stations and gates, but also around belts. these days there is a lot more use for it obviously, from prepping a warp tunnel to a gate so your titan pilot doesn't crash when loading grid, to forcing a hostile force to go in close range around a pos, or just being able to observe a hostile force while loading grid without being exposed to fire.key is that if done consistently it does provide nice advantages, and while both sides involved in a conflict can put it to use and even subject it to a sort of arms race it the focal point remains whether or not such use of mechanisms provides unfair advantages out of principle.one thing to keep in mind however is that quite often such ""methods"" are one of the few things which do provide options to actually engage without admiring your desktop wallpaper after a few seconds. preloading the combat grid prior to hitting effective combat range is not just something which is a tactical tool for all sides, more often then not it is a method of survival to even get in the conflict.does it provide advantages? yes.does it provide unfair advantages? good question. if there were an eve manual and litterally every grunt had the opportunity to learn about it then it would not provide an unfair advantage one could argue. but, eve is a game with a steep and blind learning curve, we all know this.can ccp even do anything about this? well, over the years we have seen this float up a number of times, sometimes with one verdict, sometimes with another, ultimately there is nothing they can do about it. not without completely redesigning dynamic grid (creation) mechanisms, and that seems to me a big investment of time and energy. in the mean time many people actually use this - without even realising as they follow and not lead - in order to facilitate pew pew.maybe it's another example of ccp underestimating its customers :p maybe this shows a bit of a hint to implement preloading grids selected as destination during warp to make the landing smoother for everyone."
5/31/2009,"theres not a whole lot you can do with grid fu that's useful. if you shrink a grid down around a pos to prevent sniping, you would need a ****load of covopses or else its obvious what youre doing and your objects in space can be shot down or petitioned.actually, placing objects to shrink and hide pos are exploits as declared by ccp.pl knew about grid fu a long time before this document was released and havent really made a lot of practical use of it. also i really doubt that ccp still have the capability to change that sort of code anymore.so (if this statement is to be believed)? many other alliances and corps have made good use of it, often to their oppositions demise. are you seriously suggesting that ccp dont have the capability to change that code???i used to experiment with it, and i tried probably every grid manipulation method in that document and made one of my own as well. the two main problems with using it in a combat situation is that 1. they take quite a while to execute, and 2. they are completely foiled by an object left in a certain place that you can't destroy. so you would need at least an hour's warning before a battle, and you would need to have the resources to drop invisible undestroyable objects- for example covopses. you would need over a dozen covopses, or twice as much to account for people crashing and logging out, and then you would need to coordinate positions of cloaked ships, which isnt so easy in itself.hmm, so you are suggesting that an attacker would need to plan attacks? hell, thats where most of us have been going wrongseriously, have you read the document at all? you dont need that many pilots and covertsand id go as far to suggest that 10 pilots holding open grids in a battle is not that big a deal (considering the number involved often in such battles). coordinating positions is very easy, using the overview etc.the point of this issue is that the mechanics are being used to the unfair advantage of the attacker (or the defender in some cases). there may be various reasons why doing this is desirable (eg, grid loading lagging, not being able to jump everything in etc), but that doesnt make it acceptable when another is put at a severe disadvantage due to exploitation of mechanics."
5/31/2009,"nothing to see here... move along.i gave the document a brief look over. i have played a bit with grid manipulation over the years but nothing on this scale.from what i could gather it's uses are limited to 1. shrinking the grid around a pos (oh exploit).2. setting up dd proof grid loads for sniper fleets.3. using l shaped grids to cause confusion.one or two other amusing tactical uses come to mind. but it's something that takes a lot of effort, manpower and time to implement. the document is now in the public domain.i seriously doubt that this tactic has caused alliances to fall. it's both a terrible mechanic and an astonishingly amazing one.keep it.edit: i will add, that espicially in the days now of the 10 second probe hit the advantages gained by using this tactic are significantly reduced."
5/31/2009,"scanning changes have impacted this a lot indeed, problem remains that it isn't about being or avoiding being found, in todays conflicts of 800+ in a system it is about who loads the first, wins.in that sense the advantage does remain very strong, regardless of whether one force finds another force and warps to it, the latter will have preloaded significantly better then the first.but, as i said, i would wish ccp would follow up on this from another angle. since grids are known to the server, and objects are known to the server, i would love to see a solution being creative and bypassing this all. it should be possible for everyone to gradually load objects active in space in a given system. for example during a warp, i could imagine a check if a grid is existant, whether it has objects, and to pass these through a queue to the client.that way we'd have one less ""omg undocumented"" trick and a more level trenchwar :p"
5/31/2009,"i doubt they can. the ""trick"" is to use the existing dynamics of creating and affecting grids, on the basis of the same object on which grid creation works. they'd have to replace the current dynamics with something else, or make all boundaries absolute (which in its own presents a world of trouble)."
5/31/2009,"well, im certain there is some point in eula that speaks about manipulating with the game is considered an exploit. and grid issue is more server related then ingame related as you use ingame items to manipulate game-server performance.its same exploit as bookmark bomb was."
5/31/2009,"if you want to be specific about it, the declaration was only about hiding poses, not about preventing 150km+ sniping. you can prevent sniping without hiding a pos from the warpin. i dont think ccp knew it could be done.how many battle reports have you read that ended with ""if only we didnt keep popping off grid pl would have lost""?we're not ******s. we know the moment ccp knows about any of that **** theyll declare it an exploit.seriously, have you tested a single piece of the information in this document? you need one object minimum to hold open a grid and two objects minimum to expand a grid. the document only speaks about shrinking the grid around a pos in a smaller number of direction, but you can in reality shrink a grid around a pos in every single direction(that i found out by myself and wasnt included in the leaked document). thats the only real way to prevent sniping(otherwise they will just find a grid bulge and warp their snipers there), and it requires a ton of objects both to establish the starting grid and to move it inwards.due to post size limits, ill only link rather then paste. but here's a post i made on scrapheap illustrating my tactic that is subtly different then the one in the grid fu document that shrinks down a pos grid in every single direction rather then a few:"
5/31/2009,"people hardly mention it in battlereports, for obvious reasons :p it has always been a grey area, to say the least. it's a common comment however in scout convo's and the therapy rooms of pos defence managers over the years :p please try to avoid getting caught in personal angles :p you're a politician now!don't do it solo. like most things in eve that'll drive you nuts. it is disgustingly easy using a bit of teamwork, which seems to be paired with the multiplayer concept :p it was probably unintended, but the use of the word ""tactic"" serves here as a good example how easy it is to see it as a tactic. whether that is because people have used it over the years, or because they approach matters from an angle of ""here's the problem now we fill in the steps we need to take to win"" or even whether it comes from unconcsiously classing it in with ""strategy, methods, tricks"" in our own minds.maybe the question would better be: is grid manipulation a valid, sanctioned tactic, independant of method, objective or result.if ccp's verdict is ""yes"", then this is a simple case of how eve doesn't have a manual and he who figures out stuff better then the other guy wins"".if ccp's verdict is ""no"", then it's an exploit. we then have the problem that there is no way of tracking it or following up on it, and fixing it would require such an allocation of manhours that the fix would never arrive."
5/31/2009,- added this comment to second post temporarily -i see most people misunderstood the way it can/should/would be used.let me give you one example...suppose the following would be the way the modifier table would be populated:if (agent location security rat
5/31/2009,"yes akita, we realize how it could be used. the thing is, that's not part of the proposal - you specifically avoided proposing any actual utility for your proposal, and if this were to be implemented you'd basically just be creating a lot of intentional database trash. we understand what it could be used to do, but there are other, less obtrusive, ways of doing the same thing under current mechanics - say, increasing the security bonus to agent effective quality. you're proposing the addition of an unnecessary mechanism, and little else. if you were saying ""double bounties for 0.0 agents"", that would actually be a concrete and useful proposal, agree or disagree. this, on the other hand, is just a waste of everyone's time."
5/31/2009,"but that's just it : what you described is not an effective measure.one of the first things i point out in the op (the entire focus of the second small section) is that whatever we have nowadays is simply nowhere near enough.so, you understand how the mechanism could be used, you fully understand the example given for sure, you see (at least some of) the benefits of the proposed system... but you disagree with it because... why exactly ? because it's intentionally been left open-ended by me for now ?i've left it open-ended like that precisely in order to avoid turining it into a complete flamewar discussions of ""don't nerf this"" and ""that doesn't need a boost"", in order to focus on the tool itself, which would enable the possibility to change all that in many different ways, any time ccp sees fit, with minimal additional effort.i even said at the end ""how exactly will the amounts of the modifiers be determined is not an issue right now, but if you have ideas about that too, feel free to voice them"", and i have added the link to the older thread, where a concrete method (a auto-balancing one, by the way) that would use this system is presented.if i made a ""just double lowsec bounties/loot/salvage"" proposal, you'd first have people complaining about why do you need to do that at all, other people complaining about the word ""double"" arguing that 50% would be enough (or other saying it would need tripled), and other people cluelessly crying about how this is impossible to do because the game doesn't allow anything like that (ignoring the fact that's precisely what the thread is about, changing the game to allow that in the first place).i never expected people like you to oppose the introduction of an useful tool, just because the plans for the tool don't also include a description of the ways the tool is supposed to be used in great and painstaking detail (only to have somebody else reject the proposal because they don't like the spelling of a word on page 379 of 9356).but, feel free to assume (if that's what it takes) that the ""example"" given in the second post (the one with 0.7, 1.5 and 3.0) is also attached to the proposal - does that suit your need for completeness better ?"
5/31/2009,"if i suggest you build a hammer, it's pretty clear how i intend you to utilize it even if i say 'just as an example - you could possibly use it on a nail'.requesting you build a hammer does beg the question - do you even need one? the discussion on its use is unfortunately unavoidable :/"
5/31/2009,"it is reasonable tool but at this stage of the product the desired application is more important and tools by themselves are meaningless. sure ccp can make a setting that would decrease mission rewards how you propose. what you (intentionally) omit is that they most probably are not willing to increase the rewards. this is the core of the issue.they (probably) have some baseline isk/manhour ratio. this ratio forms the upper limit of pve income. this ratio is (probably) approached by efficient l4 grinding. all you can do at this stage is nerf l4s, which will negatively affect the majoriy of playrbase and reinforce status quo of old timers.i suspect all the failures like fw, t3, l4 scaling, all bump into this wall. they cannot for design reasons surpass current l4s, while l4s are honed to perfection, so they are not attractive enough. this is where you need to introduce mudflation or just cope with effects of stagnant rewards. or be creative and make alternate valuables, which is what ccp tried with t3 skills but still was (imo) too afraid to breach the isk/h wall."
5/31/2009,"this will allow them to heavily increase the rewards of lowsec mission-running (which is severely needed) and/or also do the same for 0.0 mission-running (which frankly needs far less of a boost compared to lowsec mission-running, but it still could use some boost anyway).yes, it's obvious this particular hammer would be used on a nail as its main intended use.but what exactly do you intend to do with hammered-in nails ? it could be anything from building a house, a boat, or putting nails in somebody else's arms and legs, or just breaking somebody's head with it.a tool intended for one purpose initially can be used in many different ways, and it's not up to me at this point to determine all possible uses ccp can derive out of it, or what exactly should they do with it at all.so, yes, i gave a simple example (and a link to a much more complicated example) which illustrate what can be done with it - and now i'm asking for them to build that hammer and start using it.yes, we need one, we need one so bad it's not even funny anymore.in highsec, l4s are ridiculously profitable, because you can do them in the most ridiculously overpimped ship with little regard to pvp-related risks, while obtaining almost the same potential income level a lowsec l4 mission-runner would be able to obtain... while the lowsec runner takes huge risks, he cannot possibly be rewarded appropriately, because the tools that would enable the proper reward to be dispensed are non-existant.nobody said to avoid discussing the uses of this system, feel free to do so, but the point of this thread remains : it's not mainly about all possible uses or the way ccp will end up using it (while that particular discussion has loads of merits and even belongs here to some degree, it's not the main focus) - the thread is primarily about the need for this tool."
5/31/2009,"i would prefer something similar to what's proposed in the op, but not quite the same.agent quality should represent the standings required to use an agent, no more and no less.the economic value of a kill mission should scale with the security level of the system it's in. that of a courier mission with the average of systems passed through figured by shortest or safest route, whichever yields the least.by economic value i mean direct isk payments, bounties, base lps awarded, drops and salvage (by applying a modifier to the drop tables). any roids spawned should be appropriate to the system security and location."
5/31/2009,"this is exactly what i was saying.this thread is about the introduction of the system that would enable those ""economic value"" adjustments in the first place.how exactly you set the coefficients for it is of secondary importance, and easily modifiable later on."
5/31/2009,"idea in principle is sound, but this requires tags to be radically over hauled or replaced with bounties. personally, i think dropping tags is the best solution and replacing them with faction bounties is better idea (exactly the same as normal bounties, but just add a line stating that the reward is given by x faction to the npc template). would also provide a slight boost to factional warfare at the same time."
5/31/2009,"that's the beauty of it - it doesn't since tags are loot, and you adjust the loot too, income from tags is also automatically adjusted, without the need to remove tags and make them factional bounties.for instance, if before a certain ship had a 100% chance to drop 2 tags of a specific kind, if you have a 1.75 modifier to this particular mission, the npc will always drop at least 3 tags and have a 50% chance of dropping a 4th tag - overall, giving you 3.5 tags on average (2*1.75=3.5)."
5/31/2009,"sure it is, you just have to be more aggressive with it. it's not necessarily the right solution, but it is a solution. my point here is that your topic is not actually a proposal. it is an attempt to create a framework on which further proposals could be built, but it's not even the sort of framework which is necessary and in need of advance work. this isn't the sort of proposal that the csm ought to be championing, it's the sort of proposal that ought to be invented by a dev in the middle of a brainstorming session at the pub after work, stuck in a desk drawer, and forgotten until a need for it arises. focus more on what should be done, and less on how it should be done - ccp is going to implement your ideas in a way that suits them(and their design schedule, and their future goals) anyways, might as well at least make it clear what you want, rather than delving into the hypertechnical when you know, or ought to know, that that is going to be discarded before implementation anyways. if what you want is for lowsec and 0.0 agents to be more rewarding, then say so, toss out a couple ideas on how it could be done, and let ccp work at it. don't take one of those ideas and suggest it on its own merits, because it has no merits in a vacuum. if you have a carpenter building you a cabinet, you don't say ""go to the store and buy a hammer, and i might at some future point tell you to do something with it"", you tell him to build you a damned cabinet, and let him figure out the details. he is the professional, with full knowledge of hammers and the best way to use them, and you are not. give him objectives, not hand-holding."
5/31/2009,"currently, entering highsec as an outlaw in a ship triggers faction navy spawns.i propose removing this mechanic entirely with regards to spawn triggers for outlaws, but not when the individual has sufficiently low faction stating with that particular faction so as to be attacked on site by that faction navy.let players police highsec in absence of a gcc- not npc's."
5/31/2009,"interesting idea, and i do like the sound of it (having lost more than a few ships to the faction navy from crashes and what-not), but 9/10 times when i pass through high-sec as an outlaw i'm not even locked by another player, nevermind attacked. would have to give them (the high-sec-ees) some real reason to attack us other than the warm fuzzy feeling of a ship kill and maybe a few nanofibers.supported to see where it could go, anyhow."
5/31/2009,supported for teh lulz.
5/31/2009,"bountys, t2 loot, pvp.just think how many outlaws would be trying to sneak ships out of highsec- it would be glorious chaos.as it is i cant go to trade hubs without being chased by interceptors all the way home so i don't think there is much need for incentives besides those that exist already."
5/31/2009,"in two minds about this redsplat. on the one side it would open up many possibilites for outlaws to go about and engage in combat against the odds.on the other. i know what i'd do... sit in an offgrid with a scanning alt out and spend my days suicide ganking.also, currently the faction police spawns are incredibly useful for getting bs through those pesky areas of hisec. if they were removed all it would take is some noob in a rifter who was mildly lost and moderately bright to ruin one's day.it's all very well and good saying let players protect hisec, but do you really think that's going to happen?throwing my support in there anyway, just for now."
5/31/2009,"we can already suicide gank with utter impunity- or rather to say we can attempt to suicide gank someone.if you remove faction navy spawns and that noob in a rifter does tackle you then you have a fight on your hands- as opposed to npc's wailing on your ship.will other players engage you in highsec just 'cause you are an outlaw? i think so, but i don't know so.its certainly true that all the advantages would lie with highsec dwellers and not the outlaws.edit: more pvp is good right?"
5/31/2009,this change would make me go -10.fact
5/31/2009,"i think it is a very interesting idea, one that the knee jerk reaction from empire dwellers would be a definate no as they would imagine a player sat on a gate baiting people to engage, knowing that he should give a fair few people with limited to no pvp experience a smacking. but as a director of a carebear corp who has just come out of a war dec ourselves we several pilots who would like the chance to learn and dabble a bit and i think this would give people a great chance to pvp in a enviroment where they would feel as they have control over the situation, as the flashy pilot and only the flashy pilot would be able to return fire only when fired upon and would not get the help from anyone either in his corp or outside unless they also were engaged. the problem that will occur though is a flashy bs will just sit on a gate fighting anyone who will take them on then when it starts to get a bit hot for him will de-agress and jump out leaving the one tackling him with an agression timer unable to jump and if he does get killed so what, ship is insured and he had a load of fun, so insurance should not be available to criminals in high sec. so i will give a big thumbs up as it will give us carebears a chance to put a fleet together and try to get a bit of pvp where they can a greater chance of control over the situation, but do think the insurance for criminals in high sec has got to be done away with and gate guns in high sec should insta pop a shuttle or interceptor to stop these crim's from insta warping through high sec and give people a chance of tackling them or this proposed idea will simply be a way for them to get through high sec safer than at the moment unless they want a fight. edit to add. am assuming this would also be the case for faction warfare pilots entering opposing factions high sec ?"
5/31/2009,"how about when a flashy person attacks someone in highsec without aggro rights concord spawns instantly. rplol could be that concord views pirates as more dangerous so puts more effort into fighting them, but don't kill every pirate in highsec space as it would take to much effort without the empires backing.anyways, supporting this."
5/31/2009,too much of a nerf to suicide ganking i think.
5/31/2009,i wanna see old starting movie.
5/31/2009,agreeing
5/31/2009,"i'm a fan of the new starting movie just because it gives people an idea of what type of game eve is. it specifically says that other people will attempt to **** you over in whatever you attempt to do. it's like the game's saying ""this isn't wowinspace"" without having to have the forum community scream it at them."
5/31/2009,"right now its 4 hours i think it should be a 2 hour wait. not everyone runs missions with more than one account or plays 8 hours a day. if someone only plays say 4 hours and gets a load of crappy missions its no fun for the casual player. how i get level 1 quality missions from a lv 4 agent is weird, so if i cancel that and the next one is a mining mission from an internal secruity agent where i need the skills to use a gas harvester i either have to wait 4 hours or take a standings hit or i log. people who run missions away from hubs and with one account shouldn't be penalized with a 4 hour wait."
5/31/2009,"erm, as someone that runs missions away from a hub (ie. i only got 1 l4 agent available to me for quite some ways...) i really don't find it a problem, i'll log in for maybe 4 hours a day. this would simply lead to an increase in mission farming and heighten further the problems with l4 mission rewards.example.i actually got to have a day running missions. i got, in the following order:damsel in distresssansha spiesinfiltrated outpostsansha spiessilly miners: declinedattack of the dronessahsha spiesdamsel in distressthe assaultnot what you would call a fantastic run... still, it pulled in just over 175misk. if i'd been in a position to decline once every 2 hours instead of once every 4 then there is a much greater chance that i'd got some missions worth much more.therefore: not supported"
5/31/2009,agreed withe idea but i think the mission arcs shouldn't be anything less than a chain of extremely challenging level 5 equivalents or similar in order that it takes effort and teamwork to get back from the place you find yourself in and isn't something people do every few days when they fancy a change. that way if you really want to modify your standings in one direction you can but it comes at a heavy price in terms of risk and time.
5/31/2009,"i hate absolutes. supported.one caveat, this should be in lowsec and not 0.0, and hence not as likely controlled by any one alliance; or should havin multiple such agents but only being able to contact one."
5/31/2009,"just reminding you people that this issue was already raised and ccp responded to it a few weeks ago, not sure where the minutes are otherwise i'd point out the answer."
5/31/2009,well thought and crafted solution. there should be a way to recover faction standings and this proposal may have residual effect to (potentially) reinvigorate fw.
5/31/2009,supported so i can do pirate missions some day without destroying the future of my character.
5/31/2009,"fine in a rp sense i suppose. in practical terms, negative faction standings choke players out from accessing various null sec regions of space and thereby make joining prospective corps and alliances very difficult (ie, negative standings with minny can drastically limit access to great wildlands and points beyond)."
5/31/2009,"supported.the new default overview requires you to move ""pilot is an outlaw"" and ""pilot has sec status below 0"" down about 10 spaces for proper placement (below warx2/fleet/corp/alliance/militia/terrible/bad/great/good standing..then outlaw, then below 0). the excuse ccp used for repositioning ""outlaw"" doesn't really hold water (new players default overview should never show friendlies, even those they can fire upon due to outlaw status), and there's absolutely no excuse for placing ""sec status below 0"" next to it. oh look a -1.3 ship, it's on my overview that means i can shoot him, right? whoops, concorded for shooting a target on my overview (who also happened to be in my gang and blue/in my alliance)"
5/31/2009,supported
5/31/2009,i hate ccp sometimes
5/31/2009,they took off the outlaw flashy??!!! **** how many have i missed!******ed.
5/31/2009,supporting this.
5/31/2009,supporting this.
5/31/2009,at the same time make it so that adding war targets in empire to your overview works properly.
5/31/2009,"this was what was needed, not changing things so people started shooting blues."
5/31/2009,supporting.
5/31/2009,supported.it is far more important to know if someone is blue than if they are an outlaw.
5/31/2009,"supported, got attacked by blues because of my sec status."
5/31/2009,fail change....i liked being blinky
5/31/2009,"shooting at pirates or negative standings players, when they enter high sec (from 0.5 and up to 1.0).- becouse they are outlaws and by coming into high sec. they are instant targets.- concord coud warn them, but they woud be instant target for every player.- concord woudnt atack them, if they didnt breach the sec. standings, but everybody else coud, without any risk of concord atacking bouth players.- pirates or negative standings players, woud be instatly ""red"" for kill, also the target woud be ""red"" to the pirates or negative player which has been atacked. explane:pirates or negative player is marked red, once they are shown on the screen. every negative standings player, that will haul stuff with hauler/freighter/jump freighter it is hes choise if he wanna risk or not.my english is not my primary talk. edit: this idea can be re-adjusted and edited to meat the purpose to boost pvp."
5/31/2009,this is already the case with -5 and below which i think is sufficient.
5/31/2009,this.
5/31/2009,so you propose to delete concord [you could just set anyone negative and attack him]? i think the protection of concord for not wardecced players is vital for high sec (hence the name). regarding outlaws - this is already implemented.
5/31/2009,"congratulations... you win today my friend, your dream is already a reality.already the casealready the case.already the case. although faction navies will attack negative standing players.already the case, although faction navies provide a slight hinderance."
5/31/2009,supporting because the op removes faction navys shooting us in highsec and leaves it to players to enforce anti-piracy.
5/31/2009,also supporting as this removes faction navy aggro ;)
5/31/2009,players are honestly so much more dangerous than faction navies though...
5/31/2009,fine with me.i'd rather have a fight with another player and lose horribly than to be ganked by npc's
5/31/2009,"looking at this again, removing faction navy spawns just for players with negative security statuses would be a good idea. it would allow more pvp to happen in high security space while still keeping the security factor of concord (cause they would still be there). not sure if the op is saying this or not, but i'd like players to be able to aggro other player on the same system security vs player security scale. therefore:-2.2 sec player would be able to be attacked in only 1.0 security systems.-1.9 sec player would not be able to be attacked in any high sec system.-4.7 sec player would be able to be attacked in all high sec systems.-6.2 sec player would obviously also be able to be attacked in all systems.only question would be how do sentry guns act in high security and low security space? also how would aggro mechanics work around sentry guns?i would like this idea as long as it has the little buffer room from 0.0 and -2.0 where players are still immune in high security space"
5/31/2009,see here - new regions reachable at first only through wormholesit would also make wormhole travel more meaningful instead of simply mining and tech 3 production.
5/31/2009,"the only problem with this entire idea are the problem pilots... the 'eve offline' quasi-afk and/or macro fleets who have so much backup or such a pimped ship they can effectively ignore the risk the rats pose.all they will do is all be in the login que at the end of dt and as soon as the system is up they'll utterly glut the agent pool effectively ending the opportunity for more casual players to run missions.if someone is a hard core mission runner (more than x # of missions in a day or whatever) then the agent should just say: ""sorry, we're pretty well caught up here. why don't you go over to x an ask them?"" (and if said person is in a gang with someone that can still use that agent, that pilot gets the message)."
5/31/2009,so you just hate missions and want to nerf them? that seemed about the only other form of rationale you hinted at.
5/31/2009,"life is funny sometimes, if anyone was to play that card i would have thought it might be ankh.i do hate missions. because they are boring to run (yes i did run missions once! i'm two days grinding off level 4's for caldari navy in empire and can run lvl 3's for angels down in curse), riskless and exploitable and damage other professions in eve.the changes in op aren't suggested 'cause i hate missions.i suggest them as i think it will make eve a better game and mission running a better profession or aspect of the game.hell, if sleeper ai and all the changes proposed above were instituted in some form mission running for pirate factions in lowsec would be a source of income for me."
5/31/2009,"a couple of things that spring to mind.i hate relocating. i'm not a min/maxer, i'm not remotely running missions for the best agent available to me at the moment and i don't seem to be in a hub (at least not a big one judging from system population). i just hate the process of moving my ships around that much. if rewards drop to where i'm spending more on ammo than i'm getting from the mission simply because a few other people picked up missions from that agent then the majority of my time will be spent warping from jump gate to jump gate switching my ships around instead of on anything fun or productive. this would also encourage me to forget about exploration since moving my mission ship, ammo, fittings, salvage ship, etc. is bad enough without including in the journey my probe ship, wh ship, random other ship capable of fitting in a plex gate.depending on how low popular agents will go, some care would have to be taken in how available agents and their potential rewards are displayed to players. i'd rather things not go in an excel spreadsheet online direction.i think the static resource faucet nature of missions is intended. if every resource available in game was capped, there would be a population point where production could not possibly keep up and many degrees of unfun in between."
5/31/2009,"lets face it, eve has enough industrialists that realistically production will never be a problem.'capping' mission income in some manner would only see a shift towards other profitable professions that would take up the slack.i don't really think your worries are grounded there.however, i understand that you and perhaps many people don't like moving ships around. but i ask you, would a 4 jump trip somewhere really be so traumatic?with any changes to the status quo there will always be some people that dislike them for changing their game experience- but lets be honest here, would not the changes discussed be of benefit to so many other professions in eve that having to travel 2-4 jumps to a mission is a worthwhile sacrifice?eve is a sandbox so they say. well, in tht case i think game development should strive for equal opportunity and hence profitability and support for professions in eve- not having one trump all the others to their direct detriment and so warp the landscape that vast areas of the game are deserted."
5/31/2009,"i'd support some dynamic scaling of mission rewards/quality* and possibly availability with agent popularity (kind of like how mission rewards scale dynamically with average completion times).that'd make say hubs like motsu devalue pretty rapidly and would disperse people. it could also be applied instead of or alongside the current sec status modifier which would make lowsecs agents even better.and it would also let people continue to mission all day if that was what they wanted to do whilst still having an effect on risk/reward balance which is important from a ""it's a game"" point of view.i don't support a hard cap but i agree with the drift.* and by quality i mean missions can already be broken down into ""oh awesome, i got gone bezerk"" and ""ah p0op, the score"". maybe some scheme for tiering the missions and managing availability of the good ones too."
5/31/2009,"for me, i'd say it would depend. from what you were describing before, i was assuming around 10 jumps, possibly more on average. the 4 jump number would still get a bit old (at least to me) if it worked out to 4 jumps : 1 mission.possibly, but possibly not. the harder isk is to come by, the less risks i'm going to take. less risky behavior would decrease profits for pirates as well as industrialists since i wouldn't be replacing ships/fittings as often. manufacturer profits could also be affected simply by the fact that players as a whole might not be able to afford current prices given the new model. i don't mean to state this as fact, but simply mention it as a possibility.true, but some deviation from the sandbox model is required in the interest of fun. missions currently are a reliable fall back that among other things can be used to fund getting into other aspects of the game. on the topic of balancing by isk - in my experience, wh exploration has trumped everything i have done in game when it comes to profitability.so far as population distribution, it is likely there are also other factors at play (proximity to trade hubs, security status, proximity to low/null sec, etc.)."
5/31/2009,"ideally you wont have to relocate every mission- unless you decide to try and cram yourself into a system already filled with missionrunners.if ccp gets its act together and adds more agents, spread across the factions and across space then finding yourself a system to call home shouldn't be problematic.the system proposed makes it unprofitable to overpopulate a single system and create a missionrunning hub."
5/31/2009,"no offense, but this one was posted a couple of hours before the op (and based on a thread from last year), and would be much more useful, at least for a big subset of the issues presented in the op.granted, the op here does raise a couple of more additional issues, which do have a merit, but the funny thing is, most of the remaining ones could also be addressed by this here, which is a thread from last year."
5/31/2009,"this has been pointed out so many times, with a lot of possible to solutions to push mission running into the same ""rules"" that apply to the rest of eve. too bad you will get flamed to death by the usual suspects for trying again.it doesnt look like ccp dares to look at missions either."
5/31/2009,"it's also important to remember that the number of people feeding the reprocessed loot column is much higher than the number of people feeding the ore one.just as an example, say the number of people gaining and reprocessing loot is 100 to 1 person mining.now say it's discovered that 40% of minerals come from miners and 60% from loot.if you saw the second statement, and not the first - you'd think there was a problem. take both into account and you see that miners still produce more minerals. that's where we are right now. we have the statistics from the second statement, but no statistics on the first."
5/31/2009,that would ruin more minmatar ships than it would fix...
5/31/2009,"just to chime in, i like lowsec, it needs to be made more attratctive.i hereby present you mry, the -10.0 sec alt of mrpirate, i can tell you mry is going to die repeatedly in noob ships (or cheap frigs) at the hand of mrpirate to boost his sec status.bounties, or anything relying on killing someone to give anything can and will be abused so long as people can have alts. think about it...meissa"

5/31/2009,"you submit items via your internal email list or in this thread. there is no minimum support aside from your own judgment, but it has to be discussed for a week before it can be submitted. minor changes are fine, whether they're intended as additional options or as amendments. issues with multiple sub-topics are split if anyone in the meeting asks that they be split, though i suppose you could also split at submission time if you feel the need."

3/24/2009,yarr
3/24/2009,my sentiments exactly.
3/24/2009,no.i like all the crying.
3/24/2009,"so, you're not content with taking all their sov...you'll now go after them for getting a name change. jesus christ...give it a rest"
3/24/2009,"all of their sov wasnt taken which is why everyone is making a big deal, duh.p.s. you spelled your name wrong"
3/24/2009,what a shame ccp.../disband bobr
3/24/2009,"i really can't believe we're still seeing this type of treatment. how is ccp trying to be neutral? you'd think that they would have learned their lesson the last, oh, i don't know, 3 times they were caught in bed with bob. seriously. these events don't affect me directly, but it still bothers me.and actually, i don't think disbanding bobr is enough. i think that all corps in bobr should be disbanded and the corp members shouldn't be allowed to be in a corp/gang/alliance together, ever."
3/24/2009,multiple broken rules...i support this
3/24/2009,"i keep hearing people claim that this has happened before, but i have yet to see an actual example."
3/24/2009,"rules are rules, and everyone must follow them."
3/24/2009,they must lose sov and pay to remake alliance. not just change the name for free. this is sad.
3/24/2009,"like bob is only one, i've petitioned for my alt name to be changed from stupid letters kdkgfjkdjhg to a real name and got it :)and you'd be shocked the favors to certain large carebear corp on reimbursements ah well, the squeaky wheel gets the grease...good thing other corps know how to keep their mouth shut when a small favor comes their way."

3/24/2009,"one law to rule us all, or abolish them all. this is one slippery slope."
3/24/2009,"well then, now you have a previous example next time this happens.it's a name change for the love of bob... does it actually make a difference to you people? is it hurting you in some way?p.s. /me is in no way connected to bob."
3/24/2009,i just don't get it.i don't understand how ccp can keep doing this kind of crap and not think they're doing anything wrong....

3/24/2009,"lol, that's what this is really all about. you guys should be happy bob is here, it takes the microscope off all the other alliances doing things you'd have fits about."
3/24/2009,"so, i am sitting here at work eating lunch and i am telling my co-worker...this food is bland i think it needs some salt.lo and behold i run across this thread full of pl/gs/mm and their alts tears.life just doesn't get any better then this.1st failure being who you are.2nd failure we take our caps back3rd failure your crying about a name.if your scared just say your scared.i tell you. i love my alliance and the people the allies that i fly with.when the alliance got disband and it's assets stolen all i heard over ts was people laughing and the top brass telling everyone sit tight.plz more salt.. my lunch is starting to taste that much better and maybe i'll be able to save some for dinner."
3/24/2009,"sorry i don't believe this for a second. i have a corpmate that was unable to change their name and we are just a regular corp in eve, no strings attached. and if it is true for you, then once again why the breaking of their oh-so-strict policy for some and not others? either way, its a screwup. that is the issue here, enforcing the rules uniformly for all players."
3/24/2009,the rules should apply equally to all not at the whim of some gm who decides to break them for someone.
3/24/2009,hey guys he's right look how much we suck
3/24/2009,"haha, goons failed because you got camped into an npc station for a month.that's some serious spin."
3/24/2009,disband them !
3/24/2009,supporting
3/24/2009,though if you look at the alliance rankings. it still says kenzoku
3/24/2009,"or maybe even let them keep their new name, but change the ticker to .t20."
3/24/2009,oops ignore this post
3/24/2009,that's because the alliance number in the server code hasn't changed.
3/24/2009,shame on ccp
3/24/2009,yes. disband them.
3/24/2009,rules shouldn't be ignored for any alliance. either let every alliance do it or none.
3/24/2009,no more preferential treatments!
3/24/2009,is this the queue for free t2 bpo's?
3/24/2009,cry more it doesnt make you all look pathetic or anything.this is not the first time something like this has happened but because big bad bob you are all afraid of is involved it must be bad.your tears they are delicious
3/24/2009,"you are correct, this is at least the third or fourth time that a ccp employee has unfairly favored bob.edit: there's plenty of pubbies and even bob pets posting in favor of this. it really is an issue that transcends player politics. a developer has to ensure that all of their employees act impartially, period. there's no rational way to argue against that."
3/24/2009,"rename kennie to band of brothers (or bobr to bob)it was underhand what happened to them and if it happened to any other alliance it would be treated as an exploit. everyone needs to get off their high horses and give them the respect they deserve,ccp should be enforcing measures to make sure alliances like bob don't get stung like this again.."
3/24/2009,i've failed to see a single non goon&co+alts post.its pretty funny
3/24/2009,disband them.... or sov 0
3/24/2009,"sure, it's all a grand conspiracy. what could possibly be objectionable to rule changes and favoritism, especially towards eve's least pleasant group of beardos?"
3/24/2009,"also: not an alt. and too new a/o dumb to figure out how to put my corp (tribal liberation) under my name. but looking through this thread, i do see a whole lot of people with corporations that aren't goonswarm. amazing how deep and insidious this goonswarm conspiracy goes."
3/24/2009,it's a shame what is done in the past time for bob.stop it right now ccp!voted for disband that namechange!

3/24/2009,no actually they fail because we got out.good thing you didn't finish school. i would have had to be worried about you.
3/24/2009,no
3/24/2009,was getting out the reloaded part? did anyone bother to explain blanks aren't real bullets?
3/24/2009,no we failed to realize that even after you got out you would still just lose caps and not gain any space. i think if we had known as much we wouldn't have bothered camping you into pr- in the first place.
3/24/2009,ccp is violating our civil rights. someone call martin luther goon.
3/24/2009,no to preferential treatment. yes to consequences.
3/24/2009,"they used kenzoku as an alliance because it gave them a sov advantage day 1. if they don't like that choice, there are ways to change your alliance name through non-developer intervention."
3/24/2009,i support this.
3/24/2009,"actually, you know what? they managed to find a name that sucks even more than random japanese gibberish. and it makes it easier for us to scam using the real bob. i say let 'em keep the name."
3/24/2009,"i have a dream....that all players are treated equally, and the creators of our grand universe follow the rules that they have claimed a desire to enforce on behalf of all of us.that those band of brothers would gain the advantage of real stability through professional therapy.that each and every player can play this wonderful game without fear of favoritism of one group over another in regards to the rules......and thnx for the idea cipher7......hehehe"
3/24/2009,"this issue isn't about new bob name, it's about a change in ccp public policy that they haven't made public.if they are providing alliance name changing services, they need to let everyone know how to do it"
3/24/2009,"just to plaster this up again for the beaver fans:it is not about the name!i mean don't get me wrong, the new name is hilariously bad""reloaded""? somewhere laurence fishburn is taking the blue pill...its about the bending of rules by ccp yet again.why have an ""internal affairs"" department promising oversight and then go bend the rules for the same guysthat prompted the ""internal affairs"" department in the first place? (t20 etc, etc)and please, do not point out gm grimmies smokescreen ""nothing to see here, move along"" post.apparently we are deemed 12 years old. (no i'm not :p)"
3/24/2009,i support this petition. one set of rules for all players. no exceptions.
3/24/2009,shut up
3/24/2009,"i agree that it will be fun trolling them out of this name as well, but the issue here is that ccp bent the rules for these arrogant buttes, which is totally unacceptable. bob knew the rules when they chose to run with kenzoku and keep sov over having sov take a little longer and creating a name that isn't stupid. they should have to live with this choice, or do as everyone else does and have to lose sov to form a new alliance. i'm sure hundreds of players have petitioned to change an alliance name in the history of this game, and this is the first case of it happening. on top of that, it doesn't even follow proper naming convention (25 characters instead of 24, and lowercase letters in the corp ticker)!"
3/24/2009,"i spk for myself, and my view does not reflect my allaince's view in anyway i hereby place my vote to get ridof bob reloaded, 1 rule for all, no bias to one alliance period."
3/24/2009,"aye. man i hate getting lied to all the time by ccp. ccp, you did not have a flexible policy with regard to renaming alliances. ccp, you did consistently make corps and alliances disband and reform to change their names. the game is about 6 years old. we have 6 years of history to see how things worked. ccp, bob/kenny/beaver asked you to cheat. they asked you to do something that you hadnt in the past done for anyone else, nor would do for anyone else. they asked you to cheat for them, and ccp you did it. you, ccp, can blah blah blah rationalize and lie all you want, but thats all it boils down to, plain and simple. i dont care what side of the war a person is on. i dont care if someone wants to be called prince. i dont care if someone wants to be a weirdo and use odd symbols in a name and be referred to as the artist formerly known as prince, its not the name that matters. what matters is that with incidents like this, ccp demonstrates how dishonest, insulting, and unprofessional they are on some issues. this leads to the bigger question which is: if theyre willing to act so poorly in the public eye, what nonsense are they pulling when they know nobody is watching. to those that say out with the conspiracy theories and away with the tinfoil hats, i say, you are dodging the issue. stop. just stop. its all just blah blah blah to me. i, and others who are angry, do not have conspiracy theories and tales of alien abduction and cia planned coups. bob asked ccp to cheat for them. ccp did it. if ccp did that, and other things, on behalf of bob, they arent trustworthy. its plain, its simple, its public, its fact. ccp might get some things right, but they got this and a bunch of other things absolutely wrong."
3/24/2009,"an interesting thing to note is that issue is a public one - as opposed to private one. the subject of discussion is not a character, not a person. it is a pure game entity. therefore, there is no reason to hide any gm action or conversation. all gm action on this matter should be publicly available, because there is no valid reason to keep it hidden.is there a reason to hide this information? let people know"
3/24/2009,"give us the list of criterias that needs to be filled for a wish to change alliance name to be approved. and the timeframe starting at alliance creation within whitch the petition must be filed.if you are going to give silly answeres as in the gm thread atleast have the ****ing balls to back it up with something other then empty words..ive been playing since 06 and every year some silly **** about ccp favouring one entity is brought up and more often then not you can guess who is on the reciving end.. (well, not any more since we don't know what the hell bob wants to call themselves next week)"
3/24/2009,"ccp your community are asking for an explination as to what is going on and why it seems that you are increasingly bias to 1 faction in eve.1st. saying in a pre prepared statment that kenzoku request there name to be change when they formed up there alliance. however the corps known as band of brothers corps, were not even in kenzoku. so your statment gm grimmi is false information. unless you are saying that they asked for a name change 2 months before there alliance was disbanded. making false and unjust decisions against eula when this is what governs ccp is against your own legal documentation. 2nd. this whole issue is mostly with regards to ccp making rules, setting them in motion, making them a legal document. then changing aspects of it to allow an alliance to control ccp decision making. internal affairs seems to think this decision has no bias in this. however your own eula rules commented by people in this thread signed by senior managment at white wolf and ccp game is critisized for controlling in game politics. 3rd. game exploits, dont even try to say that band of brothers were not involved with this. their own leadership has said ""if there is a game mechanic we can use so we get the upper hand, we will!"" seeing large numbers of towers in 1 place setup the same, announcements by ccp of the setups matching these setups used in previously owned space delve.then it comes down to supercapital reimbursement for no reason at all. reimbursement of titans because ""they have lag"". when further released documentation by ccp games has said that lag is not an excuse to replace ships lost in a combat situation. however to reimburse 2 titan class ships to 1 previously mention alliance is getting a little rediclious. so through all of this. i would like to ask some simple questions. is it also fair to assume that a chars in game name of ""sir molle"" is a ccp employee1. who does govern ccp and why are they allowed to interfere with in game mechanics. who completes the audit needed which manages ccp. 2. can we get a statment with a real actual reason as to why ccp games and white wolf felt that a name change of an alliance was critical. then to plz also comment why a name is meant to be ""4-24 chars"" long, however band of brothers reloaded is 25. 3. plz provide a list as to any alliance who has their alliance name changed in the same fashion as this (also quoted in your prepared statment)4. will csa be allowed to have interaction with this decision making. with this thread now reaching 57 pages, which is 1697 posts and alot of posts in favor by the ccp community to not change the name."
3/24/2009,"supported.something like this required attention and voting of the full eve online community. if one name gets changed due to petitions, then everyones names can be changed."
3/24/2009,"this is truely amazing. all your posturing. all your petty demands. you dont get it do you. they do not have to prove or provide you anything. they have n o t h i n g to awnser for. you are not some all powerful agency who can shut them down for non-compliance. there are no laws to bend them to.the only thing they would respond to is loss of revenue. if you really want them to listen....quit.but funny thing is everyone posting thier little thumbs up in this thread and the other 1200 threads wont quit.so keep screaming into the wind. i wonder sometimes where the world would be if more people went to this length and put this much passion into real life issues...just lolpsthe csm is nothing more than a sham, something to make you think you have a real voice....sad really..."
3/24/2009,"i think people keep playing because they enjoy the game. i'm glad they play, because the game would be a lot less fun without other players (even the ones in the alliances we are at war with).however, i think people also want every player, corporation and alliance to obey the same rules."
3/24/2009,"yea, **** you all for demanding clarification on what rules are in place vov"
3/24/2009,oh no... we dont have a spy in the bob holding corp to disband them again... lets flame ccp....
3/24/2009,"not supported, couldnt give a **** what poeple call themselves tbh."
3/24/2009,"law or justice?we all know that the disbanding of bob was done in a way that begs the question of what was intended by ccp policy with regard to the one button option. that sort of thing was not intended to be used in the way it was. we know that.further, the letter of the law...is open to interpretation in its application.and none of you are the judges in this case. you are the public."
3/24/2009,"ccp has done it again, kenny can have whatever name they wish, but they must do it the proper way, leave kenzoku and create a new alliance as bobr no problem herebut renaming an alliance is pure nonsense and against the rules, guess i ll start petitions to change my name cause... well at least i have a valid reason it starts from a and when i began eve i had no idea of what impact will have in fleet fightsdo not disband bobr but change their name back to kenzoku, if they wish they can create a new alliance from scratch as the rest of us peasants"
3/24/2009,"registering disapproval at the manner and method.bad precedent, especially with the precedent regarding sov mechanics."
3/24/2009,"you are complicating simple stuff,disbanding of bob even though i do not agree with the action, was under valid game mechanics, ccp is to say what should be from now on and change the specific mechanism, but what has happened is history and more importantly within the ruleson the other hand renaming an already named alliance is against the rules of ccp not to even mention the character limit. not a game mechanism not even related to button within the game or option of every single eve pilot, you got pumpered again, on the backs of the rest that cannot because we must follow rules that you do not"
3/24/2009,"plainly said, we the community pay the wages of the gm's devs and any other employee working on this game. so we want answers.taxpayers get answers when a political figurehead screw up, this is not much different.ccp we need answers now. please stop avoiding us and trying to dodge a bullet."
3/24/2009,"oh mister high and mighty, whats that make you then? why are you special?"
3/24/2009,"again either you did not fully read my statement, or chose to ignore the point i was making. lets re-clarify:1.) they can change rules or policy in the game without advanced notification or clarification.2.) i was saying the only way to really make them sit up and take notice is a mass cancellation of accounts which in turn would cause a financial statement to the 'powers that be' and would cause serious discussion among the top echelon of executives that govern the policies of the company. what most of you still completely fail to realize is that the only true power you wield is the power that comes from your 15(insert currency here) a month. they know that even if 10% of you who have posted quit, your nothing more then a drop in the bucket, because tbqfh 90%+ of eve's population either doesnt know about the situation or just doesnt really care."
3/24/2009,ccp is too busy sending all of their money to an unknown offshore bank account to respond.watergate: apocrypha.
3/24/2009,"1. yes the goons whine alot. jesus god please stop whinging.2. yes, in this case it is warranted. i am not a goon fanboi. pretty much goons are pathetic.3. can ccp please freaking respond. obviously a lot of people are upset and it does appear to be favoritism.4. my guess is this is just temporary anyway, .bob. are having fun at goons expense and they will reform under a new name eventually since the remaining systems they have dont amount to much. 5. people who think the original bob disbanding shouldnt have been allowed are straight idiots and fanbois. it was legit game mechanics. gtf over it. renaming an alliance without losing sov is not legit game mechanics."
3/24/2009,the same rule of all of us ?hum in the old times for sure but not anymore ... and finaly not fair for the rest of our community except kenzoku/bob/bobr !
3/24/2009,"this is one of the most assinine statements ive read yet. since you want to compare this to polotics, if a polotician screws up yes he must, by law, awnser for his actions or be 1.)removed/voted out of office 2.)arrested/imprissoned based on the sevarity of the actions.this is a company providing a service, a service who's terms can be changed at will by said company, in which you agreed to by clicking the 'accept' button on the liscense agreement.your only true recourse is to quit or deal with it."
3/24/2009,"i don't exactly like my name, can i has get it changed?"
3/24/2009,"actually the ""prestige"" this whole situation brought on the old bob vs goon alliances made this known to the whole community. they even update it in the in game news networks. so people do know, look at how many views and supports this topic got. what made ccp different from the gold digging companies of other games is how well they pay attention to their customers. take away the core players from the game, then it will fall like a house of cards. one rule for all ccp, no favoritism. don't allow yourselves to become like one of those companies."
3/24/2009,"how many fsking bugs and poor mechanics are in this game that every freaking player has to deal withyou spoiled, cheating piece of crapand damn, you had a chance to rename your alliance and you chose that ? phailbuffet"
3/24/2009,this isnt caod
3/24/2009,"rules are rules, can't break them, even if it's your own rules. especially as we all pay equally, and so, have equal rights.bob's want bob back - they start new alliance, and do it the way, everyone's done it before."
3/24/2009,"i'm confused, what happened again? a gm did something to favor bob... really, a gm? so this gm did something epicly horrible? and we're sure it's a gm? so and like it was something game changing and unallowable? what could this supposedly gm have done? change a name? dear god, black is white, up is down, bob are goons. it's a ****ing game. something unintended did happen... remember when those guys bumped people out of a pos with titans. game mechanics were in place to allow it, but zomg, it was so haxorly bad and game changing... it must stop!!! and it did. and players got threatened with bans because of using a game mechanic in an unintended fashion. take 2, an alliance got disbanded in an unintended way. it wasn't closed, it wasn't disbanded... corp after corp got kicked until even the executor corp got kicked... not left... from it's own alliance. now compared to titan bowling to dooms day a few dozen ships, this is a far greater issue when it comes to game mechanics. bob lost most of it's space. 3/4 of 0.0 is down here making sure it stays that way. we've laughed, we've giggled, and all that's really happened in the end is, we got our name back... sorta. guys, outside your door is this big wide expanse called the outside. if you find yourselves really thinking that this is such a huge deal... get your fat asses up, walk outside, and watch the wind blow and the leaves rustle for a few. take a look at that real girl jogging down the street. take a few deep breaths, and then realize that there's far bigger issues in this world than a stupid game name being changed... because ffs, it doesn't affect your life unless you are a cyber tool who can't let it go."
3/24/2009,"tell me about it so, now that ccp are allowing name changes, who do i contact to change mine?"
3/24/2009,"people still don't seem to understand it's not about the name, lol. if a hooker gave your friend a bj and gave you nothing despite you paying, would you be mad? sure. now imagine it happening a second time.itt: learning comprehension died."
3/24/2009,does the csm have a position on this?
3/24/2009,nerds whining about their e-civil rightsnews at 11
3/24/2009,oops... refer to 5 post up please
3/24/2009,"again , which msn contact was it this time?"
3/24/2009,"the mittanni clearly intended to disband your alliance.also this isn't about a simple name change, its about the rules."
3/24/2009,"it is a big deal only because with the name change you kept the sov, you could have done it the proper way as the rest, create a new alliancei agree with you that game mechanics happen to not work as intended and are getting fixed all the time, but thats game mechanins, alliance name change is not a game mechanism, it is pure favorism and that is unacceptable by ccp or any other company that want to see their fixed rate paying customers the same"
3/24/2009,"renaming kenzoku was completely unnecessary, i thought name changes were just for ""offensive"" names and such, not for people deciding hey we want to jump into this alliance to quickly get some sov and then change it to a new name later"
3/24/2009,"again, you're quoting rules of a game... not even a real sport, but a cyber online fun game. and even worse, nobody is affected by this one b/c nobody who want's a name change has a history to back up the logic for their change like bob does. grow up you tool"
3/24/2009,"i'd like an immediate refund of the isk spent when reforming our alliance after it was formed incorrectly the first time please, just for the sake of fairness.let's see if that happens.... disband bobr... if you pronounce the ticker it sounds more like band of bristolians now."
3/24/2009,"firtst of all i corrected what you saidactually it was labeled an exploit, and then suddenly because of your whining it was not labeled an exploit anymore despite no in game methods being there to stop it. then you did it dozens of times a day for a solid month, and then the very day goonswarm launched its first mothership, thereby gaining the capability to do it back to you, the gms suddenly said it was an exploit again and not to do it.no sign of favoritism there really."
3/24/2009,or they could roll back the sov and give us our alliance back... this is the far less of 2 evils... it's not like we didn't suffer initially. talk about wanting to kick a guy while he's down.
3/24/2009,shame on ccp.. one rule for all..
3/24/2009,so even you admit that this was special favouritism ccp only shows to bob.
3/24/2009,"at this point this is a 58 page thread.of course its complicated. the matter is still under investigation by ccp. any changes ccp makes will benefit all of eve. in fact, i could reasonably argue that what ccp has done already has opened up all sorts of possibilities for flexibility in how ccp applies these rules. this game is not static."
3/24/2009,i support this!
3/24/2009,"i like your ""it's just a game"" defense.""it's just a game, get over the fact we're at the center of yet another rule-breaking fit of nepotism, it's not important. it's just a game. go outside. let us sweep this under the carpet with our other shenanigans. nothing to see here!"" and then you see a ccp logo in an open closet making humping motions towards a loud slurping noise."
3/24/2009,the question for me is - would ccp have done this for anyone else? and the answer is obviously no....
3/24/2009,"quoting the rules of a game is wrong? that shows how ignorant you are. ""like bob does"" too bad, ccp shouldnt be choosing favorites over others. a failed alliance is a failed alliance, we can't just bail you out because your too big of a company to fail. /wink wink"
3/24/2009,"mate have they ever rolled back the server?? not even with the pos exploit that happened, and that was a serious problem, i totally get where you are coming from, if you want to be named koukouroukou band of brothers thats a valid request, the mechanics of the game allows you to create any alliance name you want, the function that got bob disolved was a a valid mechanism, right or wrong but it was there, what happened cannot be changed, although ccp must introduce a fix or something because it is really not how disbanding should happen, but you must follow the rules because atm you didn't and that have impact on the rest, you kept sov 3!i for example 2-3 weeks ago i petitioned, to change my alts corp history and delete a corp from the list, that couldn't hurt anybody, yet i got a negative answer stating that characters names and history cannot be changed, iguess the gm was wrong after all. should i petition again? it was pure sentimental value for my alt to just have 1 corp in his history should i be treated differintly?"
3/24/2009,"oh snap, bailout reference. it's on!"
3/24/2009,"while i'm not really a fan of goonswarm, atleast they don't pretend to be some benevolent alliance of loving goody two-shoes and friendly to all like some people assume they should be... they're ****s and that's that...however, this does set a relatively poor precedent once again that ""ccp favors tafkabob"". whether through the action of a rogue gm/dev etc.. (in which this is obviously ""not"" a case of a rogue gm since it was not ""immediately"" rectified"") in which it seems like a sanctioned change specifically for this alliance, with ""less"" of a reason to have their name changed than alliances that accidently made a mistype and have to reform their alliance + fees. kenzoku existed for quite a few months ""before"" the former bob corporations joined into it to start on their sov fest. there was no legitimate petition to be made here, there apparently were no complaints about kenzoku's name until the former bob members joined up at which point they had no standing. they could have easily created a new alliance on the spot with their preferred name costing them an hour of time at most since alliance creation is instantaneous. they did not do this when it was an option because they had supposedly bigger priorities, and now it has turned into a big pr nightmare for ccp because of their actions in helping former bob members. i cannot help but put in my support for this matter as it is an obvious violation of ccp's own ethics to break/bend their rules for a singular or limited entity, regardless of how big or small the slight supposedly was it puts into motion a very slippery slope of events.as a side note.. for those saying (paraphrasing here because quoting every single one of them would use up all my posting space.) ""bob was the first alliance to have this *exploit* (legitimate game mechanic) used on them, so they should be given some leeway"". is a terrible argument for the mere fact that almost the exact same thing happened to maximum yarrage, and if you did any sort of research you would know that."
3/24/2009,please link a post where ccp says that the game mechanic which lead to bob disbanding was unintendedgame mechanic. please link that post or blog and i will go away.
3/24/2009,"yup thats right, i went there."
3/24/2009,"if ccp allowes this to happen for you then ccp is obligated to offer the same service for all eve pilots, character/alliance/corp name changes with just a petition for no apparent reason, if that happens then i have no problem with the status of ken/bobr then i ll vote the name change of yours in a bling"

3/24/2009,"actually, it isn't. alliances before you have had to change their names by abandoning sov. alliances after you likely will as well. you do not deserve special treatment in any way, shape, or form. i pay the same god damned subscription fee you do."
3/24/2009,haha easily said by the alliance that gets whatever it wants.try being a normal player and asking for favors.
3/24/2009,"heh, ccp does it again."
3/24/2009,"i think they are obligated too.for no apparant reason...there may be a reason. whoever called me ""mister"". i am not."
3/24/2009,"agreed, can you plz petition to change my name to start with a letter other than the first and last 10 of the alphabet plz? because when i started eve i had now idea that just a letter will play such a huge role on how fast i am getting primary and blown up in a fleet battle(valid reason heh)edit: can i have your number? i am a mister"
3/24/2009,"dear god ccp, do you not learn from your past mistakes? again we see ccp is willing to bend their own rules for a favored alliance. the gm who did this is at best, allied to the corp formally known as bob and willing to break their own rules. at worst, he is an idiot who did not consider the ramifications of such a contentious change and should not be doing the job he is doing."
3/24/2009,"poor showing ccp, figured you would have learned from the first time around."

3/24/2009,"i like how the bob guys, who clearly throughout this whole affair have held this game more dearly than most men hold their own families, keep telling those angry at their cheating to grow up, get over it, it's just a game, etc. there's an irony in there somewhere.the people you bob members keep saying ""grow up"" to are by and large not part of an omg elite pvp clan, they probably haven't accrued years on this make believe world, and they sure weren't crying online two months ago because their life's work was destroyed. they're probably by and large like me, people who are not directly affected by this at all, but still find themselves annoyed that the game administrators are so clearly favoring a seemingly random group of beardos by habitually changing the rules in their favor."

3/24/2009,"in all the hype over the new mission arc, one thing is sorely lacking: consideration of gallente standing. i have a -5.21 gallente navy standing. i had a drop on a mission, an 'invite' to come and run the mission arc. i was gunned down by the gate guns the second i jumped into gallente space. the 'invite' seeding in caldari must stop. most people running missions in caldari will have negative standings with gallente. all this is doing is getting a lot of caldari pilot's ships blown up.i feel betrayed and lied to. everything i read in blogs and forums and chat nothing was ever mentioned about this. all i want is my hawk back and a public notification to everyone in eve warning them of their standings before they attempt this mission!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

3/24/2009,i'm in support for the mission bit.but the loss of your ship is your own damn fault.check standings next time you fly into an another empires space.
3/24/2009,"i recall the first thing i ever read about arcs stated that they would be across all four empires. if you're at shoot-on-sight standings, you can't do it, and this is fairly well advertised in the information i've seen about epic arcs. now, the arcs are lame in a hundred other ways from all i hear - to my understanding, it's like grinding a l1 agent, except with more flying around and less reward - but -5.21 is your problem, not ccp's."
3/24/2009,"are you referring to that mission where you destroy a single frigate, and you get an item called ""smuggler's warning about sister alitura"" ?the description for that reads:""remember that sisters of eve agent, alitura, who nearly caught our trail? the boss called in some favors and got her reassigned to arnon ix in genesis. the good sister alitura may be resourceful, but she'd need a capsuleer with clearance to all four empires to be any threat, and we know how much the sisters love capsuleers. ""i bolded the relevant bit. doesn't that pretty much tell you that you need good enough standings to do the mission?"
3/24/2009,i brought up the issue long ago.the sheer fact that the epic storyline arc deal is 1 mission. thusly no arc at all. on top of that... people have horrible standings with sisters and/or gallente. where the mission happens.they responded with.. yayayay we will do that soon
3/24/2009,thisa mission that requires people to read.... imagine that!
3/24/2009,this is a good thing.
3/24/2009,"i'd love to see a new forum section, one with a ticker next to it, called ""hide"".a forum section so exclusive, that it would make the forums so much more agreeable to anyone who doesn't really care about why, what, who or when the goons or bob/ken/bobr/whatever had an issue with their bathroom soaps.not to say they only discuss useless issues, or that some things brought up in these discussions aren't valid points, but god damn it, it's turned into something that's worse than a public american election, if it were led by chipmunks and all the votes were counted by who got the most tomato's thrown at them within a given timeframe, while solving a sudoku puzzle.( we all know they couldn't do a sudoku anyway )that's really all i have to say, i don't want to add to the drama, and if you have nothing more to say than bullcrap, then please shut up in here, either you support a new section called ""internal workings"" or ""stationside gossip"" or whichever name they may choose or find to their liking, or you don't.my only motivation to post this is that the alliance discussion boards used to be interesting to read - when like... someone other than the goons or bob had a thread there. ( threads that are majorly more structured and less ""cave-man-esque"" once they hit two pages )quick edit: for those who may have misunderstood, this would be a section for threads about all alliances that have outward drama or babble, not just the two mentioned above."

3/24/2009,i'm sorry the rest of you are so completely uninteresting :(
3/24/2009,sweet... a new quote! (edit: rats... too big for my sig... arg)oh and this + supported (even if it wont happen)
3/24/2009,"if you are referring to the kengokus renaming themselves, it wasnt about alliance drama it was about the rules."
3/24/2009,"that bs about renaming is just the recent news, you really haven't been here enough if you haven't seen the countless annoying and brain-killing threads that pop up regularly.and it's more often goons than bob to be fair, but not like i care, i just would like to see some small inkling of something decently readable for once."
3/24/2009,"it's drama that happens to be about the rules. it's not a nice calm thread of people debating the merits of alliance renaming policy - there are some people doing that, but they're getting drowned out by raging goons, hard-done-by bobs, and flaming alts on both sides. and that's just in the main thread - the ten parody/restatement threads add nothing whatsoever to the discourse except volume, and yet people keep making them. and that's just on the assembly hall!unless something weird happens, this is the last post i'm making on this issue. it's just getting out of hand, and nothing we're discussing is going to help. ccp should explain which of their staff did this and why bob seems to have gotten consideration no other alliance has gotten, and the csm should definitely be involved in the process at some level. but talking in a thread discussing threads parodying threads about the real issue solves nothing. let's stop bumping the ten-thread drama bomb, and get back to discussing the actual issues of the day."
3/24/2009,"im pretty dissapointed in a lot of things about our most recent patch, and im not going to make this a wall of text. graphics:new pos sheilds are ugly as hell. too much to look at/hurts my face. i really liked the old graphic. can a brother get an amen!now all ewar (point/scram/tracking disrupt) looks the same, its flashier and prettier maybe, but again too much to look at. bring the old stuff back pls.sound: the volume gradient relative to the camera and proximity of the ship is much steeper now. kinda sucks if you want to have sound but not be in the face of your ship all the time. please fix.please consider this. leaving some things to the imagination is a good thing. i belive your dev team was going for ""spicing things up"" or something to that effect but to be honest i think a lot of stuff was overdone. if you want to improve graphics, i would do it subtly. why not fix the ""sky"" coloring in starsystems? there has always been that pixelated ugly transition between contrasting colors...and effects? how about making asteroids or stations hard sprites? i.e. they block turret or missiles lol that has always been cheesy.ok im about through, and the reason that i decided to post today is that i have thouroughly enjoyed the game for several years now (thank you ccp and all of the community), but i have seen the development of eve take a turn down a path that i dont like with this most recent patch. this will never be a game for the masses i hope."
3/24/2009,why? just to show your support for the children in the world who have a hard time.
3/24/2009,i'm flipping the main breaker the whole day.hoping for a sunny day as it gets cold here in sweden
3/24/2009,"you seem like you may well have good intentions here, but you picked a bad way of expressing them. this isn't the forum for that sort of thing, unless you're proposing that the csm officially endorse your suggestion of not playing eve to ccp and see if the devs will agree. since that is, rather clearly, not your intent, you may want to move this thread to events & gatherings or maybe eve general, and not the assembly hall."
3/24/2009,you couldn't have picked a worse time to post this... people are going to take this thread the wrong way on so many levels its not even funny.run.. run far and keep running.not supported for reasons i will not get into.
3/24/2009,"no. these kinds of events are stupid and the effort spend 'promoting awareness' could be far better spend making money to give to these underprivileged individuals. i do not see how not playing a game on a particular day will in any way help make their lives better. if you really feel that motivated to help a tiny fraction of the species, then cancel your account and spend the money on charity instead of eve."

3/24/2009,let's let everybody play by the same rules.
3/24/2009,precedent has been set. let the good times roll.also petition to ban puppet masters for being terrible posters.
3/24/2009,notice how the op doesnt actually display the name of his corp nor alliance.oh right it's a nub corp alt. why didnt u post this with your main?
3/24/2009,says the pot calling the kettle black.
3/24/2009,i guess you can only change your alliance name if ccp pilots fly for you. then you can make up whatever rules you want whenever you want.
3/24/2009,"while we're at it, how about ccp stops deleting threads that expose their favoritism?not locking, as per usual. they've been deleted."
3/24/2009,"i'm not defending what ccp did here, but my understanding is that there are more devs who fly for goon than for bobzoku reloaded. it just happens that the sleazeball(or maybe it's the idiot - he did get caught, after all) flew for bob."
3/24/2009,posting in a looser goon alt thread!
3/24/2009,i propose that henceforth any and all threads in assembly hall that have anything to do with in game political bull****... should be deleted..locked..and thrown out of this board.the csm has no business nor does it care to have business with a bunch of damned 5 year olds who have to throw damn fit over every stupid little thing that happens...all of which has utterly nothing to do with the posting of ideas and proposals that help improve the game mechanics and behavior.alliance political power blocs shifting around or changing names has nothing to do with the above.seriously... clean this filth from our boards!

3/24/2009,"little hint: the csm was originally founded in response to the previous examples of corruption and favouritism towards a particular alliance by a handful of people within ccp. if a single person within ccp has started displaying such favouritism towards that particular alliance again, then this forum is exactly where it should be raised."
3/24/2009,"the first thread on the topic was fine - as nevada said, the csm is as much about transparency as it is about game changes. it's the half-dozen followups that are ****ing me off."
3/24/2009,"i agree to this post... this should stay constructive in this forum, and issues should be raised.if one issue is raised, it doesn't need more threads..."
3/24/2009,then file petitions...this hardly is what i call an effective way to get ccp's attention.
3/24/2009,"that thread has the feel of goonswarm harassing the assembly. 500 supports - most of them don't say anything and are within seconds of each other. this screams bull ****.seriously. i could not care less if an alliance is re-named, especially when no proof has been offered that it was ccp, or anything of the kind. and witch hunts always stink of stupidity.and this place was starting to look so nice and clean..."
3/24/2009,"if you rename an alliance you lose sov. bob/kenny/beaver was renamed, with a name longer than the limit, mind you, without losing sov, so this was done by someone at ccp."
3/24/2009,"what dear ignorant fools. this thread is a good poll of who knows what the hell is even going on in this game, and who has spent their lifetime in empire. maybe you asinine dolts haven't noticed, but changing the name of an space holding alliance has rather serious in-game, sovreignty related ramifications. when kenzoku decided they wanted their old name back, they should have had to disband kenzoku, resetting the sovreignty ticker on their precious few remaining bits of space, but thanks to gm friends they still have within ccp, managed to avoid that little bit of awkwardness. this means that the original poster has no idea what even goes outside the warm, cozy blanket provided by concord."
3/24/2009,this poster would have brains enough to know that posting here like an ass would be a waste of time...and that he should spend his time filing petitions directly to ccp.i guess your not that smart are you.
3/24/2009,"supported. also, ban all goonfleet characters from ever posting ever again.--isaac"
3/24/2009,"except your ""proposal"" starts with the accusation that ccp is directly responsible, and therefore why would you bother coming to the assembly hall to draw the attention of the csm, who are beholden to ccp? oh yeah because you're a vacant ****. goons - the most aptly named alliance in the gaming metaverse.no one here who isn't part of goonswarm gives a flying ****. honestly. try a petition storm, stop wasting the assembly's time."
3/24/2009,"i beg to differ. if you cannot see the possible ramifications of people in power showing favortism towards a minor group then i really cant help you. the csm was actually made for situations like those not for your boring ""nerf caldari"" petitions. in case you havent noticed many empire dwellers such as myself are apalled at the idea of game mechanics being tweaked at my own expense. as was explained there is a hefty price too pay for your name change and the beavers have circumvinted that. nothing is perfect but that doesnt stop anyone to strive for perfection and balanced gameplay is as close as we are going to get. hope that helps."
3/24/2009,"the csm isn't beholden to ccp, it's beholden to the players who vote those people in to their positions. do you even know how a democratic system works?you're right, we have absolutely no proof ccp was involved. except that the name was changed without kenny losing sov, the name is longer than the allowed limit, and the alliance has exactly the same alliance id as kenzoku. other than, you are correct, we have zero reason to believe ccp was involved.maybe some of you should go study what the csm was formed for. here's a hint: it was formed so players could oversee ccp specifically because of situations like this. go read the ny times article about t20 and band of brothers and educate yourselves."
3/24/2009,except for the fact you arrogant pricks obviously forgot that the csm can say all they want... ccp can choose to ignore them.so skip the middle man and make a petition storm.stfu and leave the assembly hall alone and cut the political bull out.
3/24/2009,"i'm sorry that people using the csm for it's intended purpose, upsetting the balance of your precious assembly hall, upsets you so much. you should really relax about it, you're going to hurt yourself."
3/24/2009,we wouldent have to make a stink if ccp followed the goddamn rules. its a dman shame that we players left to police ccp.
3/24/2009,i propose that henceforth any and all threads in assembly hall that are written by the op... should be deleted..locked..and thrown out of this board.this board has no business nor does it care to have business with a terrible poster who has to throw a damn fit over every stupid little thing that happens...all of which has utterly nothing to do with the posting of ideas and proposals that help improve the game mechanics and behavior.whining about threads involving alliance political power blocs shifting around or changing names has nothing to do with the above.seriously... clean this filth from our boards!
3/24/2009,"go back to your hole for now. once this more serious issue is dealt with then you can get back to ""boost ravenn- my raven missllez dont work to good in missions"" posts.also ps, csm is not for proposing ideas. actually that would be the ""features and ideas discussion"". so your attempts at pleading to ccp have all gone unheard for off topic posting in here."
3/24/2009,this is exactly the type of issue the csms should deal with
3/24/2009,remove threads because you don't agree with them. yessiree.<sarcastic thumbs up>
3/24/2009,"actually, that's wrong. the article in nyt is nowhere near right about what the csm is. i suggest that you read the csm paper about what the csm really is."
3/24/2009,"it's a petition thread, and goonswarm is rather known for having a lot of warm bodies, most of whom are capable of following a link and clicking a checkbox. doubly so when you consider that it's getting a lot of support from other bob(bobr? kz? t20?) enemies. the fact that the petition is growing quickly should be no surprise to anyone. it's not malfeasance, it's outrage among an easily-mobilized base."
3/24/2009,"the disgusting thing here is that there are pubbies dumb enough to think that since goons say something they should be against it.drake you're the reason why tafkab was able to get away with their ill-gotten bpos, with their illegitimate motherships, with directors running their capfleets and giving them inside knowledge into pos mechanics. pubbies like you were too busy lining up hoping to join their ranks and cheering them on to realize that when ccp commits acts that destroy the integrity of the game it destroys any magic it has.that ccp still hasn't learned their lesson despite all of this is truely sad. with the current upheaval in 0.0 and the next expansion out, eve should be getting a lot of good press on how exciting the game can be. instead, because they refuse to stop playing favorites with their pet alliance the gaming media is going to go through another cycle of how the company is corrupt, and all of these prior acts are going to be rehashed and ccp's name is going to be deservedly dragged through the mud again.but keep on raging against goonswarm, it just shows how ignorant you are."
3/24/2009,"its a good thing i didnt have to read the op to understand that youre an idiot. you should stop posting this worthless crap here and go back to cnp or some other part not looked at, if you refuse to stop posting that is."
3/24/2009,this has nothing to do with goonswarm you jackass.read the damn post.... oh wait... your too busy clicking a link and following the mob.but since everyone is actually responding to me i guess i struck a nerve.keep it coming.... your responding is actually making you look worse!keep on beating that war drum and wasting your time here!why listen to me.... if i'm such a pathetic troll... why give me the attention?
3/24/2009,it's a good thing i don't listen to alts.
3/24/2009,"please post a link to where you supported this thread and not how you read it and instantly posted this one. we'll wait all night if you're having problems finding your post.but seriously though, go whine about t2 cruises in ship and modules or whatever it is that you do and leave this forum for what it was originally designed for, a place for players to hold ccp accountable for its actions."
3/24/2009,a bloo bloo! a bloo bloo bloo!
3/24/2009,i fully support that position!
3/24/2009,"to the op, try to imagine for a second that this is nothing to do with goons or the-alliance-formerly-known-as-kenzoku-formerly-known-as-bob. i should also point out that i am nothing to do with either alliance or their allies.since the dawn of the alliance mechanic, the naming policy has been the same as corporations and characters. afaik, no name changes have ever been allowed, and petitions have been ignored because those were the rules. the reasons are pretty obvious, constant name changing could be exploited. as a result, if you want to rename something you start again. that means, new n00b character, disband/reform corporation or disband/reform alliance.the latter, as has been pointed out many times on these forums now, has several nasty consequences for the alliance being ""renamed"". there's the isk cost of setting up an alliance, and the loss of sov in any systems the former alliance held. that bob""r"" has effectively circumvented a system that is in place for all other eve inhabitants is annoying. it's rather like me wanting to form a 0.0 alliance and being given several systems with sov 3 ""for free"".so far, arguments for the change have revolved around, ""i don't like what goon did to bob, so it's justified to allow the name change,"" or, ""goonies annoy me, so their tears are justified."" i find these arguments wanting for two reasons:1) goons' disbanding of bob was done using in-game mechanics and rules (technically, it was bob who disbanded themselves via a rogue director). the fact that the rules allow for such a dramatic take down is not the fault of those who use them to that end.2) lack of objectivity means that we can't ever be sure we're on a level playing field. if rules can be circumvented on a whim, then what's to say it won't be your alliance/corp/char whatever that's on the receiving end when an enemy of yours gets an unwarranted boost? this is the reason people should keep a very close eye on stuff like this."
3/24/2009,wrong. ccp has changed names if people capitalized a name wrongly or something like that.
3/24/2009,"who? i've seen a lot of posts from people complaining that tweaks like that weren't granted when they petitioned. furthermore, is bobr a recapitalisation of ""kenzoku""? i seriously doubt that i would be allowed to change my char name in such a way."
3/24/2009,"from another forum:""stian empire was created. someone noticed the typo, told ccp. ccp told them to disband the alliance (and getting no refund from the 1b isk needed to create it), recreate the alliance (and once again pay 1b isk to create it) and make sure to spell the name correctly.black 0ut was created. someone realized how dumb this was, and so they asked ccp to change it to black out. ccp told them no, and that they'd have to disband the alliance (and get no refund from the 1b isk needed to create it), recreate the alliance (and once again pay 1b isk to create it) and make sure to spell the name the way they wanted to.against all authorities had a slight mishap where someone didn't pay the maintenance build. they lost all their sovereignty, had to recreate the alliance, and had to once again front the 1b isk fee. ccp did not reimburse any of that.corps from a defunct alliance known as band of brothers join an alliance called kenzoku. they ""fight"" under the name kenzoku for over a month and a half. they then ask ccp to change their name to band of brothers reloaded and ccp does so, without making them disband the alliance or pay a 1b isk fee.""edit: also stain allaince- and initiative associates were told that they weren't special enough to get their names changed"
3/24/2009,"backing up the above post, our alliance also disbanded once due a forgotten alliance bill and we had to recreate our alliance for the 1 bil fee. if they now suddenly give bob special rights then i want a 1 bil reimbursement for our alliance.back on the op post, 1 topic should have been enough the others should have been closed or moved to coad by a mod."
3/24/2009,sigh in game in forum harassment is also banable :( did you think about that.
3/24/2009,"looks like the oposition is having a little trouble coming up with reasons to keep going.ironic aint it.look... i don't deny that something obviously went wrong...but spraying all that crap all over assembly hall like a bunch of damned kids foaming at the mouth is not only immature but practically degrading to whom they represent.every bloody day i see ""goons are bad"" and ""bob is (was) bad"".you know what... i'm starting to agree with them.... all i see day in and day out is spamming... ego trips.... stupidity.... snobbery.... you guys cant even keep it real let alone serious... your just a damn mob that changes its tune every 5 seconds.you can't even hold an argument without pulling bs out of your asses.ive said it once and i'll say it again... you wan't to complaint? petition it.i'm sorry... you will get nothing from csm.... zero... zilch...nada.all they will do is have a discussion and if ccp says no... its no.waste of bloody time.... and then you'll make a bloody damn fool of yourself in posting in a ridiculously stupidly long thread that is obviously ignored.like ghost training... and nerfing missiles.... all your doing is making yourselves to be the biggest damned idiots that ever graced the forums...all for naught.so stop wasting our time and actually do something about it.make petitions or quit the frakking game....theres no other way to get ccp's attention more effectively."
3/24/2009,"hear hear, drake. agree 100%."
3/24/2009,what rules?
3/24/2009,"you guys truly make me laugh. this is ccp's game. it is not your game. it has never been your game. it is ccp's game. if ccp decided that bob was allowed a name change, then ok, they get it. but this is so ridiculous. your all having a hissy fit about a damn name. get over it. it won't affect the change of the war between goons. this is favoritism in the least possible way. its a stupid name change. bob didn't win its wars because ccp helped them. if they had, bob wouldn't be at its death door by goonswarm. in fact, ccp (if they truly favored bob) would have given their territory back. free of charge. but they didn't. they changed a name. big freaking deal.get over it. i wouldn't give a dang if i were in goons or bob. so a gm decided to get involved in the game. you all cry about gms not being more in the game and then, then, when they do something, you all pull a hernia crying about it. end of story and end of thread.--isaac"
3/24/2009,this.yes i admit that its a contradiction of policy... but its just a f'ing name change people.there wheren't given anything of value other than a damn name change.get over yourselves.it would be different if it was something more significant.in all honesty i would think it would be appropriate for ccp to grant a valid name change request like a mis-spelling or a name that is free of anything inapropriate.but all this screaming over a name change?you people need to get a life. wrong or right... i can think of worse things to scream over.
3/24/2009,"people don't care about the bobr name, what people care about is that they were allowed to change it without going through the usual route of disbanding their alliance, losing sov3 in their remaining systems and paying 1 billion isk to create a new alliance with their preferred name. there are many examples in all these ""whine threads"" where alliances were refused permission to change their name, and were told to go through the process i mentioned previously.as a result, the alliance-formerly-known-as-kenzoku-formerly-known-as-bob has effectively been given 1 billion isk and sov 3 status in multiple systems. i'm sure the other alliances who never had that priviledge are very happy at this so-called fair treatment.so far the arguments against have been of the ""goons hax0r3d bob so deserve what they get"" or ""it's only a name"", thus demonstrating point-missing of epic proportions."
3/24/2009,then make a damn petition and stop clogging up the boards.i don't have a problem with the complaint... i have a problem with the jackasses that scream in spite of the fact they could have filed a petition and left it at that.
3/24/2009,"it's not just about a name change...it's also about:1) mechanics abuse. usually, an alliance that changes its name loses all sov and must pay 1 billion isk to reorganize. that's a lot of money, whether you're involved in corporations or not.2) the larger issue of fairness. frankly, all players should want to have the assurance that they're playing in a game that isn't crooked.you guys on both sides keep making this a ""carebear vs. alliance ***"" issue, but it's actually something all players should be worried about."
3/24/2009,"snipped someimho:you will never have certainty that the game isn't rigged. human beings are (in large enough numbers) going to have a few who break the rules. that is a certainty. asking for a large corporation (ccp) to be 100% honest, 100% of the time, is naive (again, imho). you want to really get ccp's attention, you will cancel your account - en mass. complaining on the boards will probably (imho) accomplish nothing.getting 2500 people to cancel accounts, even temporarily, will make them sit up and take notice. if you can get an entire (unnamed) 0.0 alliance to cancel for one day - that would get the accountants and administrators on the case of the gm's/developers to fix this now!otherwise, welcome to gm/devs eve-online... and don't be surprised when it goes to ppoop!no, i have no affiliation with any 0.0 entity, yes, this is my main, no i don't work for ccp... ________________"
3/24/2009,"no this is a goons vs the assembly issue. ever since this issue has been raised, all of a sudden a rash of bs. threads. have. popped. up. all. over. the. board., forcing several good ideas down out of sight.(and the ones i'm linking to are only a sample. some have moved down through the pages, and some have been locked.)i'm all for correcting errors, but overwhelming the system with aggressive overbearing whining is more than a little irritating to those of us who use this board regularly to push game changes."
3/24/2009,this.op is an idiot.
3/24/2009,it seems to be ****ing the goons off. and that is all good in my book.
3/24/2009,"am i detecting trace amounts of irony? after all, your remedy for this rash of threads which so aggravates you is the ""report"" link. for some reason though, you have decided to create a thread of your own to expound on your ideas. i read it and was unable to find any of the following:it's ok though. despite what many people say, the assembly hall is for seeking attention as much as for suggesting changes to game mechanics. don't be a self-hating attention junkie."
3/24/2009,completely unsupported. csm is about taking issues to ccp. not just bugs or such.
3/24/2009,an issue is an issue. as long as the proposed idea of the thread is suggesting changing the game in a way ccp could implement.
3/24/2009,also... isnt this thread in of itself ironic because it's whining about such things? doing exactly what you dont want to happen in the beginning?
3/24/2009,i dont understand why people hate goons so much.they have been highly good for the game. newbie training vids accessible by everyone.etc etc. goons/bob/anyone should full well have access to post their issues in the game. even if you disagree or something.
3/24/2009,good thing i don't listen to *******s who post with alt's and has a serious lack of intelligence about himself.
3/24/2009,the only irony here is you proving my point with your foolish attempts at diverting attention from the problem.how many threads have i actually started in assembly hall?that's what i thought.i rest my case.
3/24/2009,your an idiot for misidentifying the csm as being ccp itself or having any power over said action.as i have said time and time again.... ccp can choose to ignore anything the csm says.get it through your frakking thick skull. it will hurt less.
3/24/2009,"this has nothing to do with me hating goons other than the obvious lack of brainpower emanating form there end of the galaxy.my problem is this mob mentality crap is bull**** and needs to stop making a mess of the boards.it is one thing to post a protest in a singular thread.it is an another to start proposing stupid assed proposals in disbanding each other and compounding that fact with more stupidity.top that off with over half of the individuals participating in this are not even supporting but doing so ""illegitimately"" by playing a sarcastic attitude game which makes the whole point of giving support pointless and insulting."
3/24/2009,post with your main idiot.
3/24/2009,"you're one to talk when it comes to insulting. the fact is that your thread differs only by a matter of degree from this ""problem"" you so have done such an amusing job of exaggerating. name me one occurrence in this thread of:furthermore, why didn't you just report the offending threads and move on? not that i object to this thread. far from it, in fact. i'm just trying to gain an insight into the reasoning that reached the end conclusion that this thread would be any different than what it rants so vehemently against.the fact that you've never done it before is irrelevant. every attention junkie has their entrance."
3/24/2009,"here's the thing: you're 100% right that there should have, at most, been one single thread. the fact some people are overzealous does not negate the issue, and is why there is a moderation team (or mitnal, who is a masochist, but a team unto himself). this is hardly the first time multiple threads with the same content have been made, nor will it be the last.the reason people are saying you are making it a goon issue is probably because you are being extremely rage-ish. it would be one thing if you could link me to all your other posts where you heavily berated people for making a thread similar to ones already in existence- maybe you have? i don't know, nor would anybody else just happening across your posts.the point is this: it is a valid issue that has more ramifications than the issue itself.what i mean:there is the issue of the event - that the alliance name was changed without penalty and against the rules set forth and enforced in the past, regardless of your belief that a company can break its own eula but hold their audience culpable to it. this event is of course the event in question, and is the main focal point. it has, assuredly, been petitioned many times already. this event's consequences need to be directed at those that abused the system - that would be the alliance.but there is the other event, which may sound very similar - that an alliance name was changed without penalty and against the rules set forth and enforced in the past, etc. this event is directed at ccp itself, not the alliance. it just so happens that the two events are identical in nature, and so when posting about it, they are going to, by default, be intertwined. the consequences of this event need to be directed at ccp.both events are the same, but uniquely different."
3/24/2009,"finally... someone who uses there head before they speak.a: i don't believe its ok for a company to violate its own eula... that's just flat wrong. now whether that this particular area is covered or not depends entirely on the eula and ccp's judgement call.however... a name change is not exactly earth shattering... if the compromised in favor of one then they should give favor to others.b: the whole point of my yelling/ranting/raving at not just goons but every damn idiot who has to stand on there little soap boxes is they think petitioning the csm for answers is the answer... is flat stupid.i support the csm in there efforts of representation.... but somehow i strongly disagree that they are going to amount to a hill of beans on this particular issue.your trying to get ccp's attention... then why the hell mess with the middle man?surely you people are capable of speaking for your bloody selves!c: i am a troll... one with brains and many years of experience in the world of gaming (eve being one of many) i have issues in being nice as every time i turn around some idiot shows up and posts without using his damn brain and expects results only to get blasted by myself or any one of a few ""legitimate"" trolls around that actually give a damn about this game.im am neither pirate...carebear... or 0.0 based.i'm none of the above.... because this game can't be one of any kind.... it must be all kinds.i undersatnd the underlying balance necessities of the game and i will be first to admit i am no expert on any particular area but alot of it is just plain common sense.yes.... someone at ccp likely frakked up.but turning the assembly hall into a damn circus is not what i call a smart move...no one will ever treat a goon seriously let alone with any credability becuase you keep pushing these things:1: your bigger than everyone else2: you don't give a #### about what everyone else thinks because your bigger than everyone else3: you never treat anything with seriousness because you can afford to take a hit without flinching4: you can call in 100's of people to do the same ting without recourse"
3/24/2009,5: and to top it off... you people refuse to listen let alone give any quater because your bigger than everyone else.goonswarm has the power of intimidation... you can afford to have stupid people flying all over the place...and it wont take a many to achieve that.bob is guilty of the same thing.you guys scream the most... you trash the place the most... you spam the most... you scam the most.everyone has it out for you guys.and yet you expect to be heard...and treated just like everyone else?just stop and think about that for a moment.oh sure you can pull up my posts and point out all the stuff i've said.but i pale in comparsion to the toltality of what your alliance has said/stated/done in the history of this game.i try my damndest to remember that not all goons/bobs are alike..and there are a few who are actually decent people.. like you.but its getting just a bit hard to wipe the crap off my boot every time i step into these forsaken dump of a forum board thats getting overran with this insanity.so forgive me for being a little terse if not blunt.i appreciate the fact you respect my position... i respect yours as well.so do something about it... and try the direct approach... and leave the assembly hall out of this mess.

3/24/2009,".for the record - i love this game. i've paid 1-2 accts since late 2005 and play it 20-60 hrs/wk.a) i don't blame kenny-bob.r for their petition, i blame ccp for being their pet.b) i have resolved to try and accept ccp is dead-set on ways that will keep eve niche.like:1) one old server dominated by uber advance chars, corps, and favored friends.2) clumsy menus and game mechs; from a noob trying to setup overview filters to a vet playing 'try and grab the probe arrows' ... half your battle in eve continues to be with the interface.3) apocrypha is a great expansion getting kicked in the crotch by lag. it is bad enough 1000's of retail boxers will shake their heads at eve being so complex, clumsy, text intensive, logistics slow and death costly compared to that '500 lb. gorilla' mmo ... but that it then lags ?!? they quit.4 5 6 ...) no time or use ranting. ccp is locking threads that spread any sniff or spillage of their toxic favorism. edit - btw:i love eve being complex, text intensive, logistics slow and death costly compared to that other mmo, but not clumsy. i beaten most the interface battles but the new probing needs work, including a single button to scale probe range 2x or 1/2"

3/24/2009,did you jump the titan right on top of those ships?

3/24/2009,"i have an alt id really like to sell, but i'll be ****ed if its this that makes me get a credit card =0there's no reason we shouldn't be able to pay for character transfers the same way we can pay for the rest of eve."
3/24/2009,"yes, i realize people have needs for escapes. however, to be frank, i still don't see the need of this feature. priorities.--isaac"
3/24/2009,i think the reason a credit card is needed is to prove the seller is the owner of the account. it's also the reason why the seller always has to pay the fee. using plex's removes that safeguard.
3/24/2009,"supported, please if u cant use a plex, make a similar npc trade good thingy to a plex that deals with transfer."

3/24/2009,"removing the 1 billion isk from them is just us expecting ccp to treat them exactly like they would treat any other alliance wanting a rename. in the long run it won't make much difference.however as they now hold some sov 3 systems, the sov reset will hurt them a lot more as they will lose their cyno jammers again."

3/24/2009,"i happen to like the new look for the minmatar ships, myself. the orange lighting details and intricate non-sprite frameworks and scafolds stunned me so much that i spent five minutes switching between my ships seeing how cool they looked now. if anything, they look better, and even a bit sturdier (i can now believe my tempest will not pull an enterprise-d on me every time the armor takes a cruise missle, with that second support and all)."
3/24/2009,"for the most part, i like the premium client (especially with how they fixed the scythe/scimitar, which imo previously challenged the moa for the ugliest ship in the game on classic). i like the classic mastodon/mammoth a little more than the new, but only marginally. in general, i'd prefer to keep the new look minnie's have in premium."
3/24/2009,considering i play with a friend whos been playing this for years (hes the one teaching me) and he saw me buy the ship and have it not appear in my inventory its not something im making up this is something im sure others are experiencing as well even if they dont post about it and part of my problem is that my ingame petitions arent getting answered even a week later so it occurs to me that it is a pretty big issue am i just supposed to not bring it up? not supposed to talk about an issue im having like it doesnt exist when it stops me from playing the game... if your not posting something helpful to somebodies problems your part of said problem cause your just causing aggrivation whats the point of saying anything at all? just cause you can? in which case why shouldnt i...

3/24/2009,"i am a 31 year old humanities student living in the uk. i've been active in eve for nearly four years now and have some experience in many areas of eve. whilst not professing to be an expert in any one area i believe my wide experience will help to serve the general population of eve and bring what they want to the attention of ccp. at all times i try and maintain a neutral stance and believe the subject areas i study help me to achieve this whilst still being passionate about the game. i have applied for candidacy on the csm as i feel, if elected, i have the time and enthusiasm to make a difference alongside whomsoever else gets voted into the csm. i would like to give others the chance to be as enthralled by this game as i have been and still am. whilst trying to maintain an open mind i do have some areas in which i have a strong opinion in. these are small gang/solo pvp which i think has mostly been overlooked for some time now by the developers. i would like to see some effort being directed to non-sovereign infrastructure solutions such as mobile refineries, mobile research and mobile production facilities beyond what is available now. with the advent of wormhole space i think the need for this is greater than ever before. lastly, as you can expect from my corp ticker, i am interested in the backstory of eve and player interaction with it. i would like to see more development done that tie in the standard day to day actives of your average eve player with the vast scope of prime fiction that ccp has at its disposal. this includes ideas such as widening the scope of the newly introduced epic mission arcs to include pirate and sub factions as well as simply providing more information ingame available to anyone who is interested in where they live, what they do and how these things came about. i am interested in the availability of background information as an in game asset rather than pushing this on people as i know full well many people enjoy this game without immersing themselves in the storylines and instead writing their own story for themselves. if you have any question please feel free to contact me ingame or on here and i will do my best to answer you as promptly as possible."

3/24/2009,"aight dawg dig it, whats somethin what eve got lots of?bad dawg who shot a dawg.i been in eve a year like an dawg i seen it all, dawg i done it all. i see dawgs shottin a dawg, i see mad drons wreck, i see lot of re-re posse wreck. dawg, dig it, eve is good but like detroit.eve side has a cancer. the cancer is crime. it must be cut out before we employ the million recycliers to breathe life back into eve. eve is have made the economy ideal for recyclien an recovery growth. but community services, in this case law enforcement have suffered.a dawg say it's time a dawg give something back. take a close look at the track record of re-re posse. you'll see that we've gambled in markets usually regardedas nonprofit.recycling. recovery. silence tax.i say, good business is where you find it.as a dawg may kno , re-re posse now got a contract to run local tax enforcement.but at recycling and recovery we believe an efficient recycling and recovery posse force only part of a solution.no, we need something more.we need a 23-hour-a-day recycling and recoverer posse.a re-re who eat an sleep recyclin'eve dawgs, a pleasure of a dawg to introduce you to the future of eve presedental office.kuzim 2009!best way a dawg say it is from robocop movie, so a dawg lifted from robocop an change some words. change dawgs beleve in dig."
3/24/2009,"no, this party would be focused on protecting their desired experience. that goes without saying. just as every faction and special interest would be driving their own agendas. the reason i started this thread was to determine the degree of interest and support the segment i sought to represent had in the idea of a formal party to be their voice. given what so far looks like a record amount of apathy towards the csm iii elections in general and the idea of a party i may have gotten my answer.issler"
3/24/2009,"to summarise briefly, you whined about being war-decced by goonswarm after being elected, pathetic. to follow on from that, you seem to have no idea what you're talking about. in short, you're a poor csm who probably only got in by block vote from your alliance."
3/24/2009,"i suggested that the war dec appeared to be an attempt to interfere with the csm process. in the end it was just random gooness. we never tried to dodge the war and i never suggested any change in eve as a result of the war.your ""you don't know what you are talking about"" without citation is about as valid as me saying i think you are basement dwelling loser virgin who has a mother that dresses you funny and has unnatural relations with genetically enhanced livestock. it is nothing but a pointless personal insult (and honestly, like the comment i just made about you, not a very good personal insult). your insult adds no value to the conversation.try adding some actual ""facts"" to your attack next time please. or better yet, run for csm and show us just how 1337, genius like and uber you are. please i can't see how eve can survive without you in the csm!issler"
3/24/2009,"nexus the entire csm waz worthlezz thiz time from my point of view. again issler you failed to conzider even raizing the war dec limitz for small corporationz by one, continuing to support your big coalition friendz on the council. plz don't run for csm again issler."
3/24/2009,"why on earth would i have supported that since that certainly isn't something the folks i try to represent would want? do you have any idea what a constituency is? err maybe if i said i had a constiuanz?my ""big"" coalition of ""friends"" on the council?? yeah, got me there, most of my friends are people i don't know and have never met.... (until months after my election). do you really think we are some sort of unified group? do you read the meeting minutes?sorry i won't have your endorsement ""stuff"". you truly are the master of the ""z"" key.issler"
3/25/2009,1
3/25/2009,its true. the old capital jump effects were way better.the new one just sucks. to be honest i think they didnt put any effort into it and just rushed for expansion.
3/25/2009,signed
3/25/2009,"almost all effects has waves type =/ jumps, sensor booster etc. old style jumps was more ""interesting"" and a bit more epic or so"
3/25/2009,im agree
3/25/2009,"i agree, current jump effects are just to plaina stargate simply uses an allready existing wormhole to jump a ship through, jumpdrives wreck a hole on the fabric of space (as in, create a new wormhole) this demands a more epic fx"
3/25/2009,i also agree that the new graphic for a capital jumping in and out from point a to point b is very dull and doesn't impress even new players that want a capital. i love the graphic myself and especially with a titan jumping to destination system can give a chilling effect to a doomsday imminent on a hostile force on the other end with the cyno or the jump bridging of bs and support ships to the destination.
3/25/2009,do something about it... it is ugly now.
3/25/2009,"even as i write this it feels absurd to say so, but the old effect when a ton of caps or fleet jumped/bridged in was ""whoooohoooo here we go"".don't get that feeling now and that's a bit of a shame.give back the irrationality of real life adrenaline on seeing a special effect.zos"
3/25/2009,/signed
3/25/2009,+1! return it!
3/25/2009,"i agree, return it plz"
3/25/2009,"/signed, hell, with the new capital jump effects i didn't even notice a titan jumping in."
3/25/2009,for the love of god signed!!!!!!
3/25/2009,support this thread
3/25/2009,"i too, am supporting this topic"
3/25/2009,/agree with op. go out with a flash!
3/25/2009,/signed gimme my bright lights back!
3/25/2009,supporting thread.....huh!
3/25/2009,"this season, i will mostly be supporting this thread."
3/25/2009,"agreed. but the faction stuff should req the same skills as t2, and the officer modules should require the max skills of t2 (for a launcher officer, it should req the specialized skill at lvl 5.the better the mods/ships the higher the skill req should be.but the t2 ammo shouldn't have the nerfs reduced, just their dmg boosted( big penalty, and big bonus too use)"
3/25/2009,"i'm not a minnie pilot, and i don't know any minnie pilots who use barrage, but i acknowledge that it likely has some utility sometimes. thing is, look at what ship would generally use it. when i think of a ship that wants long falloff on its acs, i think of a vagabond or something similar, that likes fighting in the 15-20 km range, to put a point on the enemy and stay out of web/scram range. those ships are naturally speed-fit, to be able to hold the range against slower enemies. how well does a fast-orbiting ship do when you nerf its tracking? people who fight in falloff tend to need their tracking quite a lot. actually, it was strill who said the line you quoted, and me who made about the same points you just did. thing is, i acknowledge that a handful of slight advantages do not offset the stonking big disadvantages void has except in some incredibly niche situations. it's not good as a whole, even if some aspects of it are. and since you can't fire half a shot, that means that void is bad. sure, if you know exactly how the combat is going to play out, maybe it's better, but the thing about combat is that you don't - battle plans go out the window at first contact with the enemy, and all that. also, who trains weapon spec skills to 5? that's just crazy."
3/25/2009,"supported, dispite the arguing."
3/25/2009,remove all t2 bpo's from game
3/25/2009,support.
3/25/2009,i've seen no finer proposal in here. :p
3/25/2009,mmm hisec veldatar should be epic. i hope they dont mine too much or the hulk pilots will cry
3/25/2009,"well in some way i am strongly against caps in highsec, since it is not allowed by concord and thereby not the mechanics.but well it is chribba so what the heck, i support it.^^"
3/25/2009,"somehow i think chirbba is being sarcastic... u know, about the bobr thingy..thumbs up anyway"
3/25/2009,.
3/25/2009,"yes, of course."
3/25/2009,i agree that it would be nice to be able to see a titan up close.
3/25/2009,supported.but think of the veldspar! have you no mercy?
3/25/2009,qft! let the glory that is the valdatar be displayed for all to see!
3/25/2009,"absolutely.and, while they're at it, modify the veldtar's ddd so it instastrips a whole belt."
3/25/2009,quoted for the truth of it
3/25/2009,"(yorda is forum banned for another few weeks :( )after flying the nidhoggur for over a year now and discovering just how awesome triage is (it is really sexy) i'm pretty happy with the nidhoggur. the nag on the other hand has no redeeming features and is a worthless pile of ****. i'm fully speced for it and refuse to buy one as it's a complete waste of money. it needs something other than it's insanely long training time. if i could change one thing about training on yorda i would of trained for the rev instead of the nag, been done training sooner, have a good dread, and probably be able to fly amazing amarr battleships by now.motherships are a whole separate issue, i never leave my carrier and have plenty of alts so that i rarely need to dock but yet i'd still never buy a mothership. it's just not worth putting a giant bullseye over your head and not be able to hotdrop or triage. i'd rather lose a few handfuls of carriers."
3/25/2009,edit: stupid eve-o
3/25/2009,any news if ccp are gonna pull their thumbs out their arse and fix the damn nag?
3/25/2009,"i never understood why they made missile batteries that way in the first place. if keeping them online while they have a cpu use isn't technically doable (it most likely is, sounds more like a question of effort) the simple fix is to make them take no cpu and decrease caldari tower total cpu. that would make them less useful as high sec lab platforms and useable in low/no sec. the first solution is preferable, but either way something has to change."
3/25/2009,"even though the emoragers are flooding the assembly hall with bullcrap posts about alliance renaming (go back to caod, whiners) and pushing legitimate issues to the bottom, i think this still merits attention.once again, what exactly does it take to get a csm to even acknowledge this exists?"
3/25/2009,"i would like this really, would eliminate some confusion"
3/25/2009,"well, it has been a while since the last time i got killed because of 0.0 gate blockades. i've made an effort to never warp in a straight line in occupied sytems out of high sec since then.i was in a 0.0 corp once, but not for long, i joined alongside a friend, didn't learn much about them, took a break from the game for a few months, got kicked out for inactivity, and to this day i still have 2 cruisers in their hangars which i don't feel like getting back.i mean, really, noone even gave a damn about my questions when i logged in that fine day, and procedded to fly a shuttle around until i was finally caught and blown up just before re-entering 0.1 space.all i have left to say about that is it's fortunate clones get shipped back to somewhere friendlier when in a station one isn't allow to be in."
3/25/2009,"so, when?"
3/25/2009,ok good!
3/25/2009,+1 god idea
3/25/2009,agree stealth bomber need boost +1
3/25/2009,"sure, after all you wouldn't catch some grizzled veteran pilot sitting at a bar drinking some fruity drink like a pina colada, that man is going to have a scotch in a pretty damn dirty glass with a cig. definite support."
3/25/2009,everyone not supporting this should keep in mind cigarettes are already in game.
3/25/2009,are we talking the virtual burning of tobacco to create a smoke that can be inhaled by a person to get their nicotine hit in public which in many countries is illegal. or a virtual ecig? ( aka electronic cigarette) which is legal in rl.just a thought ( and dont have many of them )al thorr
3/25/2009,"yea, remind ccp so they don't forget to remove it next patch just like they did quafe girl"
3/25/2009,boosters are higher on the offensive scale and there's no way they'll take them out when they already got their t rating for the boxed set which was the whole point of removing the quafe girl. cigs are safe for the foreseeable future.
3/25/2009,"with all the wanton murder, **** and pillaging in the game, anything to help chill the virtual mind and soul is only appropriate and welcome. how do you define ""need"" anyway?"
3/25/2009,yea i would like to be leaning against a wall in jita 4-4 smoking 1 with a black coat and a hat on looking all cool and stuff when i get run over by a noob in an ibis who didnt dock properly and realise i was in the docking bay and that was my ibis
3/25/2009,i want to play an accordian while smoking a huge cigar.i'm not kidding.
3/25/2009,"lets make accordian hero game, plastic cigar included"
3/25/2009,a fine puff of whatever it is people want to smoke is a good thing imo. i myself would live a fine cigar and a snifter of cognac between missions...
3/25/2009,"i was actually referring to the amount of time it took ccp to actually give them a purpose. granted, they do need a slight nerf at the moment, but it took ages for ccp to get around to boosting them.agreed.minor? how can you say minor if weapon balance issues are currently half of why amarr are far too powerful? you're contradicting yourself.the current low sec changes have done nothing to fix low sec. ccp themselves have admitted that low sec needs help. the majority of the problem is the completely worthless ore there when compared to high sec. rats have essentially nothing to do with the problem.i'm referring to huge influx of minerals from drone space that unbalance the current economics of minerals. look at the value/deamnd of trit versus supply.perhaps you should actually read the nighthawk thread and try to understand the numbers and math involved. the nighthawk's tank/buffer is hardly superior to what other command ships can fit as well. gank? what the hell are you talking about?! the dps of the nighthawk is awful. expect to have tank and gank? perhaps you should actually read the nighthawk thread and learn some math before you start running your mouth. i provide very solid evidence and numbers that the nighthawk indeed has a serious pg issue. it's all in that thread. respond there if you'd like. all the arguments are there for you to read if you'd take the time before responding.however, this thread isn't about any of the above particular issues. the only topic of this thread is the amount of time it takes for ccp to respond to any given issue... even issues that they've admitted are problematic. why is it ccp moves so slowly on balance issues? we're not talking weeks or months here. we're talking years in some cases."
3/25/2009,"as it says to be honest, never seen the need for them back in 2003 and do not see any need for them now (other than for e-peen), as far as i'm concerned they have no place in eve and any of the arguements i have heard to support them have lacked any real substance and all lead back to what i said earlier (more e-peen).if people want kill stats then they should go play unreal tournament or something.just my opinion of course, but i'd like to think anyone that is a true eve'er will support this idea.thank you.--------------------------------------------------------------"
3/25/2009,"if you don't like them, you can ignore them. me, i like them."
3/25/2009,"force new players to leave starter npc corps after a certain reasonably short character age and either form/join a player corp or be moved to a new npc corp, against which it's possible to wage a concord sanctioned war. players, leaving player run corps, are automatically moved to the same new npc corps."
3/25/2009,in before the flames!
3/25/2009,supported.
3/25/2009,op should learn to read before making the same damn proposal for the 1000th time.
3/25/2009,the game needs something like thistoo many people hide in npc corps.
3/25/2009,"yes, of course players should be forced to play the game in the fashion you prefer. after all, what's the point of a sandbox if people are allowed to play in it differently? no. this idea isn't any better the 500th time than it was the first."
3/25/2009,"so, we now have people who are what, 3 months old, and working on mining suddenly able to be mass wardecked into oblivion? come on, ccp isn't that stupid.if you don't like people in npc corps, give them a reason to leave it and join your alliance/corporation. don't whine to the devs about forcing people down a path they wouldn't like to take. i'm in npc corp so i can help the newer players, and you're asking me to leave it because you can't wardec to your heart's content?epic fail."
3/25/2009,not supported for the 1000th time.
3/25/2009,"i obviously support my own proposal.npc corps have a distinct advantage compared to player run corps - being in one entitles a character to practically unlimited risk-free income, ""balanced"" with practically zero possibility for isk or ship loss. this is unfair to players, who choose to join a player run corp.another consequence of the loss free gameplay style is that npc corp players gain unfair advantage in the industry sector - they can afford to produce and sell goods under the cost, with the excuse ""minerals/datacores that i obtain myself are free"". potential loses would let them make more reasonable business decisions.npc corps prevent a multitude of useful gameplay options: - disrupting enemy[1] industry - disrupting enemy[1] supply lines - retaliation against ""ninja salvagers"" (more commonly known, incorrectly, as ""salvage-thieves"") - retaliation against scammers, market gougers or just plain competitorsi'm sure there are more inventive people out there, who can think of other possibilities.does this proposal create imbalance or unfairness?no.new players have a choice - either join a player run corp and be equal in all respects to other players, who joined a player run corp, or join a wardec-able npc corp and be exposed exactly to the same risks as other players.new players, should they choose so, are, of course, allowed to enjoy the safety of highsec and starter npc corps for a reasonable amount of time - until they are deemed to not be in distinct disadvantage compared to older players due to not knowing the game.does this proposal forces a particular gameplay style.no.being in an wardec-able npc corp does not prevent any carrier, that was possible in a starter npc corp. a miner can continue to pursue his mining carrier. an explorer can continue to explore. a pirate can continue to kill. a mission runner can continue to run missions. an industrialist, a trader, a scammer all can continue to play exactly as before.only while being exposed to the same risks.[1] ""enemy"" means either or both of ""enemy corp/alliance"" or ""individual enemy player"""
3/25/2009,"some replies:drake draconis, i assure you i can read and write reasonably well.herschel yamamoto, npc or wardec-able npc corp does not prevent any particular style of gameplay, preferred by me or not.bunyip, i'm not sure what point are you trying to make, that certain professions and players ought to be privileged?"
3/25/2009,"correct me if i'm wrong, but if a pilot is out in space doing his thing, anyone that wants too can come along and shoot that pilot. if a pilot is sitting in a sation doing his thing, no matter what corp he is in, no one can do anything to him, even if he is in a dec'd corpbeing in an npc corp does not prevent other players whacking that player. what you want is the ability to go after high security pilots without consequences. you want to dec the larger corps in the game so you can go after pilots that have no desire for pvp and will barely be able to defend themselves.and lets be honest here, all 0.0/lowsec pilots have some sort of alt to do their market work for them. if you vote for forcing highsec players into decable corps then you should also vote for allowing one single account and one single pilot for everyone playing the game to truely level the playing field."
3/25/2009,you can read and write? good for you.so i guess its a severe lack of intelligence and foresight.did you actually check the forums to see the other exact same proposals and there answers?did you actually bother to research this instead of emo-raging on npc's?did you actually think this through to the point of evaluating balance or are you just interested in padding your kills?yup... figured that.think...before you post.
3/25/2009,"a player in an npc corp can't be wardeced, but they also have disadvantages - they can't issue a wardec, they can't anchor a pos, they can't rent a station office for extra tabs, they can't use a corp wallet for extra tabs(more relevant than the last, because there are no station containers for isk), they can't issue corp contracts to up the contract cap from 21 to 81, and so on. also, your proposal fails another critical test - how many wardecs do you expect there to be on caldari provisions as soon as it becomes a decable corp? having npc corps that can be wardeced means that it is utter suicide to be forced out of the base corp, because you can expect dozens or hundreds of highsec pirates to keep permanent decs on those corps, for the free kills of players who don't know that they've just been dropped from safety into what might as well be 0.0 space. so i want to have items scattered about without the ability for a ceo to pay a few million and spy on my hangars. or maybe i like helping new players out, and prefer to spend my time in corp chat giving them pointers. or i'm paranoid of people i don't know, and assume that player corps are just traps for the unwary and the ceos will scam you mercilessly(yes, i've known people who thought that). or, god forbid, i just want to pay ccp $15/month to mission in peace and not have to worry about corp mails, corp ops, corp drama, and yes, wardecs. eve is not the safest of games, of course, but it isn't defined by the gank alone either. yes, the bear is an unfashionable creature, but we shouldn't just throw them all out, and even if we should, ccp never would for financial reasons. it's just not going to happen."
3/25/2009,"i think it's fine the way it is. if npc corps offer such huge advantages, why are a higher percentage of veteran players not in them?"
3/25/2009,also keep in mind that about 75% of those npc'ers are not npc'ers but alts of mains who are in corps and or 0.0.duh...
3/25/2009,force every player to mine the first hour they are logged. why? i love the pvpers tears. go searching your easy kills another way.
3/25/2009,"ravenesa, i can't see how you comments are relevant to the discussion. you point similarities between npc corp players and non-npc corp players. there's nothing wrong with that. what is wrong is the privilege of npc corp players.drake draconis, your comments is nothing, but flaming. please, grow up and/or go to flame elsewhere.herschel yamamoto, what you describe is easily solvable by creating your own corp, which is one of my points - join a player corp (possibly your own) or a war-decable npc corp.boknamar, i don't know whether what you say is true or not, so i can't comment on it. if it's true, it may be due to the fact that ""veteran"" players are ones, who came to the game before it went half the way to world of evecraft.drake, yes i keep that in mind, in fact i have pointed out that it's not possible to attack such alts, thus harming their 0.0 mains.venkul mul, what you propose is forcing a particular profession to players, unlike me. also, please, refrain from personal attacks. especially when a simple check on my killboard and the killboards of all the corps and alliances i have been will show you a negligible percent of empire kills. it just makes you look like a stupid child."
3/25/2009,"you try to force a kind of play stile you like to other players and then get offended when some retort your proposal against you?i think the one that need to grow is you. your idea has been suggested and soothed down hundred of times. nothing has changed from the last time it was refused, but you feel the need to repeat it again and pretend to be taken seriously. the only reason to propose it is to get easy empire targets without loss of standing. as it has been showed in all the others thread it is easy for macro/sweatshop farmers/transport alt and c. avoid the consequences of being wardecced. so this suggestion only result would be to get easy targets in high sec. if you don't know that it mean you haven't searched what was already written on this topic."
3/25/2009,"not supported for the same reasons i didn't support this the last time it was proposed, and the time before that, and the time before that, and..."
3/25/2009,"not sure if this has been thought of but:because a point is mandatory in any pvp encounter and due to alot of ships are limited to 2 mids, sacrificing a rig slot to add a point(only) would allow for more variety on the field.restrictions: only one point rig allowed per ship.calibration: -300"
3/25/2009,getting the ball rolling...
3/25/2009,"how about we limit it to t2 ships (to bridge the gap to the t3 ships)we could also up their calibration to allow for it.i don't think it's a horrible idea, i'd like to see some other opinions though."
3/25/2009,"other thoughts if the penalties are not enough:option 1:if you fit a point rig, you cannot add another disruptor/scram to your standard midslots. (nullifies 2x scrams fitting and dual 24km disruptions)option 2:disruptor/scram fitted using the rig receives a 50% reduction in warp disruption strength. (.5 strength will still prevent a ship without stabs from warping, and dual scramblers will equal only 3 points instead of 4)"
3/25/2009,"this feature would definitely add a lot of versatility to ships, but of course it raises difficult questions on balance, since it can impact so much of the game.why would anyone want to fit a weapon damage rig if it's much better to add a low slot and fit a damage mod?why add a rig to increase scanner strength or sig resolution when it's more efficient to add a mid slot and fit sensor booster or eccm. things of that naturehowever, the general idea is definitely good. you know how minmatar ships supposed to be the most versatile ships in game?what if we gave this rig only to minmatar? it would certainly promote the main advantage of their shipsand so the other faction ships don't feel left out, why not have special rig for each faction? sort of like ""the national rig"", designed specifically to emphasize their faction strengths."
3/25/2009,a half decent idea...i dig it.
3/25/2009,"so you're asking for a scrambler that fits in a rig slot? um, wow. it's an interesting enough idea, i suppose, but at present there's no way to activate a rig - all of them provide passive effects. maybe if the entire rig system was getting overhauled dramatically, but at present i don't think this idea is at all possible to implement."
3/25/2009,"it would act more like the tech 3 subsystems add midslots, only you can not fit anything but scram/disrupters."
3/25/2009,i like the concept but it's a large buff to shield tankers and bleh to armor tankers. i think a better idea would be give all combat ships a built in warp disruptor/scrambler and swap the disruptor and scrambler modules for attribute enhancers that affect the built in version rather than being items themselves.
3/25/2009,"i like the idea, but i would rather see a separate rig for each level of slot, and cap each ship at a max of 1 each.additionally, each rig should still have a penalty. i would propose if you add a slot to one area, you lose a slot somewhere else.so for example:low slot rig, bonus: +1 low slot, penalty: -1 mid slot, calibration 200mid slot rig, bonus: +1 mid slot, penalty: -1 high slot, calibration 200high slot rig, bonus: +1 high slot, penalty: -1 low slot, calibration 200also, afaik, no ship has enough calibration to mount all three (i could be wrong, i'm still realtively new), but two of them are definately possible."

3/25/2009,"okey first off.i really support the csm, i think it is an extremely good thing to have a few people that can voice the oppinion of the community to ccp so it is not about ""who can scream the highest in the forums wuuhuuu"" which can only bring something bad with it, so i am all for the csm and yes i do agree that they need some more power, and yes i do agree that ccp ****ed up majorly on ... well every turn of the way actually, even with the reaction thing (this cannot have been an oversight, unless the employess at ccp have hat on their feets and pants on their heads while talking funny about grissley), but well nvm, all fine and dandy or whatever you say..but giving the csm credits for stuff which is not their gain is stupid, the queu have been asked for forever, the reason we have always been getting from ccp is ghost training as main problem, ghost training was gone and every one screaming as crazy for the queu, soo this is the reason for that not the csm."
3/25/2009,"the reaction problem is understandable in a programmer's point of view. this game has roughly 40k people on at some of the peaks, maybe higher some days. each cycle (one per hour) would require four calls to the module to prevent the step from occuring. two calls is what they implemented, and it took quite some time to realize the mistake they made. if you call this a mistake, you should also consider the lack of foresight for the y2k bug to be a disaster, even though it made perfect sense at the time of implementation.while i do feel that this csm was both more in the news (due to the pos exploit described above and the dissolution of bob, and now this new problem with bobr), we were also less in the news as many of the major changes in the game have already been presented by csm1. we're working with ccp to get a good mechanic for 0.0 (read the meeting minutes), and mining could definitely use an overhaul.all in all, the csm isn't the bright ray of sunlight shining on ccp's dark deeds, but we do our job of being a liaison between the players and ccp. if you doubt the level of sincerity required to be a csm member, you're welcome to try it, as it's not an easy task."
3/25/2009,"it is not irrelevant to the point he makes, when he bases most of his argument on the idea that he was a gm.it does however not justify the fact that he cheated. you too, are ignoring the evidence then. go and read the damn csm minutes.are you in internal affairs? you too, make assumptions based on things you don't know. how do you know that nobody has been punished? because otherwise is certainly the case.if you think a flight from australia and back is free, then can i have free stuffs?the fact is that you haven't been on the csm. that means you have no real idea what the csm actually does, because you haven't been at any of our meetings. if you had any idea, then you would have another view on it. it is more than a pr stunt. and if you accept facts and don't just go by your circular reasoning, then you would understand."
3/25/2009,"wth! a constructive thread in the eve forums? the sky!!! run!!!in short, i agree"
3/25/2009,"ghost training never had anything to do with it. just have the queue's skill switch check account status - if account is unpaid, queue is inactive. alternately, have the account expiry clear the queue. i don't believe ccp ever said ghost training was the issue, it was players saying that."
3/25/2009,"the fact that he was a dev and not a gm just make the fact even worse and his argument even stronger. a dev doing what he did is far worse than a gm doing the same. what exactly are you drinking?i've read them all. there is nothign ther ebut praises to ccp transparence (which is inexistent by the way) and brownnosing from you. the truth is, as long as ccp is in charge of auditing itself any ""evidence"" they present is null and void. if the csm was assembled to be an external auditing source, as originally suggested, things could be different. as it is, you are useless, and all internal affairs, investigation or evidence talk from ccp is a ridiculous farce. i make any assumptions i wish in the absence of proof. and i bet i am right here. the absence of evidence (not ccp ridiculous pr but real evidence) of the opposite is quite enough for me.the fact that you payed for this and had the availability to do it, even considering how futile and useless the position is for everything but to gather some prestige in an online game, only shows how little value your time has for you.if i need to be in the csm to know what it does, it is already useless, by definition."
3/25/2009,"lavista vista - don't waste your time debating etho. i've seen his ""input"" on forum threads before. he's already made up his mind and will put forth statement after statement that can be neither proven nor disproven. when you can't disprove what he says, he'll think it's victory and insult you. it's a classic conspiracy-theory mindset. silence is the best anti-blowhard technique."
3/25/2009,i prefer telling him his mother smells of elderberries.^_^
3/25/2009,you on the other hand is a nice little alt. maybe lavista's alt? who knows...
3/25/2009,i fart in your general (french accent) direction!
3/25/2009,i rest my case.
3/25/2009,"i dont know if disbanding the csm is the answer but i agree something needs to change. i would suggest ccp implement a new company policy that its employees no longer are permitted to join alliances over a certain size, maybe even not allow them to join in at all.the fact is, it is human nature to abuse any power that is given. teachers are not allowed to date students and radio employees are not allowed to participate in contests. there are reasons why this is done, because it gets abused over and over again, just like we are seeing in eve.come on ccp, grow up and get the devs out of bob and gs and stop this madness once and for all."
3/25/2009,"please, ccp, return the headlights to my revelation.i simply cannot see where i am going. this is horrible."
3/25/2009,"obviously, i support my brilliant idea."
3/25/2009,i can never say no to headlights.
3/25/2009,nor can deer stand dumbstruck in the revelation's path anymore.
3/25/2009,"ccp hinted at this a while back, but i feel it should be done, if possible, sooner than later.- it will drastically reduce isk farming and macros- it would allow mining to be somewhat entertaining, kinda.- it'll open up lowsec to miners, and also make hunting them easier and more fun (they can become complacent)- some other stuff i can't think of right nowperhaps to balance this out with mining noobs, have small belts (enough for a frigate to mine 500-1m isk) around some hisec areas and increase mining missions.edit: this means basically increase sites that require probing and completely remove the standard belts."
3/25/2009,"do you mean the scannable belts? as in, the ones that already exist in normal space? or do you mean something else? op lacks clarity."
3/25/2009,"you can already find scannable grav sites in highsec and lowsec space. in w-space you can find some higher quality belts that have various different and more profitable roids in them, but w-space is 0.0 with all the risks that come along with mining in 0.0 space."
3/25/2009,op updated
3/25/2009,what will stop the isk farmers writing a macro to hunt down belts ?
3/25/2009,"no it wont. they will simple have the one person controlling the mining fleets spend all of 10 minutes to scan out the belts and mark them while the macro fleet moves around.mining will never be entertaining.ahh i see now, this is another one of those ""get rid of highsec because i don't have enough guppies to easily kill in lowsec"" threads.perhaps you should try thinking up an original idea to begin with instead of rehashing the ""force people to lowsec"" whine.this already exsists. accept a mission, complete the mission, don't turn it in, mine the mission.fixed that last one for you."
3/25/2009,"i'm an industrialist, but thanks for assuming"
3/25/2009,personally i think all asteroid belts should be randomly seeded throughout the entire game and you have to scan them out to find them.this would effectively put an end to macro mining as we know it.
3/25/2009,"exactlypeople think that macros can probe with the new system, writing something like that would be extremely complex and not very accurate.as to an isk farmer probing everything and from there on out farming the system, if it happens it happens, but the time that farmer took to scan down would add up.there's probably no way to remove them altogether, however this would alleviate a large number of them."
3/25/2009,"it takes all of 5 minutes to setup a macro to do basic mining. a simple mouse recording program and 5 minutes is all you need.step 1. set bookmarkstep 2. adjust overview to only show roids and sorted by distancestep 3. record the following:-undock-right click, mouse over to new bookmark, warp to bookmark-activate miners-click on the roid at the top of the overview that has been made to only show asteroids and sorted by distance-righ click, mouse over to station, warp/dock-move cargo from hold to hangarset the delays between steps, set the macro to repeat x amount of timesand you are done.the higher end macros work the same way, once you have a warp point and the bookmark set, they work off that. the only work you have to do is finding where to go."
3/25/2009,"that works with static belts, yes. however you have to re-record a macro (or bookmark) every day. it's not a cure for macros, just a treatment."
3/25/2009,"there are several problems:- it will require several changes to the probe system (again ) as the mining sites should be accessible to people that haven't trained the probe use, so they should be scannable using the directional scanner (making the probing skills mandatory is not a good idea);- it will not open low sec to miners. easy to scan mining spots are as much death traps as belts;- respawning of exploration sites is borked. as they respawn in a random system with the same security level in the same general area (if that area is constellation, region or even larger it is not clear) the net effect is that they tend to pile in less used or less accessible systems, so systems without stations, hi sec systems in a pocket after a low sec system and so on. while it can be interesting for gatecampers that want to kill miners at low sec gates it will not enhance mining in any way;- unless the mining pockets are small and so deplete fast it will make little difference for a macro/sweatshop farmer. it is easy to scan with 1 account while the others are mining. at best you would remove the hauler for some minute while it scan all the gravimetric sites in system and bookmark them. if the gravimetric sites are so small that they will hinder macr/sweatshops farmers they will hinder regular miners too."
3/25/2009,i know it is possible to drop modules on spots where you want them by flying there but i don't find this system accurate enough.the problem i have mostly is that i align my defensive mods from the center out. this way i know the range of my guns and i can optimize the pos guns by range.in short i place my mods on a virtual axis.this isn't possible easily atm due to camera restrictions and placement.i believe by making my suggested idea possible you can build your pos more strategically and precisely and a well aligned pos looks way better than a few modules flying here and there .
3/25/2009,1
3/25/2009,"as i was out of the game for some time, did this happen after ccp stated it is an exploit(if they did mark it as exploit of course)? if yes then you should get banned if not, then its game mechanics and the rule apply here as well, so depends on what really happenedi am an individual with my own opinion, my logic state the fair thing not what suits my wallet or what my mates say to flame/whine/pointtohaxbobedit: hell people still pray to god yet we are in the same alliance, that doesn't mean that i share their beliefes (spelling too bored to google, sorryyyy)."
3/25/2009,ex-gonad posting in support of goons.
3/25/2009,this topic might make a fairly amusing eve radio live debate with an invited panel of guests ps not supported obviously since i believe the identity theft should have been reversed almost immediately and band of brothers invited to reform their alliance name and identity.the compromise solution we have now might be pretty messy and not fully satisfy anyone but its far better than allowing the goons to whine their way to reversal of whats obviously been a lengthy gm discussion and response to the identity theft petition.
3/25/2009,hahahaha.
3/25/2009,"stick to your own goddamned rules, and qualify why you didn't do it now _a lot_ better than that meek excuse you have offered until now.what is this, fifth or sixth time? hellbent on betraying the trust of your subscribers. goddamn."
3/25/2009,"you call someone a tool, then ask them to grow up, real mature of you.the name kenzoku was hated by most of their members, and it was a mistake mollee made, and you have to live with the consequences of that terrible alliance name in your corporation's alliance history profile. mollee made a lot of mistakes. he allowed haag to disband the alliance by removing the voting safety measure, he lost a titan and destroyed your morale, he decided to do nothing and stay docked in a npc station, and finally he renames the alliance a fail name ""reloaded"", like darwin reloaded (mollee's titan that died), this new alliance will die pathetically as well.having the name kenzoku demorazlies your members, and was a vicotry for your ennemies, and you can change it using valid game mechanics, but you decided that you didn't want to pay 1,000,000,000 isk, and didn't want to have that stain in your emloyment profile.no one forced you to choose the name kenzoku, except your leader mollee. now live with the shame!your alliance is a joke, and will die as such, none of your ennemies will pay you any respect."
3/25/2009,my ingame morals guys guys
3/25/2009,same rules for everyone
3/25/2009,i'd like band of brothers reloaded to follow the same rules as everyone else.
3/25/2009,same rules for everyone
3/25/2009,you do realize that never before in the history of this mmorpg has anyone got away with such an outright identity theft as goonswarm stealing band of brothers by creatiing an alt corp to block alliance recreation right?in the past this has always led to gm's nuking the stolen name and allowing the original owners to recreate their identity.goons are the ones who appear to be operating on a different ruleset to everyone else here if anything.
3/25/2009,"actually, haargoth's identity is still his! idiot!"
3/25/2009,your post is full of lies
3/25/2009,please dont tell us something like rules are meant to be broken.i want answers!
3/25/2009,maybe they where the first to ask for the name change and this is a new service now...
3/25/2009,i recommend reading before posting.
3/25/2009,seriously identity theft? get out. the corporation didn't exist. it's not like band of brothers was disbanding to rename their alliance to band of brothers reloaded.oh wait i just figured out haargoth wasn't behind all of this.
3/25/2009,lotka volterra.never before in the history of this mmorpg? you're terrible at history fyi
3/25/2009,"funny, where do the eve rules say that is illegal? a name was no longer in use, a player created a corporation using that name. how is this breaking the game rules? forget concepts of ""honor"" and ""morals"", rules, how did this break them?"
3/25/2009,"one of the main reasons the playerbase was demanding something like the csm was because of scandles involving favoratism towards bob.again, ccp has shown favoratism towards bob. we want this to stop."
3/25/2009,you can't steal something that isn't taken. the name was available and someone registered it. no rules were broken here.
3/25/2009,same rules for everyone.
3/25/2009,everyone else who has asked for a name change ever has been told to f*ck off. this is bs.
3/25/2009,i'm honestly confused here. jade can you please explain in as much text as you possibly can how you can steal a name nobody is currently using? again please make sure you use a giant wall of text because it seems to make you look important.
3/25/2009,"ah, so instead of this rather minor abuse of their authority, you would prefer ccp have committed a much more significant abuse of their authority."
3/25/2009,bright colors and flashing images help too hth.
3/25/2009,"yeah, us goonies have a terrible attention span."
3/25/2009,"the former eve alliance everlasting vendetta went to play wow, their guild was disbanded and the name grabbed by another group of players before they could reform, i know it's absolutely astonishing that something like this has happened elsewhere in the mmo universekeep using scary words like ""steal"" and ""theft"" to suggest goons did anything but capitalize on bob stupidity and used anything but working-as-intended in-game mechanics to disband bob and get their namekeep failing to see the difference between using in-game methods to achieve alliance goals and getting a gm to flip a switch to make changes to an alliance that are impossible for players to make on their own"
3/25/2009,disband them or allow the rest of us to do the same.
3/25/2009,"even better maybe jade could put it into the form of a song with some guitar, we could called it jade trolls unplugged."
3/25/2009,i support this e-drama
3/25/2009,"actually you're wrong. it happened in age of conan. two guilds who hated and despised each other had a long running conflict brought about from sharing a resource instance with each other. ""captain morgan society"" eventually destroyed the enemy guild ""the fallen guard"" when the guild leader decided in a moment of drunken madness to rename the guild ""rolving re tards"" (no idea what 'rolving' means, i assume it was meant to be 'loving' or maybe 'revolving'). when this happened, one of the captain morgan society guys dropped guild and immediately made a new guild stealing the guild name before they could change back. in the ensuing thread the action was actually compared to one you may find in eve-online and was deemed legal. it occured on one of the strict roleplaying servers where guild name, identity and reputation is probably more important than on a plain pve or pvp server.in essence it's little different, as sirmolle removed the safety checks ingame himself (shares for votes). thus was vulnerable to such an action by his own making.you can read about it here although tbh it's a pretty boring thread.captain thunk"
3/25/2009,"speaking of reading before posting jade, are you going to read every post of unprecedented support for this idea?please take the time to do so - that way we don't have to read your terrible posts for awhile.oh yeah, and here's something to think about while you're reading:-kenzoku was formed several months before bob was disbanded-former bob corps could have created an alliance with the revised name-goonswarm has had several director-level spies and hasn't been disbanded-bob was only disbanded because their executor corp was structured for quick & easy access-get out."
3/25/2009,"goonswarm before ""agtard gate"" = goonswarm after ""agtard gate"" = goonswarm after ""molle gate"" = thank you,dr. shot"
3/25/2009,"so bob had 2 choices after they were disbandeda. join kenzoku, instant alliance and sov.b. make new alliance , with a better name and pay one bil. (don`t know about a sov mechanics concerning a newly created alliance, hope someone can explain)they decided for a and they get their instant alliance. but now they decide want to do b instead, and gm allowed that. seems like cheating to me"
3/25/2009,same rules for everyone.
3/25/2009,"i just see a standard goon+coalition threadnaught with no real substance demanding that ccp bend over for 5000 players in a dark corner of 0.0. nothing new really. ultimately i think you need understand that a thread full of alts and mindless ""+1s"" doesn't really achieve anything. this thread will go the way of the ""make goons in charge of caod"" thread and disappear in a couple of days in a puff of smoke and hyperbole and nobody will lament its absence.meanwhile the rest of the server gets on with playing the game. i'd advise you to do the same."
3/25/2009,the most supported thread in the assembly hall should be dismissed in a puff of smoke.you obviously have no faith in the csm. can you remember why it was created?
3/25/2009,"there is no reason why the gms should change kenzoku's name simply because ""it's not the right name""."
3/25/2009,"my case: after a few months of playing s9 ticker became available (didn't had it at that time). kindly asked 2 times the gms to give it to my corp since no-one was using it. ""no, can't do!"" so i had to close the corp - move all assets to corp members, get out/kick all corp members, and finally leave the corp only to re-do it 10min later with the ticker we wanted.other examples:stian empire was created. someone noticed the typo, told ccp. ccp told them to disband the alliance (and getting no refund from the 1bn isk needed to create it), recreate the alliance (and once again pay 1bn isk to create it) and make sure to spell the name correctly.black 0ut was created. someone realized how dumb this was, and so they asked ccp to change it to black out. ccp told them no, and that they'd have to disband the alliance (and get no refund from the 1bn isk needed to create it), recreate the alliance (and once again pay 1bn isk to create it) and make sure to spell the name the way they wanted to.against all authorities had a slight mishap where someone didn't pay the maintenance build. they lost all their sovereignty, had to recreate the alliance, and had to once again front the 1bn isk fee. ccp did not reimburse any of that.bobr's case: the eula clearly doesn't give you any rights to have your alliance name changed. as for bad game mecanics when bob was first dismantled, it was no-ones fault (in-game), the same faulty game mecanics apply to everyone in-game (other alliances can suffer the same fate sooner or later - until ccp changes something). you went down thru legitimate in-game mecanis - have the spine to recognize it.the name itself has little importance (you can have yer old name back for all i care). but bending the eula rules, still going strong for sov3 in some systems and not paying the 1bn bill - these facts clearly put ccp in a delicate position again because it clearly shows bobr plays this game by one set of rules and us the rest by another set.first among equals.and lets make one thing clear, this is not bobr's fault. this is a ccp failure, because they still want to interfere in eve politics. why is this happening.. idk, the only logical conclusion is that some people with a lot of decisional power in ccp still have strong ties with bobr. after the t20 problems, i sincerely doubt even lead gms do something big like this without asking permision from the head-honchos.eve is not ccp's love-child anymore, it's a cash cow. and it shows. milk it while you can. however some people will never understand that money, even big money can be made in a number of ways. it doesn't have to be like this.if csm has any voice whatsoever this issues will be on their agenda. and yes internal affairs should be notified about this, they should get mails from as many peeps as possible. be decent, civil, but have a voice. mail them!btw, bobr i hope you understand why a lot of eve hates you now. it's not yer so-called elitism. it's the cheating you need to resort to in order to win something, it's the lenghts you go to bend the rules.as for sending us out for a walk in rl so we don't moan about internet spaceshipz business.. how about you follow yer own advice, and when you come back at the keyboard you try to play the game fair-play (and have some phun while you're at it).the irony is that it's not gonna matter in the end. enough entities in-game have the means now to take you down completely and keep you down. you're not the elitist alliance you once were. you're just average now (as a lot of other peeps got into a lot of caps now).fame lasts 15min, infamy lasts a bit longer."
3/25/2009,i have no faith in goons thats an entirely different matter. csm was created (amongst other things) to provide oversight on correct goings on inside ccp in their relations to the community. in this case a gm has provided a response to the community and a decision has been made. this thread represents a standard goon threadnaught trying to bully out advantage in eve by threatening to damage ccp's pr on the internets.nobody should cave in to bullying.
3/25/2009,"excellently put, at the very least ccp needs to go into more detail about how kenzoku is different from any of the cases mentioned."
3/25/2009,"lol, as if the intention of the 'hurry up and create a corp' wasn't to steal bob's identity solely to rub salt into some virtual pixel wound. one only needs to look at the silly toon names that post from said corp to see through that charade. this whine fest has nothing to do with ccp this or gm that. it's everything to do with the fact that bob now has some of their identity restored. i agree 100% with jade contantine and others that the original corp name theft should not have been allowed to stand. rename the childish goon corp to bobr and bobr to bob. at that point all will be well in the world of eve.still it's hilarious to see the goons and their northern nut cuppers stamp their feet like little children and spam the forums. they someone think that making a billion threads and filling them with a billion posts from goons, goon alts and goon nut cuppers it's the same as having a thought worth listening to. last year it was spamming the forums trying to get jade contantine removed as csm president and your own ******* put in. last week it was 'wahhh isd didn't report us sitting outside a station for a month picking our noses.' now it's ""wahhhh, bob has their identity back no fair we stole their name proper like."" it'll be something different next week. the whineswarm will always continue."
3/25/2009,"you make that quite clear in your many rambling posts. maybe you should have a glance at some of the pages in this thread. do you really think all those posts for support are by goons?you have made your point several times that you don't like goons, we understand, maybe you are envious of their success, i don't know. please stop trolling this thread like it was caod."
3/25/2009,another bobr shows the mentality of a 5 year old. stop posting sfsfailme. you are only making yourself look an idiot.
3/25/2009,sad truth !!! btw i do not support this.
3/25/2009,"my 2 cents....01 - bob chose to rename to ken for a reason, it gave them control over some portions of space or something. it didnt work out and eventually goons took even that away from them. if bob had created a new name and got no benefit from it then i would agree the new name change is irrelevent but thats not the case, bob benefited from using the ken name so they should be stuck with it. .01 - it didnt take ccp two months to figure out that bob was disbanded using legal game mechanics and that goons took the bob name. if this was an abuse of the game mechanics then it should have been dealt with in the first two weeks. it ticks me off that ccp waited for the ken thing to go bad (ie. get their butts handed to them by gs) and then decided to let them change their name. disclaimer - the opinions expressed here reflect my own personal opinion and not the views of my corp or the cva alliance."
3/25/2009,"well, i think the massive majority are from goons, goon alts, goon allies and good fanbois - a smaller proportion might be from younger players carried along with the hue and cry and mistakenly believing some of the complete nonsense that is being posted by the goons. ultimately this is partizan political thread and the goon coalition has been instructed to follow the party line by its leadership."
3/25/2009,"i really don't know what to make of this.one one hand, a disgraced, cheating alliance seems to yet again have been rewarded by gm's in what appears to be a clearly inappropriate use of gm discretion.on the other, i am so sick of the pathetic, puerile destruction of coad and the in-game spamming of goonswarm.i am amazed to find myself ambivalent; i really don't care. the more i think about it, the more i think that it is no big deal whether it is kenzoku or bob reloaded.as for goonies whining, i find myself thinking that perhaps if they showed more respect to others i would care that there was a bias against them by the gm's.i suppose i will get spammmed with abusive eve-mails and 1 line abusive comments but as far as i am concerned is the only difference between goonswarm and bob is that bob got caught cheating red handed.apart from that; there is not much between them at all."
3/25/2009,"right instead lets have them bendover for 3000 in public. besides jade thoes 5000+ players don't matter right? they are all goons, every single one of them in this whole thread are goons and goon alts. whats a a few thousand +1s here and there... oh thats right the whole point of the csm. i really instensely dislike people like you. at least with goons you know where you stand, they wear their identity on their sleeve. you, you will support principles one day, anything goes the next, and have a public identity crisis on the third. you have no principles and frankly it gets annoying trying to have a forum debate with you. i don't know what to say because i know you aren't reading or listening, your just posting and reading your own posts.are you saying there is no history of gm misconduct, and are you saying that nothing here is wrong at all? really? come on jade, please throw us all a bone and take a stand one way or the other (goonswarm aside). is it right or is it wrong."
3/25/2009,don't worry - goons have been caught red-handed a fair bit in the past too. its pretty standard for big-alliance corruption
3/25/2009,i see you are still out of touch with those you want to feel as if you represent.
3/25/2009,"there was a history of developer misconduct. it has been dealt with. nowadays the ""dev misconduct"" thing is just a rallying call for goons to attempt to blugeon their way to victory in a political game that seeks to achieve results with whining and threadnaughts rather than playing the game.whats wrong here is that goons were allowed to keep the band of brothers alt corp without having it renamed ""evecorp4234023049"" in response to the bob leadership petition against identity theft. why this happened is even more troubling because i very much suspect it was delayed and delayed through fear of negative press before the retail release of the latest expansion. if this is indeed the case then it suggests the goon alliance has successfully bullied ccp into allowing full on identity theft to the detriment of an entire community of eve players and this is a very bad precedent.i can't believe you couldn't read all that from my earlier posts to be quite honest."
3/25/2009,dont forget friends of goon helped too.and if anyone cares to look. i believe it was on page 37 that 2 members of the bobr alliance posted support for this thread. joke or not. it still counts
3/25/2009,"no, because ccp has already set up enough bad precedents (pos bowling, alliance renaming, banning the guy who finds out about the cheating dev....)"
3/25/2009,jade i am still waiting for your explanation on how you can steal a name nobody is using. however rather then explaining this please feel free to continue crying foul and crying identity theft. that works just as well i suppose.
3/25/2009,"well tee-shirts, mugs, killboard graphics, logos, hell ... custom keyrings and engraved nipple-clamps - who knows? point as you very well know is that when 3000 players build a community around an ingame identity that identity belongs to them in some greater sense than a mere collection of letters. but we both know your question was a troll since your own alliance leader has admitted ""rushing"" to register the alt corp identity purely to block the rightful owners of the name recreating their alliance name after the director-level emocide."
3/25/2009,"ah thank you that makes sense. since they somehow ""own"" the rights to this name even though they are no longer using it nobody else can. so what ccp should do is modify the rules of the game to disallow anyone from using any previously used corp or alliance name/ticker. see when you put it that way it makes perfect sense. thank you again.follow up question, since you were on csm. do you think when they add the ability to walk around in stations they should also add brothels?"
3/25/2009,"yes. and opium dens, illicit bare-knuckle fist-fighting rings, black market genetic emporiums, slums and every kind of seedy local you can think of."
3/25/2009,"actually the ""bare-knuckle fist-fighting rings"" would probably make for a pretty interesting side game. if that was the case i'm not sure if i would rather see the mittani vs dianabolic or jade constantine vs darius johnson."
3/25/2009,stop crying goons...
3/25/2009,"you haven't read this thread have you? it's not a simple name change, its about the rules and the favoritism they showed to kenzoku. the only time a name can be changed is if its offensive in some way. kenzoku clearly isn't. it isn't a japanese swear word or anything so too bad. that being said, if one alliance gets to have their name changed due to petition of members within their own alliance; everybodys name can be changed then."
3/25/2009,"so, everybody who disagrees with you is a goon or a noob and therefore their opinion doesn't count. how convenient."
3/25/2009,"technically no, doesn't matter what their community built up, you could use the argument that the usa television channel hbo and time warner has more rights to the band of brothers due to their 2001 tv drama series based on the life and actions of 101st airborne, easy company in world war 2 than a group of 3000 internet spaceship game players, who have no real world legal claim to the name.at the time after the bob alliance was disbanded through legitimate in game mechanics the was no alliance, corporation or any other entity called band of brothers, no one individual or group had any preferential right to the name regardless of how many key rings or tee-shirts they had. goons got their first, and bob wasn't fast enough to do anything about it!"
3/25/2009,"approved. if ccp wants to start enabling name-changes, then let them notify the player base in an orderly manner and post their policy for such. other games charge real money as well for such a privilage (like portrait changes).regardless, unilateral action favoring a single faction or alliance (again, bob) is intolerable, and exactly why the csm exists. you'd think someone would have learned their lesson after t20, but whatever... back to the woodshed we take them!--krum"
3/25/2009,"no compromise. not even in the face of armageddon.i see it is busy spewing nonsense like it's going out of style here, too. has it found a cross to nail itself to yet?"
3/25/2009,"one would have hoped that ccp would have learned its lesson about giving an alliance preferential treatment. out of a desire not to play a game run by people out of touch with reality, one also would have hoped that after years of rampant corruption from isd, an exposed cheating dev and numerous documented devs involved in bob that ccp would have noticed that it wasn't ok to blatantly play favorite with the same group of people again.rename bobr to rkz and let them disband pay 1bil and reset all of their sov counters if they want to get the name that they were inexplicably given without having to following in game mechanics . . . just like everyone else. i am actually having a hard time believing that this wasn't a unilateral action but some junior gm who didn't understand the ****storm he was walking into - can't conceive that there would be obvious preferential treatment like this and that they would actually break game mechanics by allowing them to go over the character limit."
3/25/2009,"supported, but disband goonswarm too once the drama dies down and the forums get boring again."
3/25/2009,shameful
3/25/2009,"something so insignificant, get a grips of yourself's people, in the ""context"" of what has happened and the due process that went about to the renaming personally i see nothing wrong with it.it appears that a lot of people are just caught up with the ""e-hate"" and lack any common sense.my 2c, but don't let me stop your winning."
3/25/2009,"sup, welcome to eve, i guess you haven't been playing for very long, and don't quite rememnber t20, aura, delve buffs, and all of the other crap bobr has gotten handed to them from corrupt devs and gms over the yearschange the name back, disband bobr, or drop their sov. this **** has gone on for too long now."

3/25/2009,no expetions for single entities.if this option is available to everyone then there is no problem. but it is not.main point is. one exception leads to another exception and so on and in the end you got ppl exploiting the system and ruining the game.
3/25/2009,"what exactly is the issue? would you ***** and moan if mr. smith down the street changes his name to mr. johnson as well?bob was crippled by borderline abuse/exploit of game mechanics or lack thereof and they went through proper channels when they realised that the old name had been ""reserved"" by another party.this whole propaganda campaign smells like a mass-psychotic break due to personal issues with the name ""band of brothers"", nothing good ever came from mass-hysteria.a name was changed, no other action was taken. if you feel mistreated or that an unfair advantage was gained by it, put in a petition with internal affairs.internet spaceships are serious, i get that, but we are talking letters here for goddess' sake .. their spaceships still blow up and they will probably still partake in the local-smack we all know and love in null-sec."

3/25/2009,i support this.
3/25/2009,"even if it is not really bobr's failure, i support this. such buddy deals have to stop finally..."
3/25/2009,"oh wait, band of developers? that should be goonswarm, because, they do have the most members that are gm/devs.it's quite hypocritical to call someone to be favoured by the devs when those people whining about it have the biggest number of people working for ccp.and, why exactly is this petition about ""disband bobr""? it was only a namechange. if, at all, you're requesting something, it should be ""rename bobr back to kenzoku"", because everything else just shows what the real purpose of this is:to finally and utterly destroy bob and every member in it. it didn't work with all naping each other, it didn't work with using a clearly quite broken game mechanic using a defect member (but yes, it was intentional that you can disband a whole alliance, yet you have to wait 24h to unlock a bpo, wait 24h to kick an unwanted member out of a corp )and still bob is there and fights.what comes next?p.s.: thanks for killing aurora, because, they so clearly favoured bob and did all those favours for them. it's really nice that there's not a single bloody event left, it brings the backstory soooo close to us, makes us feel we can influence it.p.p.s.: having a spy in an alliance is ok. but hacking into forums and ts servers or sniffing packets from the internet isn't truly inside the game rules."
3/25/2009,"funny how people pick up on the slightest peice of misinformation and run with it like it is proof.i assume you are talking about shares.i also assume you have never been in a position where you could actually try kicking a corp out of an alliance?--i honeslty don't know how goonswarm got away with identity theft which other corps have been punished for previously, but i don't really care either.the fact is that they were shown favouritism that other corps have not been shown, and i think that is a gross injustice. the current situation is nothing more than an uncomfortable compromise.i'm serious."
3/25/2009,"hi avon, remember saying this?how times change"
3/25/2009,"this is a tough decision for me, because while i think what happened to bob in the first place was fairly trashy, and unfortunate (certainly not the way i would want to bring down a foe), and i think meta gaming is lame true, but this is all part of what makes eve great and it does seem like their may be some favoritism here. if ccp could provide some proof that they have taken similar actions before (which i do not believe they have) then perhaps i would be more amicable to the whole name change situation. furthermore, now that a precedent has been set, they better be ready and willing to change any alliance name. in addition, if bobr did get to keep their sov. despite the change that is fairly unconventional too i think, because usually an alliance to change their name would have to reform and lose sov. so bob most likely should have had to undergo the same process at least, instead of just having a quick painless transfer.so at the moment, with the given information, i support this cause, bobr should have to disband, then they should reform with their new name and sacrifice standing etc, it just seems more fair that way. i do have sympathy for bob because of the whole way they went down (very dis-honorable way to win goons imo...) but still it shouldn't get them sympathy from devs who should be un-biased and not show any form of favoritism. let's see how it shakes out."
3/25/2009,"goonswarm may have the most devs/gms, but they're not the ones getting rules bent to help them win at internet spaceships like bob. they don't have a history of devs/gms flat out cheating to help their alliance."
3/25/2009,"first id just like to say that sure, the disbanding by one button is kinda fsckt-up but:if molle hadn't removed the shares so alliance changes could go through without a vote then that's his mistake.and how come a absent director still had executor roles intact?its like removing your firewall because your bandwidth suffers lag, who's fault is it your ""secrits"" gets stolen? you or the hacker capitalising on the security lapse?not anybody's fault but your own you did a stupid thing like this.and your ""letter of the law"" point...its not that the name changed, most couldn't care less.its that you guys got the rules bent in your favour by ccp yet again!countless alliances have had to disband/lose sov/pay 1bill and reform to get what you got by ""pressing 1 button""... (ironic i know :p) so i guess:"

3/25/2009,violation of the rules. needs to be changed back until all other alliances can do this.
3/25/2009,"i am a new player. just plugged in my 60 day code a few days ago. i mainly became interested in looking at eve due to all the news that was generated because of the goons taking down bob. (i guess that is a testament to the saying ""there is no such thing as bad press."") i think however questionable the goons taking out of bob was, it does not merit any special treatment by the developers. if they used in-game metrics to complete what amounts to a hostile takeover then so be it. if that in-game metric needs to be changed then the systems put in place to make in-game rule changes should be utilized. if there is an in game metric for changing your alliance name then it should be used. anything else would be some form of favoritism. regardless good luck to all involved."

3/25/2009,"what you don't understand is sov mechanics. if they wanted a new name they should have left or disbanded kenzoku and formed a new alliance just like every single other group in this game would have had to.i guess i misunderstood what had happened originally. i guess all the former bob corps joined another already formed alliance instead of creating a new one, so they had no say over their name when they joined kenzoku.they had a choice: join kenzoku, or make a new alliance with a new name. they chose kenzoku, this never should have even been considered by ccp."
3/25/2009,yes change the name back.....no special rules for *spezial* friends
3/25/2009,"they could have made a new alliance called bob reloaded if they cared so much about their identity, they did not. they chose an already existing alt alliance to join called kenzoku to give them sov advantage in delve. they made their decision, they should have to live with it and not break the rules everyone else has to follow."

3/25/2009,"i support this. no alliance should be able to use gms to circumvent sov mechanics. i don't care about the name, this about actualin-game cheating.they should be disbanded, and allowed to to recreate the alliance with that same name. well, close to it. apparently it's too long for a player to actually create. they'll be ""band of brothers reloade"". which is close enough, i'd think. i'm sure they'd be happy with that.i actually have some sympathy for them, but as far as i know the disbanding and subsequent registration of the bob name was completely legitimate and caused by a meta-game betrayal which ccp has expressly allowed, if not actively encouraged. it is, in fact, one of eve's strongest selling points. so while i know it must suck to be bob this recent change must not be allowed to stand. sympathy is not justification for cheating."
3/25/2009,"the number of other goons that got trolled by the ""character limit"" on corporation and alliance names amuse me. its not 24/25/whatever guys. everything else still stands though. one rule for all."
3/25/2009,"the whole point is bias since the only people replying are the ones who would benefit from the proposal, if one that demanded the disbanding of razor or goonswarm on some technical ground that was minor which this is effectivly poped up and got 2000 votes from mostly corpless alts would you expect it to be taken seriously....another thing this is is a pr attempt to drag bob throught the dirt again to gain credability something which the goonswarm has been lossing at a dramitic rate if any of my fellow empire freinds have to say.what ever you say its obbious what is going on here. anyone with half a brain can see so dont try and lecture to be about right and wrong your wasting the energy in your fingers."
3/25/2009,answer ccp. we're waiting.maybe a false advertising complaint wouldn't hurt. you can't say its a player run world with this many complaints.

3/25/2009,"sorry mate, but i do belive that all this ""csm... assembly wall... n' stuff"" was created only to keep us entertained with something(and some hope.. but only that).i belive ccp will do the same thing as others, hide(you will not read/hear a word from them.)but, as a wise man once said, hope is the last to die.- seifer"
3/25/2009,some good ratting systems are cynojammed now due to this :(
3/25/2009,"i do believe you're wrong. shows a basic misunderstanding of the csm system, which by it's design takes some time to have an effect. even if the skill que was the only thing they had ever done, it would validate their existence, but they also provided some serious balancing, ui tweaks, and the orca.thats not the point here anyhow. this thread is just another pr attempt by the goons. bob did the same thing to them when they had any real power. the two just go back and forth annoying everyone else in the universe.since the goons will bump this for another year or so, no harm in condemning the waste of a slot on the assembly's main page.you frothing lap-dogs."
3/25/2009,what do you think would be better - that ccp openly declares it's support for bob or that it just stays silent and denies everything?what are you gonna do if they get balls enough to declare a favorite alliance? fight them or rage-quit?i'd think it'd be pretty amusing if they came out in the open
3/25/2009,"i strongly, full-heartedly support this. i've never worked with goonies nor with bob. but the very stickiness between bob and ccp goes beyond one's capacity of describing it in proper words. it's like i'm unknowingly getting a lemon from a car dealer w/ exactly the same amount of cash his cousin pays for to get a mercede from backdoor. if i am mad enough to go for being headlined, i'd smash his store w/ the lemon he sold, and shot him in his face. w/ the so much public announcement of your love to your bob, you are sharply indicating me that the portion of my life i've waisted is just digitalized as few binary glitches of the your database file. and you are saying you can play it however you want it. fine. i get it.like ghost training issue and t2 bpo scandal, however, this one will go down a long way for the years to come. you will never be free from people armed with these issues ganking you when and where most unexpected, and i promise you that i will be one of them.fly safe."

3/25/2009,"how hard is it for your people to see the point? it's about the fact that they've been given special treatment that allowed them to keep sov when other alliances would have been told to disband if they wanted a new name. bob jumped into kenzoku to gain/keep a little sov easily and quickly then later asked to get the name changed to something they wanted instead of going about it the normal, legit way and making a new alliance with the name they wanted from the start then gaining sov."
3/25/2009,"nice ad for eve ccp, before when people ask me about eve i use to answer it was a good game thank to the gameplay etc.. now f*** up the gameplay i will say to don't try it cause devs aren't fair with all player. gg ccp your game sucks by now"
3/25/2009,"the op is mistaken that this has never been done before. there are numerous examples that everyone seems to be ignoring in general and caod threads, so based on that i disagree. keep the tears flowing though since caod is much cleaner now that the goons and goon allies are around a circle ""discussing"" the issue."

(guessing by the amount of exclamation marks, i'd say the latter - but we are on the eve forum...)i thought the whole point of that mission is that you have to visit all empires to complete it.does anyone know if the agents will talk to you, even if your standings are too low?that would be nice, imo - you could do the mission if you're fast enough to escape the local navy :-)"
3/25/2009,"this might be me, but since when do gate guns attack you if you have low standing with a empire?afaik but that's been over a year ago, all you got was some navy ships trying to destroy you, which where at best a threat to lvl 1 frigates.guessing it's gotten upgraded with faction warfare... but by that much??"
3/25/2009,"if you don't know where you are going and what your standing means, you deserve to get blown up. take the lesson and don't repeat the mistake.even the note that tells you about the epic mission mentions that you need to be able to access all of empire space. if you found a note that said ""everyone who warps to the following coordinates needs to be able to tank 5000dps em damage"", would you hop into your merlin and jump right over there, only to complain that you had no chance?"
3/25/2009,"yes, the agents will talk to you, but you always have them saying something like ""get out of my face"" before they give you the mission. it's almost comical, but it works.also, if you can't travel to all the empires, learn the diplomacy skill. if you have it and still can't travel to all the empires, it sucks to be you. we've been trying to implement a way to gain standing for a faction without doing missions, but we're still at a loggerhead.hopefully, we'll see it soon. until then, don't do the epic arc."

3/25/2009,"whats your view of the blatant favoritism within ccp regarding the alliance formally known as band of brothers,and the blatant disregard to their own eula regarding the name change from kenzuko to band of brother reloaded and all that it entails."
3/25/2009,"from a personal perspective i believe that the examples in the past of favoritism shown towards the alliance formally known as band of brothers has been much hyped up. the t20 ""scandal"" for instance was a case of favoritism shown towards a particular player/corp within the band of brothers alliance and not the alliance as a whole. i also think that when this happens it is up to ccp to investigate and deal with like any other business rather than the eve community in general. as an example if you somehow got a meeting with a representative of a major oil company and demanded to know the results of a disciplinary against one of their plant workers you would be quickly told where to go. in this particular case i cannot see how it happened whilst maintaining the precedent ccp have stuck to before. having said that i also don't know what happened internally at ccp. additionally i personally cannot see any significant way it effects the game apart from being an irritation to those who wanted to change their alliance, corp or player names in the past and have been refused the chance and for those who would use such an event as propaganda for their own cause. i would prefer to stick to issues that actually effect people's ability to play the game and/or find the most enjoyment from the game; although if enough people wanted to know if this had been investigated by ccp i would certain be more than happy to ask that question of them. as stated in the previous example though i wouldn't consider it appropriate for me to demand of ccp to release any details beyond the fact that an investigation had or had not happened. if they wished to release more details that is entirely their prerogative. i hope that helps you make up your mind one way or another."
3/25/2009,"alright, let me ask one of the more volitile questions. i take it due to your associations with star fraction and your wanting to be in the csm that you've monitored the past two candidacies. what mistakes have they made that you would've done differently if you had the chance?second, your corpmate's reputation in the csm is well known, and many don't look favorably upon the exchange that occured in csm 1. what would you say to make us believe that this isn't a repeat of the past and that you will behave differently?last, there are currently two 'hot-button' issues on the csm's plate, and you'll most likely take up the mantle of representing these when you become part of the csm. how would you resolve/handle the following issues:a) 0.0 mechanics (sovereignty, incentive, etc)b) mining (adding interest, balancing ores, etc)thank you for your time, and i just want to see how you'd handle the pressures inherent with being a csm delegate, should the public decide you worthy of said position."
3/25/2009,"i am not altogether sure this as straight forward a question as you think as most of what the csm does, from my understanding, happens behind closed doors and in part is covered by the nda. i wasn't privy to that sort of information with the 1st csm as some might think as jade kept star fraction and the csm role separate and took his nda seriously. the 2nd csm has also been as opaque in many ways as the first one. if we are to take what we see of the csm at face value though i personally think that in some cases on some issues there has been a little bit too much self interest governing the votes and not enough critical analysis of the subject concerned. the words 'critical' and 'analysis' you will see time and time again from me as it's what i do and more to the point what i do well. i hope that i could bring both of these to the csm from my 'training' as an academic in the humanities. simple answer to this one. jade and myself are separate people with separate and distinct personalities. many people attribute a certain pattern behavior too many groups in eve and beyond but this falls apart on close analysis. if you were to ask me what personal qualities i have that i think would be useful as a csm however i would say that i am easy going and able to think critically about issues both abstract and mundane. both of these i feel are important in a csm rep. it is also worth noting that whilst this, my main, character i chose to announce my candidacy on for the csm is a member and director of star fraction my intention is not to represent any one particular group but to weigh popular opinion on a subject with close analysis to help my fellow csm members reach a conclusion to present, or not, to ccp.as with most subjects i have a personal opinion on them (i.e. sov needs a change to increase the dynamics of 0.0 warfare beyond that of the current mechanics and adding the ability for any sized groups of people to create an infrastructure to support their mining/industry endeavors which isn't limited to location and/or sovereignty) but as previously stated the aim for me is to interact with the playerbase and analyse the solutions that have popular support. that isn't to say i shall except what the most people say but rather pass on ideas that bear up to critical analysis that warrant ccp's attention that the playerbase agree would help to increase their personal and group enjoyment of the game.and thank you for your questions. i am no politician and have no carefully designed platform to wave my banner over. as such what i am trying to ""sell"" so to speak is myself and the more questions i get the better so as to allow me to represent who i am to the voters and allow them to make up their own mind about me and whether i would represent them best or whether someone else would instead."

3/25/2009,"was one of the best teachers back at eve uni, used to teach alot of ecm classes what do you think of the proposed ecm changes dv?"
3/25/2009,"when i met the ccp devs in iceland last year it was interesting to see how worried they were about showing favouritism, something i've recently seen enforced by ccp in an unrelated case. if they actually made an exception for bob that would be extremely worrying, however i'm witholding judgement until their internal affairs department finishes their investigation (which i'm sure is going on atm). it could be a gm error and that would result in the name being changed back. it could be a change in policy, unfortunately ccp has shown repeatedly that synchronising its public documentation and internal policies/mechanics isnt one of their strong points.regardless, until ccp makes a statement nobody really knows what is going on. i'm confident someone on the current csm will bring this up (my guess would be darius johnson).edit: i just read ccp's reply here. ccp stated that they have done this before, and if this is true (i have no reason to think otherwise) then there has been a precendent and ccp did not show favouritism. that said, this seems to be another example of ccp failing to communicate properly. you'd think they'd learn eventually i hope one of the current csm's will force ccp to come with a better explanation of the process/decision though.first, lets keep in mind these are first-draft, proposed changes. nothing final yet and any of those changes wont make it into the game in a hurry.i think they're ridiculous (same for the sb changes). admittedly the 230km optimal range on my falcon (rigged for range, naturally) is maybe a bit too far (although imo thats what rokhs and other falcons are here to deal with), but removing the optimal bonus completely to turn an expensive but paper-thin ship into a close range fighter is ridiculous. a better solution would be to reduce the falcon's range bonus to 10-15% so its optimal would be in range of most sniper setups while it still has some combat viability. the rook with its existing damage and tank bonuses might be better suited for ccps visions for short range brawler. the scorpion is fine and i'm not sure why they want to change it. and the kitsune could use some love but oddly enough ccp seems to forget about that one.signal distortion amps are fine as they are i think - they do force ecm pilots to truly commit almost all of their ships slots to their ewar (gimping their damage and tank), but i feel that weakness justifies the strength of ecm modules.i may be a bit biased because i do fly ecm, but i think people forget too easily that for every time you curse because a falcon pilot jams you, there's another time when a jam fails and the falcon pilot can say bye bye to his ship. ecm is an all or nothing effect and people focus too much on the all and forget about the nothing."

3/25/2009,"considering how the csm has zero political power, creating a political party makes equally zero sense.it's an *advisory* council. it's not that you can influence the game design in such a way that would give those you claim for yourself to represent any advantage or greater consideration.this thread here proves once again how much egomania the csm is made up of and how little actual reason is behind it."
3/25/2009,what eve needs is an anti-metagaming party.
3/25/2009,"i don't think that's a fair statement, these folks get to meet ccp face to face and voice their opinions, some of it is bound to sink in even if the devs are actively trying to ignore them.there's no way to sit down and have a beer with someone and have absolutely zero impact."
3/25/2009,"except that, a party makes for a stronger route to communicate important issues the reps and being able to ascertain actual interest in the issue and ultimately be able to quantify that interest in terms of numbers of individuals who are aligned with that party. imo, might actually foster better ideas coming out of here. you let whatever party (ya know---whichever interest) privately debate/discuss/refine their ideas/issues before they bring it to the attention of the whole of the community. aside: a party might have the creativity and incentive to actually foster involvement, which i think everybody can agree is a good thing.i get that an idea like this might not work. but it certainly wouldn't cause any damage if it didn't."

3/25/2009,"apologies for the delay in replying, i was on a business trip..........i couldnt resist making the subject sound so outragous, it sometimes is the only way to illicit a reply.my point is communication csm's. yes, you may well be working hard, spending long meetings late into the small hours with ccp and feeling under appreciated by the inhabitants of eve. but many threads seemed to be opened over and over again and the same questions answered because pilots did not know that you guys had already been on the case. another thing, if there are petitions threads, and you know it is being looked into, post a link to the thread! if it is an issue that is not currently being looked at, dont be afraid to post a reply even if you just sit on the fence! look at the missile petition for instance - i cant see any csm response from that.however......i see a new 'issues' thread that has been stickied in assembly hall. this is certainly a start in improving lines of communication! i have just posted a link to the bombs issue to the stealth bomber petition in assembly hall. finally, the search engine that eveonline uses is absolutley rubbish. it does not allow pilots to research issues that have been previously raised and probably doesnt help csms in their cause.grz"

3/26/2009,for the love of god put this into the game ccp.naow!
3/26/2009,"i seem to recall a ccp dev mentioning that the pos code is huge. clearly a redesign would be a very large undertaking.that said they did write all that code in the first place so while a huge task it is a task they can manage else we would not even have pos.pos are clearly an integral part of eve now. they are not some fringe thing a few players dabble in but rather a fundamental basis in the game for thousands of players and numerous corps/alliances.and that despite pos (and by extension sov) mechanics being horrendous. i am sure ccp has a lot on their plate. even so this is well worth an effort. whatever changes may come this is absolutely money well spent.eta: as for csm it is their responsibility to bring this to the devs if the community demands it in sufficient strength. i think the devs will understand that the csm is merely carrying out their mandate and not hold it against individual csm members that they are bringing something the devs already said no to. the devs can of course say ""no"" again and be done with it but at least it sends the message to them that the playerbase keeps this particular issue high on their ""want"" list. as any business it behooves them to pay attention to what their customers want whether they can deliver on it or not."

3/26/2009,"would fix the issue without screwing over genuine disconnects. may want to change that to still disappearing after 15 minutes though. there's nothing really wrong with the current 15min timer, it's avoiding that timer which is the issue."
3/26/2009,"every turret is visible (even if you cannot see the difference between t1 and t2) but even now, with two types of launchers for every caldari combat ship we still cannot look at them to see what they are fitting.is that a torp/cruise raven?is that a ham/heavy drake?is that a rocket/standard crow?who knows.i know that's a 1400mm fit tempest.i also know that megathron has neutrons.oh, look at that beam zealot..anybody else wish ccp would put a few guys onto designing some launcher models?"

3/26/2009,"surprisingly good suggestion, gasp"
3/26/2009,"yes, good idea. people will finally start laughing at me when i fit assault missile launchers on the drake!in all seriousness, it would only make sense if it was implemented."
3/26/2009,"yes, it is time to move the damn missile away from the broken spawning in the center. i want visible missile launchers which launch missiles just like turrets have now.caldari need love."
3/26/2009,i'd like to see this idea taken the whole way and have every module (even the mid and lowslots) and rig on a ship visually represented in some way.
3/26/2009,"sorry lavista, i knew you supported it.i just saw it as we are all human and can sometimes forget so i was bumping it"
3/26/2009,supported. right click repair would make the process much smoother.
3/26/2009,this needs more attention!

3/26/2009,"i'm not an awox alt and i support this topic.aditionally, carriers should be capable of carrying!"
3/26/2009,i am not a support and i topic this alt alt.hurr durr.
3/26/2009,"i am declining to support this topic on the general principle that it sounds like a one person (+20 alts) whine fest.now, if you can convince drake to support it, i'll reconsider my position. but that's only because once mentioned that he was kind of sorta maybe starting to like my posts, and i want to encourage that sort of thing."
3/26/2009,"de - i already owe you a few drinks post-ambulation for some fantastic posts. sides, drake and i troll so much we've decided to form an alliance."
3/26/2009,yes...an alliance of trolls (cough not really a troll just bitter geeks who know too much for there own good but would rather scream instead of be polite) for the assembly hall!to arms!!!

3/26/2009,"previously one just had to anchor a can at the warp-in point of a moon and it prevented someone from putting a pos there until the can was destroyed. this mechanic was changed so that pos's ignored anchored cans. now it is common practice in high-sec to anchor a tower at a moon and just keep it offline to ""reserve"" or ""sell"" the moon. whereas previously with a can you could just destroy it with enough firepower without declaring war, with pos towers offline you have to declare war on the owner before you can attack it to clear the moon to use. i feel this mechanic is worse then with cans. destroying a large faction tower in high-sec from a corp in a huge empire alliance setup to make wars expensive is unfair for anyone who wants to use that moon.i would like to see some kind of mechanic be introduced to prevent this kind of moon reserving to make it fair for others to come and use the moon if it's not in use. either make a tower unanchor after a period of time from being offline (few weeks), or allow people to shoot offline towers without being in war in high-sec, or some other method."
3/26/2009,sounds like more support for the idea of being able to hack/salvage/unanchor offline towers - all good ideas.
3/26/2009,use a different moon if you don't want to blow up an offline tower?
3/26/2009,imho if your going to play stupid little jerk games like that (anchoring offlined towers to lock moons) you should be under penalty.the towers should be online and fueled to do that.if its offline... you have 24-36 hours or the tower self destructs along with all the other equipment if not become steal-able.simple..efficient... and forces people to be more active and not a bunch of lazy morons.
3/26/2009,"if you look at 0.7, 0.6 and 0.5 systems anywhere near jita, you'll find maaany with just offline towers, most of which is just a tower, no other modules. finding a free moon anywhere near jita is nearly impossible. thats where the issue lies. there is no incentive to unanchor a tower, if your not going to be running your pos, because it's so hard to get a moon, just leave the tower offline, the chances are someone will declare war and be able to blow it up isn't that great. i'm just proposing some sorta incentive to not leave it offline, like it will get blown up easier.another option would be to just make offline pos's subject to the system trash cleanup, so after a month they vanish. that would also solve it. if you don't online your pos for a whole month, you deserve it to vanish, imho."
3/26/2009,how about hiring mercs and let them blow up the offline pos?wouldn't that be possible?
3/26/2009,"well sure, but it seems to me that this is just defeating some of the purpose that allowing towers to ignore anchored cans did. the idea then was to prevent moons from being ""reserved"" or tied up. anchored cans have immense hp, but so does a tower. you just don't need to declare war to shoot a can."
3/26/2009,"fun fact: if a tower is offline, you can use close-range gank bs and the only thing you have to worry about is if the corp shows up to defend it~furthermore, there shouldn't be a stront timer because the tower is offline, so you can do it in one go."
3/26/2009,"true.. but you have to declare war to do so... fairly expensive if the corp is in one of those 500 corp empire alliances that exist only to make war's expensive. if you didn't have to declare war in high-sec, then i agree that would be a good solution. but having to declare war to clear a moon seems excessive. but maybe that's just me?"
3/26/2009,"i've even seen reserved moons in low sec, so i can imagine how bad it is in high sec. fix it."
3/26/2009,thumbs up from me.perhaps changing the mechanic so anyone canun-anchour a tower after it has been offline for something like 7 days?this may also have a benefit to 0.0 sov war by enabling some kind of ability to siege. locking the enemy logistics would become a strategic tool again.zos
3/26/2009,"well this isn't really an issue for 0.0, since a single dread would tear up any offline pos, but in high-sec you're limited to battleships at most, and you have to declare war. for small corps and such declaring war on a big alliance just to get a moon in high-sec that someone has forgot about, isn't using or is just ""reserving"" seems a bit excessive. when viewed against the game mechanics that was changed to prevent cans from ""holding"" a moon, this just seems to be the same issue. although the can now is more expensive, but it makes it less likely someone would shoot it due to having to declare war."
3/26/2009,"too bad your premise is completely wrong.. anchorable containers are protected as assets of the individual/corp and shooting them is the same as shooting anything else in possession of the player, and that is, will drop concord on you like a ton of bricks, if the 2-50 mil it costs for you to dec the corp that dropped 200+ mil to get the tower out there isnt worth your time to take it out then that is too bad."
3/26/2009,"war dec, hire mercs, ask the corp in question to take their tower down, find a free moon in a quiet area, go to lowsec. there are plenty of methods available, unfortunately as most of them involve interaction with other people they are not suitable for some of the more extreme mouth breathing carebear elements of highsec."

3/26/2009,"go pod some boggeril; they drop banjos. oh, wait...."
3/26/2009,"two trains of thought come to mind when i see this idea.i like it. the concept of smokey bars in a station where the pilots gather to drink and play games of chance or hammer out deals in ill-lit back corners makes sense. that and there are drugs in the game already which are pretty nasty. so they do have the precedent for this already established. the thing is that its all ""text-based"" at the moment, not actually being seen done and i think that will be the difference. people react badly to the concept of smoking and drug use and in ambulation it would be visible useage, so i could see thier point if they don't include it because it might be seen as them saying ""smoking & drug use is cool"". still .. i am an adult and i don't let videogames tell me what to do. so i vote yes. its a nasty nitty gritty space world and the ciggy hanging from the mouth as u play a game of cards in the seedy space station bar works for me."

3/26/2009,"e-peen, sure, but they're also the single best source of long-run intelligence about an enemy in the game. if you want to know combat info about a pilot, look up his killboard stats. plus, people like things like that - having a record ofm what they killed, knowing what valuable faction mods could have dropped but didn't, and this is still a game. also, watching pirates whine is just pathetic - nobody wants to see that."
3/26/2009,supported for exactly this reason.
3/26/2009,"""hey guys, we just sank a battleship, and the divers say it had 16"" guns, not 12"" like we thought. the americans caught a couple more a while back, posted the info on kriegsmarineclinic, told us they were kitted out the same. you think maybe the germans up-gunned their navy while we weren't looking?""""nah, let's just ignore it and assume things with no basis in fact instead. gathering intel is like cheating, right?""there's a reason i've never uploaded a kill to a killboard, and it's because i don't want to advertise what i fly and what i fit. if other people want to pass around their valuable information like beer at a frat-house kegger, though, i'm going to take advantage of it."
3/26/2009,"i'd rather people just said yes or no to be honest, people are using intel as a reason which is a bit funny tbh, the poster above me used a real life example of how some divers could find more guns on an enemy ship, surely it would be better to find out that info before the fight even happened? (which you are capable of in eve), to think you could find out a ships fit from an explosion in space is also ridiculous, lastly the above poster pointed out that you should not post your losses for all to see? i have just looked on battleclinic and i'm showing 384 kills and 98 losses, do you want to know how many of those i have actually posted? the answer to that is ""0"", i have never posted one kill or loss on that site and yet my set-ups are there for not only my enemies to see, but for anyone who cares to know, they have not had to work hard at all to find this info out. as i said earlier, this info is for e-peen and nothing else.------------------------------------------------------------"
3/26/2009,"no. killmails are fine. just ignore em if you hate them.there, simple enough?!--isaac"
3/26/2009,hate double posts
3/26/2009,"i say just yes and no when the debate is self-explanatory. this one isn't, and so i explain. dude, sci-fi game. you don't watch the pretty explosion, you send a probe out to pick through the wreckage and figure out what blew up. thing is, that's so automatic that they don't even ask you, that's the sort of crap your bridge crew does. they just sent you the mail through concord as a joke - given how often we kill our crews, they need a laugh every now and then. more seriously, there are two parties in every kill. both will, reasonably speaking, know what happened in the fight. if one publicizes it and the other keeps it secret, well, it's still public. again, i'll pull out the ww2 analogies(been playing too much hearts of iron lately...) - there were a whole lot of real, historical battles where one side publicized the results and the other didn't. of course, those featured a lot more lying and forcible repression of data than eve does, but the point still stands - if the japanese don't want to talk about midway because they screwed up, but the americans trumpet their monumental victory, then the germans read the battle report and still get a pretty good idea of what happened. they'll certainly know if the americans start talking about how one particular spot of armour is thin, that they should probably aim for that spot if they ever start fighting japan. the japanese don't like it much, but they don't have a whole lot of control over it. your opponents are posting their combat experiences for the world to see, and for better or worse, you're in it. like i said above, if they want to pass out valuable information for free, they can do that. you don't, i don't, but others do, and there's no sensible way we can stop them from doing so, either in the context of the universe or the context of the game. um, i just gave a concrete example of something else it's used for, and you agreed with my claim."
3/26/2009,leave my kill mails alone! some of us like stats. go f off!
3/26/2009,"it's a pvp game. killmails are how combat pilots keep score. scores are kept in every game. if anything, eve doesn't have enough combat statistics. stats are fun. i love the stats in games such as battlefield and i am not that great at that game."
3/26/2009,"thw killmails are not only matter of e-peen but also tells you who in your corp is not so good in pvp and how you can help him to get better. and the information getting form enemy killmail is very valuble information in terms of setup, location and playing time."
3/26/2009,worst idea since greedo shooting first.
3/26/2009,"now now, let's not say things we can't take back."
3/26/2009,"tl;dr: not just no, but hell no.longer version:while i can certainly understand the frustration of some players (myself included) at the protections that npc corps provide to those who aren't deserving of those protections (salvage thieves, macro miners, etc) the fact of the matter is there's no real reason to force players out of them.some players (again, myself included) really just want to be left the hell alone. i chose to leave an npc corp because frankly, i got tired of being bothered by all the stupid people in the corporate chat channel. i joined a small corporation so i could, in fact, be left more alone than i was before. sure i can be wardec'd now, but i'm willing to risk that to have more control over who's on the party line they call corp chat.other players genuinely enjoy the huge player base in the npc corp. they like helping out newer players, teaching them the ropes of the game, helping them choose a path, what have you, and that's a lot easier to do, in terms of communication, if you happen to be in the same corp.finally, some players are just plain lazy. it's not that they like being in an npc corp - they just don't want to go through the effort of finding a new one.the point is, none of these people should be forced out of an npc corp just because you don't think they should be allowed to stay there."
3/26/2009,"some of it is, some of it isn't. for example, you can't help out new players in corp chat if you're in a one-man. and more to the point, you're forced into being wardecable - sort of the point of this whole endeavour - which is one thing a lot of players will find very distasteful. i've known several people who have complained that they can't stay in a player corp for a month without getting decced, and that will drive people away pretty severely. also, i've never set up a corp myself, but doesn't it require some amount of skill and/or isk? i know it's not the month and a billion alliance-making takes, but it's more effort than a lot of people will want to put in.you also still haven't addressed the problem of having a corp with thousands of incoherent, undefended members that can be wardecced. i'm sure the privateers will love you, but seriously, it is a gaping flaw in your proposal, because at present you're not advocating vulnerability, you're advocating mass suicide."
3/26/2009,i kind a like this idea.i support.
3/26/2009,would you like a box of tissues with that?all i see is a pathetic whelp of a pilot who will not read... who will not think.. and who will not do research.all he does is answer arguments made by very intelligent pilots with stupid lame assed excuses and in total denial of reality.do i troll that? oh hell yes.
3/26/2009,"drake, i love you, but you troll everything."
3/26/2009,what can i say... i'm your evil twin brother.
3/26/2009,"normally i would vote yes on such a thing, but ever since the 94% skill nerf to new characters, i now have to say no."
3/26/2009,for the 100th time in the 100th thread that is merely re-saying the same thing for the 100th time.no.
3/26/2009,"no thanks. you shouldent have to force players to experience the game. its a little bit rude, and will not win any long term subscribers.the noob corps should be there to filter out those who dont want to play co-operativally, they will either discover that co-op play is more rewarding or they will abandon the game eventually, to set a time limit on this is, as mentioned rude."
3/26/2009,"in short, exactly the same thing that's been proposed 1000 times before and rejected by everyone. force players out of npc corps into a decable (own) corp if they want to or not(so we can shoot the crap out of the newbees, but just don't want to say that out loud)and again, the answer everybody gives is the same as the previous 1000 times. no thanksedit:the only way i could see something like this happening is with some kind of conscious decision from the player in question. for instance (and this is just an example), you can not train t2 skills while in a non-decale corporation or return to one if you have them. join a decable npc or player corp.you want to fly and/or use t2? you take the decision and face the music (or guns )something like that. but it has to be left up to the player, and be a decent level skill( or skillgroup)."
3/26/2009,"not supported.if they can't stay in these corps most will just quit, which would be bad for ccp and worse for you, they are your in-game customers, who else buys all the faction crap?edit: when it comes to high-sec alts, you may have a point."
3/26/2009,tl;dr : /thread
3/26/2009,what possible reason could (mission farmers) / (macro miners) / (all the other people who would be the main target of war decs) have for leaving the complete safety of npc corps?
3/26/2009,ah gee... lets think about that... hmm/me scratches beardwell... uh... how about the ability to use pos's?corp hanger?teamwork? larger gangs/fleets?wow... i guess that was so hard for you to figure out.... musta hurt like hell.glad i could be of help.
3/26/2009,95% tax.
3/26/2009,"yes, because that will clearly force all the miners into player corps."
3/26/2009,"each race's ewar compliments their tactics, except for caldari. here i draw out new caldari ewar that more closely follows the pattern of the other races.race: tacticprimary: long-range ewar generally used by only one racesecondary: short-range ewar often used by all racesamarr: big slow laser shipsprimary: tracking disruptor - decrease tracking on gallente and minmatar gunboats.secondary: nos/neuts - bomb capacitor for speed ships and active tanks.minmatar: fast ships and gunboatsprimary: target painter - increase signature on targetssecondary: webs - tackling from speed shipsgallente: close range blasters, drone boatsprimary: rsd - restricts engagement rangesecondary: warp disruption - forces engagementso the goal here is to model caldari ewar off of the other races' pattern, but tool them to benefit caldari engagement tactics.caldari: long range rails and missilesproposed primary: range dependent ecm - higher strength close up forces long range engagements, where caldari ships have an advantage. redesign the mechanic to look more like periodic focused bursts, where the frequency of instantaneously breaking locks depends on the strength of the jam, rather than the current chance-based timers.proposed secondary: inertia field - a new ewar module that decreases ship agility could be used to catch ships out of alignment and force tight orbits out to longer distances and subsequently a lower transversal.both effects give an advantage to range-independent missile systems and longer-ranged, slower-tracking railguns.edit: bumping mechanic needs to be changed if inertia field is to be implemented, too powerful side by side"
3/26/2009,supported... if only for the hilarity of inertia fielding autopiloting freighters.
3/26/2009,only if bumping is nerfed completelyotherwise... not supported.
3/26/2009,how so? it's a little vague and i don't see the connection to ewar.
3/26/2009,bumping is the current tactic for preventing a ship from aligning.if your going to make a module that nerfs your agility which slows your ships ability to align... then bumping is nothing more than pure greifing compounded by this module.you can't have it both ways...people won't use the module by default because bumping does the same job...but those who have the module will bump and jam the agility of a ship.balance mechanics would make it an utter nightmare.so in short... bumping goes... or your ewar idea goes.not both.
3/26/2009,"ok i see where you're coming from. the inertia field is more of a tactic for slow long range ships - mostly as an anti-interceptor module that counters fast tight orbits by reducing agility, possibly forcing close-range ships outside their optimal ranges.using the module to slow align-times is a secondary tactic - but i see how it can be a huge bumping buff. if bumping were changed so ships didn't spin around in different directions, that would fix the issue. good catch though, thanks.edit: also the inertia field isn't nearly as important as the change in ecm mechanicsedit2: yes i think bumping ought to be removed completely, the inertia field is a more consistent mechanic for slowing align times."
3/26/2009,im stunned... a goon who dosen't act like a goon.nicely stated chap.i'll keep an eye out for yah.
3/26/2009,"drake raises a good point, but it's ultimately minor. the overall proposal here, of making caldari ew fit into racial tactics instead of just being a win button, is a good one. i think that the issue of range can be solved by dropping optimal, increasing falloff, and maybe upping strength a little, which would make it a weapon for short-range engagement denial(so that they have to fight at long range to get around the jams), instead of long range pwnage. that's dangerous - at least the strength-increasing part - but something along those lines might be justifiable, and that seems to be what the devs are thinking, broadly, right now. in a similar vein rsd ranges need to go way up - you can't deny a long-range fight if your ew can't hit at long range. yes, this means that the ew range is exactly inverted from the range on the rest of the racial stuff, but that's actually kind of appropriate on the whole. as for the inertia field suggestion, it's interesting, but i wonder whether it'd actually see use or just feel like a waste of a module. i suppose if it was like -90% or something crazy it'd see use, but it's not a very powerful effect in most contexts, and i don't think it really does what you want it to do in terms of caldari racial tactics. pushing ranges out from 5 km to 10, and even then only if the enemy is trying to orbit, is not the sort of thing that a rokh is desperately looking for when a blaster mega jumps him. if you want to give caldari a secondary, consider smartbombs. it's a bit weird, and i'm not sure it'd work, but they're short-range weapons that make quick work of drones, which makes them a near-perfect weapon against the racial enemy. or perhaps, in a similar vein, make ecm burst a whole lot better, especially against drones. again, not sure if it'd work, but as theorymongering goes, it seems like a decent enough starting point."
3/26/2009,"i'd have to disagree with this as being fundamentally wrong tactics wise... most ships that can lock you in time to use the inertia field on you can easily drop a point on you, negating the necessity of bumping your ship around. while i do agree that bumping is a craptacular tactic, i don't think in correlation someone is going to use an inertial field instead of a point to keep you pinned down via bumping instead of just actually pointing you. most close range ships wouldn't need the module, and most long range ships wont want to be close enough to bump you anyways... i truly think this idea has merit."
3/26/2009,"interesting and well thought idea. however i agree with drake, remove bumping before we let this in. --isaac"
3/26/2009,"yes, unless they're a supercapital, sitting on a station, sitting on a gate, or sitting on a pos shield. escape is not always accomplished via warp."
3/26/2009,"most supercapitals use cyno jumping as their means of escape, for which bumping would have no effect..."
3/26/2009,"even if it is little bit older thread i think it would be very useful. as some people blocklist contains hundreds of blocked people due ot the recruitment channel, jita scams etc it would be very nice feature to be able to export and import the blocklist."
3/26/2009,where do i sign for my wtfpwnships?
3/26/2009,"i do see what you are suggesting, however all ships are not intended to point.there are obviously some ships designed to tackle, those get the primary, secondry, tertiary points. then whatever others in fleet should simply spread them aound. the larger the fleet engagment, the longer it will last, and the more targets your tacklers will rotate through to keep the victim ships held down.another issue here is that essentially you are giving every ship an extra mid. the balance of ships ability to tank etc could be seriously upset.thumbs down from me sorry.zos"
3/26/2009,lol. that was only a suggestion - i dare say the penalties should be significantly stiffer. my point was the op didn't mention penalties at all (that i noticed).
3/26/2009,"maybe shield tankers should get the residual boost this would give. as it stands now fc's rofl at the thought of someone bringing a shield tanker to battles. i myself have heard on numerous occasions, ""shield tanker! lol let him die!"" as it stands pvp is almost solely the realm of armor tankers.one of the main reasons behind this suggestion is to help bring back 1v1, small gang engagements and add some flavor to them. one on one's are hard to find and when you do its usually the same ships. this would add more variety to your engagements ... bigger box o' chocolates, if you will.yes i did. -300 calibration severly limits your further rigging options. plus, i have provided possible options for further penalties a couple posts ago."
3/26/2009,my amarr af alt would love any of these ideas. 1 extra midslot would be happiness.
3/26/2009,"supported, but only if the rig 1) gimps your cpu/pg 2) gimps your resists, and 3) is cheap and easy to produce. oh, and one for the low slot would be interesting too. of course, the 8-slot limit should still apply.but, as someone had said, the shield tanking for fleets would finally be (as) viable (as armor) with this implemented."
3/26/2009,"ok before i say this i want to say i do not have this skill trained, ofc this was a critical skill for probers before the update if it was all about time but now whats the point of this skill?trained to lv 5 which would take around 18/20 days would reduce your scan time of each scan by...wait for it...5 seconds!this skill got no love from ccp with the new update lol, oh and the worse thing of it is that this skill does not even open up any other skills or mods at any level, again ccp, where is the love?what i suggest for this skill is to increase the warp speed of probes by a large amount, if ccp insist on keeping this skills benefit time based then why not? 5 seconds off each scan is no incentive imo, then again maybe this is another one of those skill that is intended to go to the skill grave yard.so i say increase the warp speed of probes by 20% per level as well and the 20% to scan speed, i think this would encourage the training of it...maybe."
3/26/2009,"i didn't do probing before the changes, but my understanding is that it was nothing special then either. and as it is, given normal probe warp times, training it to 5 reduces your scan time by about 25%. remember, it's not 5 seconds, it's closer to a minute for an average scanning-out, since you have to do a dozen scans(roughly) to find what you're looking for. probably not worth training to 5, but it's hardly unique in that regard - we've already got 28 weapon specialization skills that fit that bill, what's one more? train it to 4 and be happy."
3/26/2009,"its useful. i see no problems with this skill. if your truly serious about scanning, you'll do it to five. if your not, you won't. no support.--isaac"
3/26/2009,"supported, the change really made this skill pointless, at least i only trained it to level 4"

3/26/2009,"i don't read missions and complexes much, but what it sounds like is that you're being flooded in fotm threads, which will die down fairly soon. even if wormholes remain popular, mechanic-discovery threads will go away, as will a lot of the ""okay, how does this work?"" threads. i expect it'll settle down within a month or so. if it's still flooded with threadson one topic that bump all the otehrs down, then i might support this, but for now i'd prefer to wait and see."

3/26/2009,"i'm sure it's a good starting point but the entire alliance structure needs to be made more efficient.as it stands an alliance is not it's own identity when it comes to contract/corporate/insurance payouts and this really needs to be addressed.the idea of alliance roles, with of course the ability to decide who has these roles for how long and when would enable alliances to further their member corporations ability and reach by allowing clear lines of what is alliance assets and what is corp assets. of course there would still be arguements but it should be a lot more black and white as to who (personal/corp/alliance) owns what (anything in game from a shuttle to the bpo capital set), and who can interact with items stored at an alliance office.the suggestions are a good start, but there needs to be more emphasis on the identity and ownership at the alliance level, so you have my support for what it's worth."
3/26/2009,"then what exactly would constitute proof for you? any evidence regarding the punishment of a ccp employee in regards to a game which is the intellectual property of ccp will, amazingly enough, have to come from ccp. and any communication with the public from ccp is going to be ""pr"" (thats 'public relations'), so therefore, any evidence that comes from them will be disregarded by you, according to your own arguments. therefore, where's the point in arguing with you, when you are going to deny proof when you see it?seriously, take yourself outside, learn some logic, then come back and argue. i don't know if lavista is right or not, but you are an idiot."
3/26/2009,and just how do you know they are even there?all this mumbo jumbo and conspiracy crap... no evidence..no proof./me dons tinfoil hat.seriously... you people are making me laugh so hard..its hilarious.
3/26/2009,"hah, this is too funny.a list of all my alts is publicly available on the forum.i don't post with alts. i believe in what i say and i'll happily smack somebody on their forehead if they are being too stupid, without using an alt."
3/26/2009,"so because ccp actively engages in conversation with us about key issues(which we of course can't publish or talk about), we are by definition useless?sorry, your logic is fundamentally flawed. it's nothing but circular reasoning."
3/26/2009,"technicalities differs from game to game. i was gm (game master) in a game where i ""only"" had access to commands to unstuck players, invisibility, teleport around etc. only the developers were able to alter stats and spawn items and npcs. i.e. ""a higher grade gm""'s. i wasn't aware that eve was at such low level that below-gm's can spawn items.. that's remarkable.hint, that's sarcasm. try see the point.i'm merely showing ccp's behaviour (a pattern that is the key to my whole proposal), and not discussing the case in hand. i made an effort to really point out that i tried to post it as neutral as possible.if you have to know, i supported the ghost training changes (it's posted in those threads, go read if you want).it was marketed to include a ""game time card"" (the box says 60 day game time), as well as ""advanced career guide"" (which in the box is constantly referring to the online guide that already exist), and a ""vip pass"" (which is a pamphlet with info of how to use the buddy program on this site) as well as a ""special edition ship"".you could argue that the guide and vip pass is delivered as promised, the game time card and ship however isn't, as they're ""tied"" to each other. you have to use the gtc on a fresh account to get the ship, and you can't even use a buddy program invite (i.e. fresh account) use the gtc for this. thus, circumventing the free trial. i.e. effectively a loss of parts of the 60d time.so basicly you have no freedom to chose how to use the gtc. technically the things are delivered, but the text (the communication to the customer) is a work-around. ""buy 2 and get 3rd for free (but the first two had their prices upgraded so essentially you pay for 4)"". technically correct, horribly customer communication, and treatment. you don't get what the box implies that it delivers.again, the key here is to show ccp's behaviour/communication towards customers.you are being silly and didn't read my post. the situation in itself is not the issue, i'm arguing ccps behaviour. it's very simple. read the rules for name changes. it's clearly stated noone will get a name change, unless the name is offensive etc. i didn't ignore the case that a single gm might be behind this. it's perfectly in line with what i posted - poor customer communication from ccp. rogue, or inexperienced gm's? that should be subject to proper information/introduction. the company are responsible for their employees. they are responsible for their eduction and behaviour.space adding up, posting the other replies in following post ->"
3/26/2009,"i didn't read the nyt article about the csm fyi. at the time of the t20 incident i was very curious to follow how ccp would treat this case. in the game where i was gm we had multiple situations where gm's (of higher/lower levels) were involved in several situations similar to this.my interest here was not only as a player regarding ""game balance"". i know that's a subjective thing. the case i followed here was to see how ccp would try solve this. again, i'll try avoid discussing the cases itself, so let's get to the red line that goes through all the things i presented here; ccp's communication with their customers/players.in light of the t20 incident, ccp promised us an internal affairs division, as well as the csm ""to add transparency"". i remember very little else of what was promised back then, but i know that's the exact key phrase they used regarding csm. ""transparency"". csm was supposed to deliver players an insight and control mechanism to see that ccp did their best to avoid another t20.the rest is an after-construction. i'm pretty sure both you and me see why. ccp wanted a solution, came up with this ""cool idea""; and then let it get its own life and develop. it's the exact same approach they do to eve, which is part of why it's a successful game. however, while this is innovative when creating a game, it's horrible for customer relations as it's a 100% certain that the promised product will never be delivered (since it has its own life, evolve, and change).csm has run it's course, it's about to shut it down. it never got off to do what it was supposed to, and it evolved into something that isn't needed.perhaps if you instead of trying to find arguments on the particular cases, but instead reading the whole picture that is provided - the red line/theme going through, then you'd see what the post was about.i admit it was a bit long, but i clearly made an effort not to discuss the single cases. the details in them isn't interesting. what's interesting is how ccp respond to it. the rest would just be arguing semantics back and forth and noone would ever be ""right"" since it's a matter of opinions.what's interesting is to see how ccp however really could use some help on how to address big changes to their customers. and how csm is doing little of significance, being virtually useless and throwing away money that could be better spent.that's what this post is about."
3/26/2009,"i wonder where you got the idea of conspiracy theory. did you read my post? i don't think there's a conspiracy anywhere, and if someone is trolling here, it's you."

3/26/2009,"and political parties make csm politics much more interesting, let's not forget. i'm still concerned that by having a carebear party you'll end up with innately restrictive practices being forced on the csm to give to ccp - ""remove meta 0 loot from missions/rats"" would harm the isk supply of independent mission-runners at the expense of t1 manufacturers, for example, and therefore make private enterprise that much harder. again, i am all for a party that campaigns for private enterprise, sandbox gameplay and other liberal values."
3/26/2009,"due all respect, i think that important aspects to the issue in question is being ignored in your argument.there's many aspects which has to be considered when we discuss that very issue.1. do mission-runners make enough isk?2. should they make less?the whole idea is that t1 manufacturing is not worth it, because of the abundance that comes from loot.if the carebear party is made up by smart people like issler, then i'm certain that it won't end up with innately restrictive practices."
3/26/2009,"this is my point. i have nothing against advocacy groups, but when you say things like ""i think the party could make its goal to maintain the freedom to enjoy eve with the widest variety of styles of play"", you're obviously misrepresenting the truth of the situation. your goal is not to defend a variety of styles of play, it's to represent one style of play. there's nothing wrong with that, but please be honest with yourself. also, the reason nobody cares yet is that we still have a week before nominations even close. we have more serious, declared candidates in the race now than we did at this point last time. my understanding of the reasoning for this party is improved voter relations, not improved ccp lobbying. it doesn't require the csm to have a huge amount of power for it to be effective in that role."
3/26/2009,"doc, all due respect, but attempting to defeat a fundamentally good idea (such as reliable representation for at least a moderately sized portion of the player base) by putting an idea into their mouths and then playing kick the can with it is hardly a fair litmus test as to whether there would be any value in creating a 'party'.especially, when i would think with the proper leadership---your average so called 'carebear' will be infinitely better armed with information and guidance, thus producing infinitely more realistic and constructive issues. hersh,i don't get it. spell it out for me. seeing as the basics of carebearism seems to be ""leave me alone, i'm trying to build a sand castle here"", it's highly unlikely that their interests will otherwise disrupt anybody else's game---unless of course somebody else's game is harassing people who just want to do their own thing with some friends---at which point----ho hum, advocacy works/ everybody wins."
3/26/2009,"how left alone should they be, though? there's a lot of bearish miners out there who think that can-flipping mechanics are fundamentally broken, for example - leaving them alone is possible, but it'd negatively impact the gameplay of the flippers. or a bit more to the point, look at ankh's campaign to nerf suicide ganking in csm 1 - a carebear csmer(don't let the fw stats fool you) who used her position to launch a direct attack at a pvp career choice and succeeded. now, i'm not saying that her position was wrong - on the contrary, i largely agreed with it - but it was a bear's argument that did negatively impact other people. remember the old chestnut about this being eve online and not hello kitty online - harassment is a perfectly normal and acceptable part of eve's gameplay. yes, it can be tweaked up or down, but those harassers are playing eve too, and their choice of sand castle to build(in this case, one of delicious salty tears and the occasional loot drop) is just as legitimate as yours. the two do come into conflict sometimes, and that has to be acknowledged."
3/26/2009,"great! hop back into those trees so hopefully we can all miss the forest!look, i'm not here to debate what the appropriate can flipping mechanic is nor do i, at this point, maintain any opinion on exactly how ""left alone"" folks should be in high sec when they're mining, nor to even judge a definition of left alone. it's overly detailed and not pertinent to the discussion. it's probably an argument that's been had here a thousand times and with bringing it up as a universal straw man, it will probably be had a thousand times more. what's actually being talked about here is what, if any, value might their be to creating a streamlined point for players of similar ilk to constructively provide their interests to one or more csm members. save your can flipping stuff for when/if this theoretical organization materializes and when/if they even bring this up in their internal discussions and when/if they decide to bring it to the attention of the general community."
3/26/2009,"actually, i want to make sure i understand what's being said here hersh:you're not suggesting that jetcanners (herein, ""potential victims"") don't have a right to as much vocal and meaningful advocacy as the flippers do, right?i don't think that's what you're saying, but i want to be sure."

3/27/2009,instead of -cap/second t2 long range ammo should give a bonus to cap/recharge. its not a lot to ask since most fleet bs lack exactly that - cap. and also because there is already the low-damage of long range ammo's and gimped tracking. so that kind of small bonus would make it more usable.perhaps the tracking of short range lazer/blaster/missile(expl velocity here) should be looked into as well.or some sort of other bonus or something would certainly be a nice addition to t2 ammo.
3/27/2009,"can't support this topic as it's unclear what is being asked for....i would definitely support a buff for *shortrange* t2 ammo - the reason it's so cheap is not because it's easy to produce - it's bacause there is no demand due to the fact that it has crippling drawbacks for no noticable benefit - as it stands if you're using void / hail etc, you're doing something wrong!i would not support nerf of faction ammo however - and since that is a concievable inference of the thread title i can't support it."
3/27/2009,"another additional note is that you could potentially add an option to allow current customers through the shield. this would avoid having to hand out passwords, and deal with the constant re-requests for forgotten passwords."
3/27/2009,good idea but i don't think it will happen in this form.i would rather see a silo system employed. everything goes into and out of the silo.the corporation can still anchor silos inside cause they own the pos but the old rules applybut for non corp membersthe only way to prevent abuse would be to have the silos anchored outside of the shields.the person who wants to rent anchors there silo and agrees to a connection charge to the research platform.so the silo would be owned by a person not a corpthis way protects the researcher and is a much simpler method. you simply pay for the connection charge when you insert a job and you get disconnected when it is complete.and as far as all those silos you could make a research beacon of grid from the pos. so you anchor the beacon and everyone who wants to rent goes to the beacon and anchors the silo there. ccp can even limit the number of anchored silo's.and for those that want to spam have a count down say 15 days after your job ends your silo gets unanchored if you don't que a new job. so you forget about your silo and someone can steal it.of course you would never employ this system in lowsec or 0.0 but then again why would you even want too. so yes you are on the right track but no to your current implementation.
3/27/2009,"i don't see how the researcher having to haul and anchor a structure, one that is unprotected outside the bubble, is better for the researcher. the same amount of effort would still be required on the billing side for your 'connection fee' as a simple locker rent would be, only this allows the pos owner to control placement/options better. what risk do you see the researcher having under my storage array idea? and how would them using their own facility unprotected connected to the owner's pos be any better?"
3/27/2009,"i support this, not because it's a good idea, but because it is silly. also, the inevitable rage-fest that would ensue would be great to watch."
3/27/2009,"voting in support. as many have said, chribba has done way more for eve-online than the average player, and things of this magnitude are acceptable i believe, since it will really have no effect on the supply of veld or the game mechanics. just like the veldnaught, this will be a shiny toy for people to ooo and ahh over, and thats not a bad thing."

3/27/2009,"/massive signed for original posti'd do it just a wee bit different, though. i think that the nag is quite capable of being quite the pain-dealer on its own without extra/different guns.naglfar: 1 extra mid, no change in lows, significant cpu boost, moderate cap boost.-it's possible to almost permatank a naglfar, but it's not easy and you need several faction mods to do it, and even then, other capitals do it much better and easier.nidhoggur: 1 extra mid, 1 fewer low (like how it was before), significant cpu boost, moderate cap boost.-this is the wierdest capital. it gets bonuses to shield transfers, but its cpu suffers so bad that it can't fit but one if you're lucky. trying to fit a capital shield xfer with a shield tank on a nidhoggur is like trying to pull teeth on a sabretooth tiger, to boot. it's doable, but again, you need several faction mods to do it where with a chimera such things aren't necessary. here, permatanking is also possible, but again, it needs to be fully rigged and have faction mods to do the job to even pray to come close to the efficacy of other carriers. tanking aside, its bonuses are geared toward being a logistics freak, but again, that cpu issue gets in the way of its ability to fit a tank and logistics mods.p.s. - capital modules should be 500-1000 m3. not 4,000 m3.edit - the main idea here is to have all capitals be a somewhat linear progression in terms of fitting, since they are aside from the minmatar ones. mids and lows of: dreads (from amarr to caldari) - 4/8, 5/7, 5/6 (should be 6/6), 7/5. carriers: 4/7, 5/6, 5/6 (should be 6/5), 7/4. cpu and cap issues arise from inability to fit appropriate modules to compete with other ships of the same class in any respective area. if anything, the nid's bonuses to logistics necessitate a hard, stable tank, since it is essentially useless unless on the front lines."

3/27/2009,"i'll say the same thing i've said a hundred other times. if system scanning tools are developed to the point where local is unnecessary, then i favour the abolition(well, delayed mode-ing) of local. local is a stopgap intel tool, and it wouldn't be used like it is under a sufficiently improved system. that said, given that those scanning tools do not yet exist, trying to extend this to known space is premature. it's fine for the funky space to be genuinely hard to find people in, but not for the real world."
3/27/2009,i agree with yamamoto-san.

3/27/2009,"the ability to know i am in a system whether i have been seen or scanned, is whats kept me out of 0.0 for the most part. sorry but this is a needed addition, you shouldn't show up on a local cortex unless you choose to say something.use your combat scanners, and kill the localspy."
3/27/2009,"great idea we need more mission farmer alts, and i need some free kills for my cloaking gangs."
3/27/2009,"i support this idea,on the conditions that:1) we get scanning tools that make local unneeded in 0.0. 2) local stays in low-sec and npc-0.0 but in delayed mode (you only show up 30 seconds after you jumped into system or when you start moving).3) hisec no change at all.doh forgot to klick the support icon/erem"
3/27/2009,"1) autoupdating scanner ui, maybe a mini-ui might be nice.2) no3) sure"
3/27/2009,"no.why?because in ""normal"" space entry and exit to the system is governed by jump gates, which broadcast the info on a system-wide basis (which is why you can gank someone somewhere, fly to another gate and still be denied permission to jump until your aggro is clear)this information is available to all ships within the sphere of influence of those gates hence jumping into system leads to your appearance in local.w-space is accessed through unstable fractures that are not connected to any technological equipment that will broadcast this information - this is why you only see another player when they open comms by talking, you probe them out, scan them down or get visual contact on the same grid.the only time i would support ships being able to jump into ""regular"" space and not appear in local is covert ops-class ships that enter via covert cynosural field (i.e. if they enter via jump gate they appear in local)"
3/27/2009,"only with suitable scanning substitutes. ccp has made good progress in improving scanning, but it's not ready to replace local yet.that said, i'm going to support this because i want to see what ccp can come up with..."

3/27/2009,this.
3/27/2009,by that logic anyone that enters through a wormhole shouldn't show up either. i still support 100% delayed mode in local in 0.0 it's a lot of fun in w-space picking up a ship on scan that wasn't there before and trying to figure out if it's friend or foe and wondering if they've spotted you. it also seems to benefit/hinder pve'ers and pvp'ers about the same.
3/27/2009,"funny, because when you jump from w-space to k-space you instantly appear on local"
3/27/2009,"the simplest solution would be to make it so that you never show up on the communications channel unless you say something. period.it's a communications tool, not an intel tool. it only became that i suppose out of ccp's negligence. the most logical system, for high-sec, low-sec, 0.0, and wormhole space, is that you never show up on a communication network unless you fraking communicate. any other system is ******ed. does this need to be implemented with boosted ship scanners? yes. but it still needs to be universal. - adding a second support."
3/27/2009,"while i utterly hate using missiles, this idea is the best, sweetest idea i've ever heard, and something i've wondered for a long, long time. massive signage."
3/27/2009,"not supportedi would rather not have my enemy see what missiles im using... heck im already using a well nerfd weapon system, why give even more reasons not to use em"
3/27/2009,it would look cool and be consistent. you are a bitter troll.supporting this great idea.
3/27/2009,delicious. yes to visible missile module models.
3/27/2009,signed
3/27/2009,agreed and it's long been missing. maybe they'll get implemented when defender missiles are fixed...
3/27/2009,"definitely supporting this. most ships with 'launcher models' don't have anything beyond some holes that are only gonna be pointing at the target on average 1/129600th of the time, and it'd make life easier for scouts to actually see 'oh, it's a torp raven, close range' instead of 'oh, raven, could be 30km limited or 150km+ limited *flips coin*'."

3/27/2009,"well, homeworld 2 had more elaborate missile effects almost a decade ago.i think it is time to update missiles in eve and implement launchers in a suitable way.ships shooting smokeballs from inside their hull just doesn't look good and feel right."
3/27/2009,"yes please, thanks."
3/27/2009,definitely supported.

3/27/2009,sweet! free drinks. count me in!
3/27/2009,but does it come with cheese?
3/27/2009,i'm not an awox alt and i support this topic.
3/27/2009,"first, a bit of a preface. according to my source, dss probes were supposed to have a starting strength of 5 instead of 20, and someone goofed. fine. however, i also learned from that same source that when you run a scan with probes, it only returns the four best results for any given result. i confirmed this by using 4, 6, and 8 dss probes around a site that i had scanned down and bookmarked via other means. the results, while consistent with this information, were maddening. at minimum scan range, with 11 strength on the probes after skills, ship, and rigs, the sig's maximum accuracy was slightly less than 25%. it remained at that for all three scenarios. furthermore, i took the painstaking time to arrange the probes in tetrahedral (with 4), octahedral (with 6), and dodecahedral (with 8) configurations, providing the greatest possible quadrangulation. even at 32 au - enough to cover the whole system from each side in four directions - the signatures in the system bounced around like a ping pong ball, so the probes' inherent accuracy has been severely hampered by the 75% drop in strength. i believe i referred to it as a ""nerfbat to the balls.""my main issue is not the strength of the probes (though it was nice while it lasted), but the fact that only 4 results are used. no scientist in their right mind would ever think to just toss out extra data points, however precise they may or may not be, so long as they referred to the same general area or range. when we're talking about probes, each probe knows approximately how far away an object is within a given error. using only 4 results does indeed give you a point result, but if you're able to add more scans from different directions to resolve the error, hypothetically you could eliminate the error almost entirely if you simply quadrangulated from many directions. the result might not be perfect, but it would be fairly accurate, and you could move the probes closer to the result to give a perfect hit.in short, all i request is that every probe that a player can control be able to be used in the determination of a given signature's position, not simply the ""four best."" also, a base strength of 10 wouldn't hurt, since these probes are supposed to be ""highly advanced"" and do require astrometrics 5. however, the first half of the proposal is the most important."
3/27/2009,"argh. clearly, i do support my own topic.yarrsticks."
3/27/2009,it sucks that additional probes beyond 4 does nothing to improve the signal.
3/27/2009,"this whole probing system is designed around stepping everything down by a factor of 2 each time until you hit 100%. deep space probes just let you start 3 steps higher, which is useless in small systems and necessary in large ones. personally, i thought the pre-nerf deep space probes were a great reason to go for astrometrics 5, which i likely won't bother with now, but it does fundamentally make more sense. you shouldn't be able to achieve final scan results with deep space probes, you should need to swap down to something with better resolution. as for your point about the four best, i'll say two things. one, you're clearly in the hard sciences, because the soft sciences seem half the time to be all about throwing out data points to make the world fit the model(i don't mean that badly - you simply cannot analyze broad trends in a field like history or economics without making subjective decisions on what counts as a legitimate data point). secondly, while triangulation is a hard science in the real world, it's a game mechanic in eve. the added probes protect you from deviation and give you significantly better results on the whole, but they want low-skill characters not to be too badly disadvantaged under this system, and so they capped the number of probes that contribute directly. it may not make physical sense(although, to be fair, it may - the data coming from these probes is obviously incredibly loose at higher ranges, which you can see as you watch probes jump around by multiple au between scans, and throwing out data may sometimes be reasonable), but it makes gameplay sense, and that's 95% of what ccp cares about."
3/27/2009,"i think the issue is more profound than the op has it.as noted in this thread in the game development forum deep space probes (dsps) are no better than core probes apart from a greater probe range and they warp faster (and really...the warp faster thing is not a big deal at all). the greater probe range is hardly useful at all as the 32au on the core is plenty most times (simply use more to cover a bigger system if necessary...a trivial task). indeed the core probes are actually better since they can narrow the scan range down more than dsps. at the same range they are the same strength.so, you train a 14(ish) day skill to l5 for what? more expensive probes that take up more room in your cargo hold?to make matters worse apparently the sisters deep space probe is now precisely the same as the normal dsp (or so others have suggested...i have not checked).as probing existed before the nerf it was a hassle to find what you were looking for in a system since the game nicely forgets all your previous results on each new scan. however, the dsps made it somewhat tolerable as they were. now it has become a hell of probing down everything to exceptional accuracy and pinning it and then doing that again and again. boring and tedious barely cover it. timesink understates it. nightmare is closer to the mark.it seemed one of the main issues with dsps as they were was they were very overpowered when finding player ships. no question that needed a nerf. rather than a nerf though, one which would have reasonably made dsps not good at probing for ships but kept their probing of signatures useful, we get this ham-fisted hatchet job.truly, looking at the issues of gutting a l5 skill so it is worthless to train and making the ""better"" probes literally no better than their lesser counterparts and to toss the whole need for an expanded launcher, is nothing short of astonishing. csm please ask ccp for their thoughts on this one soon. at least give the players a sense if this is exactly how ccp envisioned this or if they (what i am hoping) merely gutted the probes as a very short term fix to avoid the ship probing imbalance on those and mean to provide a more balanced version soon (and not trademarked ""soon"" but actual, honest to god ""soon!"")."
3/27/2009,i bolded the part you missed. there's no concord response in 0.0 space.
3/27/2009,"unless empty moons are so hard to find, i'm not sure why people are concerned about it. what is the main reason for a hi sec pos? a research lab? if so why do you have to be close to a market hub to set your pos up at?"
3/27/2009,concord really should not protect off-line pos
3/27/2009,"agreed i would prefer the un-anchoring method myself.i would say 15 days and your tower gets unanchored.maybe a week but no less then that.oh i also like the idea of no concord for offline pos'sso both, your pos goes offline it is considered space junk after 24 hours and someone can take it out.or they can wait for it to unanchor in the 7 to 15 day period and take it all."
3/27/2009,"you seemed to miss the part where she said that she cant shoot their towers without a war, so we're obviously not talking anything ""but"" high sec towers."
3/27/2009,again.... if the tower is offline for 24 hours...no more than 36.it self destructs or becomes steal able.you people who ask for 1 week or more.... your just making the problem worse.the idea is to only hold moons your actively fueling for.. not squatting them like a bunch of jackasses.if you want the moon that bad.. fuel the damn tower.otherwise leave.
3/27/2009,well rl comes into it unfortunately and that is why i say 24 hour and it can be destroyed and then one week and it can be stolen. i really don't like the idea of it just self destructing that is too easy and not eve.that does not create a problem cause if you want the moon that bad then destroy it.if not then wait the time and see if you can steal it and make a profit.
3/27/2009,"how bout if somebody else wants the moon that badly, they kill your tower... as you've obviously invested more time and money into that moon at that point than they have... and working for rewards is what eve is about."
3/27/2009,"rl is a poor excuse.pos's should be employed by people who can use them.... that means a corp.you get a partner to help out.end of discussion.also... read my damn post... i said ""stealable"" as an option as opposed to self destructing.it is perfectly logical and feasible considering the nature of eve.you leave a can out there in space and its open to the world.. what do you expect?it's gonna get tipped.pos's are a a rampant problem... stop making excuses that favor the problem and come up with solutions that are rational.1 week is too long... and that would mean anyone could fuel it for a singular day and wait a week.at least with 24/36 hours..if you snooze.. you lose."
3/27/2009,*grumbles @ stupid eve forums glitch*
3/27/2009,i am not disagreeing with you i am saying both options.24 hours you can destroy it. (you will have to work to get that moon)and 1 week is becomes unanchored and can just be picked up and stolen.do you consider this an unreasonable option for a free 100 million to 1.1 billion isk pos ????
3/27/2009,"the problem with your logic as ive already said... people can exploit that.most won't know that the pos is offline until they start looking around.by allowing it to stay there for 1 week... they can refuel it and bring it back online.and allow them to ""destroy"" it implies a number of problems... does this mean they have to war-dec the corp?just allowing anyone to destroy the pos is not what i call a good idea... its a can of worms at best.does the owner get aggro to fire back??too many holes there...there needs to be a stern mechanic here... either you maintain your pos or it gets turned into space garbage or robbed.you can suggest all you want as far as solutions go... but 1 week is too long imo.few months ago i would agree... but now.... so many people want in on that territory.... its utterly insane today."
3/27/2009,"edited for correctionsagreed, offline poses should, after a certain period of time, become legally fair game for anyone to either shoot at or appropriate. no one should be reserving moons that they can't use.from what i can see, poses near hi-sec are primarily used for moon mining, because that's where the money is. valuable moons shouldn't be beaugarded if they're not being used. unused poses are not uncommon. it can be hard to find unoccupied moons of enough worth to justify fueling them in some areas. and naturally, corps will find it preferable to erect poses as close to civilization, which makes unused poses very frustrating.now, i do think that a corp in this situation is currently well-advised to simply relocate to a less convenient part of space. but it seems silly to me that moons can be reserved in this way, and often forgotten about."
3/27/2009,i would say yes the corp can defend its pos.and you should be able to defend yourself.hmm a can a worms yes but i think maybe it could provide something interesting @ the same time.say corp a lets there pos run out of fuel.corp b comes in and starts taking it out after the 24 hour timer comes in to play.corp a comes in to defend.when corp a fires @ corp b a instant war dec starts for 24 hours.both sides can open up on each other to fight over the moon.the price for letting the pos run out of fuel and the price for wanting the moon right now.concord will not get involved.and if the corp is in a alliance ?personally i would rather keep this on a corporation level as it is a corporation issue not an alliance issue.but i doubt the mechanics would allow it which is a shame cause it should.and yes someone can keep fueling the pos every other day but it still shows intent and would quickly become a pain in the ass to keep it up.and you could always just war dec them and be done with it.in most cases though i think more pos's will just get destroyed without the owner lifting a finger.need to think on this more.but i don't agree with a 24 hour timer and the pos just goes boom or can be stolen.too easy especially cause how this would effect pos's in 0.0cause if you let a pos run out of fuel you have to un-anchor everything else before it can be re-anchored.and you would be surprised how many major alliances in 0.0 and low0sec have issues keeping pos's fueled.
3/27/2009,"too bad there are no mineable moons in high sec or this might have merit. there are absolutely no minerals within moons in high security space, generally the only purpose of a high security pos is running labs for research, invention, and from what i can tell, t3 construction at this point."
3/27/2009,"sorry, you're right - i had confused myself and misspoke. near high-sec is what i mean - the barely-low-sec areas as close as possible to hi-sec. there are enough moons in real hi-sec that crowding isn't a serious problem there, and particular moons aren't more desirable than others since it makes no difference what moon you're orbiting."
3/27/2009,a: your making a simple solution more complicated. 24 hour war-dec is not a good way of resolving this issue.b: this is just high sec... call it a concord policy... much like not being able to anchor secure cans in systems higher than a certain sec level.c: make it 36 hours then... but not a week. 2... 3 days at most.1 week is too long.at least your thinking this through...and for that i respect you. but your compromising the balance in the process.
3/27/2009,"looks like some alliances are having to re-learn empire...but, i also agree, there should be a way to hack/steal highsec towers. however, you could always find an offline small with a one man corp and wardec them with an alt corp running amarr gank bs. it won't take long and will be cheap and easy. you can even turn it into a profitable venture if you can find towers that still have modules at them."
3/27/2009,smoking cigs/weed/crack and drinking should be in eve. it'll definitely make spinning spaceships a lot more fun. especially if there are fun visuals added in with getting high.
3/27/2009,i like keeping records of me getting pawned and podded
3/27/2009,mercenaries. pretty much nuff said.in detail:mercs that can prove they did their job make money. killmail = proof.mercs that cannot prove anything don't. no killmail = no proof.
3/27/2009,"first off people don't have to report kill mails to a public kill board.but they do and that system was around long before the kill mails even existed.so the current system is a convenience to those that wish to report what they kill nothing more.so removing it would serve no purpose other then aggravate those that use the mechanic.and for the rest of us that don't bother with it, we just don't bother to look @ it.so rather then hearing wining about why it was removed from those that use it, and for me cause i would rather have ccp working on actual issues then this i say no leave it as is."
3/27/2009,killmails are a good idea. they tell you your contribution to the fight and who contributed to your demise. otherwise all combat tactics would be totally theoretical with no one actually knowing what worked and what totally failed.the problems that need to be addressed and things that need to be added are.1. logistics contribution to damage taken.2. hitpoints transferd by logistics 15 minutes before rr ship dying.3. a solution to fake mails.neither of which justify the removing of killmails. an act that would create many more problems.
3/27/2009,"this is a serious issue which hasn't been addressed properly although there has been talk about it for god knows how long.the underlying problems are:regular cloaking devices (non-covert ops cloaks) and the mechanics that dictate that a cloaked ship is impossible to scan down. aggro timer when engaging anything. currently we have the 15 minute aggro timer when you engage a player ship and log off but aggroing npc ships is not taken into account, this being a major issue when a person spontaneously logs offspontaneous logoffs when being aggressed by npcs, like mentioned abovethe issue with non-covops cloaking devices has been raised many times already and it has been acknowledged, yet nothing has been made to correct it. at the same time scanning mechanics have been completely revamped, scanning out ships is now more time consuming than ever before while a simple module like a prototype cloaking device can effectively make you invulnerable. effectively what this means is that in a supposedly harsh environment of 0.0 a player can simply warp off and cloak using a non-covops cloak before anything can catch it. a battleship with a prototype cloak can warp off an asteroid belt and cloak (and therefore become invulnerable) before any ship can warp in to the belt and tackle the battleship. i'm fine with being slow and having crappy reactions but when catching a battleship on a belt 1,000,000 km off the gate you're jumping in from with an interceptor is considered impossible there must be something fundamentally wrong.the biggest problem of course is the non-human factor in most of the forementioned cases. the player is using a macro/bot of some kind and therefore can react way before a human on the other side can react. even this i can still accept but the fact that they do this and then use a fundamentally flawed mod like the prototype cloak to become invulnerable is just unacceptable. the other variant that we've seen is that the player simply logs off as soon as another player enters the system and with no proper aggro timer present from shooting npcs the player is impossible to catch, especially after making ship scanning even harder than what it used to be.summarizing the post, scanning has been made more time consuming than before while no aggro/logoff/cloaking mechanics have been altered. this has been unbalanced for a long time and is even more unbalanced now. the biggest problem i see here is the macros and the current mechanics that make these macros possible and profitable to use. this has to change, either by seriously affecting the penalties of fitting a non-covert ops cloak, making the non-covert cloaks finally scannable or by changing the logoff/aggro mechanics. something just has to be done."
3/27/2009,"i hate to sound like a **** here but....isn't it called a ""cloak"" for a reason? the only improvement i can see to your situation is a drastic increase in either the difficulty to produce cloaks of all types - or a drastic increase in training times to use them. i'm also not sure what you were getting at with the log-off mechanics. ships that have logged off can still be scanned down for something like two hours i believe?maybe i'm just wrong, feel free to correct me. or clarify this some more, and i'll support."
3/27/2009,"yes, i just hate paying the corporate tax when i sell my minerals....oh wait..."
3/27/2009,fixed.
3/27/2009,lolfunny funny.
3/27/2009,"do not support.before this issue can ever even have a chance of happening ccp would have to fix a number of other issues:1. the incredibly cheap cost of a war-dec, they are basially free at the moment.2. the corp jumping thing. if people get kicked out of npc corp then they will just join corps that have enough alts with their own corps that they can basically just leave altcorp1 and jump to altcorp2, and when that is decced jump to altcorp3 and so on.neither of these things will be changed/fixed anytime soon and both would have to be addressed before this could ever have a chance of happening.also, i am of the opinion that if you want to be in a npc corp and just play the game highsec worry free fine. the only people that want to dec highsec corps are the ones that have trouble in low/0.0 anyway."
3/27/2009,"yeah. mission farmers. macro miners. they sure need pos, teamwork and large fleets.look how stupid you are, troll."
3/27/2009,"mining doesn't make much isk now anyway, i can assure you most non-alts in npc corps do nothing but run missions all the time."
3/27/2009,"you're...you're not a miner, are you? have you ever even turned on a mining laser? one of my corpmates makes enough from mining in his hulk (largely solo) to pay for his account in plexes with some left over. it may not be ""much isk"" by your definition, but ffs 350+ million a month ain't loose change either."
3/27/2009,"darth vader voice - ""you underestimate the power of the mining laser"""
3/27/2009,noexamplesi am a pirate and have no to be associated with anybody i am privateer and do missions and whatever else to make a living.i am a independent miner and don't wish to be associated with anybody.i am scammer and a pick-pocket (not sure how you would do that but you get the idea)i am spy.etc etc etc.i would love the ability to remove myself from any corporation though.it would be nice to see people with a corporation identifier of none.now that would be better then a npc corp and would show a personal choice.
3/27/2009,"actually, i am- 'bearing in hisec right now, mining veld with a hulk/exp rigs/t2 & crystals etc, and solo a couple hours mining nets me from 6-10 mil. if i mission, i more than double that.but to make enough to buy several plexes? maybe if i didn't buy anything else that month, sure."
3/27/2009,he don't know how to mine does he.....stick to mission running.... leave the minin to the pros... not to mention the knowledge about them.
3/27/2009,"apparently not. assuming ""a couple of hours"" actually means 2 hours, i can make 5-6 million in my retreiver, for goodness sake. with a fully fitted hulk i would expect to make somewhere between 15 - 20 in the same amount of time./me can't fly hulks yet . i've been too busy training for a typhoon."
3/27/2009,"assuming you have a hauler alt going, and are mining regular veldspar, you make a shade under 11.7 million per hulk per hour. that's about half as much as a missioner with a decent amount of skill makes, but it's far easier. alternately, if you fit a hulk up for cargo space, and then mine semi-afk, you make better than 2 million every time you dock up. it's not enough to retire on, but it's a fully respectable income stream. if you're making 3-5 mil an hour mining actively, even solo, you're doing it wrong."
3/27/2009,"no hauler alt, expander rigs... i'll get accurate times and numbers tonight."

3/27/2009,let all npc-corp players get conscripted to their empires militia 3 months after they started
3/27/2009,we expect all pvp'ers to mine for 3 months straight before being allowed to fire a single shot.oh..wait...
3/27/2009,"they can join sooner if they want, but not stay in npc-corp longer then 3 months before getting a concord letter telling them: ""congratulation you are now a member of 'your* empires milita. no go make us proud son!"""
3/27/2009,"this is a pvp game, whelp."
3/27/2009,pvp doesn't necessarily involve combat.
3/27/2009,if its a pvp game then why are there miners and manufacturer's smartass?
3/27/2009,but only if you require all people to mine for 3 months straight.
3/27/2009,"this is a pvp game, whelp. did you already forget, i just told you?"
3/27/2009,so what your saying is... pvp'ers don't know how to read let alone answer direct questions right?wow... i feel sorry for you guys.
3/27/2009,"not supported, because you want players ""forced"" out of npc corps. offer incentives instead to encourage ppl and i'd sing a different tune.possibilities:a. after say 3 months. npc corp start handing out missions to members that gain them nothing but standings gain with that corp. if these missions are failed/refused they gain a standings hit that if not rectified will eventually have them thrown out to a different npc corp. (downside is that it still has elements of being forced)b. start instituting a corp tax on npc corpsc. let members of player corps use corp standings to access hostile agents from other factions as a means of repairing personal standings.d. give bonuses to mining or some such (similar to fleet bonuses but not stacking with them) to members of player corps while in any system they have an office or a pos.i would personally rather see something like c or d as they are incentives and not penalties."
3/27/2009,"you're right. there is only pvp. no missions, no ratting, no mining, no refining, no manufacturing, no invention, no trading, no hauling... right? the only ships that exist are there to kill. like the orca.you're just a jackass. insulting doesn't prove a point. npc corps have good pros and cons. people don't need to be forced into combat when it will probably find them eventually, even if it's only suicide ganking."
3/27/2009,i think we should be able to have a no corporation association option.or if that can't be done how about one called none or independent.something to say hey i do my own thing and have no need to be associated with anybody.examplesi am a pirate and have no to be associated with anybody i am privateer and do missions and whatever else to make a living.i am a independent miner and don't wish to be associated with anybody.i am scammer and a pick-pocket (not sure how you would do that but you get the idea)i am spy.etc etc etc.
3/27/2009,no.npc's already do that let alone 1 man corps.
3/27/2009,yeh yeh yeh i hit return by mistake.the rest of it is in there now
3/27/2009,"yes.especially combined with option to have wardec/vendetta against individual characters. (no matter npc corp, player corp or no corp)"
3/27/2009,"i agree with this actually, i think a non-affiliation (rogue capsuleers as it were) would be a neat thing to have."
3/27/2009,"no, this is game is designed with corporations in mind. no support.--isaac"
3/27/2009,oh for crying out loud.do i have to spell it out for you low iq people?non affiliated pilots are worse than npc.its nigh perfect immunity!it will never happen... hell will freeze over before you get that far.
3/27/2009,"only if you can war-dec an unaffiliated person. but if you can war-dec an unaffiliated person for less money than a corp, everyone would, and no one would choose to be unaffiliated as opposed to be in an npc corp.if all you want to do is not belong to someone else's corp, just found your own. like, the duke of plaza-toro, ltd.if you were proposing replacing the npc corps with ""unaffiliated"" status such that individuals could be war-dec'ed, that'd be something else.in its proposed incarnation, though, this seems impractical to me."
3/27/2009,semi-this.1 man corp is far better anyway.npc corps are especially nice for new pilots who join up in there first days.... they get a corp chat for the npc corp and can ask questions related to there race so to speak.. its likely to be a bit quieter than rookie chat.that's just one advantage... npc's are typically non-affiliated anyway!so i fail to see the reason for this proposal to begin with.. even if you allow war-dec to singular individuals... then whats the point... might as well allow that across the game itself.this is a ridiculous proposal...and a can of worms at best.
3/27/2009,"fair enough, it's rare, but the other three still apply quite frequently."
3/27/2009,"i thought that too at first. however, it has nothing to do with orbiting. it works, no matter whether the enemy orbits or not. it just requires you to make tactical maneuvers, too. if you do so, you can take advantage of it.there is an old naval tactic called ""crossing the t"". the basic setup looks like this:< < < < < ^ ^ ^ ^ ^the triangles are the ships in their direction of movement. it means the one who crosses can fire broadsides at his enemy wave after wave, while the enemy can only use it's forward batteries and has to shoot a moving target with maximum transversal. in eve, only the transversal speed remains of that. still, if you cross the t of your opponents flight vector and you have his inertia beaten down, he can't adjust his vector well. so eventually you end up orbiting him and you can dictate range not by speed, but by vector, because he either stops to align to you, losing distance and speed, or he takes forever doing so on the fly, falling behind on your actual vector.it is complicated, but it should work at least in theory. of course caldari pilots would have to learn that ships can actually move during combat, first."
3/27/2009,"problem is, eve isn't a tactical movement game - the commands are simplistic and not designed to let you do what you're trying to do here. really, the only commands you can enter are to dictate range - there's ""move to x"", ""orbit at x"", and really that's about it. furthermore, there's a deep problem with how tracking is implemented, in that it doesn't account for the rotation of the firing ship - if you're in a circular orbit of a stationary point, the effective tracking is zero, not (radial) like eve uses. if they implemented that then you'd have a lot more tactics in how ships move, but at present it's solely about dictating range. the inertia gun makes it a bit easier to do that, but it seems like it'd be far less effective than a web. maybe if you made it outright add an amount of mass then it'd be better for anti-frigate work, but then it's useless against big ships. i see what you're saying, and i agree to some extent, but offhand i don't think eve is the game you're looking for here."
3/27/2009,"thing is hersch.... eve would be soooo much better if it was a tactical game.it's just too plain and jane to show up and open fire on a ship.it would be so much better if ships had there weak points and strong points depending on the shape and position.for example... a malestrom has all of its cannons along the side of the ship on the starboard and port sides.one would think that going ""broadside"" on a ship of that magnitude would be a very...risky venture if not fatal...as all guns are brought to bear.if the malestrom was firing her cannons in the front or the rear quadrants.... it wouldn't be as effective.... yet it is to a degree.eve would be more interesting that way.... opening up on a ships rear quandrent to knock out the engines...blind spots...etc..etc...but..alas..not likely to happen.i can dream can't i? : o )"
3/27/2009,"i got some positive feedback on this topic in the ideas forum and am submitting this for an official vote.((topic 1))i understand the need to restrict tractor beams in high sec space, but i think the game shouldn't restrict you from pulling other people's wrecks in null sec or at the very least extend the tractor beam to work on alliance wrecks. this arbitrary limitation about wreck ownership makes cleaning up around alliance systems a pain in the ass for all salvagers, especially when the owners are offline and cant fleet you.(note)this proposal is specifically for low and null sec systems 4  0.0. systems of sec status 5 and up should and probably will remain as they are. ((topic 2))someone also suggested allowing tractor beams to pull unanchored structures and containers so i am adding it on the main proposal as topic 2"
3/27/2009,i support this topic.
3/27/2009,you support this.... thats funny because it doesnt look like you are support this eh?;-p
3/27/2009,"definitely supported for 0.0, assuming it's technically feasible. probably supported for lowsec as well."
3/27/2009,i understand some limitations for this in high-sec maybe even low-sec but 0.0 should be free for all.
3/27/2009,supported

3/27/2009,"as a ""very knowledgeable"" player what is your opinion of fitting interdictors without bubble launchers, and the loss of said interdictors to solo frigates? what actions would you take against vocal critics of such fittings?"
3/27/2009,"lol still feeling bitter about having your access to our forms removed vit? oh well. in any case i personally wouldn't use an interdictor in that way but mostly because i think there is a number of ships that can do the job just as well. having said that i can see that a high speed dessie would be useful in some situations outside of 0.0 and certainly wouldn't post insulting and snippy comments/pictures about someone who did want to try it. as for actions of censorship taken against people who critise such fittings i would be taking no actions as constructive criticism is a key way of helping others. continual pointless smack and insulting of other members of a forum is another matter entirely of course and, after consultation with other moderators of said forums, i would be only too happy to remove that persons posting/reading rights if there was enough continued complaints against said person. hope that helps."
3/27/2009,i personally love to fit interdictors without bubble launchers. i use the extra slot to fit minibars and jacuzzi and consider that since my clone's cost 30mil isk anyways its a bit pointless to fly a tech1 destroyer when tech2 versions are available
3/27/2009,where do you stand on the whole bob reloaded kerkuffle?what do you think about mining income versus missioning?what do you think about militia members getting faction hits for rring fellow militia members who have criminal security status?
3/27/2009,"well to be honest i find the amount of forum talk about it to be far in excess of what the subject deserves. as it is i think that the changing of the name from kenzuko to band of brothers re-loaded was a mistake on someones part within ccp. i doubt there was anything malicious in doing so simply on the basis that it really doesn't mean all that much at the end of the day. as mentioned by several people on both the giant threads in regard to the topic if the ex-bob leadership had formed an entirely new alliance and then petitioned the ""band of brothers"" corp for name squatting i can see how that would have been a viable solution to the affair. as it is rolling back the decision was the right move in my opinion. not becuase of the public outcry over the issue one way or another but simply because kenzuko had been in existence for too long to say something like ""whoops our bad we meant to type something else"".as a csm i would, as stated above, be more than willing to ask ccp if an investigation had been carried out into how this whole mess had happened. the issues with mining income versus missioning to me seems to be three major areas. firstly the isk a miner makes is entirely determined by the market (since the removal of shuttles as an npc item removed the lower limit cap for trit) and as such fluctuates with supply and demand whilst missioning is a relativity fixed income which only relies on the time you put in. the second issue is that of macro-mining which connects to the supply and demand part as the market value of minerals is artificially reduced by the abundance of minerals ""created"" by these miners. lastly the reprocessing of mission loot seems to me to put in an inordinate amount of minerals into the market which further devalues the mineral prices. i personally would like to see more dynamism in mission running in regards to the rewards you get and the quality of the agent being heavily linked to the number of requests that agent has for missions per day. i would also like to see the loot drops reduced and maybe balanced by a small increase in the bounties of the rats in the missions. of course this would be a delicate balance to achieve and would need some work by ccp as well as other options looked at that the players suggest. i'm sure this will get some backs up but i agree with it. the various factions are in effect subservient to the ded in regards to standings in many ways. they all ""respect"" the negative standing placed on someone by the ded and as a result helping such a person would result in a lowering of standings towards the faction. now i can understand this makes things tough for those militias who have such people in their midst but at the end of the day you still have the choice not to work with them. i think it would be far more sensible and fit in with the way the standings system is supposed to work if people with a criminal security status weren't allowed to join. however this would be ignoring the long standing traditions of privateering. i suppose there could be some sort of letter of marque given to a criminal but that's a whole different kettle of fish and would have to be looked at very carefully in order to not allow factional warfare to turn into a pirate free for all. i don't have anything against pirates though i work with a number of them all the time but eve is about choices you make. if you chose to be a pirate then ""official"" bodies such as the four core empires won't like you and if you chose aid one then you are aiding a criminal above the status of aiding a fellow militia member based on the idea that ded standings are more important than empire standings."
3/27/2009,"who am iyou are voting for a real life person to represent you :hendrik scheiderbusiness process analyst34 years old, from berlin, europeje parle fran<U+FFFD>ais ! toutes vos id<U+FFFD>es, soumettez-les <U+FFFD> moi en fran<U+FFFD>ais.mein wahlprogramm auf deutsch, siehe eve-online.decontact me in-game or via my siteplaystyle being ceo of a small industrial corporation, i am working at eve's economical foundation. i do not suffer from the ivory tower syndrome that other candidates might have, instead i am well aware of the issues that affect most of you every day. having graduated from caille university in 2003, i am seasoned in many different fields in eve : from production, mining, and trading to exploration and combat, to working with the api and operating eve-related websites. continue reading to learn about what my team achieved, what we envision, and how you can be part of that ! two prior terms on the csm as representative of take care, i'll take over from council member ankhesentapemkah, who has already served two terms on the council of stellar management. her experience is of great value and will ensure high standards with regards to dealing with ccp as well as listening to you and other players. that means, if you vote for me, i will start at full speed. there will not be any delay in representing you within csm and towards ccp due to learning and getting acquainted. further more, take care is not affiliated with any of the major powerblocks and is the voice for invididualists and small corporations, and strives to improve eve for all playstyles. where we are lacking experience, those topics are filled by my advisors from take care and the allies who my company has. we are maintaining an informal network of hundrets of capsuleers, allowing us to quickly gain reliable and hands-on intel on any given subject, which you bring to my attention. a new flavour of course, i enter the ring with my own way of thinking and personal preferences : social networking. looking ahead, i want to bring your thoughts to ccp's attention on how cosmos (aka eve facebook) and ambulation (aka walking-in-stations) can improve your abilities to brag about achievements, communicate with your friends, interact with your enemies. the sandbox approach of eve needs more thrust : your actions should be important. epic mission arcs should offer real choices and have a backstory impact. programmable npcs should be introduced and facilitate player-created missions, providing more roleplay opportunities. and, finally, no half-ready content should be pushed into the game, where it never gets finished. achievements take care has managed to live up to all it's election promises in the past. ankhesentapemkah's repeated raising of the skill queue issue resulted in the implementation of a queue in the recent apocrypha expansion. suicide ganking was made more balanced, without completely removing the practice. battleship-sized rats were added to low-security, and 0.0 game mechanics will be the major focus for eve's next expansion. many smaller issues have been brought to ccps attention and will be worked on in the future, such as factional warfare and the problems and repetition related to mining and missions."
3/27/2009,"transparancy most importantly, thanks to ankhesentapemkah, you now have a wiki where you can keep track of all csm issues. and ccp is looking for further means to improve communication with the players. i will continue this path towards transparancy and accountability, after all, what good is the csm if the players cannot clearly see what is being worked on ? this is no vague talk or idle promise, as can be proven by take care's track record over the past year. participation i encourage all players to participate at take care and get involved with the csm. there may be issues that are important for you, and we would love to hear from you. you can send questions, concerns and comments to ankhesentapemkah and me, and we'll get back to you with an answer.my agenda in a nutshellfind in the following the issues, which are my personal agenda, if you want. changes, which i will try to push forward, if elected csm delegate. some areas i would like to see developed, while not being an expert myself. i can assume that a csm colleague will know a lot more in such areas, and i will constructively support him or her in the submission process. finally, feel free to bring your own topics to my attention or to modify priorities according to your understanding._ programmable npcsprogrammable npcs shall give out your missions to other players. creating missions should allow you to assess the best pilot for later recruitment, build a renommee for yourself in the sector, create an income for mission runners and yourself. the toolset would range from simple courier missions to transport a pile of stuff from a to b (sourced in slices from your own stock), to acquisition (mining / trade / exploration, e.g. nailing down a signature), to killing, where either spawns would be triggered by the type of enemy the mission creator selects, or capsuleers need to be eliminated (where a mission would only be given out, when enemy capsuleers are present, of course)._ concord refactoring""captain, we just received a distress signal in this constellation !"" having a computer generated police force was a logical decision at eve's stage of 40k subscribers. today, with 40k pilots simultaneously online, we have better options, be it by tradeable kill-rights or introducing the role of marshals, who may react on aggression or distress signals.if capsuleers do the job, pirates will have equal opponents : carebears with teeth. and imagine an adaptive system security rating, depending on the number of marshals around, and how that could reshape the galaxy... we could test-drive the mechanics in low-sec first to provide incentives for players to police space and take care of the justice aspect of the game, while providing pirates there with more juicy targets._ 0.0 incentivizingalready mentioned during csm2, but i want to emphesize that endless pos warfare is not the endgame we want. allow 0.0 alliances to do empirebuilding, let them add npcs to their outposts, and provide more reliable money-making activities for the grunts to make isk on site. having reasons for alliances to operate under an nrds policy and making money off visiting carebears would be a bonus, for example by using the player mission system (see above). let 0.0 space be used and come to life - more ships there will then trigger or allow other activities. my focus is an increased interaction between players, making pilots travel more regions of space. of course, 0.0 needs other aspects to be looked at, like the sovereignty mechanics themselves and moon mining."
3/27/2009,"_ finishing factional warfarethere are mechanical flaws, which need to be addressed, from known exploits to stupid spawning. in addition to these engineering issues, i see a much greater importance of factional warfare for the whole galaxy. when war broke lose between the empires, i hoped that it would bring a sort of endgame to high-sec. imagine : conquering a system will make it harder for the inhabitants loyal to the defeated faction to live in it. also, i do not see a reason why amarr can ally with caldari, but a capsuleer alliance cannot. oh, and did i say that i hate spawning ? let plex appearance be player-driven, not totally random ! i can imagine player-owned habitats as factors in occupancy. with solid profits attached until being conquered or destroyed by the enemy. some kind of sovereignty in empire space._ leveraging the standing systemnow this last one is quite abstract, and maybe it is too far-fetched, but let's see : all the greater aspects of eve work side-by-side, connected more or less through the item market. yes, it is hyper-capitalism, and nothing wrong with that. but the ubiquitous call for more backstory involvement, sandbox, and incentives leads me to believe that we need more than isk to compete with. before we had the alliance system, corporations already forged alliances outside of the client.today still, a quarter of a million capsuleers meet eye to eye. you sell to one other, your contract is picked up by one other, you shoot at one other, and if you shoot well, he use his kill-right to shoot back. what you are doing inflicts a change only to exactly one other pilot (or none, when you shoot the environment). and once it is done, it is over. it not really multiplies, stages, nor has indirect effects.my goal is to add interaction between capsuleers and to make it little predictable by introducing a new abstraction layer, on which capsuleers compete throughout new eden, a second market. your standing should empower or hinder you. standing, which others set towards you ! for example from all pilots loyal to the occupying faction. thus, your actions will have a potential backlash upon you both good and bad. standing you currently gain through npc missions and you only use it for missions. standing given by other pilots is irrelevant. standing given by a corporation to a pilot is irrelevant. but in future, standing may allow the marshal role for the occupying faction or sovereign alliance. it might give real bonusses to your personal profit and efficiency of your corp. the standing settings of each pilot towards you will gain importance, to an extent as they are themselves liked or disliked, depending on the region of space you are in (occupancy). the resulting standing network will be hard to exploit, as we deal with thousands of individuals. and ten alts will not make a difference.the cushion, from where the ball bounces back to you can then be...- occupancy, where the loss of a system affects the whole loyal community there- aggression and kill-rights, which may be used by other capsuleers than the involved two parties- your creativity, where your missions in good standing are required for an infrastructure which you may exploit._ further issuesthe above list is not complete. as said earlier, i cannot adopt issues, where i am not an expert in the area of effect. a lot of ship and module effects fall under this category. personally, i think, there is something wrong with the turret mechanics in close-up battle. i will support such submissions, the least i can do is checking arguments for validity and completeness.my focus is networking and increasing travel and trade and interaction. that is the view i want to add to the csm discussion."
3/27/2009,"i express my confidence in erik, he'll make a great csm and continue the work i've been doing the past year."
3/27/2009,"anyone can stand on a soapbox in the street and trumpet their desire to make life better for everyone, to cure what ails us, to produce win/wins, and to otherwise make happiness fall from the sky like rain. this isn't limited to the csm either - we're pikers compared to rl politicians. thing is, even if they do mean what they say, they can't generally deliver. yes, it's possible to have everyone gain from a change, but a lot more frequently, someone gains and someone else loses. the gains can outweigh the losses, but you can't carry on blithely unaware that there are people who will suffer a loss because of the change you propose. this is why it's fundamentally false to claim that you're trying to let everyone play the game they want, because when the platitudes end and the policies begin, you're not. you can't. you can't even increase the isolationism offered to players without affecting other people, because you're withdrawing the new isolationists from interactions they would otherwise have engaged in, and that would otherwise have benefited others. you say i'm being too specific, but i'm just pulling out one example of many. there is no issue where you can propose a change that does not harm somebody, and you cannot call those changes simple isolationism with a straight face. bears have simple tastes much of the time, but their desires will inevitably come into conflict with the desires of others. as for the overarching issue, i think we agree. i'm entirely for players organizing to have their voices heard, and this seems like a decent vehicle for doing so. i'm not trying to derail issler's attempt here, i'm just trying to make sure that everyone understands what it will actually look like at the end. you can't get what you want without stepping on the toes of others, at least to some extent, so be aware of that going in. if this party is to succeed, it needs a clear agenda and a clear understanding of how it will enact that agenda and what obstacles it will face along the way. you will never get unanimous support for anything non-trivial, and you will not be able to enact that agenda without serious opposition. understand that, prepare for it, and while you may choose to use pithy slogans in your communications with the outside world, never make the mistake of using them inside your own head. you are not making the game better for everyone, you are not meekly asking to be left alone in a way that doesn't affect anyone else, and you are not making it so that everyone can play the game they want. you are advancing an agenda that you believe will help the game as a whole(or, if you're a jerk, that you believe will help you personally), but there will be casualties along the way, and they will fight you. that's not to say you shouldn't try - on the contrary, i fully encourage you to do so - but please, go into this with your eyes open. too many negatives in that sentence for me to be really unambiguous, so i'll just state this cleanly. everyone has a right to advocate for themselves, their play styles, and their preferred gameplay changes to the best of their ability. i may dispute your points, i may disagree with your goals, but i will never dispute your right to fight for them as best you can. to the best of my recollection, the only people i've ever attacked for speaking on these boards were obvious trolls - hell, i tend to give likely trolls the benefit of the doubt. this isn't about whether issler's crowd can speak up, it's about what it would wind up looking like when they do."
3/27/2009,"do mission runners make enough isk? it's arguable. on the one hand, you have the average level 4 runner who makes shedloads, but on the other hand you have the l3/2/1 runners that make virtually nothing in comparison. i'd say hitting the people who run these lower leveled missions would be unfair. perhaps a good solution would be to remove t1 loot from missions, but replace it with higher quality salvage. this would increase the price of t1 fits at the cost of lowering the price of salvage. higher t1 prices would probably equal higher mineral prices too - you'd get a healthy multiplier. on the other hand, what about the newbie mission runner? if t1 prices increase too much, the risk occurs that he is priced out too easily. the idea of a liberal party is a pipe dream for myself personally, so let me not repeat the assertion. maybe when i can go for a csm position? in my experiance, carebears do not stay carebears forever - they'll eventually branch out into industry, mining or pvp - it's just that some people do this quicker than others!"
3/27/2009,"isn't this the other way around? a liberal party would work towards social engineering and protecting carebears, a conservative party would be based on having as little intervention as possible. or is it just in the us that liberal groups work to protect everyone from themselves and conservative groups want the government to get its nose out of everyone's business."
3/28/2009,agree with op.

3/28/2009,"you guys realize with the current rules for highsec capitals, if ccp were to make an exception for them (and we all know how eve hates ccp playing favorites) and move the titan to highsec, he would either be forced to jump it out, or never be able to log in, with a single war dec?you can't dock titans, and amarr can't have control towers (let alone capital ship arrays) anchored. being in space in a capital will mean you get it moved to lowsec. i know chribba's not serious about the request in any way, but i have a feeling some people think this could actually happen."

3/28/2009,"the nag defiantly needs buffed, not sure if i agree with your ""solution"", but something does need to be done. the nid on the the other hand is a great carrier and even if cpu or base hit points/base cap need tweaking, i again don't like your ""solution."""
3/28/2009,"worst dread ever build; make it 4/5/7, change his bonus to rof&dmg/lvl, and you will have a nice dread, like other races; and btw do you know that a tempest have a smaller range than a domi???!"
3/28/2009,"the numbers are in - with all skills at level 5, the naglfar spits out more damage than any other dreadnought right now as it stands. with artillery and torps, it packs about 345 dps pre-siege, the next best being the revelation at about 340 dps. with autocannons, it packs about 435 dps vs the moros' 425 dps. (assumes all level 5s and emp/multispec/antimatter)the downside is that it does indeed more skills than any dread and has the worst tank of any dread. hence, my recommendation that all it needs is an extra mid, more cpu, and better cap. but, that is my opinion, and it's a modest change as it doesn't screw over people that are already skilled for the naglfar (i.e. myself). the improved cpu and cap allows for damage mods to be fitted in the lows without losing a permatank and without having to use serious faction gear, too (outside of siege - permatanking in siege is nigh impossible. doable, but you kill resists doing it unless you have carrier/logistics energy support).if it was made to 3 turret slots with 5%/lvl damage, at level 5, the nag would then do 480 dps with autocannons. but only 310 dps with artillery. just throwing that out there.but yes, i still agree principally with the base argument - minmatar capitals should all be shield tanked at the very least with comparable ease. i personally think that the extra training for both capital artillery and citadel torps is an adequate tradeoff for the best dread damage in the game if only it could tank as easily as the other dreads."
3/28/2009,"that, my friend, is a good point that i had not previously considered. by my own logic i'd have no choice but to support the notion that ships entering regular space from w-space through a wormhole would not appear in local until a w-space-like condition had been met - if someone made a specific thread about that, i'd give it a thumbs up."
3/28/2009,the entire reason you don't show up in w-space is because it lacks communication devices that are in known space and cause you to show up instantly.
3/28/2009,"support.with a caveat that directional scanner needs a severe rework (including autoupdate, just like the overview), and the ability to slave it to station sensors while docked for grid info."
3/28/2009,"of all the players in this game, the china/macro farmers are the least likely to be bothered by endless, monotonous, constant directional scanner clicking for intel.and for us legitimate players? well we hate your poorly thought out idea."
3/28/2009,"i already said there won't be the need for constant scanner clicking.and even with real time scanner update, it's already a big step plus to being able to gank them"
3/28/2009,"this would be a huge boost to small scale pvp. no more of the silly ""hey local is +2. ok, let's undock 50 people!"""
3/28/2009,that would help in my eyes the whole problem of isk farmers in 0.0 its already annoying enough to fly through your space to see macro ratters everywhere. add delayed local and bring some risk to those macro's. i approve just for the plain fact that i want to pop more macro ratting ravens/nighthawks ;)
3/28/2009,"why you people never search for a previous version of the same thread?it was stated by the developers that a auto updating scanner is not a acceptable solution as 50k scanners updating every 2-3 second across all of eve (with all the information gathering that they will do) will add a unacceptable strain to the server, with consequent lag, crashes and so on. from this point on it is my opinion, not some dev statement.local is the system intelligence toll that has the least impact on the game performance. it was possible to remove it from wh space as most of the time a wh system will have a limited number of people in it, so even if they are all using the directional scanner the impact on performance is manageable. it you have 2 20 man fleets in a k space system with every one of them hitting the directional scan every 2 seconds and getting several hundreds of signals the lag will be unberable."
3/28/2009,"i've spent a decent amount of time through the years in both 0.0 and empire, and i definately support this. i do believe there should be some sort of intelligence networking built into the game though. seems strange that in rl now, we can share intel across multiple fleets, but in the future, this is resolved to text or voice comms. i also believe that nerfing down the local-intel would lead to a more specialized intel gathering network, and ultimately shrink empire sizes. all of this, i believe to be a good thing.i detailed a bit of my idea for an ""intelligence network"" here, though some of it is outdated with the newer scanning systems. i guess i should write up a new proposal."
3/28/2009,"i tentatively support this idea, however i agree with a need buff to scanning tools. so for the moment it does not get thumbs up.one idea that may contribute is to tie this in with system scanners on a pos. the current system scanner is essentially redundant since in home systems there will be many ships in space, many of those idling in a pos. perhaps changing the system scanner to show local in a system to the sov holders and their allies would help with this. rational would be the scanner automatically scans and updates local with all the pilots in space.this would retain the intel aspect for the home defence, who reasonably ought to have an advantage where is concerned.however simply changing this would introduce a significant imbalance to the setriment of a hostile roam. therefore buffing scanning tools would be required as well. perhaps a ""transponder probe"" could be introduced, the mechanic being that when deployed it searches for active pilots transponders in the system as a whole. this probe would not be a locator as combat probes currently are, but while deployed by a fleet member would allow visibility of local to a hostile fleet.two seperate mechanics that need to be balanced well. and ultimately allowing visibility of local to both. where the benefit to pvp is concerned it removes local from systems without any sov, unless the parties involved use a ""transponder probe"".active scouting would be more essential, and probers more common in fleets.just a couple of ideas, and maybe not the best, but something to throw into the pot.zos"
3/28/2009,"a simple scenario to demonstrate why this should not be proceeded with.you have a mining op going on in an ice belt with 10 people, an orca and a rorqual. you have scouts out and all is well. you think you are safe and that you have prepared well, but all of a sudden, 20 covert ops (force recons, black ops etc ) appear from nowhere and you start screaming as your well planned and executed little op gets torn to pieces.much puiblic ridicule is heaped on your shoulders by whoever.podded and annoyed at being bounced, you scream at the scouts, ""where was my warning?"" and they yell back, ""we saw nothing.""then it dawns on you. logonski by one character; covert cyno and you were stuffed. and despite all your preparations, you really stood no chance what so ever.small problem perhaps anyone?until an instant scanning system is implemented that warns of hostiles in system and does not drive people to distraction, proceed no further."
3/28/2009,i do support this for reasons allready stated in this thread if ccp improves and adds more scanning mechanics of course.
3/28/2009,"refer to my post above and it is possible to see how some changes could balance this out. arguably it would be foolish to carry out mining ops in a system with no towers, with a tower and sov you would gain a warning from local as you currently do.zos"
3/28/2009,"i agree with this, local needs to be changed. either to have it show blank unless someone has typed. or a 30 second delay at least."
3/28/2009,yeah
3/28/2009,"this is why you need ships in your op to protect your mining ships.it would mean you need to be more on your toes. instead of having a scout 2 jumps down the pipe to give you warning. it makes the game somewhat more exciting then sitting there watching your mining lasers mindlessly and without any worry.its 0.0 space, it only makes sence. local should be removed from game completeley"
3/28/2009,supported - except we should have delayed local in all space.
3/28/2009,sounds like a plan.
3/28/2009,"with the proviso of some much improved scanning interface, oh god yes please do this as soon as you can.at the very least to 0.0"
3/28/2009,"you need to read that again more carefully. what the devs said is that the 'current' directional scanner on autorepeat is bad for the server. this statement was in answer to a ""just put an autorepeat on the directional scanner"" suggestion.obviously the number of possible results/parameters the on-board scanner produces in auto mode would need to be reduced, among other changes.edit: this is what was said -"
3/28/2009,"more importantly , we're not proposing an auto-repeating scanner. only a buff to combat scanning, and or probes.a wise man once said, you want to find someone...use your eyes."
3/28/2009,"i'm not sure i'm understanding you correctly here, but with a delayed local every ship needs to have the innate ability to acquire this intel (in circumstances mainly limited by range) without having to deploy anything, fit any additional modules, or spam button presses. this ability should come from the on-board scanner.deployed and fitted equipment should only serve to enhance that ability."
3/28/2009,"which is why i said we also need a boost to onboard scanners, and combat scanning probes.the two go hand in hand. boost scanners and probes + nerf localspy."
3/28/2009,"the problem with that is the extreme boredom of sitting watching nothing to ""scout"" for hours. its the most ******ed gameplay ever. simply speaking in such a situation attackers have all the advantages, and no drawbacks. attackers dont have to wait. and lets not get started on cloaks that would be extremely overpowered in such a place. all you do is force the few that actually live in 0.0 to get a iskmaking alt in empire along with the rest of you. it would be fun to run around in my recons in 0.0 but no way am i gonna do any ratting or mining in such a scenario. then i'll stick to missions.the only way removing local would make sense is if there is some sort of replacement tool for local that would give some of the same info."
3/28/2009,"heres an idea, because i've been thinking on this for awhile. if we were to come up with some science skills relating to communications networks and interfacing, that would stand as a nice compromise.it would be some extra lvl v's to train, but the idea is only the people with the right training can manipulate the comm-networks to use them for intel. eh? the bonuses could also extend to anyone they are commanding in a fleet. this would allow small 0.0 corps to have one hacker-scout to watch local while he plays, he keeps the gate campers and sentinels informed?just throwing it out there."
3/28/2009,very intriguing.i'd like to see someone expand on this.reading the back stories on fluid comm's always begged the question...wheres the comm hackers?
3/28/2009,"yeah i'm thinking that with two lvl vs, (edit: two lvl v's not counting the pre-reqs)maybe a maximum of 50 names can be displayed on local, even if they don't speak.this + a boost in strength to combat scanning (even if it's only nominal) would be very nice.i had some other ideas about actually hacking comm-channels, but i don't think ccp would ever implement them, even if the skill requirements were insane."
3/28/2009,"imo any skill-based solution will just mean an additional required timesink. everyone will train the new skills and we'll be back to the current situation.i believe the solution to cloaked ships is to add a 'cloak signature' to scan results. no range or direction, just a presence in system. maybe the 'visibility' of this signature should depend on the size and type of the cloaked ship, and its range from the scanning ship or probe."
3/28/2009,"well...no. because if you lower the bonus enough, to say 10 non-speaking people shown on local, and you make the pre-requisites hard enough, then even if everyone trained up, it would still be harder to see who was where.while the idea of cloaked sigs is novel, it would have to be impossible to pin down any of the signals - or cloaking would be pointless. i still think there is probably a skill-based and or modular solution."
3/28/2009,how about only having no local in conquerable space?
3/28/2009,yes please!
3/28/2009,"how will those 10 be chosen? seems a little arbitrary. and how hard would you make the pre-requisites? do the high pre-requisites stop people from having capship-pilot alts? this will just become another item for the alt market.in any case, even just 10 showing up will completely negate the delayed local effect, as a ratter will still safe-and-log when someone shows up in local, and a scout will show up in local to another scout or fleet, etc. everyone will either have trained those skills themselves or have a ""local alt"", in the same way as the current falcon alt. maybe the 'cloak sig' would show up at some relatively short range without giving up the direction, and that this range would vary with the ship size and type. this way makes the stand-off cloaked recon possible, but makes close approach risky."
3/28/2009,"this is what was proposed:""real time scanner updates"" if that is not a scanner on auto repeat it is a scanner in constant use. or it will not be real time. there is nothing obvious in this. so you want to reduce the information you get from the scanner and remove local at the same time.some other nice idea?"
3/28/2009,"simple, scanning sends out a ping. you can passively scan, say 3au, and actively scan the 14 or whatever.so when you scan, you can also be pinpointed.problem solved.so those covops exposed themselves scanning down your position."
3/28/2009,not supported
3/28/2009,i wrote about reducing the amount of info from ship's scanner when in auto-mode. this seemed obvious to me to allow it to work in real time over ranges of several au and not overwhelmingly stress the server. the manual scan may retain all it's current functionality.good idea. adds some complexity to the scanning system.
3/28/2009,"for those who dont know i recently lost a kronos, worth roughly 5 billion isk in mods etc. its my choice to fly it and i really enjoyed flying it.after the patch before everyone knew about the hp bug and the server seemed suprisingly stable i decided to take it for a spin as i had done many a time pre-patch. i jumped into a reasonably sized gate camp but nothing i wouldnt be able to tank. as i decloaked none of my modules appeared to activate, i was then instantly put down to 10% armor, at this point i didnt know what was going on so i hit fraps to rewatch afterwards, i managed to fraps for about half a second before my ship popped, and although the graphics showed my mods inactive a armor repair cycle went through boosting me to about 70% armor a second volley popped me instantly. the fraps shows clearly that just 2 zealots were actually firing, the larger ships didnt even have time enough to lock me.this kronos has 80-84% resistances on everything and i thought i had been doomsdayed at first, i quickly posted the mail and apparently 2 zealots were the only thing doing damage to me. my kronos with 7k shield 9k armor with 80+% resistances and my structure 10k with damage control had been melted by 2.9k damage from 2 zealots only (2 volleys for them)luckily for the guys who popped me the best stuff lived including 2x centum a-type lar's and vizan's eanm. i petitioned and quickly received my ship back but of course minus the mods that lived.this policy has been in place a long time and i've never challenged it because quite frankly its never been worth the effort but i'll be damned if i wanst gonna try and challenge it here.anyway to cut a very long story short after 2 weeks of escalating petitions i was given the finger. this policy is ridiculous, isk is something that takes time to make in eve and somehow ccp think its reasonable that a victim of a bug they admitted was their fault should lose 3+bil isk because what, they dont want to take mods off people who should never have gained them in the first place. if ccp make a mistake ccp should fix the mistake, i know if i make a mistake in eve i have to pay for it.i have to live with the fact i suffered a massive loss to ccp, but in the future i want to see people getting anything they lost back because we're all paying customers and why should we take a hit because ccp f*cked up.i understand that perhaps it would be very difficult and time consuming to retrace those modules steps but at the very least the person who lost the ship due to a blatant bug should get the market price for that module(s) placed back into their wallets. i dont think there are enough legitimate losses to seriously affect the economics of eve by doing this, but regardless i think something should change."

3/28/2009,signedhow do i get that tumsup thingy?
3/28/2009,i s'port this.
3/28/2009,"i'm sorry, but to be blunt, i really don't pity your situation. first off, you went into a gate camp and got roasted alive. i'm going to guess it was 5 v 1. and your complaining that two zealots blew you to bits. claiming it was module lag....right, i can see why ccp won't. even if you didn't have the claimed ""module lag"" i'm pretty sure you would have been destroyed. you tried to solo pvp and got destroyed over it. yeah, you totally deserve reimbursement....in my opinion, the policy doesn't need a change. no support. --isaac"
3/28/2009,this.to be honest i've sat here staring at this post several times trying to figure out whether this is a justifiable proposal or not...and honestly i keep coming to one conclusion.whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!?!!?!?!!seriouslyi get the fact you flew your fancy ship into a gate camp and lagged out.but there is absolutely no way for them to detect a disconnect... its just not how tcp/ip infrastructure works.for all we know it could be the jerk down the street downloading a ton of torrents on your isp's bandwidth.... some nut case plowing into a power line.... or a moron tripping over a cat 5 connection and quickly plugging it back in.all of this over a ship.yeah... sorry.i'm sure if i flew my freighter into a gate camp.. i'd be screaming too...wait.... i wouldn't fly my freighter into a gatecamp....tankable or not.because its a bloody gate camp
3/28/2009,are you stupid ?? do you think two zealots can break a officer fitted kronos tank with 2vollys? and roll your eyes again to darkness the lord ill slap you in the face
3/28/2009,"lol, you are for real or you were born that stupid?learn to read my half-brained friend: ship was reimbursed because ccp admitted it was a bug and the issue is something totally different. what? ill leave that to you (or ask your parents - maybe they can read and translate it for you).anyho, /signed for actually getting some rules for reimbursement. atm its totally random stuff, sometimes people get ships (even including caps) reimbursed after the battles (ccp never reimburses fleetbattle losses, amrite?) where in clear documented cases (including fraps) there is no reimbursement.so not only ya need to make clear when reimbursement is possible but what can be reimbursed.drake draconisminmatarshadow cadreworlds end consortiumyou sir are also stupid and your reading comprehension is that of 5 year old."
3/28/2009,hey.... for all we know this could be just a cleverly crafted argument all because someone was asleep at the wheel.
3/28/2009,trolling. -weatherman
3/28/2009,"no, ccp gave ship back because damage recieved server side was 2700 wheras actual hitpoints of his ship were over 25000 (and thats not including resists).i guess ya never lost battleship to claw in 2 seconds, by being one-salvoed? next time stfu and dont make fool of yourself."
3/28/2009,"moderated. -weathermanin anycase. i happen to fly heavy assaults, and i'd like to see the killmails to see what those zeolots were packing. i severely doubt that it was all due to lag, as hacs are well known for chewing through anything larger than a cruiser.if the case of the bug is true, good for you in getting your ship back, but nothing else here makes me think the re-imbursement system is bugged, or in need of work.not supported."
3/28/2009,"i pity your loss, but i'm not really sure what ccp can do here. either they remove those modules from the hangars of the people who picked them up - hardly fair to them - or they open a loophole you could drive a truck through whenever a bug opens. fly officer-fit ship into combat, lose officer-fit ship to bug, drop officer gear, get officer gear reimbursed. suddenly, you and your ""enemy"" have made 3 billion for a few minutes' work. if you can come up with a solution that works better than the status quo i'm all ears, but i don't see what it would be."
3/28/2009,"probably not paying attention eating chillilasagne full of leeks !!!!!least you got the ship back , pity about the mods"
3/28/2009,"wow, i must have touched a nerve. by the way, because you reported drake, i feel its my responsibility to tell you i reported you. sucks doesn't it. now that we are over that little hump....i see what the op is saying and agreeably ccp should have rules on reimbursement. (although i'm of the opinion that reimbursement shouldn't happen at all because it could be just as easily your fault as it could have been ccp's fault) but i don't suppose you would mind maybe having a suggestion of what those rules could be?--isaac"
3/28/2009,"he probably doesn't, and i still haven't heard him explain how he takes on two hacs alone. all bugs and lag aside. marauders aren't exactly made for solo-pvp."
3/28/2009,i agree with this statement if you do allow both sides to get a copy of the modules youl have people exploiting it eg: you get your ship popped by the glitch and than have your offline corpmates log on and recover your items giving you 2 sets. i do not support this unless ccp devises some system to track module ownership and fraud. once this is in place i will support changing this policy.
3/28/2009,"right now ccp is not aware of hp bug, and frankly i am also skeptical since i didn't encounter it myself and have not seen other people showing impossible kills.if your kronos died to a single frigate, maybe 2 frigates, then we'd have serious evidence of something wrong.anyway, if you hope to get your ship back, you first have to help ccp identify the bug - if it exists. without that, there's no ground for reimbursement."
3/28/2009,"supported, but don't get your hopes up.i asked about this at last years fanfest, and it doesn't look to be on the horizon."
3/28/2009,would be nice
3/28/2009,supported.i'm a caldari ship only pilot and this is something sorely missing.
3/28/2009,"i can see the rails on my vulture just fine.. i don't see the problem...seriously though, this has been requested more times than moist things in game, and still, even after all the graphics upgrades, updated effects, they've not devoted any time to it. sad, really.."
3/28/2009,"yes, i'd like to see this in ccp's next major patch."
3/28/2009,o might support box. don't let this issue die. make ccp hear us
3/28/2009,"sad situation, yeah, but i doubt anyone at ccp will give a flying f*** about it."
3/28/2009,we could really use this one
3/28/2009,"if you're transporting a skillbook, you're doing it for someone else. this wouldn't change that.also: jumpclones.yeah, somehow i doubt that.kind of like how you were too lazy to come up with a real argument? probably the only valid argument in this thread. though i have a little bit of faith left in ccp that they haven't gone that soft.supported for ""why the hell not?""edited for potentially huge isk sink."
3/28/2009,"says the pot calling the kettle black.it is a lazy mans feature.and today i came ""that"" close to agreeing with you..but your smug-assed remark turned me off./me thumbs downhowever ignoring said persons argument... i'm open to injection only under strictest of conditions.like the fact you can inject based on the fact your going to meet said prereqs within the 24 hour skill queue time.that...is rational and sensible."
3/28/2009,umm.. no.dont see the point of injecting a skill you cant train for months. maybe if you can only inject a skill that you will be able to train after your current skill ends.
3/28/2009,"based on the skill queue being created to allow someone to effectivly train their characters when they can only log on perhaps once a day, at a restricted time, and whereas the inability to inject skills without prereqs prevents this goal from being completely met, i support this idea. there really isn't a bad side to it, other than the confusion that might come from someone injecting a book, and not knowing that that doesn't give them the ability to use it until it's trained. this can be prevented with a simple notification window when injecting a non-pre-reqd skill, informing the player of such."
3/28/2009,"actually, jora'h, cores have and always have had a sensor strength of 40. dss probes got theirs hacked from 20 to 5. the reason a result at 2 au on dss and 2 au on core is the same now is because 2 au is the minimum for a dss, but 8 times the minimum of a core, despite having 8 times the strength. how an ""advanced variant"" of the probes with an ""expanded sensor suite"" is beyond me - by the numbers, someone just took the regular core sensors and adjusted them to look farther, resulting in an increase of range for a proportional decrease in strength. that's not advanced at all. that's bogus. a strength of at least 10 would make sense for an ""advanced"" probe with that range.basically, dss probes are ""long-range cores,"" and they're not very desirable at all because of this huge hit. in fact, they're even worse than cores since refining a scan is impossible with them. not hard, impossible. dss are supposed to be the specialized exploration probes, while cores were supposed to be the ""crappy do-it-all"" probes.and yes, i am in the hard sciences. that's why i said ""no scientist in their right mind."" with that said, i think it is fairly agreeable that astrometrics would fall under the so-called ""hard sciences"". an experimenter will only throw out a data point if it is very clearly not the same result, and its value and error range does not overlap or coincide with any of the other values and their respective error ranges by a certain margin.nyah. the flip side of your argument is also applicable: what is the reward for players that train hard to use the ""exploration-specialized probes""? right now: jack and s***, and jack is stuck in w-space."
3/28/2009,"""long-range cores"" is about the reason, yeah. try scanning stuff out in a 200 au wide system, and tell me cores are up to the task. if you're in big systems, and want to get a result without some exhaustive and irritating searching, use deep space probes. do they need more use? they're narrow, but exceptionally good at their niche. i say i won't bother with astro 5 because i'm not a serious scanner, people who are will likely get enough use out of it(and the 8th probe) to justify training it."
3/28/2009,"that's just it, though. scanning a 200-au system is easy with cores, easier than with dss's. systems that large have widely-spaced middle and outer planets, and it's not hard to set a few cores to 8-16 au around each planet or the inner cluster of planets and scan each area one at a time (since no cosmic sig is more than 4 au from a warpable object - unless such things have changed?). the main advantage of dss probes was that they could easily scan the more dense systems with relative ease - systems with 8-12 or more planets packed in a 30-60 au radius. dss probes allowed you to get a fix on the approximate location of each result +/- about 1-0.5 au so you wouldn't be scanning different results with higher-resolution probes as you were trying to get fixes on each.still, you leave my questions unanswered: why is an advanced variant probe specialized for exploration, particularly en masse, effectively no better than the standard ""basic"" probe aside from increased range - and worse due to the inability to fine-tune? furthermore, how is the game mechanic justified in only using 4 probes to calculate the final accuracy? granted, more than 4 produces diminishing returns, but each one still increases the accuracy of the result up to a certain point, given proper and effective trilateration (more appropriate term). new players will usually at least train astrometrics 3 and be using 6 probes when scanning."
3/28/2009,"hey,as u all know ccp personel is allowed to play on the live servers as they please. obviously without using any commands to spawn themselfs stuff etc.but theres other ways to get very very rich.this thread is about one of those ways. inside trading: trading items/goods using non-public information gained trough means of working at ccp. even short glances at global economy figures during database access can be enough to get very rich in the right hands. and hey everyone wanna have a lotta isk in eve right?does this stuff get investigated (it does in the real world)? and are there limits to how rich someone working at ccp is allowed to become in eve online tq server?id."
3/28/2009,"for years now this has been of big concern to me as you can do basicly anything given enough isk, u can even fund wars, getts lotts of people following your cause, basicly you can completely unbalance the game depending what you do with the isk.and isk makes isk, if you know what to buy and sell because you have real figures to work with that other people dont. talking manny trillians of isk here. complete market control.internal affairs, do you investigate this and are there limits?"
3/28/2009,"1: your obviously not using spell checker and type like 5 year old.2: you have zero evidence.3: you forgot your tinfoil hat.4: you epically failed to troll ccp.insider trading is a term used to define the act of someone taking company information they work for and using that information on the stock market to turn a profit and making it look like they got damn lucky.for you to use such a ""grownup term"" in the context of eve is laughable.everything is obviously pubilc knowledge as far as prices go... duh?all you people who whine about ccp playing amongst you... where's your proof? all i see is you claiming they do this... and yet there is no proof.seriously... get a grip on reality well yah?even if they did.... your still not producing proof.. put up or shut the hell up."
3/28/2009,"if you keep this up i will report you for harassment.on topic:proof: ccp ceo made public statement when the whole t2 incident went down that they will allways play on the live servers.thats enough to know that they are on the live servers and they are making isk for themselfs in eve. the question is how much isk? and do they use information they gained from working at ccp in their free time on their player characters.we do not all have access to the same amount of information. for one markets are regional, resources required to construct something thats in development, ccp is allways first to know (way before it even getts on the test servers). the most information is inside the eve database, all trading is recorded its easy to keep track of market tendancys. so no we really dont have the same level of information as ccp.and the question is aimed at ccp internal affairs, not someone like you obviously baised to believe nobody @ ccp ever does anything wrong (history has proven different allready, hence why the internal affairs was created)."

3/28/2009,i have no doubt that they take the ia very very seriously. but is it within the confines of what they are allowed to do? affect eve on a global scale and become insanely rich? are there rules that say they are not allowed to have more than 1 trillian isk (random figure)?because i believe they have no rules about this at all. all we know is that they are not allowed to spawn themselfs stuff.

3/28/2009,"yeah, read lavista's post. also, who the heck are you to demand that ccp have rules for their game when they obviously do? ccp made this game. they can just as easily unmake it. live with it.--isaac"
3/28/2009,this.. with a longer timer all ppl would have to do is fuel up the pos with just enough to online it for an hour or a day.. what ever it takes to reset the timer.
3/28/2009,"this also is a problem of towers being reserved from the standings game as well. the standings check is ony there for anchoring a tower, so you go around in the 7 days you have good standings for, and anchor a bunch of towers. then, once you really want to use them, you can online and anchor the goodies. it's gaming the system, because teh system allows, and even encourages it. that's not to say that this is right. the entire high-sec pos mechanics should be changed. offline towers anchoring shoudl decay. fueling costs should be related to standings (certainly a much higher charter expense with insufficient standings). the 7 day window thing for anchoring needs to change, so that corps must maintain standings to keep their pos affordable. howerver, changing this by itself would cause other problems... so many high-sec pos's would become unusable, thereby greatening the slot shortage issue. this should be covered by public availibility of pos slots (with the appropriate changes that this would require). this would allow intrepid individuals who did maintain their standings to offer the slots up for rent. this would remove the necessity for a lot of those 'placeholder' towers out there."
3/28/2009,won't someone just fuel the tower and charge more for the pos selling to counter any offline pos removal idea?
3/28/2009,totally depends on the costs involved.
3/28/2009,yes.... but it makes it go from a no effort type of situation to an bloody annoyance.
3/28/2009,"within certain limits. for example you can currently evade concord, with black ops ships by jumping to low sec. i think that, being able to gank someone in high sec and then being able to cyno to low sec should be fair game. black ops are not all that common, and if somehow you get tackled, its game over.with wormholes, i think raids into empire space should be possible and allow you to jump back through. now this might mean that players would have to start policing, themselves. they would deduce that if a black ops ship didn't attack them then it, is possible that a wormhole in the system, is responsible so they scan it out and destroy the pirates/whateveryouliketocallthem.concord evasion should not be an offence in certain situations. other ways of evasion should not be possible apart from black ops and wormhole evasion."
3/28/2009,i don't know whether to cry at the insanity... or to laugh uncontrollably.
3/28/2009,i fully support this. this is what is needed to make missions more fun
3/28/2009,just.....just.....no.....no way....in hell....--isaac
3/28/2009,using black ops to evade concord is a bannable offense. using any method to evade concord is a bannable offense.
3/28/2009,awesome idea! eve needs it imho

3/28/2009,"this is not correct. ships with no aggression timer will disappear after 30 sec. if they have aggression (i.e. have engaged a gate, station, can, other player with an offensive module and such) they have a 15 min timer before they disappear.and with the new probing mechanics it is impossible to catch them before they are gone as they will not be under the 15 min aggression timer. (if i read the op correct. we are talking ratters farming safe isk in 0.0, yes? )i agree with the op. the covops cloak and ships that can fit those have got a role. but when every ship can fit a cloak and become invulnerable, that is just wrong imo. some sort of penalty should be applied to using a cloak that brings the ""risk"" aspect into it. not just the ""reward"". an agility penalty perhaps?? a ""delayed warp out"" mechanic??at least something that makes ship using a prototype cloaking device have to take some risk. we are talking about 0.0 space after all. and it is not supposed to be safe.i would also like it if cloaking ships using a regular cloaking devices (non-covert ops cloaks)can be probed out and caught with a well skilled character. it shouldn't be easy, but it should be possible imo.and don't get me started about the macro/bot players"
3/28/2009,cloaks are already balanced and fitting one comes with penalties - no change is needed.
3/28/2009,and what penalty would that be?? the scan res penalty and activation delay??doesn't address the problem. and they can hardly be called balanced when they make ppl invulnerable.
3/28/2009,"as i told the last million threads on this subject....no. unless ccp changes how cloaking and all related mechanics to cloaking, there is no change needed. --isaacp.s. no reason needed because i stated it a million times. you have no real solution. your demanding ccp change the problem, but you have no suggestions. this isn't the ""qq this mechanic sucks"" forum. its the bring your suggestions here forum."
3/28/2009,"i agree that cloaked ships invulnerability really is a pain.trying to catch a ratter with a cloak is pretty much pointless any more, and searching for a red in local with a cloak is simply a waste of time.the principal of extended cloaking should be limited to specific ships, and while others may use them it should be heaily limited in use.perhaps introduce a cap usage on activation, this would be a drain of a fixed percent rather than an actual amount. the rational being that a larger ship requires more energy to remain cloaked, so perhaps an activation cost of something like 10 percent. if for the sake of argument the duration is 1 minute, then any ship using a prototype can remain cloaked for 10 minutes max. long enough to take a bio, however not long enough to simply wait out a searching fleet.i see this as a dynamic that would nerf titans in some way too, requiring them to be more often visible on grid, and therefore open to attack or at least their position and alignment known.users of cov-ops cloaks would have zero activation cost, and therefore operate as before.zos"
3/28/2009,"a non-covert ship with a cloak can barely move, can't warp,and can't attack. during the times the ship is ""invulnerable"" every other ship in the system is also invulerable to the cloaked ship (balance achieved). if the cloaker de-cloaks there is a delay before they can lock and they have weakened the combat ability of the ship by attaching the cloak that takes significant cpu and a high slot. simple test: take any two identical combat ships and two identical pilots. put a cloak on one of the ships. fit them with the best possible pvp fit with the exception of the cloak. have the cloaker de-cloak next to the other ship and attack. due to the delay in firing and the sacrifice of the cpu and high-slot the ship with the cloak will most likely explode."
3/28/2009,eve-online would be a better game without local and without non-covert op cloaking devices.it would end the isk farming problem.
3/28/2009,listen to this man.... or forever be labeled dumb.spot on...

3/28/2009,"the purpose of all these is to fund pvp. what the point of the game, watching your wallet grow and paint dry?forcing people out if npc corps does nor necessarily force them into combat - it just makes them equally vulnerable as all the other players. it may cause them to pay for protection or grow a spine and protect themselves or cooperate with others - there are many options."

3/28/2009,"what about people in major alliances creating freighter/hauler alts to do all their important logistics work with 0.00001% risk factor? instead of 0.1% that they would get with war dec.0.0 logistics is already safer than empire since alliance people in 0.0 never use stargates, only jumping between deathstar pos. and then they hide in noob corp for the empire side of the business.new players also benefit from getting early exposure to pvp. if they grow old in eve without ever leaving safety of noob corp, they become weak and too content with the carebear lifestyle, without realizing what they are missing out.this game shouldn't be too easy. and we should accept that this game isn't for everyone. the weak must adapt or be greifed into quitting. keep eve community healthy."
3/28/2009,you people are utterly stupid beyond all reason.it's truely sad.... you can't see any further than the end your damn cannon.get a freaking brain and try to figure out why this proposal gets shot downeveryfrakkingsingletimeoverandoveragain!!!!<sorry trying to drill it in for emphasis>
3/28/2009,"oh, i'm fairly certain this will be a no go as usual.on a side note drake... i see you here so much... when do you find time to actually play?"
3/28/2009,"<grins>i have multitasking v.^_^and yes.. i am on... just ask de'veldrinbroke in my new orca today. as to your comment on the thread...this is the same song next verse number 100,000,000you'd think....people would figure it out... its a no-win situation... you favor one side.. its unbalanced...npc...or pvp.... you will never reach a conclusion without compromising the other."
3/28/2009,"true enough.. while there are ppl who abuse npc corps, there are also ppl who have legit reasons for being in them. i spent a while in them myself when i didnt have net access at home cause i didnt feel it was fair to a player corp to sign up when i didnt know for sure when i could play. had nothing to do with the fact that i dislike pvp for the most part. the only reason i offer ideas to some of the things i reply to is that i have a habit of trying to see things from both/all sides of an issue. not always possible but i try. hell some of the ideas i've posted have been along the lines of a random ""what if"" moment.. i know they wont necessarily be good ideas, but i float them out there for a response and feedback hoping that it leads to an actual good idea."
3/28/2009,"so basically, your way is the only way to play the game. nice. do you even realize what an unmitigated a$$hat you sound like? sadly, probably not. this is, essentially, a whining rant against people who have already left npc corps - they just keep alts in them.on a side note:since griefing is clearly against the established rules of the game (if not the eula) and is a bannable offense, we'll be expecting your resignation/banning imminently for advocating its use.can i haz ur stuffs?"
3/28/2009,"i do not support this. i fail to see how you can properly learn from veterans in the game, if you do not chat with them. the easiest way to accomplish this is to talk to the vets hanging out in noob corp chat."
3/28/2009,"okfirst off i sincerely apologize if i trolled you a little to much.i would be hypocritical if i didn't respect the effort your putting into making new ideas.at least you have the sense to reason it out.secondly.... as ive said before... most of these pvp idiots fail to remember that 75 to 80% of the npc corpies are in fact... alts of major alliance/corporation pilots trying to sneak around and do business they normally cannot accomplish.and until you get that through your frakking thick skulls (yells at the rest of the pvp'ers)your going to look like a bunch of idiots.just forcing someone to do something to your so called demands is considered criminal in this game.i did not buy a subscription to this game to be forced to play by someone else's rules.eve is a game of chaos and sandbox... you make your own damn rules and you for the most part do as your bloody well please.the moment that changes... is the moment i quit spending my hard earned money on it and go somewhere else.i choose to be an industrialist so i can make lots of isk and stash it away for the day i can afford to blow gobs of ships up just by pvp'in like the rest of you... because the funny thing is... you guy's don't even get paid peanuts to do it!stop assuming the world orbits around you.... you ignorance on the matter is obvious.also keep in mind that i do not favor the ""carebears"" in this matter either.we need equal portions of both pvp'ing and ""carebears"" as you would put it.it keeps the game intersting... having it go full pvp or full ""carebears"" would suck."
3/28/2009,"nope, though it would help fight off the macro's it makes it too easy to grief ppl."
3/28/2009,"this is easy to fix, just one toon /account...1. - new players shouldn't be forced to do anything, the moment you ""force"" someone like me *anywhere* - i kick back, in this case, stop paying.2. - realize what they are missing? c'mon! you cannot be that self-centered! pvp just is not for everyone. most of you are too young to remember elite, but eve does the best job of bringing that game into the 21st century... please, not everyone wants to/needs to play your way... the game isn't easy. the learning cliff takes out quite enough people now. as for greifing people into quitting? hmmmm, i believe ccp has an answer for that... no!"
3/28/2009,"so what your saying is you want to cut down on the funding of pvp?you're not very bright. some people don't like playing the game the way you do. just like in real-life. not everyone likes to do the same thing.so get off your little pedestal and ""grow a spine"" and learn to deal with reality."
3/28/2009,"of course yes. losses have to hurt.thanks. i don't need appreciation from an isk farmer.sure. so, go back to wow or hello kitty online, or go dress barbie dolls, whatever makes you feel good, just don't ruin the only decent pvp game."

3/28/2009,"this game is built on greifing people, some to the point of quitting. ccp are themselves the biggest greifers in eve. because 9 out of 10 new people who try play this game get so bored or frustrated at what ccp forced them to work with, that they quit the game without ever getting into it. then there are thousands of players who quit routinely over the game changes ccp introduces with patches, or because of the negative answers they get in petitions.and if ccp wants to keep their game from turning into wow clone, they will continue to encourage greifing, separate the weak from the strong. no single player or corp has caused more greif to players than ccp"

3/28/2009,"the ability to import and export fittings is a great idea but i think there should be an option that would allow you to specify an export format that eft or evemon can understand, because right now it only exports as raw xml which is pretty much useless because none of the fitting utilities use it"

3/28/2009,why is the onus here on ccp to fix it? let the eft people learn how to read xml.
3/28/2009,"agreed... this is something they need to fix in eft, not in eve. eve has the ability to export and import it's own fittings, so they can be shared with whomever you choose, that is enough. ccp should not be responsible for tailoring the game to 3rd party tools."
3/28/2009,"two specific issues directly related to current scoop mechanics:1) when you command some light drones, specifically warrior iis to ""return to drone bay,"" often 1-2 will try to return, but for what ever reason they don't stop mwding when they get into scoop range and as such they will orbit in and out of scoop range while continuously running their mwds. its a minor issue, but it adds a lot of extra time and attention to achieve what should otherwise be a relatively mundane task (getting your drones back into the drone bay.)to solve the issue, which seems to be a relative recent bug, would be to simply fix/change back, what ever changes caused this or to simply make drones turn off their mwds once they are in scoop range (most times at least some of the warrior iis do this, just make them all do it.)2) the second issue that in my opinion is tantamount to a ""flawed"" drone scoop mechanics and which seems to cause more headaches then anything else in this regard, are the current sentry drone scoop mechanics. the issue is prevalent in carriers, but it defiantly affects several other ships/classes of ships as well. the issue is especially noticeable in pos sieges when your sentry drones, for what ever reason, wander/drift several kilometers away in various directions and can take several minutes to fly after to scoop them all (the other option being the continuous scooping and redeploying of sentries to keep them close.) often this extra time (flying after them if some all get out of range) cannot be taken and one is forced to either abandon or leave 10-20 mil worth of t2 sentries in space (less, obviously in the case of t1 sentries.) the issue could be fixed easily enough with a 50-100 m/s return velocity for sentry drones.a third issue, less directly related to drone scoop mechanics then the first two issues, but in some respects related none the less is the ""issue"" of sentry guns aggroing drones in low sec. it's fair enough that drones are freely targeted and killed by other npc entities, specifically rats, but rats also tracking disrupt, sensor damp, apply ecm, fire defenders and neut/nos cap. all these issue affect various other forms of weapons systems.sentries on the other hand apply none of these ""tactics"" against players and their weapons systems, they do none the less, target and destroy drones (often in 1-2 volleys.) all this seems to do is limit if not remove dedicated drone boats from gate and station camping in low sec. don't get me wrong, people still find ways to very successfully camp gates and stations, they just for the most part rely on non-drone boats to do this.drone boats are by their very natures balanced around the use of their drones just as other types of (pvp) ships are balanced around the use of their weapons systems, why specifically limit (if not remove) the use of dedicated drone boats near gates and stations and none of the other weapon types?i could see issues with gate camps supported by posed carriers with assigned fighters, but maybe in the case of fighters continue to have sentry drones shoot them, but it seems, i hate to use this term, ""unfair"" to limit the use of dedicated drone boats and only dedicated drone boats at gates and stations, where the majority of low sec small gang engagements take place."
3/28/2009,what purpose would this serve? how is this possibly worth considering in any way? npc corporations are the default 'none' anyways. that you end up with a chat channel you can completely ignore is just a side effect.
3/28/2009,no for many of the reasons already stated. on the other hand this gives me an idea..

3/28/2009,firstly i would like to wish you luck in your campaign. i voted for anhk in the last election as i think she did an excellent job in the first term and seems to have done so this time round as well. in regards to this section of your manifesto i am very interested to hear your thoughts in this area as i too would love to see that come into play in eve. please feel free to contact me in any way you see fit about this or simply post your thoughts and ideas here.
3/28/2009,confirming i will be voting for this candidate :d
3/28/2009,"hello erik,i created the csm chat channel for this very purpose, and the third csm is welcome to use it to keep in touch with the playerbase. i agree with your viewpoints on informing the players of csm activity, but i am currently drawn between you and dierdra for the csm vote (i only have one vote).that being said, i am against the concept of a party in any political system, let alone eve. if take care is an ethic rather than a party, i'd be all for it (as i tried to implement that very concept in csm2).keep up the good work, and i wish you the best in the upcoming election."
3/28/2009,"i have to concede that despite 'corporate differences' i would certainly vote for lark as he at least has an idea of what he is talking about and appears to have some kind of vision insofar as to the role (unlike some [cat'o'ninetails]).i have read your blog (very kind of someone to make that for you) and think your ideas are well thought out, well presented and balanced. good luck with it, lark. i for one, hope you make it.kras.edited for spelling(beer does that)."

3/28/2009,"hello,after taking some time to reflect on comments both in forums and conveyed directly about my proposal for a political party to represent the players often described as ""carebears"" i have decided to run for the third council for stellar management.i will be doing this to guaranty that the proposed ""voice of reason"" party will have a candidate in the elections. i will be driving party focused dialogs to establish the core tenants of this political organization.at this time i have not formally submitted my application for the election but will complete that in time to comply with the deadline.first steps now will be to establish the party and develop the political process to create our visions. these early steps will include:1. creation of party forums and website.2. establishment of the process to join.3. establishment of the party ""planks"".4. a virtual party convention.5. pre-election activities to raise visibility and participation.other early activities will be creation of logo and selection of a slogan for the party for this election.i want to make it clear that other candidates can join this party and process if they commit to the part values. if prior to the election we determine that the party needs to field a reduced set of candidates or even a single candidate i support the idea of an election as part of the virtual convention to select the candidates the party will vote for (i will gladly submit to another candidate if the party determines that this will best represent their interests in the csm process).so i hope many of you will join me in this new experiment in eve politics.issler dainzeceo tadakatsu obata corporationfounder of the honda accordcsm ii memberfounder of the eve ""voice of reason"" party"
3/28/2009,"issler,i agree with you in the call for a party. and as my colleague, ankhesentapemkah, has already pointed out above : the call has been heard and take care was formed. did you have a look? take care is a promise to the voter : give us your vote - we will use it well, and we will even tell you why.continuity - not conservatism, but using the methods, which were found during a term, also in the next term. take care delegates need not re-invent the wheel in the council's next term. we have a network to communicate to pilots, to the council, and eventually to ccp.efficiency - we are offered a supreme opportunity of participation by ccp in building the best game universe ever. take care will make sure that council discussions are aimed at one supreme goal : put the voter's voice through to ccp. discussions and conflicts must be fought out with that one thought in mind that an issue entry needs to be shaped for ccp to understand.communication - i know from my own experience how hard it was during the first term to reach information about the topics, which were discussed in the council. thanks to take care, i had a competent partner, who would not throw incomprehensible minutes at me, but explained what essentially was going on.dialog - take care does not make an end to the eternal fight between industry and piracy. we keep the fire burning, in fact, we turn up the heat. i enjoy mining outside high-sec a lot more because risk is involved. more than taking a position towards industry, take care takes the position of the moderator, who makes sure every voice is heard. who understands the need to shape an idea, which is in the end put onto the table of the council and has a chance for a majority. for a better game !i agree very much with herschel yamamoto in that point : take care is a platform to let this conflict be discussed, to let it be discussed by many many pilots, and to build a strong position from that discussion which can be put onto the table of the council.take care, party for eve csm(edited for layout...)"
3/28/2009,"i'm with you issler. at least insofar as it will not effect the freedom that makes playing eve so great. i would be excited to support a canditate who would, (for example) help push the already discussed sov changes that might encourage alliances to be more inclusive to peaceful players. that would be a change that would benefit the game in the long run by forcing more interaction between players. that is really what makes mmo's so great in the first place. if thats you i'm on board."

3/29/2009,"i would understand them saying flat out no if we asked for it next week, but we can wait, we just want them to start work in it. how long it takes is no issue as long as the current pos's get the job done. but at this point, its like they are ignoring pos's and how bad they are in favor of new stuff. i do understand the importance of new content but ccp do need to think of all the players that end up running all these pos's. they said that they would like sov mech and pos's to be addressed post trinity and we have seen nothing changed.if anything all i and a lot of others want is a simple answer, if not today then when will our stick pos's be replaced with something that looks like a player owned station, and when will you quit disappointing new players who get excited about seeing there first pos only to be let down with the junk in space that it is today."
3/29/2009,"yes i bashed into their heads that there should really be an interbus station to at least fix empire standings. on the pirate ones they were very vague, but said they would like to see some mechanics that allow it. don't expect anything soon for them though. faction standings really need to be dynamic based on game events, imo, it makes no sense to have them fixed like this."

3/29/2009,"nope. this is in eft with all level 5 skills. the main reason that the nag does so much better than other dreads is that it uses four weapons instead of three. 2 proj, 2 torps, and an extra slot for the siege mod. it's the only dread with 5 highs. i did not, in that instance, throw damage mods into the mix. that is only the ships themselves plus weapons @ max skills across the board, as well as top-damage non-faction ammo. i did not include the siege mode damage because it is moot - all dreads get the same damage boost from siege mode.however, as i was writing that, i re-did it with siege mode...and the dps results are the same. using long-range turrets, the nag takes the cake at 2497, the rev is a close second at 2470 (although lack of need to reload may make that better), the moros is kinda sad at 1998, and the phoenix is **** poor at 1955.with short-range turrets, the nag again wins at 3163, moros in second with 3088, revelation with 2823, and the phoenix again loses with 2127 (one torp swapped for an ion siege).so yeah, the nag's damage is not bad, per se. you just need to do 2-3 times the training to get it better than everyone else's, and even then, your tanking ability in a nag is awful in relation to other dreads. that's all i'm saying. ..... *weeps at the sorry state of minnie caps*"
3/29/2009,"the main reason the nag is terrible is because you have to fit damage mods for both guns. while a phoenix or rev can throw 3 damage mods on and it applies for all their weapons, the nag throws 4 on and only 2 apply for each weapon. the 4 weapons are completely negated by this fact and the fact that only one of the nag's bonuses applies to each group of weapons (where as the phoenix and rev have two for each gun, the moros has one and the crazy drone bonus). throw in the fact that faction crystals are easy to come by and last a long time and it's easy to see why the rev is the best.this is of course assuming best case scenario setups as most alliances realize how bad the nag is and just brick tank them."
3/29/2009,yes please
3/29/2009,"system/network scannerspersonally, i would prefer something linked to sovreignty as a system scanner. if sov level then you can anchor a module at a tower. make it a big power/cpu module so it cannot be on a deathstar and make it fragile. then you can have a small gang attack the module offline it and then go on there merry way.sov 1 makes people in constellation appear 10 seconds after jump cloak finishes.sov 2 makes people in constellation appear instantlysov 3 makes people in system appear 10 seconds after jump cloak finishessov 4 makes people in system appear instantlythat way, if you hold sov space you get some protection."
3/29/2009,"what protection is local? an arbitrary list of names? how do you know if player x is in a recon or just sitting in a shuttle somewhere?you use the scanner.enhance the scanner. scanner sends out a 10-second cycle ping when it's opened, and the window can be made smaller- in fact, if you remove the local window that people have up separately, you instantly have room to place it. from there on, you can have 2 options, active and passive scanactive scan sends out a ping which signals itself to other players running both and active and passive scan.passive scans are useful when cloaked in a covops. you have a more limited scan range, say -50%, and you cannot activate any weapon groups/modules while in passive mode.an option, to steal from freespace- is to have a scanner able to detect a ""hostile configuration"" which can determine if the ship on scan is set positive or negative based on standings. i don't see why this isn't the best solution.a) players that have these vast empty systems and rely on local/alts to be afk monitors on hostile fleets now will have to defend the space they claim.b) covops can still do recon missions in which they were designed forc) mining ops still have that level of protection, you just can't afk mine solo in yor hulk without at least watching the scanner occasionally for a blip.d) there is still a mystery, especially if the other person is beyond scan range (having a full system scan range negates the purpose if ""hostile configuration"" is implemented.this option keeps your intel tool, that requires some level of intelligence to use, it removes local allowing some mystery and not the instablob of some alliances when you want to come down and have some love.best of all, it makes black ops useful."
3/29/2009,no.
3/29/2009,"so after removing local you give less informations if someone don't use the scanner actively, see that as balanced and think that people will not use it actively. don't work that way. you will get some new player doing that error, but the largest part of the people will be pinging the scanner constantly. and you will be still giving less information on a passive scan. less than the current scanning system and less than active scan.removing the information gathering system can be some pvpers wet dream as they think to get tons of kills that way, but the results will be more blobbing and less kills as people will become even more paranoid and stay in high sec, not the reverse."
3/29/2009,"i am strongly against it.this will not help pvp. it will get some poor random sobs jumped while mining or ratting yes, but actually finding a fight with your enemies will be made harder since you can't tell reasonably quickly where hostiles are unless they're literally on the same grid as you are.i only support specialist cloaked ships not showing on local (while cloaked). that's fair, if you want to sneak up on someone, get a sneaky ship."
3/29/2009,"are you intentionally trying to be obtuse?the 'auto-updating' directional scanner does not need to see anything but manned ships. there is absolutely no reason whatsoever to have real-time updates on unoccupied ships, asteroids, wrecks, pos structures, and all the other crap that the current directional scanner can scan for. all of that can be left for the manual scan that will presumably be left as a sub-function of the new ship's scanner."
3/29/2009,"there is no pvp in w-space. 'cause there is no local there, see?"
3/29/2009,"he's already gotten his ship back, along with the destroyed modules. he's asking for people to get the dropped(i.e., not destroyed) modules back in future as well."
3/29/2009,dang that lucky ****eri lost dozens of multibillion battleships in pvp and i never petitioned them!so ccp officially acknowledges hp bug? they have to if they agreed to reimburse. can we got some official bug hunter or ccp to confirm?
3/29/2009,"i would really appreciate it if people actually read my post, this wasnt about getting reimbursement and it certainly wasnt lag. i didnt mention lag in my post at all i said that 2 zealots killed me in 2 volleys (under 8 seconds) and i've taken on far bigger camps and lived. maurauders for anyone who actually has an iq are perfect ships for pvp they have an awesome bonus to both damage and tanks and the only weakness is ecm atleast in the kronos's case. as i have already said i do not expect reimbursement, my case has already been declined but i think that things need to change for the future."
3/29/2009,"pyramid quoting is not allowed.applebabeare you joking... this post is ridiculous and you are actually stupid. let me put it this way the maurauder has 9k armor 80+% resistances and with t2 aux nano pumps, exile booster and the reppers it repairs 2,719 armor per repper, or 5,438 armor every 11 seconds. wow at taking on 2 hacs, what was i thinking... and just for the record i have fraps of me taking on 15 or so hacs and tanking with ease i can upload if you want me too"
3/29/2009,"this isn't the forum for showing off your internet *****, that would be crime and punishment. that said, tanking 15 hacs with a 3000-ish dps tank sounds like one hell of a feat. their drones alone should down you. also, don't post gm discussions publicly - it's not allowed."
3/29/2009,"dangit, herschel, ya beat me to it. that just goes to prove, go to work for 8 hours, and the whole universe changes while you're gone :)basically, see herschel's post above (^^^^) for the reasons why this will never work. unsupported."
3/29/2009,say... is this something i should report?yeah.... i think i will.
3/29/2009,"has anyone from ccp confirmed existence of hp bug?because if it's real, it's a game breaker"
3/29/2009,"this post has been cleared of inappropriate content.regards,the eve online moderation team"
3/29/2009,"killmails are bugged, *especially* damage dealt. in fact i dare you to find one correct killmail since the last patch. i see you are claiming hp bug, but since ccp denied your request and you cannot show any evidence (logs can be modified and one second of fraps is useless) there is no reason to believe you. i know you are super leader of triumvirate but i have killed some very e-famous people and they *****ed and moaned about lag and dropping when that clearly wasn't the case. would like to hear from the people who killed you since they have little reason to lie.as for getting your modules back, let's think about this, shall we? by using the petition system you know that petitions, especially reimbursement petitions are not answered immediately. in fact, they usually take a few weeks if you escalate them. what happens to dropped modules in a couple of weeks? people sell them of course. so do you yank the module from someone who legally bought the module? no, you have to reverse the entire transaction. now consider the module changes hands multiple times. now you have to reverse a chain of orders and screw up a lot of people's wallets/assets. i think you can see the problems that this will cause. another what if, let's say your corpum lar dropped when you died due to a bug in the game and i loot it. i put it on my kronos. i get killed in a legit manner a few days later and it drops again. ccp grants your petition and all modules. now they either have to yank the lar from someone who fairly got the module in a fight or duplicate the module. you also run into the situation where if you recovered your own loot with an unaffiliated alt and got your ship back, you'd have another corpum lar out of thin air from ccp.you might think it is worth it for your super expensive marauder to go through all of that, but with a standard t2 loss it is too much work and we can't have different treatment for different people just because they lost a few more expensive imaginary pixels.nice little tri threadnaught you got going on here, it's cute :)"
3/29/2009,"no, they haven't i have been in plenty of armor based combat with session changes and have not noticed any problems. i have noticed that modules refuse to online when i first fit them. but anything can happen and strange things have happened on tranquility plenty of times.if there is evidence of an hp bug, we really need to get that narrowed down asap as that would be a show stopping bug."
3/29/2009,"well the bug has been fixed now, but as an extreme example we noticed that just after the patch our titan which was at the time cloaked in a safe had one hundred (100) armor hp.anyway this thread really isnt about the bug or reimbursement for me but as deva said a call out for a clear and fair reimbursement policy for the future. i dont really see why people dont want this, how many people have had petitions that have been succesful then petitioned again with the exact same problem and it gets rejected. there is quite simply no consistency on ccp's part."
3/29/2009,"i have reported your post as it is once again off topic, this isnt about tri or me so please take your bitterness towards us and throw it out the window. read my entire post again and actually try and understand what im saying. this is no mail bug and i got the ship back."
3/29/2009,"while i can see how this works in a 1v2 battle, how does it work in a larger battle, where the process of obtaining your loot may cause several other people to lose their ships doing so, only to then be denied the loot because the original destruction was a bug.yes, it's a bug, yes it sucks, but unless it's an exploit i can't see how you can justify the amount of time it would take to come to a decision about what to do in 'x' situation.you certainly can't give isk as well as the modules, what if an ally scooped the modules, free isk. what if you then knew how to reproduce the bug, more free isk.also, you petitioned and quickly received your ship back ? after a patch even ? wow.keep in mind that with every loser, there is a winner, and when you lose something to a bug, you can think/know it's a bug, but the minute someone loses their loot from someone they killed, it will be for certain, a gm acting inappropriately."
3/29/2009,"i agree it would be difficult if not impossible to take back said items from the players who have them, but if the servers show clearly there was a bug i see no reason why ccp cannot simply give isk as a means of compensation to that player. think about the isk lost even in a fleet battle in loot it would probably come to no more than 1-2 bil even in a battle of 100's of people unless someone fitted pimped gear. that ammount of isk being given back to players for their loot wouldnt make a dent in the economics of eve but it would be fair, which is really what i would like to see. if their logs dont show anything then fine but for the blatant bugs such as mine where yeah within 24 hours i did get the ship back i should also get everything else back. again i am not asking for reimbursement now but merely using my loss as an example because its the best one i have."
3/29/2009,"signed.sucks losing a ship to a ccp ""feature"". good luck recovering."
3/29/2009,"if a bug is identified as a bug and reimbursement takes place, it has to be complete. that would be bad for those who benefited from the bug, as they'd lose the modules. but when did ccp ever allow those who took advantage from a bug allow to keep it? especially not since it even fits the exploit rules. when i shoot something that goes pop so easily that i should know something is amiss, i would have to petition it myself, even if it is to my disadvantage. at least that is what the rules say, when i last checked."
3/29/2009,"this is a toughie on one hand i agree in prinviple that its a tough loss which should have been advoidable, howeveri assume you have been playing a while and know the reimbursement policy, if that is true you should be aware of the tough stance ccp take on these reimbursement issues and also you should know that as soon as you undock anywhere your ship and mods are at risk either due to game mechanics de-sync/lag ecti remember a while a go i undocked in a pod during a war dec, black screened long enough for my pod to go pop losing implants this was petitioned falling on deaf ears :( but i accepted it grudgingly for me travelling in 0.0 and low sec in a faction fitted ship adds to the adrelenien, so with those thoughts and the difficulty ccp have for tracing and returning lost mods i cannot support this although i do feel for your loss and for that im sorry to read what happened"
3/29/2009,thats exactly what i mean though i knew the second i saw those mods lived i wouldnt get them back but i've been far too lazy to fight the cause of full and fair reimbursement because i've never really lost anything of high enough value to bother.but i think its something that should be changed.
3/29/2009,"i would support a fair and standardised method of reimbursement by the gm's and on those accassions where a esculation happens a more human approach is adopted by the gm's rather than them applying rules;1)differantly to differant people2)in cases where a exception can be made based on sound judgement and if the situation warrants it my main gripe with ccp is applying rulings unfairly and differantly to differant players, if your op included a reform of the reimbursement policy and procedure to include my points above - you will have my support :)"
3/29/2009,signzored!
3/29/2009,"since so many morons fail at reading even when the op repeats it.here the story,ship goes into gate camp.ship dies and drops mods.ccp reimburse ship and destroy mods but not the drop mods!here what the op is requesting.that drop mods also be return to the owner of ths ship in a case that ccp does reimburse a ship.i don't see any logical reason not to support. they don't have to take the items from the people who loot the wreck, just give the person all their stuff back.this game is already eats up a lot of time. losing a few billion to a glitch that ccp is willing to reimburse for got to suck."
3/29/2009,"if the proposal read like.""i recently had a ship re-imbursed after i lost it in a glitch. they did not re-imburse the billions of isk worth of modules that dropped from the ship however. this policy should be changed.""i would have supported. instead of that he wrote a two page pity-party about losing is fraking kronos. if he wants my support, he can clean up his main post. or maybe the half-dozen posts in response to dissention that sound like this. """"are you stupid ?? do you think two zealots can break a officer fitted kronos tank with 2vollys? shocked and roll your eyes again to darkness the lord ill slap you in the face""i'm not stupid for thinking a marauder can't tank two hacs solo anyway. neither is isaac. main poster is a rude jackass, and i haven't seen any evidence to support the claim that ccp wouldn't reimburse the modules from a bug-killed ship.personally, i think it's generous they gave him anything."
3/29/2009,"i support this, and i've been wondering why it's been this way for some time. my friend used to fly a typhoon in lvl 4 missions, and it looked like he was giving birth to missiles at a rate that would make rabbits jealous.i don't see how this could add too much effort to the cpu, as we can already turn off a lot of effects. the only thing that would complicate this issue (and not by much, mind you) is finding where to put the things on the already small ships (such as a rifter). the line of effect should be easy for the clients to calculate.signed."
3/29/2009,agreed
3/29/2009,"it's one of those things we all just got used to and to a point accepted, but that doesn't make the request any less valid."
3/29/2009,"i have been wanting something like this since 2003 i guess :pi mean, the icons of the launchers even show how they could look... just put it in allready"
3/29/2009,needs looking at. explosion velocity is ridiculous.
3/29/2009,"definatly supported, the numbers say it all and cit torps are just pathetic currently..."
3/29/2009,so i trained a phoenix a few months ago. the moment it was ready i hopped on sisi and started pew pewing and realized that the missiles go about 1km/s and can't hit anything that moves for any damage at all. the ship is so laughably bad that i sold the character.citadel torps need a big boost for both the phoenix and naglfar's sake. it's really pretty sad how awful those dreads are compared to the others.
3/29/2009,i quote this and remember the thumbs up !
3/29/2009,the concept of a physical skillbook that must be transported makes no sense and adds nothing to the game.
3/29/2009,"there's your problem - the ""within 4 au"" mechanic has changed. stuff can be anywhere now, meaning that a rack of cores isn't enough. also, it's not ""worse"" in any meaningful way, because it's not a choice between the two. you can scan with cores, or you can scan with ds and cores. nobody scans with just ds(at least, not after this nerf). you find it to 2 au range, reel your ds probes, launch cores, and finish the job. adds about thirty seconds to your scan time. as for the four-probe complaint, i think we all agree it's unrealistic. i just don't expect to see it change, because then they'd have to rebalance everything from scratch."
3/29/2009,"deep space probes are still useful for quickly canvasing very large systems for exploration sites. if you want to visit any of those sites you can easily switch to exploration probes and get to work. just because the deep space probes are no longer the be all end all of scanning doesn't mean they are ""useless"".it was a good nerf."
3/29/2009,"a) only using four probes ensures that scanning is about placement, not ****ting out as many probes as you can and throwing them around a hit. i like the lack of clutter, thank you. it's hard enough to see what's going on with four overlapping probes, nevermind 8.b) what you're proposing is basically making scanning easier. it's already easy to scan down stuff. if you were to double the scan strength of dsps, allowing you to scan down sites even faster, then you'd need to make all signals harder to find. you'd either just raise the skill cap to explore with any decent measure of success, or make exploration once you hit astrometrics v incredibly easy."
3/29/2009,"i can support what the other delegates in the csm with me have said. i would also like to point out that it makes no sense that the developers would sacrifice the game they know and love for the epeen of saying ""i have 3 trillion dollars"". ccp is a business, and as such, it runs by rules to ensure the game continues to move smoothly."
3/29/2009,"it is a good thing that ccp employees play the game, because it is the best (and only) way to ensure that they know what the game is all about.it is a good thing that they do so on the live server, because the test server is not a true representation of the actual game environment, since it follows a lot of different rules.it is logical that they make isk for their characters somehow.it is also logical that they do so based on what they know, as long as that does not include using exploits. they can't avoid knowing things, after all. you don't expect them to drug themselves thick and dozy every time they play, right?you have to trust in ccp, ccp's internal watchdogs and the csm to keep a watchful eye on this. if you don't, it makes no difference anyway, because if ccp actively tried to smash the game, they'd succeed with or without your trust, with or without controls. even if it just meant to go bozo on the server blades with a fire axe. that would be pretty dumb, though. after all, eve is their biz, not just their hobby."
3/29/2009,"im gonna believe they have rules for playing on tq , its a damn shame they arent public tho.im sure they woud never ruin the game they worked on so hard. however they might think its fun to get rich and wage wars on tq. if even the ia team thinks its fun for them to wage wars we got a problem as it can get pretty unbalanced to fight someone with near unlimited isk.im into pvp a lott but i dont like putting a lott of effort/time into beating a enemy that has unlimited resources, it is why when the t20 thing got out i started to put very little serious effort into eve(changed from a 10 hours a day pvper believing everyone can be defeated to a pvper that plays a few hours a day casualy) as the person ur fighting might be one these ccp guys.question is , is it fun/allowed for them to wage/organise wars or not?and from what you have seen are they into that stuff on tq? or is that nda aswell.."
3/29/2009,you do realise that this forum is for the bringing of ideas to the attention of the csm and not ccp internal affairs right.....?damn you fail....
3/29/2009,well. done.
3/29/2009,"are you a shareholder or something? ccp is a privately owned company. so no, they didn't make the game for you. they made the game for themselves and released it to the public in order to create profit. that they even listen to people in order to improve the game and thus their profits, you should be thankfull for."
3/29/2009,"cripes. another mm loser that believes all the propaganda his leaders spew out.get it through your tin-foil covered head, ccp is not out to get everyone and there is not a great ccp conspiracy on tq. most ccp employees have no idea how the market is going to react to changes just like the rest of us. any sort of blatant market manipulation based on insider info would be easily caught by ia."

3/29/2009,"you're under the impression here that concord is new eden's police force. it's not. it's the carebear defence league - if you shoot a bear(one that isn't stupid enough to re-flip a can or similar, at least), concord comes to smack you around. it's not supposed to be balanced, it's not supposed to be fair, it's supposed to be a deterrent backed up by the banhammer, such that the bulk of eve's user base can play the game in relative peace. and that will never, ever change. get used to it."
3/29/2009,good god no.
3/29/2009,"i value pew pew as much as anybody in this game and maybe more, but i still groan every time i see i ""get rid of concord"" thread. i realize this is not precisely what you're proposing, but the bottom line is concord exists for a very important purpose. just because you need to get your pew pew fix doesn't mean we should be able to evade concord. if you part non-consenting, under prepared riff raff from their ships, just go to w-space."
3/29/2009,ccp makes industry a full-time training job. someone who really wants to explore the industry side cannot train the skills to keep up with a pirate. you want to remove their protection just so you can have easier access to easy targets.you wouldn't happen to own a van that likes to sit outside elementary schools do you?
3/29/2009,"i remember a long time a go it was possible to outrun concorde (specially when ur mine exploded in 0.0 whilst you were out and about)however it was decided that breaking concorde rules was punishable by a ship loss and it has become a exploit if this was somehow advoided,i fully agree with the current mechanics and do not support the op"

3/29/2009,"how old are you? try being constructive.edit: just checked your avatar ingame and you are an obvious troll, you have barely been playing five minutes and i doubt you have got any killmails from shooting mining lasers at roids.-----------------------------------------"
3/29/2009,"as i said at the start, the people that are against do not really offer any good reason as to why we have/need km's, if people really need to keep a record of what they do then why not just fraps it(as most people seem to do anyway)? if you want the enemy set-up then scan the ship, if you want stats then keep a diary. do any of you remember when ascn lost their titan? (the first titan ever made) did you need to see a km to know it had been popped? the answer to that is ""no"".-----------------------------------------------------"
3/29/2009,"actually, several good reasons have been given. 1) it makes sense in-game that people would look at the wreckage to see what exactly they killed.2) it's a game, people like keeping score.3) the game should do that kind of monotonous record-keeping for you, not demand that you do it yourself. 4) tracking corpmate performance, to help you improve their play. 5) tracking corporate performance for the purposes of creating a clear and unambiguous combat record, which can then be used to(e.g.) advertise mercenary services. 6) there's no good reason to remove them, it's fine, l2p. also, i know i don't use fraps - doesn't it utterly ream your system performance? my computer isn't exactly the fastest machine on the market, it can't handle another high-need program while eve's running. besides, expecting players to be forced to use third-party tools when the first-party tool already exists is silly."
3/29/2009,"/signed for the counter-argumentcloaking is a balanced mechanic as it exists in the game. you can't find them, but they can't harm you. and if they try to harm you, they're doomed. the exception of course, being stealth-role ships, since that is their purpose, to hide and lie in wait and ambush. but compared to similar ships, they're still weaker combat-wise.yes, cloaked ships are impossible to scan down. the cloaking device bends all electromagnetic radiation around it seamlessly, rendering it invisible to any form of detection. while it is cloaked, its sensors are offline as well, so it is not emitting anything that a probe would pick up on since it is far too small to register passively on magnetometric and gravimetric sensors."
3/29/2009,"i was watching the video of revelations and in the background of space you can see thousands of stars in a narrow band, seperate from the basic background stars, all around you. these are the stars that we can travel to in game and that we see when we open ""map"". it depicts the stars all around us and its so neat.however after revelations, ccp no longer has the ""map"" stars visible in the background, just the basic background stars are visible. i am wondering if they can put them back into the game because seeing the stars in the background as you play helps with immersion i think. i wonder if they removed them from view because they created lag? or why don't they have them visible in the background anymore?can we get them back visible again? maybe even add in the thousands of stars we can go to via wormholes too, that would be neat to see as you look around your ship in space"
3/29/2009,"to me it sounds way more logical if all the ceos had to vote for some important decisions such as;disbanding allianceinviting/kicking a corporation.hell what about simple introducing ""shares"" of a sort this way the guy who started the alliance can decide if he likes a vote system or not."

3/29/2009,"thanks for asking gothar. there are a number of ideas that i personally like include looking at group dispersal weapons both modifying the existing ones (i.e. smartbombs and launched bombs) to make them more use able and the creation of new types such as chaining weapons. one of the key areas though that i feel could benefit the small gang pvp group would be an in game record of intelligence gathering allowing the fc to better track what is going on outside of his own vision. i would like this to be integrated into the map so a commander could at a glance see the disposition of potential enemy forces assuming he has scouts in the area. obviously this would benefit large scale pvp as well but i think the effect it would have on small gang pvp would be extremely beneficial. obviously this wouldn't replace the old tested methods of voice-comms and a pen and paper but it would supplement it. the long outstanding issue of transferable kill rights, if implemented, would also help to increase the opportunities for solo pvp and am very much in favour of this issue and would hope to be able to raise it again with ccp. i feel the concept of ""bounty hunter"" sub-career would not only fit right in with the feel of eve but would open up exciting opportunities to those who like to spend time gather intel and finally strike at the moment they think is right. the issue surrounding it that would be problematic in my eyes would be the old clunking bounty system which at the same time would need an overhaul. beyond these areas i think that factional warfare could do with a change to decrease the benefit of large numbers of people in a single plex capturing it although that ideas isn't fully formed in my mind how it would work and therefore i can't go into much detail right now. these are just the ideas that have captured my imagination so far that have been bought up by various people of course and if a proposal is put up in the assembly hall that would benefit the area of solo and small gang pvp it would get careful consideration from me if i were to be on the csm. well thanks for the input anyway sak. please feel free to give your reasons so the other people reading this can be aware of your concerns and better come to their own decision."
3/29/2009,i like your ideas and may vote on you. good luck in the election./erem
3/29/2009,"heartstone, bunyip,thank you for closely reading my op, and let me give you a few thoughts regarding the two topics you were touchingsandbox and factional epic warfareour positions are very much related, heartstone, and i can see where you are coming from; jade's plea for more pilot-storyline interaction is among the most captivating i've ever read. and using fw as one possible vehicle to flatten individual (and erratic) influence onto possible storyline branches is quite clever. still, as we stand today, the sandbox is too imaginative, factually decoupled from the game's foundation (i.e. the plot; anyone still remember why we have fw? it's war, stupid!), and isk is the least original incentive for player activity.on the other hand, sandbox and storyline impact present two economic challenges to ccp : how to balance gooning, which threatens effectivity of investments, and how to offer content with as little man power as possible ? one part of the solution, and very much web 2.0 in that regard, is to let the players create content. and the second is to give them choices - not too many choices, for man power reasons - and make sure the choices depend on many pilots rather than one. that is why i advocate two ideas as my very own agenda :- tradable kill rights- programmable npcsthe former might one day replace concord, and the latter i see as a major milestone to boost the sandbox into a new dimension : it will bear a sister to the player-driven economy, which is the player-driven mission system, it will link wis to space, and it comes for almost free for ccp.we should cooperate, heartstone, and make sure that ccp shift their focus accordingly.a party is a party is a partyand then again, bunyip : it is not. look at it as a mechanism to make the communication pilots -> ccp more efficient. i'll give you three examples:issues are not always risen by posting on the forum, let alone the ""right"" forum, which is the assembly hall. the mass of pilots is using their network of friends to communicate and exchange. that is where the idea of our party network kicks in : having a csm's ear everywhere. thus, many good ideas will not only be discussed on an alliance's forum, but also picked up from the perspective of a council's member, who knows, how to work with the issue until is gets presented to ccp.secondly, the csm has rules which are written, and then there is the unwritten governance regarding communication within and to ccp. having the party as mechanism to assure forwarding of experiences from ankhesentapemkah to me will bring continuity into the discussion between csm and ccp. not so much in terms of eva's personal favourite issues to be continued, but knowing how to deal with people. that will allow me to start at full speed and give both csm and ccp a predictable (read: reliable) team player. in the end, this is to the benefit of pilots, who will turn to me to have their ideas represented.thirdly, and just mentioned, as a pilot, you will want to find someone to get your ideas through to ccp. nothing more teadious than now having to convince the csm first, before ccp reads your idea. take care has a clear identity, in addition to the above said professional yet less tangible aspects :- small industry / gangs- roleplay- balanceif you as a pilot, have an idea in this area, take care will be your addressee and your voice to ccp."
3/29/2009,"introductionmy name is weazy and im running for the csm. i thought about doing this the last two times, and basically assumed that the people who would run would be representing the majority of eve online players. however, through following the progress made by the last two councils, i would be neglecting my responsibilities as a player if i did not run. the bickering, pointless arguing, and general neglect of the playerbase has led me to believe that the people who have been in csm have done a poor job making any noticeable progress.bio/platformfirst and foremost, i am a pvper. i dont mine, i dont rat, i dont plex, and i dont build. my only occupation is 0.0 combat, both small gang and pos seizing. i am under the impression that eve was designed to be a combat environment with a secondary emphasis on everything else. i currently fc for the dara cothrom alliance in cloud ring, where i run ops daily in all combat situations (defense, roams, pos seizing, and gatecamping.) i am not a pirate, i do not grief new players, but i spend my time in eve as a human wrecking ball. over the last few months, i have observed the shifts in pvp tactics from an fc and combat perspective, and think i can provide ccp with valuable insight as to how combat in 0.0 works and can be improved. im not signing up to run because i hate falcons or think amarr is overpowered, im running to represent the so far neglected voice of combat pilots who have always adapted to flavor of the month combat and will continue to kill because thats why we play the game. i have been playing eve since 07/07 and run three accounts, with my two mains at around 30m sp each. i have been a member of many 0.0 and high sec corps and alliances including bruce, daco, pure., and others. i have experience as well with high sec mission running,t1 and t2 production/invention/research and am well versed in the carebear arts, but i have enough isk so i dont need to manufacture any more. my toons encompass all four races so i am not partial to any in particular. i have led fleets to all ends of the universe, and my favorite type of op is (of course) the small gang roam.real life infoim a 23 year old student living in the southern united states. i attend university with studies in a broad range of topics, ranging from history to computer science. summaryif you vote for me, you will be voting for someone who really enjoys combat and will work with ccp to make it as fun as possible. i have many ideas to bring to the table, and know i can make a contribution to the combat side of eve.a vote for weazy is a vote for pew."
3/29/2009,"howdy.what are your ideas on ccps plans to make 0.0 more interesting?and what do you think should be done to make 0.0 more interesting, namely pos warfare?"
3/29/2009,"hello all,my effort in the campaign as a csm will be focused on pvp. let me introduce myself, my friends call me leo or ruri, i am 24 and study business management at university, currently in my final year, i hope to set up my own wine import-export business soon, when i'm not out or studying you'll probably find me online on eve!many players love this game because it offers the most fun pvp out there in the mmorpg selection out there, my focus will be directed to interfacing with the pvp focused community and to make that voice heard.arguments that will be discussed with the community will be matters such as:the current sovereignty system, how can we make more fun and less boredom war.low sec loss of sec status rebalanced (make low sec engagements less demanding but keep empire safe(ish) without limiting access to someone just because he popped a couple of ships).revise the bounty system to make a bounty hunter profession viable where assassination contracts are handed out between players, player/corp ""a"" hires player/corp ""b"" to kill player ""c"", no point in assigning me a bounty so that i can pod myself in my clone with no implants to collect the bounty. maybe the contract could specify variables such as: if ship kill or pod kill required, maybe if ship what class(frig,bc,bs, capital etc.),wreck ownership (if you kill something and a third party steals it flags the thief to both wreck (ex) owner and aggressor.avoid corp hopping schemes, make it so that if someone joins a corp he cannot un join for a period of time (3-5 days?)work and talk with community and devs to find a way to let players that in the sandbox choose a purist pvp a way to survive, purist missioners make loads of money, purist miners also, a pure pvp char will have many more costs but substantially less rewards, this needs to be rebalanced, also links in the next point of t2 efficiency over price vs insurable t1, what point is there in having many solutions and many ships when they are not viable?work with ccp to find a way to give small hac/recon gangs a game play more enjoyable, maybe not bring ""nanos"" back but find a way that gives small groups more choice of mobility in engagement/disengagement. what i would like to express in this point is the difficulty of groups of skilled players to be effective, a 50 mil sp char on a hac/recon vs a 12 mil sp char on an insurable bs should take in account not only the sp count but also the cost of utilizing a 250 mil un insurable hac/recon or a insurable bs.also a discussion on the ""surrender war"" option, to make it so an official ""contract"" is accepted by the ceos of the two corps, where an item exchange section is displayed and a ""safe time"" in days is displayed so that the cessation of the war is mutually agreed by both parties. the winners take the agreed cash/assets and concord can sanction the contract by saying that for x amount of agreed days the winning party cannot declare war again before the end of the agreed contract.i hope i can do my best for my brother (and enemy) pvpers so that we can all stay in this fun place and keep enjoying it!!please send me feedback and talk with me, my voice is yours to use!!!leonardo d'alessandro - ruri dant"
3/29/2009,"question: in what way do you see the establishment of a political party as having any effect in a non-binding advisory body such as the csm.you've indicated that you put some thought into doing this and i'm wondering how this will actually matter. what are you thoughts madam?edit: apologies, didn't see the party post before putting question here. if you like you can direct your response there."
3/29/2009,"i looked and i don't think that the party referenced was anywhere close to succeeding in gaining support. the fact i had to have someone point me at a thread outside the forums that were used for promoting candidates indicated to me that the party was not viable in the form it exists now.as to the stated vision of the ""take care"" party, i believe that the party should decide if they need to ""reinvent"" the wheel. the ""voice of reason"" party has no interest in ""keeping a fire burning"". we seek to assure the freedoms we believe are essential to our members within the basic tenants of eve that risk and reward are directly related and that the pilots of eve have the right to choose the degree of risk they will most enjoy. that when the risks of eve are all compared that there remain a logical relationship to the rewards.we are ""conservative"" in that we believe that the fundamental principles of the risk/reward framework must be maintained. we are however a party that embraces changes that maintain the balance but add new and interesting elements to our lives in space.i have announced my commitment to the ""voice of reason"" party in a separate thread.best of luck to all candidates and any political affiliations they happen to represent in the upcoming election of the csm iii.issler dainzefounder of the ""voice of reason"" party"
3/29/2009,"thisi vote on individuals, not party's. a csm-candidate can be a bear and have good ideas that improve eve for everyone without tilting the game the game to much in a certain direction that will alienate other players with their preferable game style. however i'm 100% certain that you, issler, are not that person that i can trust with such things.andas for the name, i'm sure you thought you were clever when you come up with that for your party, but for me that is just a big warning sign. it reminds me of small, often extreme, local parties who desperately tries to get their ideas heard but no sane individual takes seriously and gets hardly any votes on election day. no doubt you will get all your friends in honda accord to vote you in a second time, but i hope more reasonable people look elsewhere.but at least the name tickled my funny-bone for a second./eremedit: fixed some typosedit: fixed more typos"
3/29/2009,"we can pretend all we like but there's not a whole lot of leeway between ""carebearism"" and ""wanting to lick carebear tears.""it's a 0/1 toggle.representing ""being left alone"" as a blow to ""pirates rights"" is a bit of a sham isn't it. either one person gets to be the sad panda, or the other."
3/29/2009,"for reference my position on this issue is as follows: there is no place in the csm for political parties. the csm is meant to represent the eve community as a whole and not just a select group of people. whilst personal focus of individual candidates may influence where they put their vote and what subjects they cover due consideration must be given to all topics by all csm members with as little bias as possible. the idea of voting blocs, parties and vote trading seems to me to smack of corruption. to quote james madison ""the public good is disregarded in the conflicts of rival parties ..."" (james madison the federalist #10 thursday, november 22, 1787)[edit for spelling]"
3/29/2009,"of course there is a place for parties : how can the pilots, those who vote, be sure that an individual candidate will represent their vision, as he might claim to do ? except the faint incentive to be re-elected one time for a voluntary job, there is only his bio and his network, which define him.in addition to that, most of us show their alliance / corporation in the posts. would you display them if you were not in favour of their position, and deem showing your affiliation to be helpful to your cause ? that is whya) i show my face to the voterb) i think players will appreciate a csm-themed affiliation (on top of any in-game reference)as for the 1787 reference of madison, i tend to answer pragmatically : would we have parties, if they did not do a good job ? cause on one hand parties are apparently well condensing people's opinion to an executable position. and on the other hand, they balance individual eccentricity to make sure the public good is not forgotten. my rough estimation : more harm was done by self-called ""people's representatives"" who did not have a stabilizing surrounding."
3/29/2009,"not at all, read the op. this isn't so much to make lowsec space harder to get into than to make it a more enticing and worthy challenge. as a mission runner i can certainly see this idea having legs and taking off.i also see this controlling the -10 population."

3/30/2009,yessss
3/30/2009,"not a very big change but i would be good if on the orbit option in the overview we can have perhaps 3 defaults set so can change range fast while in combat rather than having too bring up the box and manually swap the orbit range. i.e, one can be set for close orbit, one outside of scram range and another at the gtfo range. as it is now if want to hold a gate in close before the jump got to swap to say 1k then keep remembering to change it to outside of scram range and tbh when in a drunken gang it does make for comedy deaths and missed tackles etc but even those wear thin after a while. so please give us a chance to pre-set a few more defult orbit ranges."

3/30/2009,"1) you haven't definite your ""less information"" before this post. 2) most of the posters suggest a range reduction in passive mode and that is the best way to make the scanner useless.3)i would very much want to see other things beside manned ships, for example probes, drones, maybe wrecks (it will give me an idea what the other guy is doing), cans (same reason as wrecks), unmanned ships if identified as such. the function of a scanner is to get an idea of what is happening, not simply to know ""there are 3 pings""."
3/30/2009,"oh yes, wouldn't make 0.0 as boring."
3/30/2009,"if you don't understand what we've said then just say so.1) what are you asking?2) read again- you misunderstand3) okas to your last part, it's the same interface. only actively scanning makes you more visable, thus the ""ping"" reference."
3/30/2009,"till the post 65 i cited no one has defined in any way what ""less information when auto scanning"" was. i don't agree that reducing them to only ""manned ship"" is a good idea, but at least it define a starting point.saying ""you haven't understood what what we are saying"" when you hadn't defined that vital point has no meaning. maybe you should read the posts again. suggestion so far:1) replace local with a pos add-on linked to sovereignty2) passive scan with reduced range3) no, we don't want a auto repeating scan good, having a starting point helped.the last part mean that getting only the ships (and pods hopefully) is getting ""there are x pings"" (targets, or however you want to call them).people need to know more informations to try to guess what they are doing. so if i lose local with his friend/not friend display i need to have more informations by the scanner to compensate. for example if i am in high sec and see:orcapod apod bpod cunmanned combat ship 1unmanned combat ship 2unmanned combat ship 3and then it change toorcamanned combat ship 1manned combat ship 2manned combat ship 3as a miner i can suspect i am in trouble even if i don't see that there are 3 red flashing guys in system. a useful feature to add to an active scanner if local is removed, is the detection of friendly transponders.i.e. i actively scan and send out a signal. all friendly (blue) pilots transponders reply and the relative ships are identified as allied, the others simply as not identified."
3/30/2009,seeing how the 2 post about reduce range when in passive mode are yours (-50% range and 3 au) can you care to explain how that will make the passive mode useful?
3/30/2009,this only works in wh space atm because there are a limited number of poss up without a bazillion ships foating in space plus most wh system i have encountered have been fairly small. in reality in proper 0.0 it just wont work.
3/30/2009,no
3/30/2009,"if you're not using the scanner, and it's just sitting there, exactly what would it matter, other than a quick glance?see, you want to have everything simple and easy, and handed to you. you want to get a full picture of the situation without any work. as you posted above, you want to know for sure based on scan results if some ships are manned or not, or what changes have taken place. hell, let's just make a huge system-wide map that shows everyone's position and what they're doing.no, a scanner should essentially say, ""x ship is roughly y au/km away and in z direction with n% accuracy.i've posted the interface will not change. but if this would be a local replacement, with the scanner constantly being on the main ui, then unless hunting for someone actively then reduce the range and add some mystery. stop wanting to play the game on easy mode."
3/30/2009,"because there is people like you that want to get a ""easy ganker"" mode.3 au passive range is laughable. it will not detect any probe (but then probably you don't want probes detected), it will detect a ship that is already warping to your position and only a pair of seconds before it drop on you. coupled with a refresh cycle of some seconds it mean it will miss a ship warping to you at least 75% of the time.that mean that passive scanning is totally useless. at that point we return to step one. mash the scan button every 2 seconds and kill the server and find the scanner made useless by lag. you don't want a replacement to the local system, you want what you dream is a ""get plenty of kills"" system.but the effect of a change like that would be exactly the same of the change of the probing system with kali.a pair of week of easy ganking of mission runners, then years of cries in forum ""where are all the low sec missionrunenrs, force them to run in low sec, we don't have target"".you will not get more easy pickings, you will simply increase the number of empty systems and cloaked ships.maybe you think that cloak on line will be a beautiful game, i think it will be a total waste of bandwidth."
3/30/2009,"yep, i really rack up those kills... oh wait. you see, here's where people like you have a huge problem.you say, nope that won't work. so instead of finding a way to fix it here and there, you throw everything out.here's a thought. passive scan range 14 au, active is 25 au.suddenly nothing changes, except we get an auto scanner that broadcasts the location.local does nothing to prevent anyone from getting ganked. oh wait, that's unless you use it as a batsignal when to run, hide, and log out.because when you run to station you can't do anything. you can't scan where he/she is. for all you know they're cloaked and afk.local does absolutely nothing right now but give a false sense of security. enhance scanning, by benefiting those that want to be found and those that don't.make it so stealth has a purpose.make it so hunting down people takes work.make it so there's no insta-broadcast of who's in space.make it so alliances can't take 100 systems with 30 people.make it so 0.0 industrialists have to actually be cautious, instead of parking a scout 2 jumps up.it's a joke, and i'm an industrialist."
3/30/2009,signed.local shouldn't show you in any systems if your not talking.
3/30/2009,"learn to read. i clearly show how item duplication and ownership of dropped loot cannot always be distinguished due to alts and trading and market/contracts. report me all you want, throw a tantrum, whine and holler, no one cares.under your idea, which you have changed from getting all items back to getting isk value back (and who determines the amount of isk to be given back, hmmm?)i'll go very slowly and hopefully you'll actually engage brain this time:1) you get popped to a bug, faction module drops2) your un-affiliated alt picks up faction module3) you get back your ship + all modules via petition4) your alt also gets isk since ccp refunded the items it took away from your alt that looted all the modules.get it?"
3/30/2009,"signet sooooooooo much signet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!this policy is more then just rediculess!.since you only get your ship back if it was killed due to a bug, i don't see how they can let people be rewarded by using the bug which is actually exploiting, this is so rediculess and should be fixed immidiately!.signed signed signed aaaaand signet :p"
3/30/2009,"you have records of everything in eve, it is just to ran everything back module wise.meaning if you got a module due to a bug, it will be removed and you will rescieve a eve mail where it states that it was a bug and therefore was removed and if it was done on purpose it would have been a exploit and therefore banneble, so people complaining clearly know it is a bug and therefore wish to exploit (well shouldn't need to say more"
3/30/2009,"im torn on this issue as well.unless ccp can find that the items have not changed hands, fitting to a ship, refined, or jetision i would say yes... give the mods back.but the problem goes back to the ""logs show nothing"" and trying to track those items let alone the chance that someone doesnt try to quick sell the mod for isk... or fit it to their shiney ship.i think it could leave room open for abuse, and cause more problems then it solves.the hp bug is something i hadn't heard of before, but its just that a bug... and its good you got some reimbuirsed.i support you in ideal, but in the current dev/player relationship through petitions, the time it takes usually to resolve reimbuirsment... its not fesible to implement, imo anyways."
3/30/2009,"i'm with ignit on this one as well. it's sort of like the legal principle that the will not disgorge an unknowning purchaser of stolen merchandise. i do believe certain exceptions should apply, such as the wreck being popped before being looted. but i'd be curious as to how you'd redress this problem 'creating' items or removing them from people who through no fault of their own came into possession of them before i'd give my full support."
3/30/2009,"the problem with this is that it starts to throw the rarity of a lot of mods into question. wait, dark, weren't you the raison d'etre for the speed nerf in you 18 km/s vaga? oh screw you not supported!"
3/30/2009,"yet again i ask you to read my post and if you have a look at the bottom i havent changed my mind on anything, i said market average value in isk is a possible option. as to your exploit... what? so ok if it is a genuine bug then it would most likely be at random like all bugs are. so in your situation you would run the risk of blowing up your own expensive items and run the risk that a) you get it back and b) the expensive modules are the ones that live. if ccp put a banning rule on this sort of behaviour i highly doubt anyone would try it because it would be incredibly difficult to do so plus bugs are very different to exploits... exploits are consistent bugs are random.all your posts are saying to me is that you have some kind of personal dislike for me or tri and you still have not fully read my opening post."
3/30/2009,"i think there are two possible fixes for this. either give the player isk back based on the average market price or perhaps impliment a new petition section giving it priority much like petitions filed under ""stuck"". say we call this new petition option ""bugged loss"" the player who has lost his ship or items petitions saying i beleive my loss was due to a bug etc etc. the gm then freezes the items or removes them from game temporarily and passes the petition on to the reimbursement department who can then do a full and normal investigation taking as much time as required for it. this minimizes the work load on ccp and doesnt **** a load of people off who have shifted, sold or used the modules themselves by having the items taken back. the petition response generally on a ""stuck"" enquiry for me has never been longer than an hour or so, no item can move very far in that time."
3/30/2009,"dark, i know you're smarter than this to not see how many horrifically myopic problems the bolded bits would bring in."
3/30/2009,its just a possible solution but i would be interested to see possible arguments. imagine also that ccp said abuse of this system would have punishment i doubt many people who arent drunk would do it.
3/30/2009,"we just need ccp to stop responding like robots and actually consider what happened, and as far as i know this bug still hasnt been fixed, i keep seeing it."
3/30/2009,gather the evidence and report it. i consider this to be a very serious issue - yet there's not enough evidence to show that it really does exist in a way suggested in this thread. a bug like that would be of critical importance to fixotherwise it's just rumors and excuses by people who lose stuff. where is the evidence?
3/30/2009,"we're playing the same game here, right?"

3/30/2009,"i've no idea if it's the exact same bug, but you can see basically the hp bug happening in one of farjung's old vids [edit: wave of mutilation 11:10 in] from several years back where he two volleys a freighter's hull with a blasterthron. there's been quite a few reports of it just recently, so i don't think there's any doubt it's a real bug. that's not the point of the thread though...the reimbursement policy is horribly inconsistent, there's no debating that. you can submit the same request in identical circumstances and depending on the gm you get you either receive your ship back immediately or have to wade through lots of firm nos, an escalation or two and then quite possibly a yes.i have heard of a couple of cases of looted mods being reimbursed (or duped rather) unfortunately i can't cite concrete cases. i guess even with a no-dupe policy recreating the odd t2 mod seems insignificant to the gms. i don't know what the solution is. we used to have a set of implicit precedents like no looted mods reimbursed, no supercaps reimbursed, no ships from fleet battles reimbursed. all these policies were grossly unfair but at least they hit everyone in the same way.now they've all been broken, gms take every case on it's own merits. that should be the ideal policy but unfortunately they've proven several times now that they're just too prone to ballsing it up. they're obviously overworked and with eve being as complex as it is it's hard for them to hire enough knowledgeable people, but something is very wrong if they can't even consistently call the headline cases correctly.the specifics suggested here on what to do about dropped loot i can't support. there are too many corner cases. it may not be a big deal to try to reimburse several bil in low-end officer gear (fortunately isk isn't insta-win in eve) but there are a lot of items in eve that are so rare you just can't put a ""market value"" on them. if the gms can't even notice how long an alliance has existed before changing it's name how can we trust them to accurately determine the value of a t2 hac bpo looted in a bug. ideas to try to freeze loot associated with suspect losses is just unworkable in general.until we reach a situation where genuinely unbiased common-sense usually prevails in petitions i tend to think hard limits with no-exceptions on various reimbursement scenarios is the (unfortunate) way to go. never-the-less i'll support reimbursement policy being raised by the csm, not because it will lead to a silver-bullet solution but because it will remind the gms they have a lot of room for improvement, however hard that improvement will be.i know vuk campaigned on customer support in general (and probably will again) and has been very tough on the gms whenever he's gotten the chance but i'm not sure it's ever come up as an official csm issue. so here's a tick and let's hope it does.i'd also personally like to see more qa effort and attention paid to the kind of bugs that lead to these situations. there are some signs that's happening, but there's a ways to go yet."
3/30/2009,"nice post, and i have to be honest i have no quick fire genius way to fix it i've just given some small suggestions as to the kind of direction it could go. but this is about raising awareness to ccp that their reimbursement policy could as you say use some improvement. thanks for post."
3/30/2009,"yeah, so everyone can see just what our damage potiential is.. wait what damage potential since the nerf... not like it matters right now missiles are a minor (at best) threat in most pvp."
3/30/2009,agree.
3/30/2009,"not supporting this, then people will know i'm in a disco-raven when i warp into the bubble on the outbound"
3/30/2009,been saying we need launcher grafic for ages.. support
3/30/2009,"i figured that this was already implied. if a skill is injected already, i can queue it up until it hits the 24 hour limit. of course the same would be true with injecting skills based on pre-reqs that are in the process of being trained.full support here. i was actually a little surprised that they missed this when they implemented the queue."
3/30/2009,fully support this only if the required prerequisites are already in the training queue.
3/30/2009,"well...because ccp saw fit to erase all your previous scan results on each new scan the problem becomes sorting through the clutter now. with core probes you have to narrow each one down, one at a time, to 100% so you can bookmark it. even if it is a site you do not want you need to go through this rigmarole so you can bookmark it to avoid probing the same site out on your next go to find whatever it is you are looking for.previously you still had to get some accuracy on it but did not need to pin everything to 100% to focus on something you wanted.and again...it is more about them being essentially the same as a core probe for usefulness. yes you can scan a bigger area with one probe but so what? you can get better hits with a few cores running a shorter range plopped to cover inner planets and remote planets. i think the guy above is wrong that sites can be anywhere. all scans i have run have all the sites within 4au of some stellar object. even if you use dsp you simply must revert to core anyway. so while not a big deal to call them back in and redeploy core why bother? not to mention this makes it worthless to train up to l5 on the skill."
3/30/2009,this. get over it.
3/30/2009,"1: you're* obviously not using spell checker and type like a* 5 year old.2: you have zero evidence.3: you forgot your tinfoil hat.4: you epically failed to troll ccp.insider trading is a term used to define the act of someone taking company information they work for and using that information on the stock market to turn a profit and making it look like they got damn lucky.for you to use such a ""grown *up term"" in the context of eve is laughable.everything is obviously public* knowledge as far as prices go...duh?all you people who whine about ccp playing amongst you...where's your proof? all i see is you claiming they do this... and yet there is no proof.seriously... get a grip on reality well yah?even if they did....you're** still not producing proof...put up or shut the hell up.---fixed---"
3/30/2009,"they might not be alone in thinking it's fun to get rich and wage wars on tq. after all, a lot players try to do either or both, and i don't think ccp employees are any different.i assume, because waging/organizing wars is (part of) the game, and they are allowed to play the game, they can wage/organize wars.the rest of your post seems to say you have more of a problem with big alliances playing eve than with ccp employees (about 0.5 % of all players, maybe) playing eve. if your worried about getting into unbalanced fights in eve, you have bigger fish to fry, so to speak.p.s. even someone with ""unlimited"" resources can be defeated, so there, go back to playing 10 hours pvp a day."
3/30/2009,"there should be a easy way for filtering local from unwanted players based on their corp or alliance. currently you can only block a single characters which is avery ineffective way of making your life easier if you want to avoid entire groups of players, for example noob corp players/isk spamming bots or some alliances you just dont want to read. many messages in same time can increase lag, but long block list can give you simmilar effect."
3/30/2009,i'm supporting this
3/30/2009,"i'm sure there's probably a good reason for this, but i'll wait for the parade of people to emorage on me to explain why. the modules in question are sensor backup arrays and signal amplifiers. taking a look at signal amplifiers between their midslot counterparts it comes out to this:signal amplifier ii:targetting range +30%signature resolution +15%max targets +2no faction variantssensor booster ii:range +30%resolution +30%activation cost: 5 capscriptable to 60%/0faction variants------------------------------in this case shield tankers are already juggling their mids for other utility slots such as tackle and propulsion, not to mention the cpu advantage is generally lost on shield tanks given their high cpu amount. the lowslot variant is less than half as effective in resolution (important due to agility changes) and the only benefit you have is a passive module that is vastly outperformed and a bonus that doesn't work because of broken mechanics.now, onto sensor backup arrays and eccm: radar backup array ii:+48% sensor strength.passive18 cpuradar eccm ii:+96% sensor strength12 cap usage/10 secondsoverloadable to 124.8%in this case the module in question is once again half as effective for about 33% cpu savings, and minor cap usage. with overloading, it becomes about 1/3 as effective, and is detracting from propulsion/cap/damage modifiers/fitting utilities. in sum, these items (as well as tracking computers/tracking enhancers) need to be reviewed from a balance perspective, as it's already one more disincentive for shield tanking in pvp."
3/30/2009,"the most reasonable thing to do, without any radical changes, is to seed faction variants for mods that have none"
3/30/2009,now compare tracking enhancers to tracking computers. low slots are allot more valuable then high slots yes those 2 mods are weird.for the rest if you have atleast 3-4 mids then low > midslot

3/30/2009,"from one who loves to fly under nrds policy, expand it please!! --isaac"
3/30/2009,"ok, first of all, im not trying to say that scamming should somehow be removed or bannable, if ppl are not wise enough to read contracts before excepting the terms, they deserve to be scammed.with that said my issue here is the blantant abuse of spamming of scam contracts in jita local. im sure i speak for many others in stating that the scammer spam in jita local chat impacts the legitamit players significantly.the solution i constantly here when ppl complain about this is simply ""block them"". well thats a fine idea, however you can only block so many ppl, and that really does not impact the potential buyers of the legit contracts, unless the potential buyers also block them. not to mention that there are only so many ppl you can block.a few ideas i have that are probobly not perfect but may help. i hope others chime in with ideas and the dev's take a serious look at this discussion.idea#1 drastically increase the amount of players that can be blocked, like to say unlimited!! (at least if only in jita)idea#2 there needs to be a time limit when posting with contracts linked. possibly 1-2 minute delays before posting another contract link (this wont affect chat). maybe not the best idea due to the fact that it will limit legit traders contract posting as well, however it will most certainly hurt the scammers more than legit traders i believe. it will also give ppl a chance to read the contracts and determine the fake ones vs the real ones, and the block the fake traders. idea#3 im out of ideas for now, you chime in on what you think may be a good solution"
3/30/2009,"i agree on idea #1, the others not so much."
3/30/2009,"just to clarify, the #2 idea about dealying posting with contracts is intended to be towards the same person posting multiple contracts one after another. although admitedly its not the greatest idea, just a thought."
3/30/2009,"and what is the problem with closing local when you enter jita and then re-opening it when you leave? unlimited block list would be nice, but if it is because of server performance limitations then i would rather have better performance.even if all the scammers and spammers were gone from jita local, jita local would still be completely stupid."
3/30/2009,"maybe a ""report spam"" system would be a good thing.. simply right click the name of the player ""add to spammer list"" and once every 5 minutes the system checks for people with more then 10 (25 or 50) reports and then mutes them for an hour as punishment. this could also be used in other places of course.. like yesterday in 49- the goons took it on themselfes to spam the hell out of local (for no appearant reason i might add) and it would be nice to be able to stop that without having to call for a gm.this doesn't prevent anyone from scamming but it would curb the pants-on-head ******ation that is currently jita local. it's like reading the viagra-spam mails all day... it's not like anyone falls for them (expect people that deserve it) it's just plain stupid and a waste of bandwidth/gm-time etc."
3/30/2009,asura starfield would be displeased
3/30/2009,"how about not allowing a contract to be posted more than say 50 times in a day? or maybe a total limit regardless of how long, like 100 max contract links."
3/30/2009,"dr. eyjog mentioned it at fanfest 2007, people have been asking for it before, others tried to make one themselves:an eve isk saving account / bank, that people can put their isk to and receive interests.the interest rate is supposed to be small, e.g. 0.5% per month or lower, so that player driven eve banks and other forms of investments can compete.the isk can be locked for a certain period of time.also the interest payment can be done on a daily basis, where people have to login and push a ""collect interest"" button, so that they receive the daily interest, otherwise the interest for that day expires. this way there won't be an uncontrolled growth of isk on inactive accounts. it would also motivate people to log in. the idea, that money generates more money without that the owner of the money has to do something is not new. interests are common in any economy system, receiving interest for money occurred even thousands years ago on earth (even mentioned in the bible), a realistic financial system (that eve is supposed to be) shouldn't lack it."
3/30/2009,and why don't you just put your money in the player driven eve banks?
3/30/2009,"eve's financial system doesn't lack it. put your money in a player bank, or a bpo, or a better mission ship, or... it's not that i'm opposed to this, i just don't see the point."
3/30/2009,this.
3/30/2009,"because i don't like to lose all my isk in the ""next big eve online scam"".banking requires trust and security. this naturally doesn't exist in eve: the bank owners can simply not pay back your isk, that's legitimate gameplay, no scam, and you couldn't do anything against it.in real life bank deposits are secured in many ways, the prohibition of scam for example, and finally through government guarantees. in eve there is nothing alike, it's a big invitation to pull a scam. player made content doesn't work properly in that trust-/security based system. i'd love to see a secured banking system."
3/30/2009,then this sounds like the issue you should be proposing be fixed. not creating a system separate from the one that already exists.
3/30/2009,evading concord is actually very easy.you just don't go into systems where they patrol.problem solved.
3/30/2009,"absotively posilutely not, and this is exactly why: carebears rely on the rule of law to run the supply side of eve's economy, because by and large they can't rely on themselves, especially when they're working in space in ships fitted for industrial tasks."
3/30/2009,yes. while in it i keep a sniper rifle handy and practise satanic rituals. i also think concord should be more easily defeated but changed so they are more like sleepers (this info is the worst of them all...shudder).
3/30/2009,"you are still operating under the mistaken delusion that concord can be defeated.i believe it's actually been said somewhere else by one of the ccp folks that if you can figure out how to beat concord, it's an exploit and bannable.besides, i already told you how to avoid them. what more do you want?"
3/30/2009,"ok, on a corp shopping trip to jita, loaded a hauler with 600mills of mods and rigs and bpo`s , at a jump gate in jita which is 0.9 sec , lag and high player count meant locked down gate , i was on auto pilot waiting at gate, serious lagg , next thing i know i was in a capsule ? wtf ??? wreck looted.checked loss mail, popped by a large smart bomb from an abbaddon battle ship piloted by a -10 sec rated player , my hull, armour and sheilds amounted to approx 2,500 hp`s yet kill mail showed i was popped with only 299 damage ? the mail smelt to me rotten and not quite right.ccp quoted as saying to me gm reply removed. navigatorcan someone please explain to me how this was possible ? how did the -10 sec player avoid concord and was able to operate in 0.9 sec space freely ? why did my loss mail only show 299 damage and 1 person involved yet my ship should have taken 2,500 plus hps ?i am at a loss to understand this .despite me also having to explain to my corp, ooops sorry guys lost the shopping !any ideas?"
3/30/2009,"so, you were on auto pilot in a little hauler, carrying over half a billion of cargo?wrong forum, and the loss is your fault. -10 are punished for being in hi sec, but they are not prevented."
3/30/2009,"a) wrong forumb) do not post communications with gms.c) being -10 just means the faction navy/police will chase him. not concord. it is possible to fight them off or tank them. given he was using smartbombs he likely was expecting to be target jammed by the faction navy/police. being in an abaddon he probably had a hellacious tank, sucked up the damage and decided to instapop whatever he could at a crowded gate where everyone is locked out.d) seriously bad move toting around $600 mil in a mere hauler. at the least a tanked to hell-and-back (plates/extenders) transport. preferably a freighter. you are asking for trouble with that much loot in a hauler.e) no idea why km was odd. maybe lag...dunno."
3/30/2009,/lock threadwrong forum. you chose to afk pilot a hauler with 600mil isk of mods (stupid stupid idea btw) and then cry about it. get a t2 hauler/freighter and pilot the dang thing. send this to c&p.--isaac
3/30/2009,"supported, as a non-smoker. don't we play immersive games to do what we can't irl?also, if there's rating issues, label it a healthy thing. air-borne medication of regenerative nanobots leaving a smoky residu trail!"
3/30/2009,"do we really need it? my employment history is long as it is, mainly due to me being a bad choice in player corporations.i would like it as some sort of option. as much as i would love to cut some player corps from that list i know that wont change"
3/30/2009,not supported.any (intelligent) corporation that considers you an as applicant is going to want to see those changes.
3/30/2009,"unless you're booted from your corp unknowingly, you never need to see a npc corp - you don't need to drop corp to switch. if you have a pile of npc corps in your history, that says that either you don't understand game mechanics too well or that you got booted from your corps, both of which a potential recruiter wants to know. beside, the gaps would say just as much as the npc corp entries do, it'd just mean that people would have to examine the start/end dates on every corp swap. also, you'd lose the ability to check character creation dates. not supported."
3/30/2009,heh.. i'd settle for timely updates on what ccp is thinking about fixing... then we'd know exactly what their priorities are.
3/30/2009,"enough talk, do it ccp."
3/30/2009,"boy wants mails done away with cause it an e-peen stroker, then trying to flame a new player for not killing enough people, thus flashing his e-peen around for all that cares (none btw). careful nebie, too much e-peen stroking makes a mess !"
3/30/2009,with my corp we made some test:a covert jump-fleet of black ops consume isotope....ok .we measure the consumption of diffrerent ship for a jump of 4ly :manticore : 258 isotopepilgrim : 3218 isotoperapier : 2725 isotoperedemeer : 845 isotopethe cargohold of the black ops being 600m3 of 4000 and may contain isotope .....consumption of covert jump-fleet was modeled on the fleet of jump-fleet of the titan ..... but the hold or consumption is a big problem ....i am not in favor of increasing the hold of the black ops to prevent abuse of all kinds .... but reduce the consumption of ship is a good solution
3/30/2009,they already implemented a supplement to this and that is with the blockade runner ship. it was designed to be able to use the jump portal as well so it could carry fuel and supplies for the fleet.
3/30/2009,"i support this.other mmo's dont' require years of trainining to make 1 character proficient in an area.doubt it will every happen, because ccp would lose a cash cow"
3/30/2009,"neither does eve. unless of course you define proficient as ""super omgwtf pwnage army of one""."
3/30/2009,ditto with one slight difference.. you can only create one personality per account but have the other slots available should you buy another.
3/30/2009,no.
3/30/2009,"you have nothing new to add to the discussion. you have not read or understood what we are trying to say.. you are just copy/pasting from other cloak related issues and think you have come up with a smart reply. what you are adressing is not, i repeat, is not the issue here. please read again, think, think some more, use your imagination to understand what the op is actually saying. then reply."
3/30/2009,"cloak is called cloak for a reason. works as intended, no issue here. macro miners are a problem which every mmo has. changing a game mechanic to aim at macro miners will aim at legit players in general aswell. we just have to live with macro miners or, better, hunt them down (yes, it is possible).sorry, no easy free carebear kills for you."
3/30/2009,"ah! i see now. it's an arguement so strong and so pursuasive that facts have nothing to do with it... only our imaginations can unlock the wisdom of this idea. i'll try hard to imagine a world where this is a good idea, i really will!"
3/30/2009,oops sorry i forgot to put [proposal]
3/30/2009,"candidacy postno website yet, will update when i throw one together."
3/30/2009,"i think ccp has done a very good job making 0.0 interesting by allowing the player base to make it what it currently is. however, i think that there needs to be more adjustment to make it more tempting for players to come out and enjoy it. one of the major problems i think eve has is the divide between the players in high sec and the players in unsecured space. one could go his entire eve career, become exceptionally rich, and never enter 0.0 if he did not want to. there needs to be more incentive for people to leave the comfort of high sec for better riches and more reward.also, i think pos sov mechanics need to be reworked to make it a bit more interesting. shooting down posses that are un-manned is about the most boring and tedious parts of the game. i would like the regular pos ai to be reworked so an un-manned pos is harder to kill, and also would like to see poses take a more backseat role in regards to sovereignty. one of the things that makes the game un-fun for 0.0 inhabitants is the fact that we have to deal with posses all the time (filling, anchoring, transporting, emptying) and have people in our alliances who do only that. if we could remove some dependence on poses for sov, everyone would be happy i assume."
3/30/2009,"ruri,i represent a different group of folks in eve and am running myself so i wouldn't be voting for you and i would be encouraging folks to vote for members of ""the voice of reson"" party. that said i hope you will run. you definitely have been committed to an important part of the eve experience. the eve csm is only better the more diverse we can become. i hope you give it a shot.good luck!issler"
3/30/2009,i am hoping that the formation of a party will increase the visibility of the csm. i also believe that while i have some ideas about what makes sense for the folks i will (or whoever the party ultimately supports) represent adding additional channels of communications and opportunities for participation will improve the input for this constituency into the csm.this is very much an experiment. i was partly inspired to take this course after some conversations with folks in ccp about this interesting venture into virtual world politics.i am excited to see how this unfolds. so i'd love to continue hear what folks think.issler
3/30/2009,"i've gotten commitments from 8 of the csm canidates for interviews, and hope to see commitments from more in the near future. i plan to post the interviews on my blog.that said, here's a link to my lead post on the subject. it also contains an index of all my interviews..if you've specific questions you'd like to see asked, just go there and leave a comment. i'll update here as this progresses. expect the completed interviews by the 20th of april."
3/30/2009,"i appreciate the time you took to respond to my post erik and i respect your position. in fact in many ways i agree with a lot that you are saying but don't personally see the need to bring in another layer of titles and names to be able to achieve it. let me briefly address some of your points from my personal perspective so you , and others may see where i am coming from whether you agree with me or not. i believe one of the essential things for a csm to be able to do is look an issue brought before the csm with as little bias as possible. to say you ascribe to one vision or another limits your options in certain circumstances if you hold to it in every case. yes there are areas in which i have opinions and thoughts for myself but i think it would be remiss of me not to consider counter arguments against those ideas for the good of the whole community. i can think of a number of ideas that would be of great benefit to solo/group pvp that would negatively impact the industrial sector for example but wouldn't vote for them precisely because of this negative impact to a large portion of the player group. in this instance i am not talking for my alliance. i am not here to represent the views of the star fraction on certain issues. i am not even here to represent the views of the roleplay community or the pvp community. i was actually considering creating a ""blank"" character to run on who had no affiliations but thought in the end that such a character would be ignored so simply went with my main character. personally i think this is a tautological argument. we have parties, in my opinion, because they are, to an extent, political easy mode. i see a certain value in them in real world politics but can't really see the need for them here. i agree that parties can be a stabilising influence certainly but the stabilisation they are shifted to more often than not seems to be towards the benefit of the party than the public that voted for them in the first instance. in the case of the csm i certainly don't doubt that the public good would be forgotten by anyone who wished to run as a party member my concern is with the implication rather than the current reality. at the end of the day though i certainly won't be railing against those that are members of parties or those that wish to represent one cause over another. i respect your position and wish you luck with it. it's just not for me."

3/31/2009,"nice idea, especially with hot keys."
3/31/2009,"i posted a thread months back about orbits and hotkeys, and especially how baffling it is to see hotkeys for certain functions like lock target, but nothing else like the various movement commands. it hardly received any notice, but no matter, this one fits the bill nicely. give us something that should've been present in the game ages ago, ccp."
3/31/2009,supported.
3/31/2009,very much a good idea
3/31/2009,"this was on the wrong page, saying that, the 3rd csm should bring this to ccp, we will see if they fair better the our current csm..."
3/31/2009,what this guy said.so no.
3/31/2009,"the were the one suggesting 3 au or in alternative to cut range by 50%.passive at 14 au is functional, 3 not. scanner don't broadcast the location. it give number of presences in range. and there are those like you that offer one sided solutions and then get all offended when people shot them down. you want it changed, your job is to offer functional solution, i don't see much reasons to change, my job is to shot down unworkable solutions.i have suggested some idea, you fell they are overpowered and shot them down, good, you are doing your part of the job, but don't pretend that your suggestion have no flaws. all your argument have a value if you offer a a workable solution, but most of your suggestion so far have been about removing a strong intelligence tool and giving in exchange a tool suffering from myopia."
3/31/2009,space is too small with local blaring your presence.i support this as it would make small roaming gangs more valid.and extend it to fw space too for extra fun.(directional)scanners need work though.
3/31/2009,"it's a change proposal. if you actively scan, it shows even on the passive scanner within the maximum range. so if you're looking for someone, you can be seen also. of course this doesn't work for cloaked, so instead i had a thought last night, with ""ghost"" images, random blips or such. this would need more thought as to houw it's implemented. but i do agree, removing local without making it possible to detect that someone might be cloaked nearby is too overpowering for covops/recons/black ops believe me when i say i'm not offended, and also when i say my ideas have flaws- i even state several posts above that any ideas of mine have issues and need to be fleshed out a bit.i've spent a lot of time in wh space recently. i've been a ""nice guy"" there and one that's not so nice. i've harvested and hunted. with no local, and constandly looking at the scanner, i've had a blast.if you delay local in lowsec and 0.0, it won't change much- lowsec is about as populated as a wh system these days anyway.part of removing local though would be to also remove static belts. this would give your lookout (if you were on an op) to notify the fc if hostiles were nearby.and if you're really that worried with a few recons coming and disrupting the party, have a couple bss, intys, and hacs around. those recons will melt like butter."
3/31/2009,i'm so disturbed right now by how many people have 0.0 alliances in their name and support this.the reality is that 0.0 space would be forced into becoming capship stationgames far more then it already is. the system wouldnt be defendable. the only people left ratting or mining in 0.0 would be farmers.
3/31/2009,"lolwhy, becase you can't park an alt 2 jumps up the pipe to see if local pops?or because those super-alliances might find it's fairly difficult to defend that much unused space without an instant intel tool?no, there would be no farmers, as they wouldn't be able to run and log as soon as someone enters local."
3/31/2009,"you know, rp reasoning for this can be used either way.""this information is available to all ships within the sphere of influence of those gates hence jumping into system leads to your appearance in local.""can you explain why this has to be?"
3/31/2009,oh can you imagine how awful that would be. oh the horror! the horror!(disclaimer: would not really be horrible)
3/31/2009,speak for yourself.pro-tip: ratting can be done with other ships than lolfit ravens warping to belt-markers at 0km and staying stationary until the last rat is dead.
3/31/2009,you must tell me this secret of awesomeness!
3/31/2009,"really? i doubt it.just a thought, but a possible set up that will work for rattlers:- raven with extended probe launcher instead of cloak (sure, it will have cpu problems, they it will not be so hard for ratting);- drop a combat probe, max range, filter ship only- and smash the scan button forever- war to a safespot when the probe detect someone.boring as hell, but probably anyone working for a sweatshop would get a macro doing it for him and automatically recalling the drones and warping him when someone was detected. it would work even for normal players too. the only drawback is that they will hate smashing the scan button every few seconds."
3/31/2009,"macros input commands, how they respond to dynamic data is not known, and cloak means no-show-up thank you for finally agreeing with me- actively scanning to replace local."
3/31/2009,"how about this:the people who want to keep local will have an option to always appear in local. but those of us who don't want to show up in local, we won't show up unless we speak.everybody gets what they want!and you have no right to make me show up in local against my will."
3/31/2009,"stupid idea. 0.0 is already too empty ,who the hell will do ratting or mining,if they can get nearly as much isk/hour in supersafe empire doing missions, if this no local will be implemented? noone.then who do you want to attack with your small roaming gangs? possibly noone will be there to be your target or maybe another pvp gang.but because you wont be able to know their numbers for sure you can be eaily out numbered (lots of them can be cloaked). one side will surely bring in more numbers to achieve victory --> blobbing. so there wont be small fleets only some larger fleets without targets. and the usuall high end moon blob wars in 1-2 systems thats all. if you want to increase the risk(what this proposal will do) in 0.0 okay but then increase the gain too especially for the average 0.0 players and not for some rich alli leaders with moons. what ccp should do is greatly increase asteroid mining income in 0.0 and reduce the stupid jump transfer possibilities like jump bridges. also there should be possible stacionary target for small gangs like pos shooting/station service shooting for huge gangs ,where they can hurt the enemy even if the enemy doesnt want to fight back."
3/31/2009,":= omg , so who the hell would use the show local type if he wouldnt get 100% accurate info? he only gets the negative from it ,but no benefit."
3/31/2009,"i would rat in 0.0 with no local chatand i would enjoy having less competetion from the chinese isk farmer - because i will kill them if they don't leave.and maybe, with less farming and macro mining, the prices of 0.0 goods will go up slightly, making my efforts more profitable.the big alliance mining ops can easily post alt scouts on all gates - essentially alerting everyone of any new arrivals. so yea, basically we get less isk farmers, more reward for real player, more excitement. and there's nothing wrong with losing your ship now and then, when you can cover the losses in just 1 hour of farming."
3/31/2009,i will also rat in 0.0 with the proposed change to local chat.
3/31/2009,"not supported.imo, the reimbursement policy is as great as it gets. don't want to loose isk - don't be an idiot and fit the ship with mods 3x its price and take it to pvp."
3/31/2009,"sorry to hear you lost your ship./totally signed.and for your reference, just over a year ago i petitioned a carrier loss due to a bug and when the ship was reimbursed i got it back exactly as it was fitted before loosing it. including all modules, entire contents of corp-hanger and every ship in the ship maintenance array, even though a lot of this doesn't appear on the killmail.i don't know if the policy has change since then, or if is inconsistant or down to the gm dealing with it. i know i had to petition twice before getting it back and iirc in the end it was dealt with by a senior gm ."
3/31/2009,"ok so darknesss' is jumping into our camp. i was dealing with internet spaceship drama. so basically i was the sentry. i was there to say. hey 80man bs gang is about to jump in. better vamoose. darknesss' comes back into local, he had been jumping into our camp mwding to the gate; getting away, i say on vent. darknesss is back in local. i see nothing maybe 1min. then on vent. ""omg he's back."" i'm thinking? maybe someone came from the other way? then on vent... ""wow what was he in? he instapopped."" ""was he just a shuttle?"" ""no the wreck says gallente elite bs"" ""what the hell happened?""darknesss warped to the gate. right next to me. jumped. i never saw a damn thing.as for the whole idea of the thread.surely he doesnt suggest getting the modules back that were dropped? so he suggests getting a gm to spawn items; or isk value. which certainly cant be good for the economy.also... think of the exploits then. someone figures out how to replicate said bug with 100% success. fit the most expensive ship possible. have a friend kill you. lewt and get gm to spawn new modules for you.also where is the cutoff? can i get my t2 fit insured drake completely respawned and everything? or is it just for these highprofile eve player 5bil isk kronos bugs?too many holes."
3/31/2009,"this would unleash a flurry of accusations of ""favoritism"". ccp got that kenboku member's officer mods back to him from a goon an didn't explain what the bug was, or they explained the bug but baaahh not true ccp cheats.the ship only reimbursement policy exists because that will be enough for new players, but screw old players, they should know better. the universe is cold, unpredictable and unforgiving."
3/31/2009,"the universe should be cold, but im not talking about the eve universe i'm talking about ccp being at fault and fixing their mistakes. as for players doing it over and over again and exploiting it, i dont see how its too random to and if they got caught it would be a perma ban. even so i'm not saying my suggestion is the best way to go but merely the situation needs addressing because atm all eve is is favouritism, some people lose things get everything back, some get nothing back. the ammount of times ive heard people who have petitioned in a fight got their ship back, someone else in gang petitioned the same thing and got turned away.ccp couldnt possibly be any worse with reimbursement than they are now."
3/31/2009,who needs to do it more than once? 3b off an exploit is more than enough for a few minutes' work.
3/31/2009,"try it, it would take you hours to find a worthy target in high sec, then you can repeat your ganking attemps with concord killing you until you no longer can enter high sec.you think you'll make money?"
3/31/2009,support
3/31/2009,supported.exploiting aggro and logoff mechanics is making pvp too easy to avoid. not simply because of the ctrl q at a gate but also seeing gangs log off everyone but their cloaked scout until you go away.i like the idea of a packet sent to differentiate between a ctrl q and a genuine disconnect. don't know if it is possible but that would seem to be a solid idea in principle.zos
3/31/2009,"should be changes yes.and no it is impossible to differentiate between real disconnect and a ctrl+q. well that would be possible, but then they would just pull out their network cable or disable their wireless. (or do something more fancy by letting their firewall block all eve packets)."
3/31/2009,"love the idea, because it'd look awesome.not that i think it'll be implemented in the near future, but oh well."
3/31/2009,yes please i'd like to see the citadel launchers open up from the hull on my phoenix or cruise/torp launchers on my ravens
3/31/2009,agreed i want phoenixes with some nice launchers opening up
3/31/2009,"have you tried flying a torp raven? it will even put up a fight to the most feared gallente mega pilots :)anyways, supported definitely. more shinyness always welcome!"
3/31/2009,/signedwould be very useful with no drawbacks that i can think of.
3/31/2009,"plenty of people are signing without reading the counter-arguments. the skill que knocked off most plausible complaints from the skill system. to go this far is just pushing it. the point of not being able to inject the skills before pre-reqs is to facilitate a number of things. 1. the skill stays a physical item until you inject it. this allows you to change your mind and sell it, or lose it - which to me is a fine risk for something you can't use yet anyway.2. you can't do physics without arithmetic. it fine-tunes your skillque to mainly leveling skills you already have and want to get better in. which means...3. you actually have to fraking sign into eve and change your character sometimes.not supported. we have our skill que,lets not get ridiculous.edit : yeah because textbooks add nothing to real-life."
3/31/2009,"i actually bumped againt this the other day. let me give you the example.i was training drones v, and knew that immediately following that i was going to train drone interfacing 1.so i wait until my drone v gets down to under 24 hours left - i.e. i actually have room in my skill queue for a new skill. i try and add drone interfacing 1.nope, sorry, no can do. admittedly, it's a minor annoyance - i just stuck a three hour skill in there, and then waited until drones 5 completed before i added drone interfacing, but it doesn't make much sense to me to have it implemented that way."
3/31/2009,except that the reason ccp stated for the skill queue at all is to allow you to more easily determine what time of day you 'fraking' (?) sign into eve.
3/31/2009,"and the skill queuq accomplishes that objective... so what exactly is the purpose for this? other than to further distance and abstract the skill system.i haven't seen a single logical argument for this implementation, only people who want to manage their characters a little less.if you can't manage your time with a 24 hours queue, plus the ability to tag long skills onto the end of it, then perhaps this isn't the game for you."
3/31/2009,"it's more about completing a feature. yes, the queue does let you keep your training time utilized, but it, in some instances, does not allow you to fully maximize your training time. this would get rid of the only hurdle in the way, and with virtually no work required by ccp. i guess i still don't understand the reasons against this, unless the general population is so used to 'almost complete' features in the game, that the prospect of something being finished is foreign, and frightening.it doesn't really matter either way to me, as i don't think i even have any skills to inject that i don't meet the prereq for, but i still wish to see the game constantly improved."
3/31/2009,"if the block list works like i think it does, this should be fairly low-lag. i wouldn't use it myself, but it would have use to some people. it's not a priority, but sure."
3/31/2009,"tracking enchancers are likely that way because it's meant as a compromise to gank for snipers, and more or less useless to most short range weapons (pulse lasers are still quite well effected by them)"
3/31/2009,"hi, i am in the wormhole with some player since 4 days with a pos.and some players have began to mine some gravitometric.the situation is too stupid, i have only one covetor and the medium intensive refining array is completely out to follow the covetor.the first proposal is to increase the capacity of refining arrayexample : medium 25k -> 100kintensive 200k -> 500kor to add a new array for make the compression before refining same process than the rorqual"
3/31/2009,"stopped reading right there tbh. refining arrays are fine. get a dang rorqual or live with the array. --isaacp.s. want more support for your idea? quit saying its stupid. its how it currently operates and that's what ccp wanted. now, why don't you be more constructive. also, they will never make the refining array act like a rorqual. otherwise, that nerfs the ship."
3/31/2009,"sorry but in some wormhole, it's not possible to pass with rorqual.and how do you make in this case ?and not every body is in low sec."
3/31/2009,maybe don't live in the wormhole?
3/31/2009,"i'm likin.not likin.some pretty damn stupid players.ya it's a funneh thing the reactor. basically anyone who might want to use it. will easily overrun the stupid thing. add on top of that. the thing basically hogs the whole tower; takes forever; and uses tons of fuel.big waste of time, isk, and energy.yep. our mining op got to about 150km3 and i was like. ya um time to stop mining.thusly making the actual rorqual useless?sorry but proposal isnt supported; as it isnt very practical.the refiners blow chunks; that's for sure. 25% loss... just because?boosting these refiners hurt who? rorquals more or less? but even then there's value in using rorqual still. who is left to take advantage of the boost? 0.0 and low sec people. they dont have stations to put stuff into. im pretty sure a 0.0 mining boost sure wont hurt things.some might come and say. but jason. what about the drone regions? pff those guys are so heavy in sov 3 and minnie outposts and easily defendable choke systems rolling into like 9-10 systems. those guys wont even bother using refiners."
3/31/2009,"i dont think any of that post had any sentence structure in it :)but from what i have read, you want a array that can compress ore.that sounds like a good idea, but it would make the rorqual almost useles apart from the bonuses and the jump ability."
3/31/2009,"yep the rorqual have not the same utility than the ""compressing array""with the rorqual have an nice bonus, the clone jump, hangar array, compressing ore.and it's not possible to use the rorqual on all wormhole.sorry for me this request is interesting."
3/31/2009,"understanding that english is not your first language, there is a problem. this statement, in english, doesn't mean anything:""the situation is too stupid, i have only one covetor and the medium intensive refining array is completely out to follow the covetor.""please restate."
3/31/2009,i think he's saying that the array can't keep up.
3/31/2009,"yeah, that was my guess as well... i guess it comes down to how long you are mining in a day... i believe an intensive refining array can refine 1111m<U+FFFD>/min, so really, a single covetor would only really exceed it's capacity if mining more than 18 hours a day... need more capacity, get more refineries..."
3/31/2009,completely agreed!
3/31/2009,"imho there are a few ships that need they're bonuses tweaked.guristas shipsall guristas ships have split bonuses, caldari skill boosts missiles, gallente boosts hybrids. every other pirate ship has either twin bonuses focused on one weapon type, or a bonus to a weapon plus a bonus to some other element of the ship.rattlesnake:i've never seen a rattler fitted with hybrids and this is probably true for a number of reasons:1.) it only has 4 hardpoints.2.) even if it had 6/7/8 it doesn't have the pg to fit them and anything else.3.) if you try to fit hybrids/mwd/point/web/cap booster you either have two slots for a tank or have to armour tank, and either way you run out of pg by a huge factor.fix: scrap the hybrid bonus, add a different gallente-style bonus (5%/10% drone hp + damage bonus would be ideal). also would be very nice to add a 7th launcher hardpoint and bigger drone bay even without bandwidth to match. gila:not as bad as the rattle, but overshadowed as a hybrid platform by deimos / brutix / vigilant / eagle and even probably the thorax. once again changing the gallente bonus to a drone based one and giving it a reasonable drone bay would keep its different flavour but make it more useful, +1 launcher hardpoint too.worm:tbh i have never flown one, so i won't comment on downsides / upsides of bonuses.pilgrim:i'm sure this has been mentioned before, but the only use i can find for this ship is ninja-ratting against sansha's. its too slow to catch intys / dictors and without fitting faction neuts it can't attack anything larger without being in overloaded web range. the rapier + arazu get a bonus to their primary ewar range, the falcon already has range and gets a strength bonus, yet the pilgrim is left with short-range + strength bonus.fix: swap the 20% per level neut amount bonus, for 20% range bonus, or give it 10% range bonus and 10% amount bonus."
3/31/2009,"you're putting together two very separate issues, and you might have more luck splitting them. that said...pilgrim: agree fully. the pilgrim has always seemed a joke to me - without a range bonus, it doesn't really do very much. it's in need of a bonus of some sort, and dropping neut effect for neut range seems the natural way to go. guristas: again, agree fully. who slaps a blaster bonus on a raven? the vindicator is the right sort of model for putting a third bonus on an existing ship - find something novel that combos well with the existing two(a mwd bonus on a blaster ship), and you've got a ship that is actually sensible and functional. put a mediocre bonus on that doesn't fix very much and you have a mediocre ship once the nano fit stops being broken(machariel). and put a bonus on that most people actively ignore, and you've got a ship that just feels like a raven you bought because you didn't notice that extra 0 in the price. faction ships should be different in ways that make them useful. a shield-tanking paladin is a novel concept, and the nightmare runs with it admirably. a battleship tackler is a fairly bad role, and the bhaalgorn isn't very good at it, but it at least feels like a faction ship - it does weird, cool things. the idea of a missile/drone ship that is actually worthwhile seems like it'd be in the nightmare category - usable, interesting, and effective. if you really boost the crap out of it, it might even be worth the isk but yeah, i agree with both. and if you can arrange a review of the blood and maybe angel ships while you're at it, that'd be cool too."
3/31/2009,then why have a curse? that's always been my question. the pilgrim has in your face neuting while the curse is farther out. why change it? --isaac
3/31/2009,"the whole full speed, warp cloaked. lets you get a pretty good setup off on people. in most situations i'd think neut amount would be better then range. however in the more bloby situation. that which pvp is. pilgrim really is left out pretty bad.honestly giving em 20% range and 20% amount wouldnt be terrible. then again. falcon is being nerfed bigtime. so might as well let one of the recons fail with the falcon.yep. horrible. needs to be fixed. we were promised this during empyrean age. we didnt get it.ps. i could swear the nightmare used to have torp bonuses; with 4 launcher slots.proof of nightmare with launchers - old 2007 nanobs vid"
3/31/2009,"in large fleet battles, 100km warp ins, big complexes, whatever, sometimes you just want to look at something far away. i mean you can physically zoom out and spin the view around so you can get close to an object, but this is very annoying to do with objects far away. since eve is a very pretty game with beautiful spaceships and whatnot, why should you be limited in what you can see? i propose that one should be able to ""look at""/""set as parent"" on anything on the grid. as long as you can zoom out and see it, why can't you zoom in for a closeup? this would make it a little easier on film makers, and also further facilitate the detailed graphics of eve.tldr: if you can zoom out and see something, you should be able to get a closeup. (you can get a closeup already, it's just difficult)"
3/31/2009,agreed.
3/31/2009,agreed. this has always seemed weird to me. look range should be grid range.
3/31/2009,"your client already knows where the object is, so why can't it look ?it's only a client-side change we are asking for here.now if it was at the edge of the grid and on the other side there was a ship that you couldn't see, but the ship you chose to look at could see, you still wouldn't be able to see it because seeing it would require more work from the server."
3/31/2009,"simplest option:r-click player, select 'spam' option. until you leave system they will be blocked (for you). if enough individuals select 'spam' in a given period of time, the person is gagged for a certain period of time (i would be satisfied with an hour... lets me get my shopping done without their annoying yammering). if enough people flag the spammer in a 24 hour period, or in multiple systems in a short time, the character is gagged or their account locked pending investigation of the spammed material.that'll stop the spammers dead in their tracks, but leave a little breathing room for legitimate sellers."
3/31/2009,"thing is, he has no chance whatsoever of getting that ""problem"" fixed - it's fundamental to eve. he at least has a chance at getting a npc deposit bank implemented."
3/31/2009,"so what you're saying is his overall chances range from ""slim"" to ""none""?"
3/31/2009,"that, and that i won't fault him for giving slim a shot, even if it isn't terribly good policy."
3/31/2009,i'd like to just be able to split my isk up into different piles - it would make keeping to a budget much easier if you had all your spare isk in another wallet...
3/31/2009,if you want to keep you isk then don't give it to random people you meet on the internet.working as intended imo.
3/31/2009,"oh, multiple wallets is definitely something i could support - one of the beautiful things about being in a small corp is that you can ask the ceo for a spare wallet for when you want to track a couple things separately. i'd be all for that option being open to others as well. thing is, this proposal isn't that."
3/31/2009,"i recommend eve bank. thats eve-bank.netlavista vista helped write the code for that one i believe. as for an npc bank, thats probably never going to happen."
3/31/2009,"i have been playing with this idea of adding a ship which is capable of scanning like the covert ops but has the ability to participate in pvp as the covert ops class have no added value other than scanning (which doesn't drive a lot of people to choose this ship as they're ship of choosing).so i present my idea of adding the patrol attack ship.based on the destroyer class hull it is a ship designed for probing down opponents and holding them down for a limited amount of time.i won't bore you with endless statistics which will bore you to tears and will never see the living daylight so i'll outline the main points of my idea here:general bonusesit would include something in the likes of a bonus to the range or/and strength of combat scanner probes and a small bonus to the range of warp scrambling devices. also standard a cpu bonus for the expanded probe launcher should be added so it can be fitted easily.offensive capabilitiesmake it able to wield a small amount of small guns and possibly even drones. but make sure that it will not become a solo ship.defensive capabilitiesgive it a medium sized tank so that it can last and will not have a paper tank. on top of that give it a heavy mass so it is not the next best nano tank (due to heavy armor plating/shielding equipment).cloaki don't think a ship such as this would need the ability of a cloak the ship's scan strength or/and range should be enough to make it able to scan quickly.race bonusesonly dependant on the gun types so it has a little fire-power.prerequisite skillsracial frigate 5covert ops 4destroyers 5astrometrics 5it should be in line with the skill time of the interdictors.in conclusion:i personally think this could be a viable ship in pvp for finding people in safespots without sacrificing good tackling ability and a capable damage ship.now support it, flame it, discuss it."
3/31/2009,"i think this is a cool idea, as it would possibly call another use of the destroyer class.my only problem is your name. i think they should be called hunter killers."
3/31/2009,"a couple changes i think:first off: skill requirement:racial frigate 5covert ops 5destroyers 5astrometrics 5my opinion, it should be five for all four skills. offensive abilities:no drones, unless its gallente. about five guns sounds right to me. cloak:t2 cloaking device sure, but no cov-ops cloak. otherwise, ship sounds pretty good, but i don't see the need of it atm. yes, the covert frigate is not the greatest thing to fly in the world, but it gets the job done really well. some people i know also use it to tackle people (at risk sure). so in short, i don't see the need, but more ships isn't a bad idea. --isaac"
3/31/2009,"i agree with the basic idea... a probing ship that can do something other than sit there uselessly.with caveats, of course.base it off the tier-2 bc hull. give it an insane tank. give it the marauder weapon bonuses and limited weapon mounts (so they can fit utility modules such as tractors/salvagers).make it slow as sin. do not give it any weapon bonuses of any sort other than the marauder damage bonuses on limited hardpoints. do not allow it to fit covert cloaks (allow it to use non-covert cloaks, as bombers do) to prevent them becoming cloaking guerilla fighters, but no velocity bonus.essentially give it the ability to do two things:scan swiftlywork plexes finds.but worthless in any sort of pvp (or they'll become fotm gank fleets).end of story."
3/31/2009,lol. so you figured out a couple ways to evade them. meh.so basically you want to make a system where you can kill someone in highsec. they cant even see you coming. while taking no losses at all?you know there's an exploit. where you essentially have a person accepted into a corp. while they are basically in warp and about to drop in on a group of people. or have the gang log out where you know the camp will be. accept their apps. log in at the same time. etc etc. all these are considered exploits. gms have made posts saying they are exploits.why do you think your exploit is better then any other exploit?
3/31/2009,"i wouldn't mind seeing the black ops exploit get legitimized.i mean, dropping over a billion isk on a gank ship that has a very good chance of not surviving long enough to jump out is both 1.) awesome and 2.) very risky.i don't see the problem, frankly. if you lose your hulk to a black ops, get another one and mine in the same system with a cloaked friend in fleet with tackle nearby. next time he tries it- pow! concordokkened and you get a bunch of shiny loot to replace your loss.i feel like that would be fun as hell for both the black ops and the targets and considering the immense cost of the ship i dont feel like it would start happening all over the place. remember, the black ops really only has the time to strike and jump out in 0.5, maybe 0.6 space and it has a window of only a few seconds to pull it off."
3/31/2009,"there have been a hp bug which reduce your effective hp to extremely low, properly what happened.the -10 sec pilot.. well that's just extremely bad and lame mechanic from ccp which they should stick where the sun don't shine.. so ertarded"

3/31/2009,indeed.
3/31/2009,"it's r-tard.anyway, by his typing, let me paint this picture.he's on the gate either into (likely perimeter) or jita (to perimeter). traffic control closes the gate. he has 600mil in an apparent t1 hauler, worth roughly 200k isk. my math sucks, what's that, like 0.03 of the value of the goods transported?ok, so he's got ap on, so when the gate opens he jumps through... are you sure? never tried it.so i'll put myself in this situation for a second...i'm stupid enough to haul that much worth, with that little yugo ship.the instant i realize the gate is closed, i will buger off and warp away. i will not sit there hoping some miracle opens the gate for me.the -10 player did nothing wrong. this shouldn't be in this forum, it should be in c&p where he can be mocked. repeatedly.i have done runs into lowsec, 0.0, and through all the hubs with hundreds of millions... hell, even billions in cargo. not once have i ever been ganked.i've been targetted, i've been attacked.play it smart, and you minimize your losses. i'll die eventually, but i'll be sure it's not because of doing something this idiotic."
3/31/2009,"1. don't go to jita, if you can avoid it. 2. if you can't avoid jita, transport your stuff via courier contract. let someone else take the risk.3. if you can't wait for a contract, use a solid vessel that has a good tank. that means battleship or orca in highsec.4. always split your risk. if you can do it in multiple runs, don't do it in one, unless you can risk losing it.5. if you carry immense value, never stop. if a gate is locked, use another. if all gates are locked, warp around in the system till they open up again. never play sitting duck.6. if red flashing people are anywhere near, watch like a hawk.7. don't go to jita, if you can avoid it. p.s.: be glad it was only 600 million. your corpmates will understand. after all, they were bright enough to let you haul that much unescorted and all by yourself from jita. they could have jumped into some ships, too. would have split your risk."
3/31/2009,"concord doesn't pod - he flew in in a pod, grabbed a bs, and shot you in said bs. if that's what the gm claims, it's likely what happened. as for the 300 damage thing, you're the second person i've heard complaining about that - look at the reimbursement policy thread, some guy was saying the same about his kronos, and mentioned a titan having 100 hp as well. petition it on the basis of this hp bug(since it sounds like you just petitioned the -10 guy shooting you), and you might have a bit more luck."
3/31/2009,"get off our board troll. this isn't an issue, or a proposal. you are simply full of fail."
3/31/2009,"i'm not sure, posting on a public forum that you carry billions of cargo in a hauler might come close :)"

3/31/2009,"my name is melgaladh, and i approve this message.and if you go over and look at what ccp said about ambulation they brought up three movies: aliens, blade runner, and star wars: the empire strikes back.blade runner was covered in cigarettes. i think the idea of having a cigarette during a corp meeting sounds like a nice touch."

3/31/2009,"hello my fellow internet spaceship captains. i am pleased to announce my candidacy for the csm. my history in this game is very different from most of yours. joining goonfleet on day 1 of playing this game, i flew my ibis directly out into 0.0 (nobody told me about podjumping ), and right from the start i have immersed myself in all that is good and bad about life in nullsec. i am a firm believer that the best parts of eve are found in the high space drama that occurs out in 0.0, yet so much of the playerbase is unwilling or unable to venture out away from the protection of concord. i want to make 0.0 more fun and rewarding for everyone. and my goal as a csm is to push for 0.0 changes.here's my campaign website:"
3/31/2009,"it's not concord that draws ppl to highsec m8. it's independence. freedom.i got tired of being taxed, ordered to show up at xxx-xx at a certain time, also i was a meatshield for other people's moon mining operation and they don't give nothing back, basically i was playin the game for someone else's benefit.not sayin all alliances are like this but it just left a bad taste in my mouth.right now i have every part of the game at my disposal, at the time of my choosing.i got r&d production going.i got nice sized rats spawned for my killing pleasure.a minihub 6 jumps away for trading.a lowsec system 8 jumps away when i wanna get froggy.a mining system 13 jumps away when i wanna mine and watch a movie.if i want 0.0 providence is close.i log in when i want, do what i want, and best of all no tax.yes i miss having gangs to fly with but i can't imagine trading away my freedom.freedom is why i play eve, when the freedom is gone so am i."
3/31/2009,"everything you said is true. life in 0.0 is a hassle, and the real rewards of life in 0.0 (moons, plexes, supercap construction) are only feasible for big alliances. i see this as a problem and i want to improve it without nerfing anything about life in empire."
3/31/2009,"your ideas have merit, however i think larkonis managed to get in a bit before you.he seems to be the un-official c&p delegate and given how many ""carebear"" candidates there are, i think it would be important for at least 1 pvp based candidate to get through.i'm unsure if by running you would be increasing or decreasing the chance that a delegate who regularly pvps (and more then just shoots stuff, actually understands wtf is happening) is voted in."
3/31/2009,"issler, thanks for your words, although we have been on opposing sides of the battlefield and the smack talk i can appreciate your words, i believe we can work together focusing on the different facets of eve so to make it a better game keeping in mind all game play styles!mickey simon,i have read (now) the pod of larkonis, whereas his manifesto looks more like a ""dark side"" of the pvp i hoped to work for the benefit of all pvp, i for example dont think that resources have to be diminished in empire, just make it so that empire stays as it is, low sec should be richer by a multiplier of 1.5 than empire and 0.0 richer by a multiplier of 2 than empire, but this is my opinion, what i would like is to hear as many different people as possible so to understand what the specific view on different points is. my view is that there must not be a compartimentalization of the game (the blobbers - the crazy pirates/mercs - the carebears)my candidacy will have the goal of better defining pvp as a profession, noir. i'm sure wouldnt mind yulai convention approved contracts for mercs and assassins.thank you for your input guys!"
3/31/2009,"simple - i want to promote freedom to play the game in as many ways as possible, the large sandbox for all. i also wish to help ccp improve the game, particularly with balancing of game mechanics and follow up on various initiatives that ccp has already started upon. i will also try to offer a newer player perspective to the game, with me personally having less than 20 million skill points and less than 2 years playing. the free trip to iceland is also cool (although, i will have to bring my wife, so it wont really be free.. cause if i dont bring her, she will kill me!)"
3/31/2009,"why aren't you running as friedrich phil""whatever""? your main?issler"

3/31/2009,"the idea of doing away with local has been floating around for some time. the recent glitch to local on sisi (whether intentional or not) has sparked a few discussions/rages about its potential fate. i am completely local neutral, so if it stays or goes i could care less. i do, however, see a potential repurposing for the recently defunct pos module, the system scanning array.empire, for all intensive purposes, is civilized space. per concord mandate, system occupants are reported via the local system for all to see. nothing changes.low-sec and npc 0.0 space are a gray area since technically they are faction, not concord, occupied space. for these areas, local would be paired with positive standings with the occupying faction. take molden heath for example, if you have positive standings with the minmatar republic, local appears as it currently does. if you have neutral or negative standings, local is reported on a broadcast only basis (similar to alliance chat). access to local would be based on true standings, not as modified by the various social skills, so players seeking to gain access to local must earn the tactical advantage.0.0 space, being lawless and unoccupied, does not report local by default. it acts solely on a broadcast basis where you only appear upon posting. now bring back the system scanning array (sov1 anchor, sov2 online) and make it so the controlling alliance has the option to provide local through associated standings. this provides a home turf advantage to the occupying alliance that they can see system occupants in local but hostiles can not. this also means that just as jammers and jump bridges are taken out as a part of 0.0 sov wars, it allows local communications to be taken down as well.the data elements to do this should already be inherent to local as standings are reported to make the little blue and red boxes next to names. all that would be needed is a conditional pre-filter to determine player access to local on a system-by-system basis.the end result would leave local in place where it is most wanted while adding a whole new positive element to low-sec, npc 0.0 and alliance controlled space."
3/31/2009,"i understand what it means to repackage a ship. its basically taking it apart and packing it into a smaller space. what i don't get is why they wont let us repackage ships that have rigs on them. technically the rigs are a part of the ship when you install them, when you remove them they are destroyed. so they are nonetheless part of the ship and can be taking apart with the ship and put back together since its not being removed from the ship.i don't see any particular reason to have it to where you repackage a ship you lose your rigs. wouldn't it increase the risk of transporting ships if they still had the rigs installed??sorry just kinda angry since i couldn't fit a ship thats 55,000 volume and (5500 packaged) into an obelisk that has over 800k room. even with the ship unpackaged theres plenty of room for it to fit.what yall say? repackage ships with rigs ok??"
3/31/2009,"i think t2 bpo's are fine as they are. for the older corps to last this long in a world like eve is proof that they should hold onto that bpo. eve isn't about fairness and older characters are always rewarded for being with the game because they sat through a bunch of ****. does it hurt the market a little and make an un-exhuastible source of income for the holder. yes. but it doesn't matter since they were here first and got it before it was gone.if ****es me off just as much as anyone that i won't be able to get a bpo of a t2 item, and if i buy any bpc's then its just pure profit for the guy who made it.but how about instead of taking it away, give it a decay factor? just like ships and mods, if the t2 bpo isn't used for what.....3 months, it goes back on the lottery. instead of destroying them how about re-circulating them if their on inactive accounts or if they are just sitting in hangers not being used?even though i like happy mediums....i still stand by that they lucked out on it and everyone else will just have to deal with it and suck it up."
3/31/2009,"get some billion and buy it. no on the first count. the only field where the t2 bpo influence the market are the items where no sane inventor want to invent anything. remove the bpo and the t2 items will disappear as the few t2 items build today will be replaced by named/faction items.one example are the t2 armor plates. they are worse than rolled tungsten and cost the same. remove the bpo and i doubt anyone will care to invent them. for the ""un-exhuastible source of income"" they work exactly as any other bpo. after you have brought it it give you an income if you build from it. so any bpo is a ""un-exhuastible source of income""."
3/31/2009,"thats pretty much how it works...if you want a t2 bpo, buy one, but be prepared to wait for a year or so before you start making your money back. they are not isk printing licenses these days, not like they were before invention. as an inventor i may not be able to make the margins, but i can vastly outdo the t2 bpo holder in output."
3/31/2009,"1) defense of the low-end computer users. (let us turn off effects entirely: pos shields, bubbles, textures: let me turn them off.)2) support of user-generated content: let us create stuff.examples:- change poses to modular structures (...like t3), instead of this annoying click-and drag interface. let us configure how they look, similar to the amazing structures found in some missions.- let corporations create missions for the general public to accept.3) make missions / interaction more in-your-face. for example, seize camera control (but let us break out!) and zoom the camera in advanced mode towards an enemy spawn that us usually announced in local. give us more dialog, more realism, and more interaction.4) let me fiddle with things outside of the intended game mechanics! let me be creative and try things from a roleplaying standpoint, and make unexpected things happen. for example, let me steal the maiden from the mission, which results in the mission agent hiring faction npcs to chase me down. let me shoot at things i'm not supposed to shoot at, poke and play with things, and make something interesting happen!feedback welcome, and my right to append to this list is reserved."
3/31/2009,there is no doubt in my mind that user generated content (when done correctly) is the future. so i like the idea we could have some discussions among the csm candidates about your suggestions.issler
