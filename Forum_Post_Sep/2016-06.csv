6/3/2016,i said it years ago that corps should get charged a tax to stay open. if they run out of funding they close and any characters get booted to npc corps.if an entire corporation goes afk for 12 months and noone keeps the wallet full then how can they complain? it becomes a game mechanic that self-regulates the idea of troll characters taking up names or perma-afks who are never coming back.
6/3/2016,"their present position could probably be summarised as:""people still use this important feature despite its many crippling flaws, so we won't touch it""like dust values still being present in the game despite the dust game itself being literally dead.and so many other problems."
6/3/2016,"fozzie, rise, australian guyit's time. the following need addressing: rocket launchers, blasters, railguns, lasers, armour reppers, shield boosters and assault frigates.rocket launchers: these modules are ridiculous, they have almost no variation in fitting but still suffer under the tiered system. the faction variants are too expensive and don't bring enough to the table.blasters/railguns: in particular the small sizes. ignoring the many variations of each 'caliber' these could be made in to something like small compact electron blaster 1 small electron blaster 2 small enduring ion blaster 1 small ion blaster 2 small scoped neutron blaster 1 small neutron blaster 2 and you tie the fittings much closer so that the choice between the calibers is less significant. it achieves two things in presenting better validated choice between calibers as the tech2 version is just an improved variant of the meta and secondly it lets you cut some of the pg/cpu off of ships that otherwise abuse this extra generosity to fit oversized modules they really don't need. rinse and repeat for all turret types.armour reppers: these were brought up years ago. they're stupidly designed as they are. cut back to ancillary, meta 0, compact and enduring variants and then tech 2. faction variants either boast better cap efficiency or better boost amount like shield boosters but not both. or lower fitting/quicker cycle time - but not both.shield boosters: scrap the current system and rebuild from the ground up with a linear scaling of performance vs fitting. i'm still very mad at ytterbium for how he led the previous attempt in 2012. shield boosters are in the same boat rockets are they're just a joke and clear cut case of bad design.assault frigates: these will heal with better and more practical module choices. at present their greatest enemies come from within, not without. they have periodically very poor base stats and it's not helped by the total crapshoot of modules they're bonused for and have to fit."
6/4/2016,"currently there is no way, to my knowledge, where a player can find out who to contact devwise about specific issue in one area... if there is it needs to be significantly more visible. we have bug reports, we have player go betweens (ala csm), we have forums, but there is no place to find out who is on what teams at ccp to tell them an issue. from watching fanfest there seems to be a lot of confusion about talking about the wrong topic to the wrong team. so why not fix that?the idea:one page that puts some faces and dev names to areas of expertise would do wonders for getting the right info to the right people, and when things are not clear where they go the current csm could be on there as well. the key to all of this is contact info. reliable, easy to use contact info. a click this link and it opens a text field kind of contact info. having easy access to this page from the community site would be huge. having it under the support drop down would clear a lot up. why is there no place where we can get a short description of what a team generally is in charge of, not specifically as that is what the csm summit is for, and some key people that act as the face of that team? have a short description that actually differentiates the teams from one another, the emphasis being on what makes them different. having 7-8 teams that just say game design is no good. having one group say citadel balance stats, and another that says citadel contracts though would be amazing, for example. having something say gm, not good. having something say what a gm actually does, good. there are team names and dev names for a reason, why not make them visible? it is easy to find info on people who do things like ship balance, sov rework, graphics (although this is a recent one for the easy category.) what about other areas, who would we talk to? i tried to find out who to talk to about pricing and marketing and had an easier time finding people on linkdin than through any ccp resources. this is really bad.we have the forums, but they are not the best medium for everything."

6/5/2016,"rule number one of software development: don't let your customers send direct messages to your developers. your devs end up spending more time responding to messages than actually developing. that's why you have support teams, to filter the incoming information and make sure it gets to the right place.i wouldn't mind a little bios page on the devs - that would be fun. but unless you're actively working with one to root out an issue, you don't need a way to contact them directly. and you are actively working with them, i expect they'd give you one then.eve is like an addiction; you can't quit it until it quits you. also, iderno"
6/6/2016,"i am sorry if this is not clear. i am not saying directly to the devs. i am saying contact info for the correct people to talk to about the issue. i don't know how many times that i have seen a community/art/random dev say ""oh hey that is not my area."" when you ask whose is it there is no response, or it is very vague. have the devs up there so people know for things like fanfest, but no contact info; just ccp randomname and a picture, under their given team. then a team description. sorry if this was not 100% clear."
6/6/2016,"well, if you think you have a bug, submit a bug report. if it's some other support type issue either submit a petition or email support. (support@eveonline.com)if it's more community related, then there's usually a community manager, but i'm not sure who that is anymore.i'm not sure what you're really asking for. these communication paths already exist.eve is like an addiction; you can't quit it until it quits you. also, iderno"
6/6/2016,"this pretty much standard practice in any industry.one issue is that there could be one dev working 5 teams but one project, another dev working in one team but with many projects, or another dev being retasked to different teams and projects based on an ""as needed"" basis.moreover... devs will start to insulate themselves from a community once it reaches a certain size. this is because the amount of inane requests, ideas, or even threats from players will begin to mount... necessitating ""filtering mechanisms"" to weed out the general rabble.in other words... go through the correct channels like everyone else."
6/6/2016,"when you buy items now you have no real way to know who produced it even if you look at your wallet history and see who you bought it from. what if all player made products had a way for us to identify who produced it? this way different alliances can tax imports from different producers and prop up local production with favorable taxes. it can also allow for more interesting ""market pvp."" it can also stand to give producers a bit of pride seeing how they corner a particular market.edit: nvm posting elsewhere for most exposure."

6/17/2016,"i totally agree with everything you said jack. i also disagree with what the op has said. it isn't suicide ganking that is the problem nor does ccp support suicide ganking. suicide ganking is a clever loop hole or exploit that players have found and ccp is yet to discover possible solution too that wouldn't disrupt the game play of their player base or stop the mentality behind a sand box game that ""anything"" can happen.i remember when i first started playing a friend told me that when you undock from station you consent to pvp. also i remember them telling me that only fly what you can afford to loose. two major rules that all players that have been playing eve usually live by.mind you when i first started playing when i logged in the game had something like 100,000 or more players online, some times during peak times i would get put into a queue and have to wait 5 to 30 seconds to actually get into the game. now when i log in the most i see is maybe 24,000 or 26,000. never really seen over 30,000 players online. i don't know if this is due to banning of bots or other things. however i would like to point out this video, back in 2012 before the war dec changes"
6/17/2016,"mineral prices returned to their historical levels because ccp removed ""gun mining"" from the drone regions. and then improved 0.0 mining quite a bit, leading to an oversupply of high ends. nothing to do with wardecs."
6/17/2016,"and to some extent changes in refining of mission loot. why mine minerals when you could run missions, get the loot, get isk, and get loyalty points and improve your standings? then refine the loot for the minerals if you also do industrial stuff."
6/17/2016,"i doubt anyone was running combat missions primarily to get the minerals from the loot, but yeah the byproduct was a non-trivial source of supply, something around 10% iirc. but the drone region output was immense, i recall it peaking at something over half of total mineral production.meanwhile, wardecs used to be far more prevalent than they are. if anyone genuinely believes that hi-sec wardecs are a primary driver in mineral prices, i have some discounted mining permits for the hale constellation they may be interested in."
6/17/2016,"you are correct, drone alloys used to be the major contributor to minerals prior to their removal in what 2012 2013. which is what initially drove the prices of minerals up. just as the need for materials in the construction of citadels is driving the need for pi and minerals. which is why i talked about the 3 to 4isk per unit and the next jump which was 5 to 6isk per unit.as for wars decs being more prevalent now then they were in the past. i disagree, in the past we had more players online then we do now, also corps were restricted to a maximum of 3 war decs. now that has changed we have corps with 99 and alliances 99. i wouldn't say it was turning hi sec into low or null being that they would have to dec just about everyone for that statement to be true i would however say that war is and has become easier for people to get into. which i might add is both good and bad.good in the since that it creates more conflict which destroys more things and creates a need to rebuild what was destroyed.bad in the since that most of the wars that i'm seeing are from bored pvpers looking for a war targets. their ceos trying to appease that and deccing anyone they see or find that could potentially give them a target to shoot at.the good does cause prices to go up being that the need to build what has been destroyed will always drive demand, and the bad usually comes from pvp corps deccing industrial carebears that want nothing to do with fighting and would gladly pay to keep from being shot at. the fact that you would offer ""mining permits"" only proves my point."
6/17/2016,"tl;dr - allowing 99 wars is ... extreme ... at the current cost & risk of the whole thing. defenders should be allowed an option to 'bribe the cops' just like the attackers have in order to create a 'gang war' in the first place. terms used loosely, of course.correction: most highsec wars are from pvp'ers looking for low-cost low-risk kills because they want to get into fights but they can't justify the financial burden of losing ships to an opponent who's even remotely willing to fight them with something resembling skill.the hardcoded war mechanics are, fundamentally, usable only in highsec at this time. the reasons to declare a legitimate (read: ""not out of boredom"") war through these mechanics include, but are not limited to, keeping your null enemies' supply lines from working and eliminating competition.ccp will need to revisit the war system soon(tm) enough and decide whether the lesser infliction against the sandbox (and, by extension, their subscription numbers) is to permit the current model supporting unhindered wars where the risk is mainly on the part of the defenders with only a mild cost to most attackers ... or whether enabling a mechanic where the attackers assume some form of liability and/or risk by virtue of creating a war declaration would be the superior choice overall.the suggestion of permitting a defender to pay some amount to remove/negate a wardec has roughly as much merit as what amounts to bribing the cops to look the other way when you want to start a gang war in public (this is the current system, clearly). maybe the other guy would like the opportunity to also pay off the cops to stop that business from happening, eh? it'd certainly be a ton less difficult to implement than, for example, some suggestions covering things like putting up a collateral as an attacker in case you don't achieve your own arbitrarily-specified goals (e.g., ""i'm gonna put up $500m as a bet against blowing up $500m of your ships."") as a form of risk, and it certaily makes more sense than some of those other sets of junk ideas."
6/18/2016,"ccp seems to completely okay with. although mass dec's do have meta problems, they have one benefit of being a giant isk sink. proooojection. i love it when people revert to this sorta opinionated insult. generally it means you have no idea what's going, evident conveniently by the next paragraph... if you are war with another entity, gate guns in lowsec will not engage you. so no not just highsec is a wardec useful. ask pl they just decced goonswarm who are currently residing in sarren. wonder why? war's need to be tweak yeah, they haven't been touched in a long while. just like sov ccp will need to change the game at some point to keep it interesting. your idea only benefits the strong and well established. which they can do already by paying the current mercenaries a protection fee. it worked for two years for ped-dictorate. no merc could dec them with out the other 7 drop in to defend before the ceo's lack of social skills got the better of him anyways. you want to keep newbies from be farmed, your idea is not going to work. brave, goons, pl, ivy, dead terrorist any of the big alliance are going to still be a stupid high amount to dec, and the newbies are going to be penniless. #deletetheweak"
6/18/2016,"well once again, i will point to my thought of the war bond to illustrate the core problem. for this experiment, we will need to postulate that there is a mechanic to define ""winning"" a war; you cantake your pick, or even imagine that there are multiple ways (eg k:d, structures surviving/being destroyed, activity, whatever.)suppose that on the formation of a corporation or alliance, in addition to the normal registration fee, concord requested that the ceo deposit a war bond of equal or greater size. a bond which can be increased later at any time.should any other entity wish to declare war against that corp or alliance, they will have to match the war bond held on deposit. the winner of the war is awarded the loser's bond.this would give the defending entity an element of choice in the kind of conflict they wish to engage in: if the bond of malc's minimal tax mission corp is 5m isk, that may send a message that i don't care about the corp at all; if wardecced, i will just abandon it and form another. (on the other hand, it might also communicate that i'd love to have a wardec because mmtx are also bored and welcome fights.) in essence, anyone with a ship to undock 5,000,000 isk to risk can try their chances, but they should not have high expectations of the campaign.on the other hand, let's say that malcanis's massive industrial machine (mmid) puts up a 500b bond. anyone looking at that bond will realise that they have to put up half a trillion isk to have a go. they might well infer that mmid has very sustantial assets in hisec that they want to protect, and in any case, there is a very large prize to be gained for winning a war with them. if mmid can afford a bond of that size, they can presumably afford to pay defenders, and might well have srsbsns allies. in short, any war declared on mmid will be almost certainly be a serious effort by a group willing to play for large stakes, who will expect to get one or more significant fights out of the campaign."
6/18/2016,"that's a nice suggestion malcanis but how many of the new players can afford a multi billion isk war bond to kind of protect themselves?the current war dec system is rubbish. it allows pvpers to impose their play style on others. that can't go well.what would they do if because of some game mechanics the only thing they suddenly can do is mining? they would leave too.yes eve isn't a birthday party for children, it's evil. it is and has to be dangerous everywhere but that within well defined borders. if someone wants a total war, there is plenty of space in low and null sec for it.what has to be changed?- no war declarations without avoidable reasons. a reason can be a suspect timer on a corp member.- the costs for a defender to end a war has to be lower than for the agressor to declare it. otherwise its a simple mechanic to financially ruin the defender.- declaring war on a 5 man corp has to be more expensive/less rewarding than for a 500 man corp which very likely has more resources to defend themself.- unequal fights in high sec, where the aggressor has much more dps/hp as the victim shouldn't be rewarded with loot."
6/18/2016,"the word, ""correction,"" means an adjustment to what's there. it's not like saying, ""yeah, you're wrong and here's the holy truth to consider."" further, what pvp corp is actually afraid of lowsec gate guns? come on, you know better."
6/18/2016,"malcanis,i enjoy the whole concept of a war bond. it would be similar to setting the price for someone to send you a message only now its a defenders bet that says you won't be able to win a war against me. i would like to see some more detail into this concept like for example. what would be the conditions for winning said war against a defender? are those conditions set by a general game mechanic or by the defender? is there a way for the attacker to end the war with out losses and the defender to retain their bond? how does surrendering work in this case? how does allies coming in to help the defender work?just a few questions if you have more to add to your idea please feel free to do so. i like that idea as much as i like mine with the whole bribing the cops so to speak as a few have suggested it as.one thing though in regards to aelavaine, i agree with most of what is needed to be changed except for the fact about the costs for a defender to end war has to be lower. the whole point of war is to ""ruin"" the other corp you are attacking. it could be equal i suppose for the attacker and defender, meaning that the cost to end the war from the defenders side "" the bribe"" could be 50mil just like the initial cost of a war dec was 50mil. with the option to pay more to prevent a dec for a week."
6/19/2016,"it's not a proposal, it's a thought experiment designed to illustrate the problem with war decs in the first place. war deccers generally don't like the idea beause it allows industrial corps to spend isk to protect themselves. the defending corps generally don't like it because it allows them to protect themselves by spending isk.the experiment therefore illustrates the motivations behind both sides. in general, hi-sec war deccers are in it for low commitment, easy kill farming, with any profit being something of a bonus. so a system that requires them to commit isk and which also allows the defender any agency in determining the terms of conflict is not popular with them.likewise, the defenders in general don't want non-consensual pvp at all, and they want ccp to just stop it (see the post directly after the one i made above, for example.) so to them, the war-bond is a regressive step that they see as one more way of putting the responsibility for defending their ships and assets on them, rather than on concord.in short, the issue with war-decs is that they are non-consensual pvp in a way that, for example, a war between two 0.0 alliances isn't. the 0.0 guys may complain about blobs or coalitions or cloaky camping or whatever, but that's just tactics. they're not complaining about the concept of another entity shooting at them at all. wardecs on the other hand, typically involve a defender who doesn't want to engage in combat pvp at all. how can you reconcile that desire with the desire for other players to play a ffa pvp game? the war bond addresses the fig-leaf justifications that both sides put up. deccers constantly complain that defenders can just quite their corps and reform another, risking nothing and losing nothing but a name. defenders complain that they have no way to use their playstyle to protect themselves, and that the wardeccers commit nothing and take no real risks.and yet when offered a mechanism that addresses these complaints, neither of them like it. in true eve style, each want the other to do all the adapting.one might query whether it's a sensible idea for new players to be raising their flag and forming crops that they can't defend. but such a corp could just post the minimum bond of 1m isk (iirc that's the cost of forming a corp) and be in almost exactly the same situation they are in the current setup, with the sole difference that their level of commitment to their corp is now public."
6/19/2016,"neph,thank you very much for showing support for this proposal.dmc"
6/20/2016,that's true.
6/20/2016,"it is also bravo sierra. if you want a corp that is war deccing other corps to face risk, then it is up to the players that are decced to impose it on them. that is the only source of risk in the game, generally speaking, players imposing risk on each other. the implicit argument here is that ccp should impose the risk somehow."
6/20/2016,"i'm sorry, but what game are we playing eve or ccc (cute cuddly critters)?the very premise of the game is that you can impose your play style on others. if you choose to be helpless and ineffectual...that is your choice."
6/20/2016,my suggestion is to be able to obtain factional passport after acquiring enough standing with specific faction in order to have passage to there space .so more players can enjoy using capital ships in high sec on missions and whatever they enjoying of doing except in engaging in wars also developing high sec missions oriented for capital ships
6/21/2016,"i happen to be a cute cuddly carebear. but i also agree that it would be nice to see the deccers have a bit more skin in the game whether it be a modification of malcanis idea or steves warsturcture concept that has been floated before,should hisec be safe? hell no. but that should apply to those who make wardecs as well.more skinmmike azariah ----<U+FEFF> <U+FFFD>|(<U+30C4>)/<U+FFFD>"
6/21/2016,"i would refer you to this post.i think the real problem is a fundamental difference in the philosophy. while we can point out, as malcanis does, that hs war deccing is to farm easy kills and one could argue is rather...low class or something along those lines. the other side, those getting decced, have a philosophy when it comes to the game that is 180 degrees at odds with the philosophy of the game.that is always going to be a problem. for these players any measure short of making hs perfectly safe is just not good enough. it is why we have the ""just one more nerf"" phenomena. ccp nerfs and nerfs and nerfs, and yet we hear the same complaints. over in the afk cloaking thread despite a nerf to cynos via a nerf to jump range and fatigue people are still....still...whining about cynos.and we won't get into the issue that in many cases these are people who make bad decisions in game. repeatedly."

6/25/2016,"interesting thought op. while you have your answer already that indy ships already have faction ships in the form of mining, mining command, primae and noctis. what other indy ships could be available for use? pirate faction blockaid runners are a good start.however are we looking for more industrial minded capital ships? or more industrial minded sub capitals.ccp could always put more work into various aspects of the game however they need to have incentive as well as legitimate reasons for that work.artificially creating a niche by creating a faction ship doesn't work to well. good example would be the primae which is a pi industrial is well the same model as the noctis.first thing to do is develop a reason be sides stating that its needed. need is not want, and stating that something is needed with out proof of that need is generally a want, not a need.most industrial pilots ""want"" some love. which is why ccp is in no hurry to implement major or even minor changes to the industrial aspect of the game. they will make changes as they see the need for ships they have worked to create suddenly come up short and have no real value. again i point to the primae, while its a good looking ship its still basically worthless being that in one update that ccp made with industrial ships.so while most industrial pilots ""want"" love ccp will not give it unless there truely is a need that will warrent them spending time and money on it.honestly i would enjoy seeing some love for industrial pilots. they are the back bone of the game. what is needed is a ""road warrior"" mindset when it comes to industrial ships.if you watch main stream sci-fi you see that the industrial ships (cargo ships, mining ships etc.) all have the same problem they are weakly defended, with little to no armor and little to no speed. which is why pirates are so eager to attack them and take what is in their holds. if we look back at naval history of the world you will see that pirates lost just about as much as they got. it was really the privateers not the pirates that made piracy profitable. being that privateers were backed by the crown (french, spanish, or english) and had a port to sell the goods they plundered from ships that were ""armed"" but not armed as well as a ship they were given by a naval power. in fact most traditional pirates would be sailing roughly the same ship class as the ship they are attacking. privateers on the other hand were granted ships of war to attack merchant vessels.which brings me back to sci-fi shows and the ""road warrior"" mentality. sci-fi shows such as fire-fly, star-trek, alien, star wars, and several others portray industrial ships in general as lumbering behemoths with little to no armor and little to no offensive armament where small swift raiders can attack and take control of. it is really no different than current eve mechanics. granted that adds spice to the game being that now as an industrial pilot you need to seek out help from a combat pilot to defend you. however if we take on a ""road warrior"" mentality. you'll see the advent of the ""q-ship"".for those of you that are not familiar with the term ""q-ship"". allow me to enlighten you, a q-ship also known as a q-boat or decoy vessel is a special service ship or mystery ships that were heavily armed merchant ships designed to lure submarines to the surface in order to destroy them during world war ii. q-ship are used in several sci-fi books such as david weber's ""honor harrington series"".ccp is always talking about ""wanting more conflict"" and generating more ""wars"". well alright then ladies and gents i give you the q-ship.for industrial ships it could be a t3, or t2 variant. more than likely t3 with changes that could be made to it much like the t3 cruiser subsystems. might even be able to use the same subsystems. however special role bonus would be something a long the lines of appears as ""equivalent class of ship on scanners"".so if you have say the minmatar version it would look like a mammoth on overview, and d-scan. until you check ship and see that it isn't a mammoth at all.for freighters it would be a bit different. it would more than likely be a t2 variant, with limited changes. save for the fact that the hold would have to be a lot smaller than a traditional freighter. talking like 100,000m3 base. giving 3 or 4 high slots to the freighter, 4 or 5 mid slots and 3 to 4 low slots and 2 rig slots. giving you the ability to fit battleship weapons or other fitting to make it more of a problem for pirates. in essence a freighter sized block aid runner. however it would have the same role bonus as previously mentioned industrial ships.in the end you would end up with a ship that could dish out as much as it could take and in some cases the pvper would be flying this ship to lure other pvpers into a fight. talk about crazy conflict generation."
6/25/2016,"dear all,eve update shows us eve will get bulk fitting with the following description;so, very nice for people in the pvp arenas of physical combat.but the tools supporting the eve economy used by enablers do not grow.*see the trend here? when they announced bigger corp / alliances due to their existing skills, i also tried to get this point across, i hope someone will pick up on it now.*from rubicon 1.3 statement by ccp fozzie;*my suggestion to get enablers better trade skills for market and logistics too; *then, in the citadel expansion, traders are faced with a higher tax in npc stations, to promote citadel markets. i can follow that reasoning. but when you choose to market the masses in an npc station, and you are a station trader, you have to eat the taxes each time you want to resupply / replenish an order due to the following facts; you work up standings with a char for a faction / race that char has 305 orders mass working a multitude of products, say 6 slots a product in jita, as example, leaves you with just 50 products. if you want to work bulk long time markets, with high turnover volumes, where you want to secure hedges or make bets. you have to work with a certain stock in market and work within the limited room given in a char, or you have to start multiple alts. but still, when relisting product, you have to pay taxes over and over. please give us the means to decently replenish our orders.suggested skill; when you update an order, you should however pay taxes over the added amount of product. also, since you edit the order, the timer should renew to the original timer of the order, it being 1 day, or 3 months. *with the arguments of ccp with growing empires, would it be unreasonable to give some love to the enablers that work within the eve economy, to give them the tools that support this bigger game ccp keeps talking about, just like ccp does for the people supplying the physical means in game?thx for reading.

6/26/2016,"think about it. the serpentis only ""stole"" one ship. did they buy their new capitals? or do they have an industrial wing hiding in the depths of space, researching and building these new ships? the pirate factions have to have a significant industrial wing to support the amount of ships their factions lose daily. it just makes sense that they are also using the same ships the miners use. i would bet that they have boosting orca's and rorquals too! it would be awesome if we found a pocket of asteroids with a small pirate faction mining fleet mining them for us to destroy! make it happen ccp! make it happen! skins at least..."
6/26/2016,"are there seriously any points in a region that are over fourty jumps from another? and even if there are, are there enough to warrant training a skill to 5?"
6/26/2016,"no there is not afaik. but i do recall someone working out that the largest number of jumps from point a to point b anywhere in the eve universe is 60. (i tried to find the post where this was worked out, but my googlefoo failed me)the range modifiers on market orders are fine imo.and market orders are ok(ish) but a bump in them would also not go unwelcome.contracts however definitely need looking int - but i am praying that the contract system is due for an overhaul as well. so we shall see."
6/26/2016,"its the same distance as the other trade skills, i dont care about the distance. as long as the skill itself will be available ;). ""schr<U+FFFD>dinger's missile. i dig it."" ~ makari aeron"

6/26/2016,"i honestly don't think this is necessary, and it devalues the effort required to maintain a proper trading operation. 300 orders is a lot of orders, in fact, the tycoon skill is the most ""best bang for your buck"" skill in the game, because each market order has essentially no limit on your isk/hour (but of course market competition helps keep it down a bit).if everyone had double the orders, the only real result you would see that it takes double effort to make the same isk (under the assumption that everyone makes full use of their orders, which they do not). furthermore, having too many orders discourages interactions with orders despite tax hikes -- why buy an item for 20.2 million when it costs you 20 million to buy it and you wait a little longer? a smart trader will tell you to use the 200k pricier order because time is money, but idiots with high trading skills are living proof that people don't do that (or maybe there are a bunch of braindead botters in jita, wouldn't surprise me with how fierce the competition is sometimes).wait, what? why don't you just pay the 100isk broker fee for adjusting the price by a cent? this completely resets the timer. there is a distinct tradeoff between larger orders and smaller orders due to this exactly. if you're not making money then your strategy is bad. to make best use of your order slots, you should do something like this:assume some item has a median buy of 1.7 mil and a median sell of 2.2 mil: list 100 units at 2.3 mil for 90 days when there are only a few units left, lower the price to 2.2 (or lower depending on volume), this resets the timer again but you don't care about that, since the order is going to get filled soon list 100 units at 2.3 mil for 90 days from your stockpiles (which you probably replenished somehow) taxes are there for a reason, if you want a tax break go sit in the right citadels or make backdoor deals. as a hardcore trader i can tell you that these changes that have happened are all really good (except for no contracts in citadels, which pretty much cancels out all the good stuff i've been saying about citadels because i can't pay others to do stuff for me in citadels).now this... this is just plain old entitlement. you want to be rewarded for enabling trade? you think ccp should do it because it's their game? you're playing the wrong mmo my friend. you want to be rewarded for enabling trade? you find a forking decent trade route or come up with a great strategy or supply goods to a group that didn't know it needed them. it's up to you in the sandbox, not the devs, to make things go smoothly (or not)."
6/26/2016,"first time i hear someone make a good argument in this direction. ""schr<U+FFFD>dinger's missile. i dig it."" ~ makari aeron"
6/26/2016,"i dont mind paying to change taxes, i dont want to pay taxes on goods i already put on the market, if the 90 days are over, and i want to put up my stock again, i have to pay taxes again on the same order. if i add stuff to the order, it should be taxed, and the broker fee is ok too. i just want the stuff that is in market, to stay there for sale. now if i want to top up an order, i have to cancel it, put in more stuff, then relist and repay taxes. i want to be rewarded as someone who is part of the eve community. the entitlement you are reading into it, is the fact that 90% of the resources are diverted to pvp related issues, while issues in contracts are here since 2003 and simply never fixed.

6/27/2016,"yep long overdue. things like drag'n'drop of destinations into courier contracts, and more control over the completion period for courier contracts are sorely needed. 24h is a ridiculously long time period to have as the minimum."
6/27/2016,"i recently ran across a player who needed help with one of the career agent missions (introduction to cosmic signatures), and since i happened to be in his area, decided i'd scoot on over to lend him a hand with it.in the course of my actions while helping him, i discovered what i felt would be some very good options to 'fix' the mission to make it more 'noob friendly'. i feel that these ideas can even be extended to other career agent missions to make them all less apt to confuse our future fellow members!this particular career agent was one of the minmatar agents, in couster system.when first given the mission, the player is told to head to the site and contact the agent on grid for further details.this first mission window should include details to inform a player unfamiliar with encounter sites to undock, right click in space, etc.next up, landing on grid.there is both an acceleration gate, & an agent in space.- first problem... the agent is not interactable! he should be interactable to inform the player to make use of the acceleration gate! (after all, this may be the first mission the player has come across that uses one!)just to double check, i made use of the gate to warp into the second room. at this point, there is a pop up window by defualt to explain to the player how to continue, and i presume from such in the following rooms as well. this message was well detailed enough to not need further work. (and i presumed from this that the following ones would be all right, too.)please feel free to add your own thoughts, and experiences, with helping noobs!"
6/28/2016,"i know it's the first day of this release, so some of you haven't had a chance to check on things yet. were any of the csm in the testing? lots of good things in the release, but the major bad thing has, once again, stolen the show. the station docking animation is a problem for a number of players for different reasons. will the csm be able to speak on this in the forums?"

6/30/2016,"titans are currently the only ships capable of fitting a jump portal generator able to bridge subcaps of any size or type. i propose that ccp introduce a new capital hull class, could even be an industrial capital, that is capable of using a jump portal generator but has little to no self defense. only larger fleet hanger, fuel, and ship maintenance bays making it the ideal ship for the nomadic people. name suggestions: errant, wayfarer, vagrant, gypsy."
6/30/2016,"don't worry, we play the game as much as you and are aware of it. we echoed calls for it to be toggled on/off in a menu when it hit sisi. personally however, i quite enjoy it. with regards to the other changes, we were able to give feedback on scope network earlier in the term, and the balancing changes w/ regards to capitals were heavily discussed internally."
6/30/2016,"^^when it comes at actual testing, we're just like regular players. we get access when it shows up on sisi. i, personally, have had no issues with the docking animation. i've since heard it can cause some people issues with motion sickness, but that's a specific subset of people, and people outside that subset don't have any problems with it. so it can be hard to identify that it may be a problem. (i looked at it from the perspective of 'does it slow anything down, and i didn't see it doing that, so i didn't consider it a problem?)"
