11/2/2013,"recently, i have been advocating for work on the mining of eve and the love it needs (mostly in the features and ideas); it seems that more people in other posts are doing so (not because of me). current mining is suffering and needs ccp to look at, and look at it not from the isk/hour idea that most people see it as.is mining ""safe"" compared to other professions? yes it is, but other professions have more options available to them. look at nullsec ratting. people lose ships in there, but there are also people capable of bringing more secure ships like carriers that don't even take a scratch except when hostile players shoot them.so is mining safe when other people can bring more ships or new tactics that dramatically increase their survivability and income at the same time and receive the same risks?mining is dependent on the player run market when you assume isk/hour, while npcs are not, they receive the static bounties on them. so how can we balance it? we can't and i accept that unless something about rat bounties change, and this i am not advocating. what i want to see is a rebalance of the mining profession all together. many of the modules, lp store, and distribution of the minerals are problematic or useless:little things issues:ore miners: only a range bonus, this is not exactly useful in mining, yes range is nice, but the asteroids are not running away.harvesting implants: the low-grade set for harvesting is again a range bonus, not useful for the price.modulated miners: this module is unlocked at mining level 5, however you can not use any of the ammo for it. you would otherwise suffer a loss using itmining crystals: required for modulated mining lasers but takes 31 day for just all tech 1 crystals, twice that for tech 2. does not have any mining skill prereqs.mining drones: while yes, some people do use them, they seem to be pretty lacking in comparison to others mining ways.larger issues:limited tech tree: there is a large gap in effective ships to use. current mining ships make a plausible expansion of the tree difficult without making other ships obsolete or increasing the new ship's risk. (new content like my resent post of how to expand the resouce gathering tree)null sec industry pt1: the difficulty for the 0.0 industrial index is far too difficult to maintain and raise. even if it is raised, there is such a small if non-existent benefit for it.null sec industry pt2: while the idea of removing the need to scan down the asteroid clusters seemed like a good idea, the already vulnerable and easy to kill miners will have even more problems living with their limited tree after the warp speed changes. the now ultra slow haulers who are mid-warp will be extremely likely to die with an interceptor (who is now nullified) waiting in the belt.null sec industry pt3: mexallon, while i like the interdependence for null and empire, there is still a massive deficit in null. skill tree: skills, ship skills not included, related directly to mining are limited to (exception to drone bonuses) 7 skills. with mining crystals its 23 (prereqs like refining not included). needs to be streamlined and some expansion would be nice, like a mining rof reduction and range bonus skills.now you may say that i am focusing on nullsec mining. this is true, i am because i think that nullsec is what needs the help for the profession the most. highsec i am fine with, the concord support is safe enough in my opinion and the fact you only have to deal with npc frigates is not much of a problem. any issues in highsec would be solved with the little things changes.the point is at the end of this, does ccp truly understand the issue with this profession, which is necessary for the eve game play to build things for people to blow up now that drone poo is gone? does ccp even plan on acting on this profession without brushing it off? will the csm push for an overhaul on this section of the game-play which needs it?"
11/2/2013,"i'm not so sure about that, from what i see it seems to have spawned a large group of massively wealthy, incredibly overentitled fuckheads who whine shrilly and unendingly whenever anyone else 'dares' to touch what they think is theirs by right. its like everything bad about highsec has been distilled into one group.yes people will shoot incursion motherships, in case you forgot thats what theyre ******* there for. what they are not there for is for you to sit on like elvis on his throne farming more piles of isk to horde or spend on pointless bling. *youve already been told what works against the tactics you described and the things you claim are stopping you are only stopping you because you cant be bothered to make the effort to address them.*by you i mean the op and his ilk*(insert clip of willy wonkas you get nothing scene here)"

11/3/2013,"hello!i support this idea. i live in a wh and the ore bay for the refineray is way to small even for a single person. many of you have said that this would be unfair to those who owns the stations with refining. i think that the idea that the refinaries at a pos is skilled based (with a bit greater lose than a station, something like 5-15% loose with max skill) and that it take some time to refine would still make people that can use the station refineries continue to do so.my wh have a high sec exit and you can not bring in a freighter. you can bring in an orca, but you can not jump back and forth with an orca because the wh will close quickly and you will need to do alot of jumps on diffrent exit and to diffrent trade hubs to get the ore out. the cargo space for the orca is big, but not that big that it will deal with all the ore from one day of mining. using a mammoth or similair is not an option either because their cargo bays is way to small for the job. looking at either the orca or smaller industrial ships sums up that you have to do alot of jumps to get the ore out, and that takes time!lossing the 25 % and having to put up with a small ore bay in the refinaries is still the best option if you can not use a freighter, but that does not meen that the current solution is great, because it is not. your idea howewer is great!kind regardslizden"

11/4/2013,"interdictor bubbles should cause aggro, this current state is stupid.tonight i jumped a gang of capitals to a gallente station, a flycatcher then undocked and dropped a bubble on us, we couldnt warp in the bubble to cause it aggression, so it just docked, waited a bit and dropped another bubble. we had no choice but to slowboat the carrier fleet 35km to get out of range of the dictor undocking and slowboating with invul and then dropping the bubble and docking.yesterday we had 2 of our carriers tackled on a gate by a long range sniper gang, that had 2 sabres and 2 arazus. the arazus were no problem we could shoot them and push the points off field, the sabres however, not so much, they could jump in, mwd cloak, bubble and jump back out of system. our carriers were stuck for over an hour by two ships that didnt even get aggression.last week, we dropped dreads on a gate and sieged. the enemy gang responded by running back home keeping the gang docked and sending 6 interdictors back to the dreads, and using the same tactic of mwd/cloak/uncloak/bubble jump. we managed to slowboat the dreads out of the bubbles which took 30 minutes before their batphone arrived.to me this all seems a bit wrong? why should a ship have such an effect without even getting aggression? the only counter i have at my disposal that i can see is smartbombs, but i cant smartbomb bubbles on a station so they are useless to me there. so basically if a dictor wants to waste 30minutes of my life with no risk they can.edit: capital ships are used as the example as they are ships that are slow and therefore cant burn out of a bubble easily"

11/5/2013,"the algorithm could be relatively simple. base it on what navigation command was last issued. if it was to approach an object, or to manually fly via double clicking, treat it as a bump, but only once per navigation command. orbiting. keep at range, undocking, and aligning actions (or simply flying in a direction you are already pointed) would not be tracked as bumping, thus eliminating most accidental bumps from consideration, while making it relatively difficult to bump repeatedly and intentionally.allow half a dozen bumps or so before concord warns them to knock it off ""reckless pilot warning"" , then 2-3 more after that before a suspect flag. after the reckless pilot warning is given, if the player has green safeties on, the navigation commands which can produce a suspect command should ask for confirmation of those commands.it might also be worthwhile to use the same algorithm with different rules for ships knocked out of alignment as they are trying to warp, giving them an ""impeding navigation warning"", with a chance of getting a criminal flag if they are still on grid when a ship they just bumped is criminally attacked. this would address the problem of ""outside assistance"" in suicide ganks (the chances of this could be based on hidden factors, such as past use of outside assistance by the ganker, and how close the interfering pilot still is when concord shows up.)"
11/5/2013,"i heartily endorse the above-mentioned product and/or service!having taken advantage of this mechanic a time or two, it does seem a bit broken."
11/5/2013,bastion modules cause a weapons timer but bubbles apparently don't....yea... that's kinda broken when a purely defensive module causes a timer but an attacking module doesn't.
11/5/2013,"trying to engage warp to a location off grid whilst in the bubble creates an aggro timer, you just need to be quick to do it to a ship thats trying to complete its job and get back into safety. if you do i believe the ship/pilot gets an aggro timer and cant dock/jump.if dictors never got aggro from bubbles you would never see dictors on killmails because of a warp interdiction probe, and i can tell you ive been on killmails since the last patch for precisely that."
11/5/2013,you do not appear to have read or understood the first post...
11/5/2013,i have and the only issue i see is that trying to warp whilst either in siege or in triage meant the checksum hit the siege/triage brick wall before the bubble stopping warp brick wall. the only other possible issue is if technically the dictors can bubble up after they've sent the jump request (ie the server processes the deployment of a warp interdiction probe after/during its processed the jump command)
11/5/2013,"weapons timers were removed from interdictor bubbles soon after the implementation of the new crimewatch to allow the dictors to jump and keep up with their fleets, if i remember correctly. e: nope, retribution 1.0. perhaps the change was before release. the reason is correct, though. i'm not arguing against the op, mind, i'm just producing the reason probes don't give a weapons timer. allowing the interdictors to remain with the fleet is important, but the situation described in the op is bordering on abuse of the mechanic"
11/5/2013,and shorten the invul timer from undocking/jumping from 60 to 30s aswell.
11/5/2013,put it back to the old days of when you dropped the bubble and someone had the foresight to try to warp in said bubble aggro was started. make these lazy dictor pilots learn what it really means to time things or beat feet. seems an exploit at current.
11/5/2013,trying to warp in siege/triage wouldn't cause aggression on the mechanics anyway due to the fact that you cannot warp anyway. interdictors and interceptors are going to travel even faster come rubicon. combine that with an invulnerability of just being able to dock/jump due to no aggression is stupid.
11/5/2013,"i would agree that dictors need to keep up with the fleet, so no to launching bubbles as a source of aggression timer.if you launch a bubble and someone tries to warp while inside of it, though.. yes to making that start an aggression timer."
11/5/2013,maybe make the action of launching said bubble and activating a gate / docking having to occur on separate server ticks (rather than the same that i believe it is currently) meaning there will be a 1 second difference between the bubble being dropped and a docking request/jump request.generally peoples reaction times are <~250ms so would seem enough of a difference to do something with it.
11/5/2013,"still doesn't solve the issue where an agressive module use doesn't induce gun timerdrop a bubble => 60 sec. gun timer. deal with it.too easy to bubble and dock in loop with actually no way to be caughtand a check on the undock lenght (both time, and actual physical lenght)also, a ""stop ship"" order shall drop the invulnerability, this is non sense, invuln is made for ppl with a bad connection to actually catch up (preventing them to be killed before actually seeing the outside), if they issued a ""stop"" order, they are in control, why shall they remain invuln?"
11/5/2013,"no, the other way around!having people try to warp near the end of the bubble's life is what really extends the aggro timer to stupid long levels and prevents the dictor (and fleet) getting aroundalso you could still land at gate > launch > jump before anyone tries to warp"
11/5/2013,it is wrong that you drop capitals as solo pwn mobiles on gates without support to kill supcap fleets or ships. capitals are meant to be fleet and support ships. go home with your elitism pvp and get some friends in support ships.
11/5/2013,supportsupportsupportyou sir are text master
11/5/2013,"i feel your pain, however you need to consider that interdictors are meant to be ultimate pwnmobiles and better than other forms of tackle so your arguments are invalid."
11/5/2013,please tell me where i said i had no support? i said none of the ships on field can even lock the interdictors. due to a combination of no aggro and cloak/mwd trick.go cry about getting hotdropped somewhere else.
11/5/2013,"the problem isn't support, we quite often have support, you can't lock a ship that can instantly redock or is on gate and just jumps through."
11/5/2013,"also i would like to point out that capital ships are used as the example as they are ships that are slow and therefore cant burn out of a bubble easily. if im in a vagabond ill just leave, it still doesnt mean there isnt a problem that the dictor still is not taking aggro."
11/5/2013,"your text make it seem like the situations that were described were put together theoretically and not a product of actually having those assets in those situations, which makes me wonder about the legitimacy of your concerns."
11/5/2013,"please check my killboard and corp killboard, these are ingame events over the last week. i used the capital examples from the last week as this is where dictors are most broken in these situations. i gave ingame events as examples and you say its theory. yet i even say in the op yesterday and last week, why would i say that of its theory lol."
11/5/2013,"i've used dictors on a gate to hold capitals down, as well as dictors on a station to inhibit logistics. in my opinion, dropping a bubble should not cause a weapons nor pvp timer. however, if someone is inhibited from warping because of your hictor/dictor bubble, you absolutely should receive a weapons and pvp timer. it gets pretty silly when i can undock, drop a bubble, redock. undock, drop a bubble, redock. thankfully, those of us familiar with game mechanics will simply drop a bomb via stealth bomber to clear the bubbles and then cyno out."
11/5/2013,"launching a bomb counters the bubble, the bomb also has a longer cycle time. however this still doesnt counter the dictor itself that can just come back and place another. the dictor still has no aggro, which is the problem...currently im going to have to field an entire ship to counter a single mod rather than a ship.."

11/6/2013,suspect flags for miner bumping will create more opportunities for pvp!
11/6/2013,"after reading a lot responses here, all i see is the common place in a lot of threads, discuss an issue that is a consequence as if it was a cause. bump is a normal game mechanics that can serve to a fair purpouse within the game universe, and it is just a way of harassing people because something else the game mechanics allow, not the bumping perse.bumping can be not only a annoying thing, but a regular strategy we use in our industrial only corporation to help in gate camping counter actions, pirate persuit and emergency warp delaying until interdictors arrive. the problem is not the mechanic of bumping, but the strange thinking behind ccp development team that for honest naiveness or condescending dismissal, impress on texts how eve players are, and how eve universe is, when everyone know that a small fraction of people is remotely like the way they say eve players are, and a very few people is or ever will be able to enjoy the game as they say it is.i sure have nothing to complain about eve. it is the way i first found it interesting and still is, and it is unique among mmos. the thing is, it is not due to the reasons the site adverts it is, but it is unique in the sense that no mmo out there has such lack of regard in giving people equal chances to achieve goals.in wow a lvl 90 (is there 90 already ?) say, warrior, can one shot a dozen newly created chars, which prevents groups newly created with the sole purpouse of doing that. in eve, someone like that famous guy can alone create a dozen chars that need a few days only to be able to do lone ganking. but, you usually will find people with 2 or 3 accounts that want to get together to do a ganking fast. you can use 1 week chars to do a lot of things that wont even reflect after you delete them. damn, 7 people can plex their way into making a whole 1.0 hisec system into a death trap for weeks.and people still complaining about bumping.there are two powers: power of numbers and power of leadership they compensate or add to each other, but nothing compensates or add to having neither. politics: if you dont use it, it will use you."
11/6/2013,"a single bomb can counter many dictors.... popping all of their bubbles at once. this might only by you a small window before they rebubble, but if you are weary this gives you the window you need. furthermore, an insta-locking arty ship can sometimes blap a dictor before it re-docks/jumps."
11/6/2013,"the argument would be legit either way, as long as interdictors were able to act as tinker describes (they are)the fact that players can mitigate negative consequences of a broken mechanic does not address the issue of a ship being able to negatively/positively affect others in a combat situation and then immediately escape, something the new crimewatch mechanics were designed to prevent and something that eve should not include.a weapons timer from players trying to warp out from a bubble means that the interdictor can still negatively affect players with the bubble and then leave, as long as there's a period before someone attempts a warp. also, this extends the amount of time a fleet has to wait up for an interdictor pilot to lose the weapons timer, since someone may attempt to warp at the end of the bubble's life, meaning the dictor has to wait for the bubble to vanish and then sixty seconds more. giving a weapons timer when the bubble is launched means the dictor does suffer being at risk for a time if they choose to attempt to affect other players in combat, but that they also have a good chance of being able to keep up with a fleet."
11/6/2013,"saying ""bubbles should only cause aggro when someone tries to warp"" is like saying ""benny's tornado shouldn't be shot by station guns unless he scores a hit on that frigate"""
11/6/2013,i think you are missing the point of someone needing to try to warp in the bubble or someone being pulled out of warp to start the weapons timer. because if i was to drop a bubble on a station and no one but i was in system should that give weapons timer? or if i was 100km off a gate and only one in system. that is where there needs to be something to cause the weapons timer. as you were stating that about shooting at frig and missing. as you can't just point your ship in a random direction and fire turret weapons....
11/6/2013,these changes were needed 7 years ago. how much longer are you going to ignore one of the games *fundamental* tools.
11/6/2013,i am back! i also still fully support my own well thought out and epic proposal!
11/6/2013,1
11/6/2013,limit carriers to 5 drones but give them 20% drone damage per level so that the damage stays the same.also double fighter base damage.this would make the interface cleaner and most importantly reduce lag.
11/6/2013,it would also remove one of the carriers main defensive abilities which is unique to its particular class of ship.
11/6/2013,how would it remove anything?could you clarify?
11/6/2013,is drone lag even still a thing?
11/6/2013,"my main still has all my old pirate logs, i'd love to see them come back. they were fun! +1"
11/6/2013,"first of all i would support this, however i would suggestion a couple of adjustments:1. link from some low sec system which is next to a hisec system2. make the jump distance so that no capitals in current space can cyno there3. to make the space dark cold and big, remove all the stuff you get in the eve map and dotlan like kills, cyno's, npc's killed etc. as well as localremoving local is only part of it, you need to remove all that information that enables people to find people so easily in current space, this would then be an eve i could relate to, something damn hard and rewarding proper hunting play. blocked: teckos pech, sonya corvinus, baltec1, shae tadaruwa, wander prian, daichi yamato, jonah gravenstein, merin ryskin, linus gorp"
11/6/2013,"as a rule of thumb you can rule out harassment everytime you have a sine qua non clause demanding the active participation of the ""victim"".ganking is harassment, you dont ask to be ganked (some people beg to be, but it is not a condition sine qua non). wardec is flamed by some as a form of ccp legal harassment tool, but you activelly open a corp, and wardec is something that comes with it. if you are in an npc corp, do not attack or seek revenge, do not open yourself to theft or any other action or inaction that in any way facilitate the act done to you, and you have no means to protect against it, then it is harassment.isk doublers are scammers always. period. as is anything that offers something for nothing. everytime you are offered something that isnt usually bringing something to the one offering, it is a sort of scam that if it is not you the victim, someone is.people usually complain in the form of ""i have this problem"", ""i have been a victim of this"", and when you do this, you are just doing the same thing you are complaining about, which is someone that just bother when something is done wrong to them.barely no one come to the forums and talk about things that happen to everyone, or something they find out they can do and have an advantage. if someone find out that game mechanics allow you to force a person out of their ships and you take over, you will only see a post when a person is a victim of this. and the thing is, usually people will come with such a post and then tell ""he said i should click eject or he would shoot me"". lolc'mon people, make ccp spend time on something really important.there are two powers: power of numbers and power of leadership they compensate or add to each other, but nothing compensates or add to having neither. politics: if you dont use it, it will use you."

11/7/2013,"yes. if you drop a bubble on station and noone was in system, that should give a weapons timer. because you can drop a bubble on a gate and jump immediately, and the bubble will effect anyone who jumps in. hictors still get a weapons timer when they activate their warp disruption field, don't they?ok, let me sit a smartbombing bs on a gate with smartbombs cycling, but no weapons timer until i hit something that's not a gate. no, if i do an aggressive act, i should gain a weapons timer"
11/7/2013,no and no.
11/7/2013,"drone swarms have always been hard on the server, now that missiles are no longer 'mini ships' i assume they're official the most resource heavy 'module' to calculate. ccp has throughout the years made updates both to ai for drones and database values used with drones to streamline them. at this point the performence hit doesn't get felt unless there is more than few hundred drones on field. realistically it's as about as good as it's going to get. you suggestion makes the capitals more vulnerable to opponents killing off the drones without giving anything in return. while i wholeheartedly agree with' death to all supers'this won't have much an impact as the current meta of the sentry drone doctrines will guarantee that drone counts from sub capitals will by and large outnumber the capitals altogether."
11/7/2013,"this has been done before. carriers used to have 20 drones and dominixes etc could field 10.drones have since been changed to be far less resource-intensive by ensuring they don't collide with most ships/objects. they're nowhere near the resource drain they once were. the largest bottleneck by far in big fights is still the session change (especially players entering/leaving system).the one thing to be said for drones in this case is that they were never redesigned with the weapon-grouping feature that turrets and missiles received. as there's obvious practical issues in the way of that, i don't see it being resolved anytime soon."
11/7/2013,it definitely is when you have 300 carriers deploying 10 sentries each.
11/7/2013,no. as it is with 600 sub caps deploying 5 drones each... so clearly this is not a capital specific observation....
11/7/2013,"i can't make any promises; the pve team might well have their own plans in mind that don't include pirate logs, but i'd like to at least see them brought back to empire. they could be a valuable tool in encouraging newer players into exploration and visiting non-concord space."
11/7/2013,"i fully support removing map related intelligence gathering. map should not give any statistics on kills and pilots in space. all such information should be gathered by individual players, players can choose to share it in their intel channels"

11/8/2013,"i assume that if people in ccp are more professional than 13 yr olds doing computing class they dont render things in the server, which makes renders and colliders a client lag not server lag. the server takes time to respond for requests because the client takes time in formulating them, but serverside everything may happen text like communication. so server lag has nothing to do with models or colliders. but who knows, maybe ccp does server rendering ...

11/9/2013,"agreed, this needs to be sorted very much so. please put forward as something that needs to be done."
11/9/2013,"problem: where ?solution: why ?when people started booming around usa making small corps that had a clear advantage of mobility and tight leadership, big corporations like intel and ibm saw their empires being bitten piece by piece by small local companies, that alone were not a threat, but each piece was one piece, and when several pieces are put together, they become a huge chunk. eve is not different. it is not hard to small corps to get a foothold, it is hard, as it will always be to confront many being few, adn trying to do it alone.if or when people wake up to the power of numbers, or devs do something about it, huge corps will most likely to start render their power to small loyal corps and will have the advantages of big corps and the advantages of small corps. that is what any manager will do.in any social competitive environment you have the power of numbers and the power of leadership, the problems of numbers are solved by better leadership, and the problems of leadership are solved by the diminishing of the numbers. good leaders lead small numbers of leaders leading small numbers of leaders and so on until you have the operational people. no measure from ccp can turn against it and not be against the small corps at the same time.boils down to who have the better management of the bigger number. good leadership of low numbers is as weak as bad leadership of huge numbers. that is all that massive multiplayers games are about.edit: in that regard, try to think why renting your unused potential to others is not only about money, and that is the way people get allies and cost effective operatives.there are two powers: power of numbers and power of leadership they compensate or add to each other, but nothing compensates or add to having neither. politics: if you dont use it, it will use you."
11/9/2013,"i am a loyalist, to my choosen empire i mean, and although i have characters in each playable faction, i have choosen one that all of them are loyal to, even against their races. they have their reasons for that.what i propose is a counter strategy from the empires to the changes brought in this soon to be xth free expansion (eve devs like to stress that) tightening securities, adding top layer rewards and making their way to what would really be such a reaction for the growing independence from them.concord assembly could add one layer of security status that prevent what i see and do often, which is break hell loose and jump to low sec, shot few pirates in anomalies, go back and wreak havok again. you less bounded by the parameters of lore may ask why i loyalist does that, and i answer, i am loyal to one and friend to one empire, not the four.anyways, i think that all the playing loose goose with penalties, standings and etc makes exactly the contrary to what it is intended for. if people want to see things blowing up, you may want to converge in a path that makes people have nothing else to do after a while.it is pretty comfortable these days the life in empires. they give targets, give advantages, let the targets come easly into their space, and things are being blown up very often but very broingly.if you guys use rubicon exapansion as a excuse to make hisec more tight, people with shady or loyal tendencies will meet more often in the border zones, and compeled by having nothing else to run for. the confrontations will get bigger scale instead of little skirmishes here and there. people will have to watch their backs.one thing i really see as a waste of resources is the fact that small confrontations and small scale gankage are more supported than group interactions in empire space. this is not realistic into the lore of eve. people are stranded, capsuleers are powerful and misunderstood, they would start to stick together because the ""us against them crap"" would be savage from the part of the empires. it doesnt make sense that all the effort is made to facilitate alone confronts over full blown carnage in the borders.maybe it is because i know conflict regions in real life and i see what happens, but i feel that all this skirmishing in hisec crap very unlikely and unrealistic. to really unleash the kraken, you have to have islands of security people can prepare and be ready to fight, and full ""turn the ass to the wall"" zones where people will be in terror for their lives. huge empires reasonably secure everywhere is just boring, every place dangerous is boring. having ships being blown up for no reason is boring.as i said, ccp has an idea of eve players that very few players live it up, but if you put measures in place that makes everyone responsible for their acts, they will choose sides, and the ""us against them crap"" will do the rest.there are two powers: power of numbers and power of leadership they compensate or add to each other, but nothing compensates or add to having neither. politics: if you dont use it, it will use you."

11/10/2013,"an idea that came to my mind to go with an automatically refreshing d-scan was an active/passive scan option. active is the d-scan we have now.passive will show you the direction of any ship that's running an active d-scan providing you are within their scanning angle and close enough to their ship. i'm thinking that the passive scan can detect active scans from some distance outside the range at which the active scan can see ships. say, passive scan can detect an active scan if the ship is within 1.5 times the distance that the active scan is set to.so you can set your d-scan to automatically refresh. but the wider the scan you run, the more ships that can see that you're scanning.maybe also let probes do the passive scan. that way a cloaked ship running active scan can be located and decloaked."

11/11/2013,"its not a rendering issue, its a entity issue, even if you tell the client not to render drone models, its still the equivalent of 10-25 new frigates jumping into or jumping out of system every time a single pilot launches or recalls its drones, multiply that by 300, 500, 2000 ships on grid, and the server entity tracking system goes tango uniform quickly. add to that the moment they fire and the projectile tracking system crashes, especially when they have all been assigned to assist the fc so they all fire in unison.drones have needed an overhaul for more than 4 years and no real work has been done to them, just the token useless module changes. if you remove the drone spam, you will have to uber buff the tank as well as make them invulnerable to ewar, otherwise removing a carrier/supercarriers only source of damage becomes too easy and makes them practically useless on the field. there are a lot of changes that would possible reduce the lag but the changes would have to come with a ton of buffs to counter this. one change i would be for would be the way the drone control unit works, (currently the most lolworthy module in the capital arsenal) make it a single passive high slot module that instead of new drones, adds a percentage to both dps and tank per level. correct the assist mechanics for drones where you can only ""assist"" ships that are in your squad, unless in a command position ""fleet/wing/squad command""give carriers and supercarriers a command boost similar to, but less than the titans more in line with their roles to encourage capitals to be fleet flag ships. this will require some massive changes to fleet mechanics as well, but i have no issue with capitals having better boosting capacity than command ships. here is hoping that if and when ccp finally gets around to the capital re-balance (after they get around to fixing the node lag wall that tidi bought them some time on but didn't fix the issue) that capital drone issues is high on their list."

11/12/2013,"problem is:i really dont know how you guys mine, because i cant be afk mining for that kind of time. i imagine that you mine alone, with no fleet, no bonus, with one mining laser in an industrial, because if you have a fleet with a mining leadership at least foreman, you will fill the cargohold of any mining dedicated ship in a few minutes. i am not aware of any way you can automatically get ore from your ore hold to somewhere else. if you can take 5, 10 minutes afk mining, sure your yield is the drawback of your lack of actions while mining.mining cant be ""fun"". mining is what mining is. you mention null sec, so you gotta be having rorq support and a minimum of 1.7k cicle to be complaining, and that cant let you be doing something else and maximizing your ore acquisition. if you mine alone in null sec with non miner ship, you are just wasting time.while i agree that mining need some love, i cant possibly think a way that the mechanics of mining would change to be ""fun"", unless they do the same crap they did with hacking and archeology, and you need to ""click"" mineral clusters in an asteroid and the laser will pick that up, and you do the ""farmville style"" mining, which will make mining mining just needing more clicks but not actually making it more enjoyable, just like hacking and archeology.there are two powers: power of numbers and power of leadership they compensate or add to each other, but nothing compensates or add to having neither. politics: if you dont use it, it will use you."
11/12/2013,+1. would save lots of time. although i'd be worried about the server load it might cause. when creating a contract with 200 unique items my client gets buggy. i'm worried what would happen if you tried to fit 100 ships at once.
11/12/2013,"for this reason i'd be just fine with a 10 at a time limit.10 at a time would be a massive improvement for basically all purposes. sure fitting ships for burn jita 3 might be a long process still, but for the weekend ganker, the null fleet doctrine brainstormer or most other people it would be a huge improvement."

11/12/2013,i'd vote no on this. the benefit of getting a certificate is having new skills you didn't have before. don't need a monetary/lp/whatever additional reward also.
11/12/2013,not empty quoting.
11/12/2013,"first, you may not run out of things to train even if you started your char when eve started. you may be in lack of core skills, or focused on one faction, one profession, one line of one side. simply: you can do the math, to have all skills to be reasonably bloating you have only useless skills to train you must have been playing eve longer than eve existed.neverthless, the idea is crappy. anything free means no value. if eve is cheap enough to have people running around as if isk grow in trees and have no maket respect for people's ingame work, you assume that the only reason you pay is to train skills ?they still have to have infra structure paid, space and processing allocated and so on, even if you dont log in but is entitled to, so there is no logic, there is no reason, and there is no value in making it happen.there are two powers: power of numbers and power of leadership they compensate or add to each other, but nothing compensates or add to having neither. politics: if you dont use it, it will use you."

11/13/2013,i very much doubt that we need more concord intervention.
11/13/2013,"because ccp never put mechanics in place that are intended to help one thing and serve to be abused in five other ways.they should use a unique rule for aggression applied to everything: if it affects another ship, it is aggression, it doesnt matter how that impacts on the ship. if you want to have your interdictors in place, be mindful of where and when you deploy. if you deployed something potentially affecting yourself negativelly, that should be taken into consideration.that is the kind of wishful thinking that dominates parts of development and things are done to be ""nice"" for one reason and become nasty loopholes for five other reasons.but i also know that it is nothing that cant be avoided by simply planning ahead. as much as it is a broken mechanics, it is also not impossible to counter, just require what no one out of industrial and covert game like to do: plan and scout when you move, specially heavy slow ships.bubbles and non-cloaked ""bubblers"" show in dscan, so you can have an idea if there is one in place, and more or less, where it is. as i recall, that may be the case for low and null sec, therefore, the places where by default you should be careful and use the instruments the ship give you. maybe wh life made me paranoid and i cant live without dscan and covert/black ops scouts, but it is not a bad thing at all, specially when you are travelling around with a billion isk ship.you want to see how people is careless around ? drop a bubble, say, in the low sec between the hisec island in placid. you see people in industrials and freighters blobing up on a bubble just because it is placed on their route. most of the time you see the same person there over and over again.warping in auto pilot or just gate bridging in low sec is like afk mining, you just shouldnt do, or live with the consequences whatever they may be. in hisec, which that sort of thing matters, you cant use those.there are two powers: power of numbers and power of leadership they compensate or add to each other, but nothing compensates or add to having neither. politics: if you dont use it, it will use you."

(stops people from placing several low bounties on one person). this would help kepp a ballance for those who regularly offend/criminalize people and those who dont. -the current system kind of works it stops people with alts from attacking themselves for profit and helps keep everyone happy by not having the bounty diminish overtime they are there cause someone got mad and wants to pay someone to have revenge which is why i think there should be something on top of the current system to satisfy those who place bounties and want them collected. personally i placed a bounty on someone and im not happy with the result no one realy cares if they have a bounty, i think thats wrong unless they want to be the #1 most wanted which is something to boast about, but should be hard to keep."

11/20/2013,"i believe the recent controversy over changes to rlml and rhml systems with rubicon highlights a need for sufficient time for players to test and vet new game mechanics and provide constructive feedback prior to these changes going live.one of the key complaints about the changes to rmls is that the announcement was made barely a week and a half before the change was being launched with rubicon, and only uploaded to the test server a few days before going live. a common opinion is that the launch of this particular change should have been held for a later patch in order to give sufficient time to test it first; but by the time it was unveiled, it had already been included in the planned rubicon 1.0 build. to many, this felt like the job was being rushed out and half-done, and that feedback was ignored largely because there was no test data available to back it up. i would think that those who are against a change such as this would welcome the opportunity to fully test out new mechanics prior to their launch, as it provides them with the opportunity to test out their theories and opinions and share experiences that reinforce their position. likewise, i believe that those supporting mechanincs changes would also prefer this, as if they truly believe in the effectiveness of such changes, then it would be likely that at least some of the detractors would change their opinion once they have seen the changes in action. having a reasonable amount of time to put new game mechanics to the test benefits everyone all around.one of the statements on this particular issue was that it would be pushed live, and then possibly improved at a later date. the problem with this is that historically, once a system has gone live, it tends to be a long and laborious process to get anything changed. once something is launched, it seems to be forgotten or ignored, and this often leaves players dealing with faulty mechanics for an extended period of time. this is unnecessary, and can generally be avoided with proper preview testing. isn't this the primary purpose of having a test server open to the playerbase?my proposal therefore is this: that any significant change to game mechanics be required to be uploaded to the test server for a minimum amount of time prior to its launch on the live server. if ccp is unable to load a change to the test server with sufficient time before its planned launch, then that launch must be delayed until such time that proper testing and feedback can be completed.i will leave the exact minimum test duration up for discussion. i'd personally recommend two weeks as an absolute bare minimum, although i would like to see more. minor tweaks or adjustments to existing systems can probably be allowed without this requirement, but anything that changes the way ships or modules are or can be used should meet this minimum.please keep in mind that this is not specifically about the rml situation, but something i believe to be important and valuable to any future changes. the rml discussion has merely pointed out the need for sufficient community testing as a part of the development process.why a switch on/off? because the new animation doesn't add anything to gameplay and it's graphically annoying. in other words, it's worse than bad: it's useless. simple as that. _ - kina ayami_"

11/20/2013,"interesting, but it'd be a major balance headache. essentially, you're talking about adding at least two extra variants to most of the ships in the game (presuming that the baseline models would fall under one corp or the other, and since each empire has three shipyard corps). that's doable, but adding all that many different hull variants seems to me like it'd primarily serve to dilute role definitions... if a given hull has so many variants, it's harder to tell what a given ship actually does... especially if that information isn't visible at a glance (in the way that different variants of a given tech2 ship normally are).the basic concept (adding more options for each role) isn't bad, but this isn't the way to do it. a better way would be something closer to how, say, assault frigates work. the gallente have the enyo and the ishkur... both are assault frigates based off the incursus hull, but both fly rather differently, being from different corporations. does that mean that there's room for a third af from duvolle? maybe, maybe not (in particular, there should not be a third af based on the incursus, though there might be room for one based off some other hull).that said, the idea would especially be interesting to add more options to other roles, especially those with limited options. as an example, a creodron-type logistics ship, designed to support with heavy drones instead of large remote reps, would be interesting."

11/21/2013,"if you can't make a profit doing something, you're in the wrong market. i've been there myself, there's a lot of effort and math required to tell whether or not a market is desirable to get into, and the profit margins are often stupidly low. as such, business models involving buying materials from a safe market and selling products back to that market are likely to be a bad deal, since you're competing against people who think their time is free. to make real profits, you need to take real risks.notably: prices, especially for tech 2 stuff, are vastly higher out in nullsec than in hisec, simply for the convenience. that's not a 'scam', it's just a supply and demand thing; guys out in null are rich enough to afford the markup, and pay it gladly for the convenience. there are guys who make a killing running cloaky haulers out to npc stations... but it does take a lot more effort and risk than sitting in one station forever buying and selling.if you're frustrated enough with the state of your gameplay that you feel you want to give up, why not take some risks and see what happens? after all, if you were going to quit anyway, you're not exactly losing out... and even if you fail and die, at least you'll go out with a bang."

11/21/2013,"holy ****, the new expansion has bugs! this is a complete surprise to everyone! no new expansion has ever had any bugs before, ever! especially not in the first couple days after it's release! the csm had better stop flying in space and get coding to patch them right now, because that is totally their job, as opposed to anything else.seriously, what are you expecting? the new expansion just came out, the new bugs are just being uncovered, and ccp is naturally focused specifically on finding and fixing those bugs. what do you expect the csm to do to get things moving faster?if you find a bug, report it to ccp directly. if it's really causing you problems, go the extra mile and collect whatever extra info you can through the sources available to you to help them along. they're working on those fixes right now, so it's a good time to do so. but don't complain to the csm about it; there's not really all that much they can do to help ccp fix already-identified bugs, after all."

11/21/2013,"though nice in principle, it's sometimes a tricky balance between testing time and actually getting the features out. more time to play with features would be useful, but i'm not sure if it'd be worth delaying the expansion over."
11/21/2013,"-1the test server isn't there for us to fully vet any features they wish to implement. sometimes they do, sometimes they don't. furthermore, your stance is diminished by your focus on rlml's. did rlml's didn't undergo a ""significant mechanics change"" from"
11/21/2013,"there is no need for this. it's ccp's game so they can change what they want and no one in entitled to anything in this game. there is no issue with rmls! the weapon is still good in many ways it just people are expecting it to be used the exact same. if there is a problem with rlms then its the peoples understanding of how they work. it's like comparing a space shuttle which would glide down to earth where as a space capsule would just fall down. both acheive the desired result, but go about it differently. i have been saying this many times, rmls are hit and run weapons, not sustained battle weapons, use them on roams with a small or even a large group."
11/21/2013,"wrong the test serve is there to test things out on, it was first made for ccp to test new ideas and items out on. yes it's used by players now, but it's key that the people making the game test things coming into the game somehow before it hits the game. the test server is the place for this, it's also a good place to test modules, ships, etc for being over powered and under powered and any other issues within the game.and again wrong, ccp might have made the game, but it's the players game. the first burn jita proved that. upset the players enough and they could crash the economy of eve, ccp knows this. that is why they have the csm, and also why they ask for players input about stuff. without the players there is no eve. things like rapids being completed worthless now and not being tested and being changed within a week or so before release is completely unacceptable. all new ships, modules and etc should be tested for at least a couple weeks, to see if they have any issues, and adjusted as needed. to just through something into a game as in depth as eve is crazy. eve has a fine line of balance it doesn't take much to bring that line off. and eve also has a very out spoken and aggreesive player and fan base, it wouldn't be wise to upset them. if ccp wants eve to grow, and to keep the player base it has, it needs to do well thought out testing before fixing items, before new items are brought in and it needs to remember eve is special because it isn't like other games. and yes there are many issues with rapids now, 40secs reload in pvp is worthless for one, and won't be hard to counter at all. once you know your enemy is using a weapon system that takes 40secs to reaload, just find away to not take a whole lot of damage and when they reload you win. rapids were op before, but now they are truely broken, and need to be looked at again, a long with some oher missiles too. the other thing is 40secs reload for a weapon system is a slippery slope, if they did it with rapids what else might they do it with? i think asbs 1 minute reload is odd, and should be looked at again. these just seem to be easy and fast fixes, instead of well thoughtout and real fixes like old ccp would have done. i hope they get back to that soon, but who knows. adding reload time aren't fixes, it's an easy way out. and if you disagree with rapdis being worthless, come find me and we can play, it should be a good time haha."
11/21/2013,"i wouldn't recommend delaying an entire expansion over this; just hold back on the untested feature. again, this is not about rmls - this is an issue which has been highlighted by the recent rml controversy and ensuing debate, but it is by no means unique to this single feature, and i would hope that people can be objective enought to understand the difference. i understand that these idease are discussed internally. however, the one thing that all that internal testing cannot provide is volume data. as an engineer who works in system failure analysis, i can tell you that volume data is vital to any product release. you can do all the planning and experimenting you want, but you will never cover every use case or see all the ways in which your design can break unless you can gather data en masse. even then, there are things that may be missed, but the larger the sample size, the better the chance you have of ensuring you are releasing quality work. this is why giving these changes adequate time on the test server should be considered a crucial part of the development process.at the core, this proposal is not about giving us time to learn the changes (although that is a nice byproduct). the key here is to give ccp the information necessary to release their features in the best possible state. how many times have we seen featrues come out which upon release were either nerfed so hard that they faded into obscurity, or on day one were broken by the players in a way ccp never imagined and become so overpowered that they dominate the game? requiring this level of testing would not eliminate all such occurences, but it should significantly limit them and hopefully reduce their severity.the sad part is that we should not have to request this requirement at all; this is something ccp should already be doing for their own good and for the good of the game. frankly, the very idea that we have to ask for proper testing of features is shameful.why a switch on/off? because the new animation doesn't add anything to gameplay and it's graphically annoying. in other words, it's worse than bad: it's useless. simple as that. _ - kina ayami_"
11/21/2013,"let me use a real life example for you. i rent an apartment and recently the new management company said they are removing the indoor pool, adding an outdoor one in the spring, and revamping the clubhouse/office. many people were pissed about that. those people believe they are/were entitled to the indoor pool being that they pay rent. however, they pay rent to use the apartment and amenities, the management company owns the facility and has the right to do whatever they want to it so long as it doesn't violate the existing contact the renter agreed to. personally i like the changes they are making, a virtual golf center with 500 18 hole courses (so good-bye eve) among other things, and will stay while other people clearly don't like the changed to the pool (specifically that feature) but there is no legal obligation in the contact that says the pool cannot be changed or anything of the sorts. the company did specify that i could, if i wanted to, end my contact early with a heavily reduced fee due to the changes (1.5 months rent as specified in my contact for early termination), many people have already opted to take this and end their lease.if you do think you are entitled to anything in eve or by ccp then you are horribly wrong for thinking that and you have the right to walk away at anytime. ccp being a company obviously wants to give out a quality product for business, but it's their game. they can listen to people but don't have to. if you want to start another burn jita then go ahead over one module which needed to be changed. since they changed it, finding the new use for it to be most effective is what you should be doing."
11/21/2013,"to be frank, i while sisi provides the full ""volume"" testing you reference under special situations, things like rlml aren't ""volume tested"" there. sisi provides players with a risk free environment to fully vet the mechanics. when ccp changes some problematic back-end stuff, the volume testing is important. when ccp changes simple stats, it generally isn't."
11/21/2013,"i disagree. when you change a weapon system like this, it has the potential to render it either completely useless, totally overpowered, or somewhere in between. the more players who can test and try it out, the more data ccp will have available to determine where on that scale this change will fall. the test server may not provide the same volume of data as the live server, but it is definitely more data than they are getting internally. more data before release is always a good thing. after release, a lot more data will be available, but there is a lot less motivation for follow up and improvement. once the release deadline has been met, people move on to the next project, and few features get the post release evaluation that they deserve. plust, there is always the potential for catasrophic results and the ensuing fallout. as such, it is far better to do all that is reasonable to improve the features prior to release. to do otherwise is irresponsible.why a switch on/off? because the new animation doesn't add anything to gameplay and it's graphically annoying. in other words, it's worse than bad: it's useless. simple as that. _ - kina ayami_"
11/21/2013,"a video game isn't an apartemnt compnay, people have to sleep somewhere. but games, well there are 100s of them and if you don't listen to those who play said game and mess it up enough that enough move to something else, said game is gone. in the real world you have to listen to the consumer and also the consumer isalways right. not testing something and changing it 10 days or so before it gets adding to game is a good way to **** those consumers off and show you don't care what they think. do that enough, and they will have enough of you and move on.so if ccp wants to keep their consumers, they should probably listen to them. they didn't with the walking in officer quarters and aur and 100s of consumers attacked everything in jita and almost crashed the server. as eve is only on one server and the market is 100% play based, it wouldn't be hard for the consumers (players) to crash the economy and/or server. also if they keep adding things at the last minute, especially things that ruin an idea in the game they will have th consumer loose faith in them and look around for other games that won't f them over so much.so should ccp listen to their consumer base yes, do they i think so to a point. should ccp test everything new coming into eve for a couple weeks yes. should they also test anything that might be op or up before trying to change them yes. do they have to, no. but if they want to keep eve going and keep the consumers, it be a good idea."

11/24/2013,"okay first time stepping into the council hall, let me put on my fire retardant clothing, okay good. ready for the flames. my suggestion is simply really (and though i can't speak for the totality of the eve community) i believe many will be able to see its merit:with rubicon now upon us and the increasing power of the capsuleers in new eden, i suggest a few new mechanics for the next expansion.1) allow players to take control of regions within empire space. not just by saying this is my system or that is my corp's system, but in a more concrete way. make it possible for an alliance with enough will and strength to declare independence from the empire in control of said region (obviously this would be more likely near the borders/medium security regions and not near the capitals or 1.0 systems). 2) allow players to force out/destroy the current stations in highsec empire controlled systems. since we now have the ability to do this with pocos, the next logical step is to be able to do this with stations. we already have stations owned by players outside empire space, so the mechanics are already present. 3) allow newly ""independent"" systems the ability to hire/create/spawn (what have you) their own security forces (since logically the empires/concord won't be inclined to defend these systems any longer). this could be tied into a new branch of the skill tree, something the effect of corp management or empire control and obviously the ships used would have to be purchased/built by the new ruling alliance. this could also allow for these indepence movements to occur in lowsec stretches of empire space. after their war for indepence is complete, the new ruling alliance could ""convert"" the system to a pseudo-higher security level wherein they set the laws, i.e. no podding, ganking miners is a-okay, all out pvp is the norm, or so-and-so on this list is not allowed in this system. 4) to create a more fluid/realistic process for these revolutions, make the change over be something that requires a lot of work, i.e. you will have to win indepence from the empire that controls said region. if you win, the result would be freedom. if you lose, the result would be a dramatic drop in faction/empire status akin to fighting for the minmatar for a year and trying to fly into amarr controlled highsec.5) this one's more for the cool points, but when/if you win your independence, your alliance will be ""upgraded"" from alliance status to nation status. the alliance name will still be present, but after it would be the name of the nation, i.e. the bacon legion of bacontopia. okay, so there's my first post. please be gentle."
11/24/2013,"i beg to differ. after the rubicon expansion i have the potential to gross 20+ billion a month off one character with six planets. i know math is hard, but the numbers don't lie. and now with the ability to run tax free pocos (be it through owning them yourself or by using a little diplomacy with your neighbors) the profits are actually higher for a player willing to learn how to use the system. as for manufacturing.... please tell me you're kidding. my corp runs blueprints for missiles in minmatar space. we buy our materials outright instead of harvesting the minerals ourselves and we turn steady profit. as we've grown we've started negotiations with nearby corps to form an alliance (paid for by our pi and manufacturing), this will drop our costs because most of these corps are mining corps, and thus we will be able to create our own market for minerals, which we will use to make more boom booms, and more iskies. tl:dryou're wrong or you're doing something wrong. pi, research, manufacturing, and mining are all profitable if you're willing to use a calculator (which ccp was kind enough to put in game for you)."

11/25/2013,"why, oh why, can we not downvote other people?"
11/25/2013,"i'd like to resurrect an old debate started when ccp removed learning skills almost 3 years ago:andski wrote:t's a curious question - why do learning implants exist? how can their continued existence be justified? you need them to train your hyperoptimized per/will skillplan as fast as possible, sure, but why should you need them to begin with?let me begin by highlighting the problems with learning implants: they discourage people from playing eve. you're still paying your subscription, sure, but you're not playing the game. you don't want to jump to your empty/combat clone and lose a day of ""optimal"" training so you can have some fun, and then have to jump back to your training clone the next day. this affects nullsec (especially wormhole) players doubly so - losing your ship in a bubble is a surefire way to get podded. people in empire still have a better chance of warping their pods out of harm's way, and thus have no qualms about running missions or otherwise ~flying in space~ with their implants, unless of course they are at war. that, however, is not our playstyle. they are seeded exclusively through lp stores rather than being made in-game entirely. characters that need pirate faction implants for any reason (supercapital pilots with slave/nomad sets, freighter/jf pilots with nomads, etc.) are essentially stuck with +3s. but this isn't about pirate implants. i'd also like to append something else to that list: if you're buying things to risk when in space, it should be because you're either moving it somewhere (for trade/logistical purposes), or you're using it to improve your general survivability while you're in space. hardwirings (generally) fall into this category, as the vast majority give either defensive or offensive bonuses to ships in space. losing them is just like losing the modules or rigs attached to your ship, as they are all for the same purpose. however i feel i have a more elegant solution than andski. my proposal aims to meet the following goals: players aren't discouraged from pvp out of fear of disrupting their training plan. wormhole and nullsec players don't suffer skill training delays for their choice of gameplay style. players who can only afford to risk low-grade pirate sets for combat no longer have to slow down their training plan. it will still be possible to gain a faster training speed if you have the isk to invest. this faster training speed can be achieved by player-built items rather than implants bought from an lp store. part 1all current training implants are repurposed into generic ship attribute bonuses, and renamed accordingly:+1 bonus: basic-grade capsuleer enhancement+2 bonus: low-grade capsuleer enhancement+3 bonus: standard-grade capsuleer enhancement+4 bonus: high-grade capsuleer enhancement+5 bonus: experimental-grade capsuleer enhancement(as a bonus this helps eliminate the current naming scheme for training implants that can be fairly confusing for new players. ""limited neural boost - beta"" is totally intuitive guys)slot 1: (formerly perception) 1-5% bonus to ship agilityslot 2: (formerly memory) 1-5% bonus to shield hitpoints slot 3: (formerly willpower) 1-5% bonus to ship velocityslot 4: (formerly intelligence) 1-5% bonus to armour hitpoints slot 5: (formerly charisma) 1-5% bonus to signature radiusthese implant bonuses correspond to the old attribute bonus, so a +3 willpower implant would now give +3% to ship velocity. other slot 1-5 implants that currently give an attribute bonus also receive the corresponding ship bonus.then... do not give everyone +5 to base attributes to compensate for the loss of +5 sets. instead give them a lower amount (between +1 and +3). so how do we reach the old training speed? with something new.part 2introduce a new set of (legal) boosters that give a timed bonus to a certain attribute. this bonus depends on the grade of the booster, but would be between +2 and +8. these boosters would last for several days (or possibly weeks), during which time the character gets a decent training speed bonus. all training boosters would share the same slot, meaning only one could ever be used at a time. this means that a user would be committed to a single attribute bonus for the full duration of the booster, and cannot switch until it expires. however, between the base attribute bonus and the potentially higher bonus on the new boosters, characters could end up training slightly faster than before.just like other boosters these new ones would give random penalties; corresponding to the bonuses listed for the capsuleer enhancement sets. this gives extra incentive to use these implants in pvp, in order to counteract any negative penalties. players using full sets of these implants would also end up generally better off than before, even with penalties.so, is it time we send learning implants to the scrapheap alongside learning skills and achura bloodlines? is this the right way to do it? should the ship bonuses listed be different? am i asking too many questions?"
11/25/2013,"yes. i find it somewhat confusing that the implants weren't removed along with learning skills. learning skills were removed because they created a situation where new players were discouraged from playing the game for fear of less optimal skill training. implants have much the same effect, except that while everyone lost the same amount of training time to learning skills, implants hurt newer players more than older players who can afford to replace them.learning implants force players to choose between playing the game without risk, unfairly expensive deaths, or sub-par skill training. the first and most common option is bad for everyone."
11/25/2013,"i can get behind removal of learning implants, sure.replacing them with learning boosters, though? wtf? that feels like it'd be even worse."

11/25/2013,i proposed learning boosters here a month ago.
11/25/2013,"i like this idea, but the boosters should have a potential side-effect and also a 10-15% chance to fail. a fail still lasts the duration of the booster, so if someone tries a 1-week +8 booster and it fails, they can't use another training booster for a week."
11/25/2013,"as long as learning implants exist, cybernetics remains the last learning skill. every argument that applies against learning skills applies to the cybernetics skill. at the same time, arguments for keeping learning implants can apply to bringing back learning skills. but i don't see anybody calling for their return.as for boosters replacing them, that would punish people who don't play eve enough to be able to afford the boosters. so it encourages people to log in on days when they don't feel like playing just to do an isk making activity. which then leads to burnout and people leaving eve. even worse, this will hit newer players worst of all because they have less capability to earn isk.well, unless you make the boosters so cheap that their cost can be ignored. well, except for players in wormhole space who still have to worry about the logistics of getting boosters for their characters. why do you hate wormholers ?making the booster only boost a single attribute hits new players even worse, as they are far more likely to want to train skills from a wide range of attributes. while my training plan for the next year is almost completely perception/memory skills.attributes in general just sound like complexity for complexities sake. boosters only make that worse. complexity is only good when it means players have to make interesting choices. i don't see any interesting choices that come from attributes or any method to increase learning speed, be they permanent (learning skills and implants) or temporary (boosters)."
11/25/2013,production of learning boosters should require the harvesting of frozen corpses.just putting that out there.
11/25/2013,"to be completely fair, people who have expensive ship bonus implants *also* have the 19 hour penalty / play being discouraged. after all, if you want to fly something where every bit counts (a capship, say), you'll want a slave pod to go with it. if you move between lowsec piracy and nullsec fights, you'll be swapping between something like a snake pod and a cheap pod with a +1% or +2% hardwiring. yes, this would address +5 pods, but it wouldn't magically make every bittervet undock.i like the boosters idea. i'd also support getting rid of attributes, although i haven't in the past-- i realize now that the thing i like about attributes is the feeling that i can do *something* to change my training time, which is otherwise a big monolithic bloc of ""ugh, 10 days before i can work on something *else* i need""."
11/25/2013,true. i know i sometimes want to be able to quickly switch between roles and the implants associated with them. but i think it's something separate from learning implants. plus something that will a solution more complex to implement than removing attributes and/or learning implants.
11/25/2013,"right i wanted to suggest this because it only just occurred to me.would it be possibly to sort different ammo types in different waysat the moments its just alphabetical.but what about sorting it my something different such as range or tracking speed.reason i suggest this is because well i have a bad memory and can't remember the the longest or shortest range which isn't tech 2. and which has the best tracking or whatever.i currently have it down on a notepad just to double check.as for sorting could just be listed on the gun for examplevoid would be at the bottom and null would be at the top and then any range / tracking speed in between, depending on how you want it sorted"
11/25/2013,sounds good to me<U+FFFD>

11/27/2013,great idea! we need more innovation such as this you got my vote.
11/27/2013,we need:1. more yeild per cycle.2. better tanking to mitigate gankers3. more ore hold capacity4. to increase ore yeild one more high slot on all mining vessels5. add to the list people....
11/27/2013,why after so many years of eve is it still not possible to put up a wtb contract for blueprint copies?a system that allows it could be pretty easy to implement in my eyes.
11/27/2013,"prompted by this dt titan loss.essentially you can probe out a titan or super, warp to it, and bump it. if caught the pilot can literally do nothing to defend himself but activate hardeners. you can not cancel warp, you can not jump, i don't even think you can activate a smartbomb. this has been possible for a long time, but now it is down right easy with the warp speed changes. this is bluntly a ****** mechanic. no where in the rest of eve are you so unable to change anything. you the pilot are completely unable to affect the course of events.the only way to fix this is to make it so you are invulnerable during ewarp (and can't be bumped). making it so that the ewarp mechanic can be stopped in anyways opens up the old multi log jump out trick (for those that remember it). you could just have a friendly probe you warp and shoot you and than cyno out.login ewarp should offer complete invulnerability and be completely un-interruptible ."
11/27/2013,"there are a number of things that frustrate me with the current way the overview is setup.-the way saving presets work is somewhat annoying. over several patches, some items naturally get added, or modified and overview settings need to be updated. in most programs, you have the option to simply ""save"" (over the previous copy). in the eve overview, you need to ""save as current type selection as"".-deleting an overview preset requires way too many clicks. you click the menu up top, lower your mouse to delete, move your mouse again to said overview, and make yet another click to delete. it would be nice to reduce the amount of clicks required for something which should be so simple.-the way states work is counter intuitive. it will sometime leads to objects that you want to see being hidden. it will also lead to objects you do not want to see being visible. this happens because you need to enable bounty in order to see corp mates who have a bounty on their heads just to name one exemple. there needs to be a better way to resolve such conflicts.-we need an option to change both brackets and overview at the same time. this should in no way change anything to the ability to have different brackets and overview if so desired.-the text boxes in the overview settings are way too small, especially given that you can enter html in them in order make the lettering bold, change the color, etc."

11/28/2013,the tears from people who get bumped are delicious.the tears from the exact same people after they were instantly killed upon undocking from a market after implementing their own poorly thought out ideas would be equally delicious though.it's win win for my tear bucket
11/28/2013,"simple answer: minigame should add hidden cookies to make it more interesting. a 'find' in the ice, if you can recover it.but don't worry lads, there is hope! go over to star citizen and get their devs to fess up to the mining design there, and critique it properly. i love eve online, but let's get real. pay to play 10 year old game with eve valkyrie as an extra add-on vs first person new game modeled heavily on eve ... new players are simply not going to join eve once star citizen hits, because let's be blunt, eve the game is often unplayable. repeated server cluster crashes in nullsec sov warfare battles, unplanned emergency downtimes, unplanned extended downtimes every night this week it feels like ... that's just not going to cut it.so yes, keep the ideas rolling. but time to think outside eve now, because love it or hate it, that is where things seem to be heading fast."
11/28/2013,"i am gravely concerned by the latest design direction confirmed by rubicon, and subtly included in previous patches. this is very bad.core issues as i see them currently: drone assist. when drone damage, range, and speed modules and rigs were added, no changes were made to how many drones could be assigned to one player. the consequence is that fleet fights are essentially warp to broadcast hardners on, approach, launch and assign drones as ordered, go make a coffee. that is boring, but the state of null pvp atm. when you are going to get hit by 65+ enemy archons' drones simultaneously there is no point waiting to maybe click the 'need shield' broadcast button if you are in anything less than your own space slug. degraded stability. a fleet battle of 3,000+ players could crash the server due to the drone mechanic. now you need less, 1200 or so can do it, if you can bring carriers and supers that can deploy more than 5 drones each. verdict: it seems highly likely that due to the 'assist' mechanic the server is trying to simultaneously calculate the hit/miss on thousands of drones on one target, then update the damage back to every drone and its owner, not to mention the spatial 3d and collision detection of all those drone objects. when every player has to target their own weapons, they never do so with mechanical precision, same as when they press their f1 buttons, so damage calculations without drone assist for a fleet are sequential and thus less likely to crash the server. we have collectively learned how to crash the server at will in huge fleet fights, so now what should be the pinnacle of nullsec warfare, which will be the defining point of difference between this game and star citizen, is a horrible slideshow with 20% time dilation in 1,000 person drone/fighterbomber/fighter fights on a reinforced node which simply become a debacle because if your caps are at risk of dying you can just crash the server. that's not good enough. drone assist should be limited to double the bandwidth of the ship assigned to. degraded audio performance. why? i think the warp to / mwd / ab additional sounds are contributing to server instability in fleet battles. there is no sound in space, but when you have large numbers of ships maneuvering together, the server is paying for those grating annoying inappropriate sounds. they took out the duke box, then put the music for sale as a physical item in the collectors edition. it's a lovely score by the way, very nicely played. however audio wise, i don't get why the sounds of metal scraping on metal (listen carefully, you may hear the train on a bend sound) is simply all wrong in a starship. unless you fly minmantar. welcome to wowified ships. the removal of things like being able to put missles on pilgrims and maelstroms has led to tic tac toe hyper specialization of core and t2 ships. the result is just like in wow - you know what a warlock in pvp can do, he has extremely limited choices how to use his abilities, and the counters are all similarly known. and yes, pvp in world of warcraft is actually now more complicated than in eve online. that makes me really sad. afk camping in nullsec. this is anti-play, and as such anti player. valid tactic? sure, but let's get real here - subscribers quit over this mechanic, and have been for years. difference is they are not going to come back to such an expensive (real world cost /year) game when other games have better pvp. star citizen is adding mining ships, not because it enhances pvp or anything - but because they will attract more players. guess where those players are leaving from? you got it, camped nullsec. people *like* mining, and *like* making things. a game that gives them that will thrive all other things being equal: but perma camping is just driving people out of the game. either a player who is inactive for 15 minutes should be disconnected from the server (to improve performace), or cloaks should take fuel perhaps 5 heavy water per minute, so people have to manage their cloak use. rigs. the idea was cute. but the gameplay consequences combined with the latest changes are lethal. combined with mods and ship changes, a lot of pvp is now instant. instant lock one click *boom*, or instant warping interceptors and cranes, etc. instant is a bad word in pvp game design, because it means there is no time for players to make choices, right or wrong, that affect the outcome. if you think of pvp as a spectrum between shooting someone with a .50 cal, pistol duel, fencing (lots of parry and riposte), chequers, and chess, then you can see the pace of combat is critical. eve used to be set at about the fencing level. you made your move, and the opponent often had a countermove that you needed to decide what to do about. it was still fast, but you had to think and react, or die. now 'pvp' is really mostly just ganking, the 0.50 - or wow rogue. interceptors invalidating nullsec gameplay options. an interceptor can enter a system warp and point you faster than you can even see that they have entered system if you have high latency. not even kidding. while we have rejoiced in the juicy kills we have gathered, the simple reality is that interceptors are not only fast, they are just too fast to warp when rigged right. either other ships such as covert cruisers and such need their time to warp decreased, or intys need to be toned back. a lot. and if they are immune to bubbles, bring back mines in nullsec. we already have people like nulli anchoring hundreds of secure cargo containers to reveal cloaked ships, if interceptors want to go fast into the unknown, let people have a weapon to counter interceptors, i.e. mines. and maybe the ability in sov null to anchor up to 4 guns on a gate, just to say hello. why has the csm allowed wowify?"
11/28/2013,"1) the csm has raised this topic with the five-0 devs on several occasions.2) it's possible that drone assist has this effect, but you don't know for sure. also see above.3) pretty sure the server doesn't render any sounds whatsoever. that's purely a client-side operation.4) t2 ships are meant to be specialised. i don't know how this comes as a surprise to you. ""hyper specialistion""? what merely ordinary ""specialisations"" were lost with the removal of missile slots from the mael? this smacks of mere nostalgia for irrelevent fluff.5) pvp happens in 0.0. sorry you can't farm anoms with the same blithe safety as a mission farmer in a 0.7. maybe consider organising and leveraging your power as a group, the same way the ""afk"" cloakers are doing.6) instant warping is bad but instant locking is ok?7) even with the new interceptors it takes 4-5 seconds to get to an anom. if you're playing on a 5000ms latency connection you're gonna have a bad time. stay aligned and stay alert. oh and do that group thing i mentioned above."
11/28/2013,"it's funny how to local makes nullsec much safier than a hs, and nullbears crying about it.... (when someone/devs make a nerf to safety of nullsec). james arget for csm 8!"
11/28/2013,i think she said both is bad. may have been edited tho.
11/28/2013,"it's funny how ""highbears"" who claim that null is so safe never seem to want to live there, but there you go. it's a funny old world.oh btw, cynos are coming to w-space. welcome to 0.0!"
11/28/2013,"so we can finally bring (to wspace) titans, supers (and other compensating stuff), spending our (sleeper's) endless riches ?it's funny to see all nullbers to dockup, close all hatches because someone just entered local in cheetah, or buzzard....james arget for csm 8!"
11/28/2013,"nobody is talking about getting the bitter vets to undock, screw the bitter vets, the fact that this is of slight benefit to them is irrelevant.ship implants are something beneficial to some ships and which give an edge in combat in exchange for a rather high price. there is no _need_ to use them, if they get blown up you're out a bunch of isk but that's it.learning implants are different. any time lost to inefficient skill training is time lost forever, no amount of work or isk can recover it. anyone who is training with less than +5 implants on a remap-optimized training plan is losing sp, sometimes an awful lot of it. essentially players are forced to choose between optimal skill training speed and actually playing the game. game mechanics which actively discourage logging in are a bad thing.this unfairly affects new pilots who can't afford the implants, then once they get the implants they can't afford to lose them. it also hurts new pilots more because they're less able to follow the long-term remap optimized plans that older pilots are able to do as a matter of course. implants and attributes only serve to increase the already insurmountable skill point gap between new players and bitter vets."
11/28/2013,"1) this is essentially an opportunity cost argument (people aren't losing skillpoints by using +4s instead of +5s, they're simply gaining them a couple of percent slower), but everything in eve is about opportunity costs in the first place.i could use your argument to say that ccp should give every player a gauranteed income, because every minute they're ""forced"" to spend making isk, they're ""losing"" a chance to ""play the game"" because they're not out pvping.2) to get to the root of the question: should players be allowed to spend isk to train skils faster than those who don't spend that isk?clearly you don't think they should, but you don't offer a reason other than ""i don't like paying the price and i don't want other people to be able to pay for that advantage if i'm unwilling to"".3) your basic objection about ""losing"" skillpoints seems to be contradicted by your proposed solution. removing learning implants would mean that everyone ""loses"" those skillpoints.oh wait, let me guess: what you actually want is free permanent +5s, am i right?"
11/28/2013,"why do people insist on using these as an excuse not to pvp? so we remove them, then they'll use some other mechanic as the next excuse and ask for that to be nerfed. oh i can't pvp in that tech3 because i might lose sp. etc. etc.i pvp in my +5 imps, either when i simply cannot be bothered to change clones, or in a rush. i also use far more expensive clone sets, dependant upon which ship i'm using. implants have never, ever, stopped me playing the game.you cannot equate the learning skills with learning implants, it's simply not the same. one was stopping you learning other skills and therefore skillz for 3 months, the other is the by product of learning the cybernetics skill. hardly a game breaking skill to train.oh and while you were sat in the station worrying about your sp per hour and the cost of your implants, i was out earning isk and learning skillz whilst enjoying the game. using said expensive implants, because guess what? it's a game, time to play it.destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
11/28/2013,"let's say you don't have time to play but don't want to stop training. there is this option in account management, to pay half the usual amount and have access to training queue only, nothing else."
11/28/2013,"a refining array is designed to have shortfalls. if you don't like it buy a rorqual like i did.this is not a problem, it is an inconvenience and a justified one at that."
11/28/2013,"in this high-tech universe, why do pilots still have to keep pushing a button to obtain a d-scan? even a programmed robotic arm could do it. don't tell me this would be impossible to create (in the eve universe).so, my suggestion is - program your d-scan, d-scan is automatic, repeating the scan every x seconds (30?). a bigger delay than it could be obtained by manually pressing the button, so there is room for ""skill""... same design as autopilot. maybe even new skills to lower the number of seconds for automatic d-scan, or modify the range options, or automatic calculation of au to km.today's d-scan is archaic. there is no skill involved in pressing the button. ""look, i remember to press the button, i'm skilled"". my version would still require setting the direction and range, nothing changed here."
11/28/2013,d-scan needs reworked entirely. trivial patches like this seem like they'd do more harm than good; the whole system needs rebuilt.
11/28/2013,"completely agree, particularly given the lengthy efforts made by a number of player alliances months ago to inquire about this, ccp must take the time to address it at this point."
11/28/2013,"so hang on... this is the pilot getting caught and bumped at the spawn-in, before the automatic warp begins, right? if so, i agree; it should at least be possible to cancel that initial warp, if anything unfortunate happens."

11/29/2013,your problem seems to be mainly that you're not very good at the things you're trying.
11/29/2013,oh snap!!! i have awarded you one 'internet spaceship forum like' jint hikaru - miner / salvager / explorer / spacebum in the beginning the universe was created. this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.
11/29/2013,i treasure them all.
11/29/2013,"planetary interaction in hi sec was barely worth it in the first place - the only thing we used it for was making pos fuel components so we didn't have to buy any. 2 things about the new pi system really do not make any sense to me -1. why does the npc (interbus) get any tax at all since their customs office was destroyed and replaced by a new customs office from a player corp? imho - they should get nothing (the npc tax is eliminated for all by a poco).2. why does a planetary launch off a 500m3 container cause a tax payment to be made? if anything you are engaged in the time honored tradition of smuggling, so no tax payment should be made. if anything, you should get a suspect flag from concord for picking up a planetary launch container - this lets the owners of the pocos have at you if they care to stake out the planet and try to catch you picking up your smuggled goods."
11/29/2013,1) because of game balance.2) because of game balance.
11/29/2013,game balance? really? i would think the introduction of additional taxes to player corps on the pocos in the first place did a lot more to change the game balance than either of these proposals would.
11/29/2013,"straw man argument. making isk is playing the game. you can make isk in eve without locking yourself out of a large portion of the game. if someone loses out on making isk today, they can make up for that by spending more time to make isk tomorrow. lost training time is something that can never be made up, making it a false analogy.i don't care about myself, i can afford the implants, this doesn't seriously affect me. this affects new players who don't have years of isk buildup laying around.it's what they did with the learning skills, but i am not strongly attached to any particular solution."

11/29/2013,"no. just pay the monthly amount and then choose to only update your skill queue.in what possible universe would ccp spend dev time creating a separate game program that splits people by how much they are paying at logon, and sends people to a newly developed skill queue only game.... so that those players can pay ccp half the usual monthly fee.jint hikaru - miner / salvager / explorer / spacebum in the beginning the universe was created. this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move."
11/29/2013,"i fear that this is the intended use for the 'space' on the new screen... advertising!seeing as we nearly blew up the game after the potential pay-to-get-extra-stuff fiasco, i see some sneaky paid advertising slipping in. it will start fairy eve'ish, plex or buddy offers.... then will come pizzahut and coke adverts!!!please, i really want to be wrong here!jint hikaru - miner / salvager / explorer / spacebum in the beginning the universe was created. this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move."

11/30/2013,"so t1 ships have been rebalanced, capital ships rebalancing is planned but not scheduled, and we just did t2 interceptors and eafs. that means it will soon be time to look at my corp's favorite ship class: the stealth bomber.my corp is fairly new (9 months old) and we live in w-space. almost all of us can fly and we use them all the time. i can fly one too and i use them to gank everything. i hate .before i suggest fixes, let's talk about what the problems are:1. they're good at ganking small ships2. they're good at ganking big ships3. they're good at things they really shouldn't be good at (siegefleet, missions)4. they're cheap and relatively easy to train intoto elaborate:1. are frigates, so they have high scan resolution. for some reason, they also are the only ship to have no retargeting delay after decloaking. this means that the only thing that can avoid being pointed by a stealth bomber is a pre-aligned frigate piloted by someone with really fast reflexes.in lowsec and w-space, using a stealth bomber for initial tackle is uncounterable, which is why we use them. the no decloak delay is an interesting mechanic on its own but doesn't belong on an otherwise so versatile ship that costs so little.note: i really really really don't want to open the can of worms that is stealth bomber afk-camping in nullsec. that is its own problem and while obviously very related, still orthogonal to most of the issues presented here. it's too hard to have a discussion about it and all of the other uses of this extremely versatile ship, so let's please leave that out of the discussion.2. obviously, this is the main role that they were designed for - this is the niche they were supposed to fill. my main issue here is that the big stuff you're killing takes longer to train into and costs more than the . i _could_ bring a similar-sized ship (and therefore similar isk+sp investment), but it makes a lot more sense to just bring a cheap stealth bomber and guarantee landing point even if the prey is d-scanning.they're used to great effect in large numbers in nullsec warfare too. i might be alright with a cheap frigate being able to engage battleships. i'm alright with a covops ship being able to engage battleships. i might be alright with a ship that can perform other combat roles being able to output battleship-level damage (yes, the sustained dps is only cruiser-level but they're killing battleships, so i'm calling it battleship-level damage). the combination is overwhelming.3. even our small corp has used to bash poses. siegefleet (bashing a pos in by sig-tanking the pos guns) is weird and not a fun mechanic to have to deal with; it doesn't create content. it might be cool to have a cheap ship that you could bring to bash poses with that doesn't have the commitment of sieging dreadnoughts, but if they can cloak up then that's just no fun.i've used to run faction warfare missions in lowsec. this is unfortunately a sticky issue because without , lowsec missions are not worth running at all. that is, however, a completely independent problem that needs to be addressed separately. having missions that spawn beacons that anyone can warp to is cool. being able to do level 4's with a covops cloak is not. it's interesting that a cheap ship can solo level 4's in lowsec; it's downright unfun that they can do it and cloak.4. a typical stealth bomber costs 20 million for the hull and 40 million after fittings. it takes 32d 20h 54m 40s for a brand new character with no remap/implants to get to the hull+cloak+torps (and another 2d 2h 58m 40s for the bomb launcher, but you don't need that for #1 or #3). the training time is important because you can field a lot more low-sp ships than high-sp ones.when doing #2 or #3, that seems unfair. if didn't have their covert ops cloak, they would still be good at those and i would still complain.i spent the 42d 22h 58m 30s to train into an interdictor and the ship costs more than a stealth bomber. we use it to gank things too. at the current isk+sp investment required, i would fly a stealth bomber if all it could do was instantly, uncounterably (is that a word?) point things. it's good enough at #1 alone; why does it do #2 and #3?"
11/30/2013,"fantasyland interlude:i'm not suggesting that this is a good solution, but let's imagine an eve where don't exist.small ships are relatively safer from being ganked (because you need to bring a non-cloaky ship that can be d-scanned or a cloaky ship that can only bump you during its decloak delay).you need to bring big, expensive ships to fight big, expensive ships.you need to bring battleships or better to siege poses (and they can't cloak up and run away). if you really don't want to fight, you could bring cloaky t3's, but that's a slow pos bash and you can always get pointed by some kind of weird, covops ship that has no decloak delay and the scan resolution of a frigate.lowsec missions would actually be dangerous. yes, they'd be a waste of time, but that's just because the risk/reward ratio of those missions is way too high - again, a separate problem.also, all the sp my corp sunk into would go to waste unless we want to fly covops (oh wait we live in w-space) or torpedoes (ew).back to reality:ok, so have a lot of balance problems. as a very versatile ship, they're used by a lot of people for a lot of things. this is probably not a problem that can be solved by a single change.but wait, t3's are really versatile. people use them for a lot of things. as a w-space corp, we use and see a lot of t3's. i have a lot of words about them, but i'll leave them out of this. the point is i'm much more ok with them because they're really expensive and take a long time to train into. also, their logistics subsystem sucks which reduces their overpowered-ness (i know i said i wouldn't bring t3 balance issues into this, but it's relevant, i swear).what if stealth bomber hulls were 100 million? that would make them at least more expensive than the battlecruisers we gank in them. that would make them closer to what i think a combined tackle+damage role should cost (similar specialized tackle ships, interdictors and interceptors, cost more than or as much as and don't provide damage).what if they took longer to train into? that would be weird because they're just a t2 frigate... but what if you needed t2 torpedoes and t2 bomb launchers to fly them well? i actually had to go look up what those modules do because we don't use them. they don't fit well on .t2 torpedoes deal a little more damage to shield battleships, but way worse damage to armor battlecruisers. you also lose range. javelin is pointless on . t2 torpedoes are just too hard to justify bringing unless you're using them for a siegefleet or something. maybe if t1 torpedoes did very poor damage and t2 torpedoes did fantastic damage, people would feel the need to train for t2 launchers.t2 bomb launchers reduce the cycle time to 135 seconds (before skills) which is cool... if you're in a siegefleet. even then, the extra fitting cost is hard to bear. there are no t2 bombs. there are a lot of directions to run with this, but my personal favorite is making t1 bombs die to a single t1 bomb explosion. t2 bombs would have the hp of current bombs so you could actually do bombing runs in large fleets; t1 bombs would only be useful in solo/small gangs (keep in mind i live in w-space, so ""large fleet"" means ""more than 9"").increasing the cost of a stealth bomber seems like a fairly low-risk change. making t1 torpedoes worse and t2 torpedoes better would affect battleships, but in a good way, i think. (then again, i don't use missiles much, i don't fly battleships, and i don't run highsec missions, so maybe i have no idea what i'm talking about.) making t1 bombs worse and either introducing t2 bombs or giving the t2 bomb launcher a damage modifier would only affect .t3's can be good at a lot of things, but not all at once. if t3's had a decent logistics defensive subsystem, nobody would use logistics ships. a stealth bomber can tackle small ships, provide damage for big ships, and do all this while cloaked. since ""one less role than ccp intended"" seems to be not too overpowered, let's try that on .1. they can tackle small ships and cloak, but can't engage big targets. that means covops and no decloak delay, but no bomb launcher and maybe no torpedoes.2. they can cloak and engage big targets, but can't tackle small ships. that means covops and bomb launcher + torpedoes, but a decloak delay.3. they can tackle small ships and engage big targets, but can't cloak. unfortunately, in order to instapoint small ships they need the cloak, so this doesn't make any sense.it's hard for me to pick a favorite here because they both hurt our playstyle too much.tl;dr: the phantasm is way better at impaling things than the incursus."
11/30/2013,"they're not, they get obliterated by them. i've seen an atron with ion blasters kill a hound, it took him way over a minute but with the hound dealing miniscule damage to him with torps he died miserably. unless you've got the numbers for it, they're going to maul you horribly.they're not really killing battleships since they die too fast (gokufleet got driveby'd by a bunch of tengus and that was the end of that) and interceptor gangs do a hilariously good job harassing siegefleets unless siege has backup recons with scrams, webs and ecm. they're good at ganking unwise, unsupported battleships whose pilots are bad though.a bc pilot would have to be largely terrible to die to a solo bomber and when you sic a ten of them at it it's not a fight anymore, it's a gangbang.plus, it's supply and demand - they used to be twice as expensive, nowadays they're actually much cheaper."
11/30/2013,"me too, but that's not what i'm talking about. please read my explanation where i elaborate on #1.or pve-fit.there's also a price floor based on the cost of production."
11/30/2013,"it may be able to land a point well, but in many cases it's unreliable to tank long and survive the fight - especially if you're ganking something small. by small i assume a frigate/cruiser. they seem largely hit and miss, i've seen them both die to bomber's buddies and killing the bomber to leg it.they're good entry level for covert ops too.edit, after some research into the subject:the scanres i wouldn't call stellar. if we compare it on t2 level, minmatar as example:hound: 500mm basejag: 750mm basewolf: 700mm basecheetah: 450mm basestiletto: 970mm basethe covert ships out of the bunch have lowest scanres, and cheetah can add to it the decloak penalty. raw ""bombers don't have a decloak delay and can point fast!"" holds a lot of merit to it, but it's worth noting that people get snatched by arazus, rapiers and covert t3s - it's likely that most victims of a bomber would fall to one of those equally easily.we'll take a look at the arazu, nonsensorboosted, ~reasonablish~ skills not all 5's:scanres, after skills: 288mm (231 base) + decloak delay. sensor booster, if someone's into this flavor of the 'razu, can bump you up to 460ish after skills. 288 is 4.4s lock time on a raw cruiser preset, eft and you need to add to it 6 second decloak delay (5 if you went all snowflake on it and have cloaking 5 but we're not talking obscene skills).it composes to ~10s time (+1 tick rounding up likely) for a pilot to react, align and warp. 1-2 second reaction time could be common when someone is expecting danger (and in this case, it's worth noting recon pilots often approach targets in cloak going for a ""bump decloak"" - to stagger someone's warpout) and even larger when someone isn't. to that you need to add align time, of course.that said, after some consideration i can get behind siegefleet's price and harassment value but it's a tricky subject on its own."
11/30/2013,"it doesn't need to survive the fight right now, they're cheap as **** and can hold tackle long enough for friends to get on field. with basically no way to stop that from happening.""there will be neither compassion nor mercy; nor peace, nor solace for those who bear witness to these signs and still do not believe."" - the scriptures, book of reclaiming 25:10"
11/30/2013,"i'm pretty happy with bombers in the place where they are. it's nonsensical to try and claim that they make other frigate class ships not worthwhile, because torps are so utterly different to any weapon other frigate class ships use. and observational evidence shows us plenty of frigates doing plenty of things with no worries in the world about bombers treading on their toes.i'm hoping that torps themselves get a rebalance, and when they do it's likely that bomber bonuses will need to be reworked to compensate, but right now, bombers are pretty cool imo."

11/30/2013,"the only thing i always wondered about when it came to was their range. by default it can hit out to around 50km with its torpedoes (the range goes beyond lock range with javelin, but the damage drops drastically.)"
11/30/2013,"yea, be totally happy with a ship that a cost analysis has shown out performs bs and t3's for grinding sov as far as cost and dps goes, can fling wave after wave after wave of bombs with bomb code that frequently goes on the frittz and forgets its supposed to blow up the wrong bomb type and now we have people isboxing groups of bombers.sounds perfectly balanced to me. let me help, if the goon only uses one thing and one thing only to grind sov with, theres something broken about it, regardless of your 'opinion'"
11/30/2013,"fair comment. i should have said that i'm happy with respect to their torp ability, since that was the element of the op that caught my attention. my bad for not being clear there.i definitely believe that bombing should be dialled back a healthy notch, and i have given this feedback to ccp in several discussions revolving around fleet combat."
11/30/2013,sup bobi got that consignment of attention you said you needed.
11/30/2013,"erm... i compared bombers to a lot of things, but other frigates was not one. my only frigate comment was that it wouldn't make sense to make a t2 frigate hull take longer to train into, which is why i proposed the t2 weapon changes.my entire point is that i'd be fine with if they did some subset of what they do (and perhaps costed more), but they currently are too versatile and are too cheap of an isk+sp investment.great! perhaps you should consider my t2 bombs proposal!"
11/30/2013,what mining really needs is the elimination of static belts (ie - they were mined out a long time ago and should never respawn) and the introduction of scanning down minable asteroid clusters in each system.
11/30/2013,"your argument is proffered as the only way to look at the argument but let me propose another viewpoint. i spend almost all my time in high sec ( .8+) i can try and gank someone's snowflake rni but i'm unlikely to be successful simply owing to gaming mechanics in my chosen region of game play. i chose my area of eve to play in and understand and accept the consequences of that choice. where you play ganking the exact same snowflake is relative child's play ( assumes pure pve fit rni ) but your chance of losing implants is much higher. this implant issue is a downside of where you have chosen to play the game. i'm suggesting that like me you must accept the negative aspects of your choice to play where you play just as i doalso, i put in +5's as soon as possible and your contention that it in someway hinders me wanting to play couldn't be more wrong. what you r really saying is it doesn't benefit everyone so it should be removed or altered. if this is the new paradigm for eve's development then i have a very long list of things you won't be able to do soon because they don't benefit me.yawn, i'm right as usual. the predictability kinda gets boring really."
11/30/2013,"hello, this is my first attempt to raise an issue so let's see where it goes. with lack of any input in the f&i thread, i've decided to move it here. there have been a lot of quality of life improvements as of late, so i think the developers could spend a few minutes of their time on this issue. (i mean hey, we got new bubble effects. you can now precisely determine which sort of bubble you died in!)proposalat least crank up the blue tint on the covert cynosural field generator i icon, making it different from the cynosural field generator i one. kind of like warp scrambler and warp disruptor have.and why the balls would you do that?!currently, two modules: cynosural field generator i and covert cynosural field generator i share exactly the same icon on the ui (it's also used as the command processor i icon for some reason). their functionality, while similar (providing a jump-capable ship with a beacon to jump to) differs in major ways. for the unaware, i will list them. cynosural field generator i requires cft (cynosural field theory) at i, covert needs cft5 cynosural field generator i has a cycle time of 10 minutes (5 on a recon), covert variant has a cycle time of 60s (30s on a recon) cynosural field generator i consumes 250 lo at cft5 (50 on a recon), covert uses 25 (5 on a recon) to a normal cynosural field can jump/bridge: capital, supercapital, jump freighter, rorqual, black ops battleship. to a covert cynosural field can jump/bridge only a black ops cynosural field is a beacon that is seen by the entire system and anyone can warp to it. covert cynosural field is seen only on the grid it's present on. both render your ship immobile while cycling and prevent you from ejecting it's common that during sov wars recon ships (and variants of t3 cruisers) carry both cynosural field generators in their high slots - and very often, both are online (sometimes one is offlined due to fitting requirements or to prevent fatal mistakes). this allows for quick response if a scout comes across something caps should be unleashed upon.pilot skill at reading labels aside, it is excruciatingly dumb that a module that lights a beacon pretty much invisible to others share the icon with one that makes you a target for the whole system - in best case scenario, welding you in place for five minutes (second best case ten, worst case less because you're getting sent home in a pod. or via pod express.)i'm fully aware that there may be a ui redesign coming up, judging by presentations from the art team, but couldn't we at least get a placeholder? it would be a big quality of life thing for people addicted to cyno 5 usage.(as a disclaimer - no, i haven't actually lost anything to a mislit cyno myself or i'd link a lossmail for the crowd to laugh at. i've seen this little incident happen with comical results, as for five minutes nothing warped to the rapier that lit it despite full local. i did pack the wrong cyno with me once though - selected the wrong module from hangar, was stopped from lighting by insufficient amount of lo in hold.)"
11/30/2013,i agree. it's just like the issue with the ab/mwd's before the change to the mwd icon. simple change.
