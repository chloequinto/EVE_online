7/1/2009,"as long as there is a public name history i would be all for this.when i first started eve i figured i'd play it for three months and quit like i did with every other mmo, so i didn't put much thought into naming any of my characters. now that i'll probably play this game until they unplug it, i wish i could get one name change on my characters to better fit who they are and what they've become.so with the 'public name history' caveat, i support this."
7/1/2009,"assuming there's an aka, supported."
7/1/2009,"characters have a character id. when you block a player, the game adds its characterid in your block list, not the name. therefore, even if someone changes his name, he/she would still be blocked afterwards because the characterid didn't change.also, i seriously doubt that scammers would be willing to repetitively pay the 20$ fee (or whatever the rename fee would be) just to change their name everytime someone reports them for scamming.i would really want this myself, as long as changing someone's name has some restrictions. for example, you shouldn't be able to do it on the same character more than once every month or so (maybe even more). you would also have to be in a npc corp (just like character transfers, for the same reasons).this would especially be useful to all the newbies that didn't know they could use spaces and proper case in their character name, and have names like ""ipodalot666"".i really don't see any good reason why this shouldn't be possible for a fee."
7/1/2009,"i have not read through the whole thread, but one limitation to name changing i have considered suggesting would be that the name ""change"" would tie up a second character slot. rather than changing your name, you get to create a new character and permanently link the two character slots together. when you log in, you can use either character slot, and that's the name and portrait that you use during that session. the other name would show as part of the character info tab, and since all of the information is based off of the database id of your original character all standings and history would remain unchanged. biomassing either character slot would wipe out both.essentially rather than an actual name change you would be paying ""concord"" for an official alias / ""doing business as"" name.i would use this service, even with the penalty i suggest. in fact i would prefer it over just a name change in some ways, as i would be able to fly in combat with a callsign and rp with a regular name."

7/1/2009,would be nice not to have to escalate something just to get it read
7/1/2009,"not sure here. i think they need to have access to the same tools to answer the petition (by answer i mean fixing whatever we write in it). well to get a faster response and accurate response and ""fair"" one i would say yes."
7/1/2009,"right there is your problem.the gm's get way to many petitions that are total rubbish. assuming by ""few months"" you mean 3, lets take you as the ""average"" with more than 200k accounts in eve averaging 4 petitions every 3 months. that means they recieve just under 8,900 petitions a day.i think the real ""solution"" is people should stop petitioning for all the stupid stuff, learn to write short concise non whining petitions, and not fill their petitions full of emonerdrage and self entitlement. no idea if yours are like that, but i have seen plenty of examples that are from many another pod pilot.for the record, in 3.5years of playing eve, i have only made 2 petitions. not counting the numerous isk spammers petitions i have made, but those dont really count, since they are meant to be skimmed.tl:drno"
7/1/2009,"thanks for assuming they were all rubbish. prior to the last few months, last one i sent was nearly a year ago. i don't petition every ship i lose or every little thing that happens. i petition things that are screwed.my latest petition is the old 'i'm warping, no i'm not, oh, i'm warping again, great! no, wait ... no i'm back at my starting position again. no! i'm warping! yay, gre ... wait, no.'also, you'll note in my post that i stated that i think they create a mass of the problem themselves. both my very recent ones weren't read at all. i think the gm saw a keyword there and just went to his bank of 'cut&paste' responses. it had nothing to do with what i was petitioning about.you're fine with that, mate?"
7/1/2009,"i liked his emonerdrage comment, very funny.maybe ccp could delegate some of the petition load to the isd volenteers or maybe they should consider hiring more gm's if the current amount is overwhelmed.but people petitioning for stupid stuff doesn't help the matter (not saying your petitions were about stupid stuff franga)."
7/1/2009,"this ^^i dont know if idea about a special skill, is the correct solution. but something definately needs to be done to address this.everyone should be able to loose their ship, when they undock.also everything else in eve needs player interaction, afk cloackers can sit 23 hours a day in a system, without risking their ship.and the worst part is you cant kill a cloacker, if he wont decloack. not even if you had a thousand players in system, camping, probing and flying all over the place. with every ship, module and item available in game. how is this fair or balanced?"

7/1/2009,"sorry but this is just bull. neither a single sb nor a recon can kill a lot on their own. even decloaked, those ships also have huge disadvantages over non-cloakers. a black ops may be dangerous but heh, so can any other bs with a cloak fitted, sitting in a safespot.psychological warfare (as in: making you too afraid to undock) is a tactic, not a weapon. there are easy counters to this, beginning with ""don't fly alone"". and yes, this is fair as there are many situations in eve where there's no solo counter to something."
7/1/2009,"getting tired of being ganked by our stealth bombers? the downside to stealth bombers is *drumroll* they're frigates. use correct drones, and you won't get ganked."
7/1/2009,"not supported, totally would mess up the stealth bomber after it just got fixed."
7/1/2009,totally support fuel for cloaks. maybe one day ccp will realize having 2 day old scouts perma logged in every system is a stupid thing.
7/1/2009,not supported
7/1/2009,"not supported, i would rather see cap or fuel usage per cycle or something.. probably cap as that feels more balanced, but to help counter the bigger ships with cloaks on i would think that the cap usage is relative to the size of the ships radius.e.g. a covert op gets bonus so uses almost no cap, a battleship has big sig radius so to cloak it means the cloak has to work harder and use more cap."
7/1/2009,no support. cloaking is an important game mechanic and works well as it is. making it possible to scan for cloaked ships is the wrong way to go about it.titan pilots need a way of going afk (e.g to sleep) without the risk of it being probed and destroyed while the pilot is away and unable to fight back.if you're worried about one sb disrupting a whole system then you need more buddies in system with anti-sb ships.

7/1/2009,"i agree that there should be some repercussions for leaving drones behind, however, i personally have no intention of purposely leaving them in a fight or mission. however, i'm also stating that there needs to be repercussions on the other side of that argument as well. for example, jettison cans. if someone were to take loot out of your can, they would be flagged and you'd have kill rights for x amount of time due to them ""stealing"" your items - i share the same logic for drones: if someone steals your drones within y amount of time of being left, they should be flagged for x amount of time ( y amount of time being a time period before drones are completely free game).for reasons of possible exploits on gates and other high sec areas, i disagree with drones going awol .. lol."

7/1/2009,"supported, but with one change:if drones can be recalled from far space, or remain connected when the players leaves the general area, then the npc enemies and rats should still shoot at and destroy the drones even without the player present. if this was not made the case, then a player could drop drones in missions, and let me take out rats as the player warped in and out to observe and refresh the connection timeout proposed (a lot of effort to cheat, but still sounds like cheating to me)."

7/1/2009,"agreed.re: the intel issue, i don't see how that should have any bearing on this. everyone else in the fight is revealed, the logistics guys should be too. if you don't want to show up on a killmail, then don't do anything."

7/1/2009,if i may comment in defense of my suggestion.a player with only 1 account that has trained up a roqual has already demonstrated a exceptionally high tolerance of boredom already. they are not the most exciting ship to fly as they stand at the moment anyway.
7/1/2009,"as true as that might be, its not the ideal situation. also, you have to keep in mind is what happens to the rorqual pilot when he gets attacked? with a 30min cycle, he'll be screwed if a fleet shows up. its pretty much way too much expense and time sinks for very little reward. --isaac"
7/1/2009,"i like the intent, but the method is just way too dangerous, no one would do it."
7/1/2009,i like the idea of distrupting enemy harvesting operation. not sure though if the moon minerals would be really worth it though.
7/1/2009,"you know that deathstars can lock and shoot anything on the grid, right? that said, nobody in their right mind is going to park a capship next to a hostile pos in industrial mode and wait for a gang to show up and obliterate it.member of former gbc entity loses r64-rich space, immediately proposes methods of making r64s less secure. news at 11.()"
7/1/2009,the stealing part is a good idea. but i dont think multiple rorq's all mining on the same r64 is a good idea. imagine a fleet of 20 rorq's all on a single 64 moon with increased yield.
7/1/2009,you can park your rorq on the other side of the planet.
7/1/2009,"i've always seen bo and sb's very much in the mould of ships able to use stealth or superior movement/logistics to pick vulnerable targets and then destroy them before an enemy can counterattack.as it stands most bo are rather lacklustre compared to ther t1 counterparts when we start comparing damage outputs and considering the isk invested.i propose blackops are allowed to fit bomb launchers, with damage boni to all damage types and an increased range to bomb deployment to bring it in line with the ranges used with close range turrets (~20-40 km)."
7/1/2009,"humm... i don't really see why not. it's kind of the big brother of the stealth bomber in a way, it should have a way to deal more damage."

7/1/2009,recons are the big brother of the stealthbomber and recons can't.
7/1/2009,1. you cant warp in cloaked.2. you need to be aligned towards your target3. you fire your bomb.4. the heavy tackle that survived will get a point on you5. you need a new blackops.doesnt sound too logical to me.
7/1/2009,"you don't think the alpha from a bomb, when used with a bo hotdrop, will increase the likelihood of item 5 not occurring?to an above poster:'recons cant launch bombs' seems a rather strange justification for not allowing bo to use them given the disparity in roles between recons and bo."
7/1/2009,"no, i dont think it will save you from it. some heavy tackle or some ceptor who was buzzing a bit off will survive and happily hold you on the field while the rest will melt you.stealthbomber fill that role better.edit: horrible forum :("

7/1/2009,i agree.

7/1/2009,"i definitely agree that the requirements for the covetor need to be reviewed. at present, the covetor's only real purpose is an invention seed for hulks."
7/1/2009,"since the mining barge skill is also the way to the orca, i support this change.it would reasonably branch the tree between those who skill for a hulk and those who skill for an orca and it would make the covetor viable."
7/1/2009,"since a hulk only requires about 2-3 days more training then a covetor, and the hulk is supposed to be the absolute best, i support this.makes sense and sounds fair."

7/1/2009,"the way armor repairers and shield boosters work is just wierd imo.waiting for the whole cycle to complete makes no sense.while an armor repairer/shield booster is repairing the ship, it is working and repairing during the whole time it is on, so why we must wait until the last second to get a boost all of a sudden?my proposal is: change the repairing system so that the repair process is distributed during the whole time that a module is on.i hope my english allow me to be understood."
7/1/2009,why
7/1/2009,would increase lag alot since the server would have to calculate a boost for your ship every 0.1 second or whatever.bad idea.
7/1/2009,"wrong, it would be just like how the capacitor recharge itself."
7/1/2009,1 point to you since i believe calculation would be made per .1 second or so compared to 4-5 or so seconds.. or whatever recharge time you got.the data still has to be sent to you
7/1/2009,"or passive shield tanks, right?"
7/1/2009,"why not just let ccp decide if this would affect lag or not? truth is, nobody really knows how this would work, so stop making assumptions.i support this feature."
7/1/2009,"lag is always a valid argument, however, in this case i believe its a moot point. i think repair modules are just fine right now.--isaac"
7/1/2009,"i wouldnt realy want this to happen, unless it repaired alot of armour then it would kill armour tanking. however i would like somthing similer done to the regenerative plates, rather then them just adding a armour percentage, maby adding somthing similar for medium slots and rigs so that a armour tanker could be fitted like drake.edit: shield already have somthing like that, their called shield rechargers and shield power relays."
7/1/2009,"no, you are wrong, you are talking about the natural recharge rate of shields; that is fine and it is not what i'm talking about.i'm talking about how repair modules, for both armor and shiels, should work: it makes no sense to me that you get a boost all of a sudden, repairers are working the whole time you turn them on, so the repair amount should be slowly given during the whole process, as long as they are on.and please stop talking about lag, nobody know if this will have any impact on lag or not, so just say if you like the idea or not."
7/1/2009,hmm no? current system is fine except active tanking sucks compared to monster buffer?
7/1/2009,"and why not?your sentence looks like a paradox to me: if active tank sux so much, why don't agree with op idea so to balance things a bit?"
7/1/2009,the problem with active tanking in pvp has nothing to do with the issues being discussed in this thread.not supported. tanking is currently set up to be as lag-free as possible. anything that causes more possibility of lag is a bad idea.
7/1/2009,"yet another proposal without understanding the problem. the problem with active tanking right now has nothing at all to do with how often the shields or armor reppers cycle.the problem with active tanking is that ever since nos was nerfed, everyone and their grandmother fits racks of neuts. not to mention the amount of ships that a player will find himself up against in modern eve is a lot more than what the same player would have come up against when the modules were last modified.when shield boosters and armor reps last saw any changes, the typical fight was 1v1 or 1v3-4. i'm not saying blobs didn't exist three years ago, but they were a lot less prevalent. the amount boosted per cycle would have to receive a boost to keep things on par, but i'm not sure that ccp is even interested in keeping things on par so i wouldn't look for any active tanking boosts anytime soon."
7/1/2009,i support this very much. it should have been a no-brainer on the part of the dev team when they developed this window.
7/1/2009,"i agree. granted i don't have the problem the op has but i can see where it would be an issue.if there is a general ""improve the ui"" topic, perhaps this could get rolled up into it instead of pushing for a specific change? it might get pushed through to the csm faster in that case."
7/1/2009,"before i post the idea, please respect the idea even if you don't like it, and if you know how suggest improvements, i tried hard to think this out.well bombs were created for the purpose of breaking up blobs. they are damage based, and the bombs that are not aren't very effective anyway, i think the system needs a new start to make them an effective anti-blob tool while not making them overpowered.firstly the idea is to make bombs a threat to blobs while not killing them but still being effective. all the current bombs would be removed for a single bomb, the name i thought of was ""random disruption particle bomb"". the info would be like:so as you can see the bomb would leave these disrupting particles in a 15km zone for 10 minutes, now blobs would not want to be blobbed as the effects could be devastating. the bombs would generate a random negative effect, not like so random to be useless but their severity and what the effects would depend on the pilot's skill level in bomb usage.some ideas for bomb effects were:-cannot use certain modules, like target painters remote reps(obviously would require a high level as that effect could be very overpowered)-increased signature radius-capacitor recharge rate reduction-drone control range reductionthese effects may not seem huge, but certainly you would not want to sit in a field where you couldn't remote rep. plus even like 7 weak effects (meaning 7 bombs launched at a blob) would mean 7 new weaknesses you'd have, so the blob would want to move thus breaking it up. the random effect portion may make the idea seem horrible, but if the effects are decent then it keeps people from like super focusing the effects to do things like making gate camping impossible.the random part is a bit iffy to me but if done right i think the bombs could become an effective tool against blobs. the effects are mild and short term enough to separate a blob, but not enough to make any form of camping impossible.any critique on the plan would be extremely useful, and i am going to continue to refine it to make it good enough for implementation."
7/1/2009,"i would like to see this bomb in addition to current ones, this would be very interesting against fleets guarding stationary positions and camping. i would prefer to keep current bombs as they are still interesting utility tool, even though they are used rairly.i would likke to see this in action, should be funny. how about a bomb that causes damage over time in the area for the duration of 15 minuts?"
7/1/2009,"i think the current range of bombs actually does most of the things you are suggesting when used correctly.a steady succession of lockbreaker bombs mean remote reps, target painters and weapons are much reduced in effectiveness.void bombs negate cap so a recharge bomb is in a sense just a duplication.damage bombs essentially wipe out drone swarms, and further to that are an effective means of breaking blobs in themselves when used in a coordinated gang.all in all i think the range of bombs available is fine.not supported.zos"
7/1/2009,"the basic concept is good but its not perfect. basicly u ask for more bomb types. witch is good. maybe we can use bombs that trow 15km radius bubbles. this because its not hard to implement (same as dictor bubbles). but now we have 6 ""bubble"" bombs. each bomb has its own bubble colour, blue, red, green, yellow, purple and blackeach bomb has its own effect:blue, stands for + 30% sig radius within 15km bubblered, stands for - 30% velosity within bubblegreen, stands for - 30% tracking within bubbleyellow, stands for - 30% agility within bubblepurple, stand for - 30% cap recharge rate within bubbleblack, stands +1 warp stenght within bubblethe black bubble eccect bubble will give everyone in the bubble a +1 warpstrenght. this means that people that are pointed with a disrupter can warp off but the onece that are scrambled can not. this requiers alot of skill if it will be used. buybbles have a duration time of 1 min to not make them too powerfull. each bubble have stacking penalties, this means that 1 bubble has only 1 effect and it cant be stacked."
7/1/2009,"seems interesting to get another bomb in the field but this one could have an effect that the fc dont want or the people in fleet dont want. how about a bomb that decrease the scan res of all ships in a 15km radius. imagine this. your in a fleet on a gate camping it and you got 20 people there. imagine the effect of a bomb of that type. scan res decreased at a point with makes the inty takes something like 30 seconds to lock. that would not destroy gatecamp since other countermeasures exist for this but are not the greatest like the fof for example.you could say thats why the lockbreaker exist but thats a jamming ""tool"" that is impossible to counter with ...even with eccm cause its chance based.in other words, your idea needs work since i don't see the benefits or the point with yours."
7/1/2009,"also a very good idea, but how can u be sure what the area of effect is and for how long?your need to be able to see your effect"
7/1/2009,area of effect could be the same as any other bomb to give it a fair use but the for the length... i let ccp decide on this. if you ask me for an idea on this i would say 30 seconds (based on an inty scan res of course)of effect for each ship in a 50km radius. the more ships on a gate the longer the effect will last.in the end if bombs will be more avail and cheaper then one of the outcome would be that gatecamp would either decrease in numbers or size
7/1/2009,"i don't support this. people in general don't like randomness, which is why there are different types of bombs at the moment."
7/1/2009,"i like this a lot, plus one minute keeps them from just being destroyed, but one minute is a short effects for a 1m per shot weapon."
7/1/2009,"when new players join the game, they're quite unaware of the long term consequences of killing those blood raiders or guristas in empire missions. by the time they're ready to venture out into 0.0, they have -7 or worse standings and are totally hosed.i propose two changes:1) install data centers for the various pirate factions.2) allow all data center agents to be a repeatable mission, with say a one month timer.being able to switch allegiances with various factions at will, with a good bit of effort and expense, is in line with the sandbox concept."
7/1/2009,"im very sorry about this but it took me a while to understand what you meant with your proposal. so let me clear this up (perhaps to people who went : wha wtf??): you target an asteroidonce acquired, you point your ""laser"" at the surface of the rock and mine.if theres nothing more to ""drill"" or mine at that specific surface you point it elsewhere on the same rock until the rock is no moreif thats the case, that whould definitly cease the passive nature of mining. one reason is you can't go look at a movie and mine at the same time or do something else in your house or worst, at work. some people mine cause there at work and pvp is not an option cause it requires too much attention. besides these ""negative"" point, i feel your proposal is a bit better...true. i support it."
7/1/2009,"not supported, one word,... macro"
7/1/2009,"make the roid overload your ship or modules in a way they would take damage if its used too extensively only in high sec. this way the modules will take damage no matter what and you would need to stop your mining, go to a station and repair your modules and ship. for low sec and zero, not damage taken since risk(people that kill miners for fun) it there to greet them.that would discourage (or hope that kills) macro once and for all. this seems logical since the overload (taking damage to a module) system is there anyway. make use of it then. just a minor adjustment if you ask me."
7/1/2009,"you got it somewhat right. essentially a rock can be broken down into what would probably be 5 layers max. each layer would be divided into sections. better skills make the rock divide into more layers and more sections in those layers. now a lower skilled person who mines a section that a better skilled player only mined part of just recieves a fraction of the ores depending on what they other guy leaves. sections of the rock themselves can vary in size due to the consistency of the rock. better skills allow more selectivity and faster mining options. as for targeting the only difference would be the direct use of a scanner to select targets rather than free targeting and overview targeting like we currently do.so you scan, see a picture like the one above, select a section, mine and the image updates as the rock deteriorates.i would expect any given asteroid belts to have maybe 10-12 of these kinda rocks per system with a system dedicated to mining having much more massive rocks an more spread out areas. one more thing, assembly hall is about supporting ideas, even if you don't think they're possible. so while you might not think the devs can pull it off, if you like the proposition, it's in your best interest to support it anyways to help fuel further ideas for them."
7/1/2009,"not really since you have to ""select"" the area of the rock constantly to get the minerals. this looks like an active mining system from what i understand."
7/1/2009,how do you macro something that takes intuition?
7/1/2009,nice idea.i'd like to see rewards such as increased yield for skilled players.
7/1/2009,"not suported. this would break too many things people are currently used to. it's just too big of a change this late in the game.it's well thought out, but just too late, and too complicated for most players at the moment.there's got to be other ways to make mining more interesting other than by inventing a whole different system such as this."
7/1/2009,"you got a choice here. either what the op proposed which makes more sense to me. or a minigame like connect4 type of thing. you know, align 4 objects and score points lmao"
7/1/2009,"just so you know, every other system in the game has had complete redesigns and massive changes within the last few patches, so your argument here really falls short.scanning used to be about dropping non-overlapping probes all over the system and spamming the scan button every 5 minutes on the off chance that a site might be out there somewhere. now it's a minigame where you can visually move your probes around and actually see what your scanning for and get feedback on how close you are to finding it.pvp used to be all about being the fastest. the fastest ships and the fastest gangs either won fights, or didn't have to fight due to their ability to get away. with the need for speed changes, pvp has been completely revamped into dps vs hitpoint buffertanks game where one side blasts away at the other and hopes that their dps can overcome their opponents buffer before their own buffer is depleted.invention. 'nuff said.a huge change to mining that is more interactive and less passive is just what mining needs. i'm not exactly a fan of what has been proposed in this post, but there are some very good ideas floating around out there to change mining into a more interactive process."
7/1/2009,"ontop of a fresh new way to mine, i think it would help lower the amount of macro miners in eve simply because programing a macro to mine roids that aren't the same in make up would be difficult, as it is right now a macro just warps into a belt and starts mining.with this active mining system it would be alot harder to have a program do it for you and it would defintely make mining more interesting.supported"
7/1/2009,fully supported it would be an utter travesty if the people who have been propping up the floundering beast that is fw weren't recognised for their efforts.
7/1/2009,support
7/1/2009,"whenever bounties, loyalty points and/or salvage are adjusted or changed in any way, there is never a retroactive adjustment. such retroactive adjustments would be utterly gamebreaking. it is meant to increase attractivity of faction warfare, not to feed a flood of benefits to those who have already done it. especially not to those who have stopped doing so."
7/1/2009,"sorry, no. there is a lot i would support to make fw better but not retroactive rewards. you guys knew that there was nothing in it and yet you spent time and effort on fw. i admire that but please take into account that eve is also an economy. some people would have participated in fw if they could have afforded the ships (or could get rich in the process). you can't invalidate their decision right now by screwing with what is essentially the past.i would expect some kind of bonus for you guys for your militia rank but not a game-breaking fortune."
7/1/2009,"that, you knew what you could expect when you joined fw."
7/1/2009,supported
7/1/2009,noi dont want eve to become a happy retroactive place.
7/1/2009,retroactive rewards? are you out of your mind?i spend more than a year grinding missions for the blood raiders before loyalty points were introduced. do you think i or any other person who had been running missions suddenly got a huge bucket of loyalty points for all our previous work? no we got jack.what a pathetic egocentric proposal to make.
7/1/2009,like totally supported and stuff.
7/1/2009,"definatly not looking for a fortune. heck, i doubt for me it would even mean more than 50k lp if it was completely maxed out. rank based is cool. we know ccp has kept records of everybodies ranks. if i were to sign back up, i would be the same rank now as when i left. it would be easy enough to give x amount of lp per rank, and i think everybody would be very happy with it.kills, the only kill info that is kept are the final blows. yes, i am on several hundred kill mails, but due to the ships i fly i am only on a handfull of final blows, thus receiving the km. it is only those who get the km who will likely get lp (something i think ccp needs to be carefull of abuse on), and that lp will likely be small compared to the plexing rewards, i would guess based on ship hull size - 5 lp for a frig, 20 for a cruiser, 50 for a bs, etc. something that can add up, but hey, run a single level 1 mission and you get more lp's. so, no, none of this should or would be ground breaking. i can probably get more lp running a couple of level 4's in an hour than i would with this, so would most people. it might bring some folks back to fw if they now have 30-40k lp and want the faction navy mega, which needs 200k...."
7/1/2009,this. and any militia rank bonus is the same bonus anyone else gets for their militia rank.
7/1/2009,"this is one of the most balanced ships in the entire game, not to mention also one of the most versatile.there's absolutely no reason this ship needs 7 turrets.instead, why not focus on the real issue, which is projectile turrets. if anything in the minmatar arsenal has some shortcomings, its turrets... but certainly not the hurricane."
7/1/2009,"that, and a standard t2 fit brutix does 860 dps with ~50k ehp."
7/1/2009,"itt: whiner demands ridiculously unnecessary buff.your arguments have been based on a hurricane not putting out good dps in its falloff, as compared to a brutix at optimal. try flying a blaster boat, then complain about your damn falloff :)"
7/1/2009,"it doesn't have seven turrets, but surprise surprise, in addition to it's six guns, it can also fit a whopping two missile launchers for a grand total of eight weapons. now, i don't see your other tier 2 battlecruisers pull that stunt, right?"
7/1/2009,not supported. your cane does also 662 dps even with 220mm/ham and 55k ehp.
7/1/2009,hurricane is not in need of love. projectiles are.
7/1/2009,"i'm sorry, what? cane is fine as it is. it may be outdamaged by the brutix, but it can put range on the thing and kill it without hitting blaster range.can't comment on the harby, and i just avoid the drake in most situations.not supported. op evidently doesn't fly a cane'"
7/1/2009,"give the cane 7 turret slots or fix projectiles...if i had to choose between the two, i'd have the latter."
7/1/2009,"love the hurricane as it is thanks. probably one of the best balanced minnie ships, very versatile, fun to fly.i agree with other posters that projectile turrets are probably where any balance ""tweaking"" should take place.not supported."
7/1/2009,"tbh hurricane is very balanced, and is in fact probably the best tier 2 bc. no other bc can have excellent dps while fitting 2 medium neuts in its utility slots."
7/1/2009,"cane has no utility slots, fitting neuts means you do less dps. you can fit neuts in harbingers, drakes whatever as well. adding extra turret wouldn<U+FFFD>t really boost cane that much for close range [60 dps gain with 4 gyros], it would simply make it better long range boat than it is now.heavy pulse ii with an multi 91 dps (4 heat sinks)425mm autocannon ii with rf emp 100 dps (4 gyros)63 dps advantage to hurricane, however medium drone set of harbinger vs hurricanes 4 light / 1 med set puts it to 16 dps difference all-together."
7/1/2009,hurricane is fine.
7/1/2009,the hurricane is perfectly fine. no support.
7/1/2009,"supported ... hard to tell the dif between:cruiser <--> hac <--> logistics <--> bc <--> cmd ship, etc ... plus, being a column you can choose in the overview, if you dont want/need it ... dont check it."
7/1/2009,"eve has a learning curve for a reason. good pilots put some effort into learning each ship and what it is capable of. additionally, knowing the class doesn't really help with gaining any understanding of it's capabilities vs. the ship or fleet you are in, it is the ship itself you need to learn and it's potential fit that are important since capabilities vary significantly even within class.i don't see a need to spend any dev time at all on a small change such as this.not supported."
7/1/2009,"it's small changes that make game better.learning curve should imply gameplay and tacktiks, and if you noticed developers are trying to reduce the curve, it is a nightmare for a new pilot that is trying to do pvp to remember several hundred ship names by heart, and you cannot afford to go ""showinfo"" on every ship you encounter because by the time you figure out what ship it is, it either runs or takles you."
7/1/2009,"i think you're completely missing the point. eve is not only for the elitist such as you. casual players also play this game, and if something like this could help that learning curve, then so be it."
7/1/2009,"even if this were to be implemented, you only know a little bit more, not enough to make any difference. so instead of a bc/cruiser hull and a zealot, you know its a hac and a zealot. new players still don't know what the hell a zealot is capable of and have to search it up anyway for its stats as to get a good understanding of its capabilities."
7/1/2009,"i do, and so do most competent pilots i know. it's not that hard."
7/1/2009,"not needed for you maybe, but there's a ton of casual players who could really use this."
7/1/2009,pretty useful imho
7/1/2009,deletedthis forum software is a constant source of frustration and lousy errors.
7/1/2009,message i got when replying here ?????time flux detectedyou are going too fast! wait a minute and try again.then yes
7/1/2009,"so 450 dps from drones alone is not enough if you factor in that you can still fit bonused blasters/rails? (just tried 3x dual 150 ii, cn am, 1 mfs ii just 600dps)you live in a strange world.a cerberus e.g. gets just 394dps (hml ii, 3x bcs ii) with perfect skills and cn scourge, 440dps with scourge fury. so you out-dps it just with drones and can still add dps from turrets.that said you didnt really complain about too few dps on an ishtar right?edit typos"
7/1/2009,please visit your user settings to re-enable images.
7/1/2009,"this is why people should not use eft. that 450dps came from using gardeiis... your cerberus will just stay at 50km and shoot that 0dps ishtar to ashes in no minute. on the other hand eft only shows theoretical maximum dps, which never meets real dps. why didn't you try ogreiis, as it will give 475dps with all support skills at lv5, and that means (according to your logic) most frigs dying in a matter of a second, am i right? the thing about this discussion is, that it's not a really a whine about dps, but a pointing out some illogical bonus structure. people should never use eft. or at least not before spending a few years ingame."
7/1/2009,i prefer the gank nature of said ships.
7/1/2009,"his whole point was that his *drones* are not strong enough. if you now bring on resistances, sig radius and speed and all the other factors that count in for effective dps. they apply quite similar to each weapon type.imho the ishtar bonuses are fine. if you use medium hybrids you get rewarded if not you still got a very decent base dps. do we want to talk about the cerb pilot having to switch to unbonused ammo?and about the 0dps ishtar. ... he can happily warp out and laugh at the cerberus pilot. or switch to mediums and **** it, if the cerb doesnt warp out. if each of them brings a mate for tackling, they get rewarded for another important aspect of eve. teamplay."
7/1/2009,ccp's stance on plexes are that they are in-game items and shall be treated as such.
7/1/2009,ok it seems i am alone on this issue - therefore i withdraw the proposal.greetings belmarduk
7/1/2009,supported.but to make it work properly there would need to be full client side lip sync with the model animations? at which point you may be looking at a complete off line scriptable client anyway?
7/1/2009,"[x] the ninja salvager should be aggro'd to the mission runner after the first wreck is salvaged, because the mission runner owns the wrecks, and i feel that ccp needs to change the current dynamic."
7/1/2009,"don't expect a change, ccp are icelandic, descended from vikings for whom theft was a way of life. that's probably why they choose to see wrecks as not belonging to anyone. ironically they didn't see things that way about cod in the 70's;)"
7/1/2009,bump...
7/2/2009,"and an 80% base thermal resistance doesn't make it op? admittedly, 1-2 tps would've been better than the extra webs, but i wanted it to be somewhat realistic- if i was actually expected to hold a harpy down in my 100m/s dominix, i'd need some damn good tackle. not to mention, web/scrams do help small drones hit, as they slow down the target & ultimately increase the drones' rof since they no longer need to chase."
7/2/2009,"if you are worried about your drones missing, use warriors, they have much better tracking and are faster than hobgoblins and explosive is one of the harpy's weaker resists. also, if 80% thermal makes the harpy overpowered, you would agree that t2 frigates, cruisers and battlecruisers are all overpowered then? nearly all of them have quite high base resists."
7/2/2009,"warriors also put out a significant amount less dps- especially when comparing the t2 drones- however that's not my argument. as far as overpowered ships, t2 cruisers + bcs are infinitely easier to lock down than frigates- scram, web, and they're fish in a barrel. frigates on the other hand generally require at least 2 webs to be fully tackled by anything cruiser+. hence, i think afs are overpowered if anything- not underpowered. as for other t2 ships, i think they're for the most part fine as is, aside from build costs."
7/2/2009,"so the harpy is overpowered, but the eagle, with exactly the same base resists, the same 3 bonuses, plus a 4th bonus for 5% shield resists per level, isn't?"

7/2/2009,"i agree with the above. besides that i support destroyer changes, i hated getting killed by anything bigger then a frigate, the ship(my thrasher) had very low versatility. not to mention you dont get the full affect out of mwd's since destroyers arent frigates."
7/2/2009,"agreed, destroyers are pretty worthless as anything other than l1 mission runners and salvaging boats.as others have said, there's no reason for the rof penalty to exist (destroyers are the only ship with an innate hull penalty, right?), the sig radius is slightly too high, and the hull optimal bonus, while useful for some fits, is particularly unfair for the catalyst which in most other respects seems to be designed as a blaster platform.i'd suggest dropping the universal 50% turret optimal hull bonus for a 50% tracking hull bonus, and dropping all the tracking speed destroyer skill bonuses for alternatives more tailored to the individual ship. i'd also consider upping the base velocities slightly - as these ships would no longer be designed as extreme range frigate-snipers they'd need some other way of keeping their targets in range.as a personal thing, i'd like to see the catalyst reconfigured into a droneboat too but that's just me."
7/2/2009,"if people already take the time to keep track of charachter exchanges in forums, then what's a few extra clicks before important deals to see previous names? seems rather easy in comparison, unless maybe you need to do it on a large number of people.might be a point in making the information about previous names as easily accessable as possible.for example:you would have your new name on overviews, channels, local etc, but if someone clicks ""show info"" on you the list of previous names is visible in smaller text directly under your name right there on the fron page. only one click required that way. a namechange cooldown of, say 6 months, should help in keeping that list short.i think the estetic value of more people around us having decent names should outweigh whatever inconveniance this may cause."
7/2/2009,"yup. don't see a problem here. all the agruements that have been raised against this are basically: ""oh no, i've gotten so used to the 'tools' available for me to make assumptions about people that i don't want this"". in other words: moot./support"
7/2/2009,the csm already brought this to ccp and they said it was not going to be done. why do you keep bringing it up?
7/2/2009,an excellent idea. the fw setup used at the current time is lacking. too many situations exist that need adjustment in fw.
7/2/2009,"agreed....to an extent. while i would love to see further development in items acquired from npcs (as in very few items - t1 bpcs and skill books only, perhaps), this idea does need some work. instead of npc drugs (which could be used in t2 boosters), how about other trade goods? the possibilities are wide open, but you have a good start."
7/2/2009,approve... minus the corpse bit... that's just morbid and i can already hear the up-in-arms rioting of parents when a game encourages players to use parts of dead bodies to help improve your character's attributes.maybe use salvage instead.
7/2/2009,"i start to wonder why we actually have lp stores if all the lp items are just going to be sourced from other places instead. faction weapon spec skillbooks were good in lp stores, and then got seeded on market. now you want to do that with implants as well? the only thing left will be faction loot, and faction loot tends to be crap because it's limited by tags, and nobody collects tags because you have to lose access to half of empire permanently to get tags in quantity. the current system is fine. i'm all for player industry, but this just seems like an attempt to extend it for the sake of extending it."
7/2/2009,"ccp had promised implants production from the midas expansion (the fabled industry expansion), later it was shelved with most of that expansion.some of your suggestion are interesting (even if i feel herschel has pointed a real problem) but this need to be implemented carefully. this could end with caldari getting missile, railguns and shield related hardwiring and gallente only getting blaster hardwiring. then there is the fact that no lp store sell bpo. they only sell bpc. giving them the opportunity to sell a unlimited number run and copyable bp make the reward almost useless in a short timespan. if you add the absurd number of lp necessary to get a bpo from the lp store and you will see that we risk some serious repercussion on the market. btw: there are already several t2 hardwiring. look those requiring cybernetics v."
7/2/2009,i like this it would also decrease the cost of the implants i'm sure. i get tired of paying tens/hundreds of millions just for the basic attribute implants.
7/2/2009,"you're not a very old player, are you? two years ago they cost about 3x what they do now."
7/2/2009,while i like the idea of being able to manufacture implants i do not see the reason why to use existing resources for their production. those resources are already in use somewhere else so let them stay there.instead it should be some completely new resources and methods for gathering and production that should be needed to produce implants.
7/2/2009,not a bad idea
7/2/2009,"supported because eve is a dark, cold world. if you're dumb enough to get yourself podded, you deserve to get laughed at :)"
7/2/2009,"yes, please!"
7/2/2009,"it does seem the procedures have some holes.for example there is no communication channel between gms and devs it seems.you are unable to work through an issue with a gm, compile all the information, then escalate to the devs.instead you have to start from square one again with a bug report.little inefficiencies like this may well be eating a lot of time, tho i'm sure ccp has the numbers to see bottlenecks."
7/2/2009,"this goes back into my original post. there are so many petitions that ccp outsourced some of the gm duties to a 3rd party vendor in germany. they most likely did this since it would provide a built in on demand scaleability.if ccp were to hire enough gm's to allow ever petition to be read throughly with an individualized response written for each one, ccp wouldnt have enough payroll budget left to staff much of anything else."
7/2/2009,"any company that writes individualized responses for petitions of the type that ccp gets is barking mad. cutting and pasting is the only sane way to deal with floods of identical issues. just because they sent back copypasta doesn't mean that they didn't read your petition - i am not cruel enough to tell gms that they have to spend all their time typing and retyping all the same pleasantries for 40 hours a week, until their brains melt and they find a better job. that said, the process could use some improvements."
7/2/2009,"yeah, i'm not saying i have anything against the copy-pasta, i have something against a copy-pasta that has nothing to do with my petition. ie: they haven't read it.a corp mate of mine had a copy-pasta petition response to his ship being blown up while docked and all the fittings dropping. including the rigs!but apparently everything was okay and the policies regarding reimbursement are strict and need to be adhered to."

7/2/2009,"thank you for your support. needs some more, i'm afraid, in order to attract the attention of the powers that be, though. let me address some of the comments i've heard:the extra stress will be small, both in absolute and in relative terms. almost any conceivable additional feature (rig sizes? loyalty point bounties?) will add at least a comparable amount of strain.that's like saying a marketing campaign for a new product = fail because it didn't speak well for your confidence in your product. it adds a tiny bit of weight to my message and hardly cramps my style (certainly less than for those csm candidates who voted for themselves ;) ), so it is well worth it.corp and alliance logos are loaded once and then stored locally on the client. they would naturally load only at very low priority, and shouldn't cause much lag as they are not sent from the node and your own internet bandwidth should not be a lag issue anyway.odd, that. my eve was never military-themed. corporate and dark sci-fi, yes, but military? hardly.besides that, whether corporate or military, uniforms, logos and colours are all considered very important."

7/2/2009,ccp recently stated it was 50/50 old/new code.i'd prefer 80/20 with expansions not being marketing exercises that are promptly forgotten after release.
7/2/2009,"i think people tend to notice minor bug fixes and they enjoy them as well - they just don't go to the forum and state that they do.and while it is true that you rarely get positive feedback (not just on bug fixes, on anything - people are eager to complain and reluctant to praise), they stop to complain about that specific part (and probably start to complain about something else)i think some people would disagree on the ""they just fixed scanning"" part.well i guess it's all open for debate, but adjusting a bonus or a fitting requirement is not exactly what i call a bug fix. imo that's mere tweaking parameters. making sure that ""dock"" warps to the selected station and actually docks 100% of the time, is a ""real"" bug fix for me.(but that may be splitting hairs )however given the current rate of introducing new bugs with new features i think the 50/50 approach is not sufficient.imo this leads toa) too many new features depending on buggy/unstable/unbalanced parts of the game - making them buggy/unstable/unbalanced as wellb) increasing the feature base faster than it can be maintained (a new feature is ""old"" after the release it is shipped with, wanting to be maintained)c) spending most of the bug fixing time on the bugs of the newest features, because those bugs are the most annoying and of course no one wants to make it any worse than it was before - and if people are living with certain bugs for months (or even years) they will survive another week or so, right?"
7/2/2009,"you obviously have only a shallow understanding of the process of software development in a commercial environment. it just doesn't work that way. ccp states that they spend 50% of their time on bug fixes and 50% of their time on new features. they can't keep bug fixing. why? because they can't do this because it is just too expensive and takes too much time.i want the software to work well, obviously, but i also want new features that add to the richness of the gaming environment. if ccp went through the exercise of fixing every bug that was worth fixing, you wouldn't get any new content for years. plus, from a developer point of view, bug fixing isn't exactly the most exciting part of the job.ccp are doing it right, or as good as can be expected. they continually iron out bugs, they continually add new features [yay 1.5 update!]. i'm a happy customer and as long as the client doesn't crash hard or a bug renders the environment simply unworkable, i shrug at the occasional bug and be done with it.all the problems you mention are real and no doubt annoying, but if you know that they're there you have to work around the problems and learn to live with them until such time as they're fixed. there is no use getting worked up over it. when you're done ranting the bug is still there and you spent some time of your life being needlessly unhappy.instead, you could be zipping around in space working towards universal dominance. i know i am.abulurd bonifaceme meceo"

7/2/2009,"there are a lot of people who do not like the current doomsday mechanics. most of their arguments boil down to one thing, doomsdays should be used to give a side an advantage in a fight not to end a fight.with the number of titans currently in game it has become far too common place for alliances to bring multiple titans on grid and completely wipe out a fleet using doomsdays. this strategy ends a fight usually before it begins. the change i am proposing is two parts.1. doomsday damage reduced to ~45k with max skills2. limit number of doomsday firing by all titans in system to one per 15 minutes(these numbers may need balancing)by limiting the number of doomsdays fired in system of all titans in system to one per 15 minutes this would eliminate the double, triple, etc. doomsdays that only serve to stop a lot of people from enjoying a good fight.basically if there is to be a doomsday weapon in game it should be used to gain an advantage in fights, not to end them."
7/2/2009,"i have seen a lot of good proposals for doomsday balancing. this is not one of them. in practice, you'd be making trillions of isk obsolete, because nobody would use ddd any more - wiping drones and interceptors is not enough to justify risking titans."
7/2/2009,"i already posted a thread about the covetor skill requirements, but after a more thorough analysis, i realized that the issue goes far beyond that ship. the requirements for the whole mining barge and exhumer classes are out of wack and not linear. the training curve is not constant enough between each tier of mining barge, which makes the retriever the only viable barge to use. the procurer is worthless because for very little additional training, you can fly a retriever. the coveter is also worthless since only a few more days of training will get you in an exhumer. the mackinaw is not so bad, but not really worth it either since the only difference between it and the hulk, is one level of exhumer.here is a list of the current requirements for mining barges and exhumers.(each ship is compared to the previous one)legend: (new) (+1) (+2) (same)procurer:- astrogeology iii (rank 3)- industry v (rank 1)- mining barge i (rank 4)- mining iv (rank 1)- science iv (rank 1)retriever:- astrogeology iv (rank 3)- industry v (rank 1)- mining barge iii (rank 4)- mining iv (rank 1)- science iv (rank 1)covetor:- astrogeology v (rank 3)- industry v (rank 1)- mining barge v (rank 4)- mining iv (rank 1)- science iv (rank 1)skiff:- astrogeology v (rank 3)- exhumers i (rank 5)- industry v (rank 1)- mining barge v (rank 4)- mining iv (rank 1)- science iv (rank 1)- spaceship command iv (rank 1)mackinaw:- astrogeology v (rank 3)- exhumers ii (rank 5)- industry v (rank 1)- mining barge v (rank 4)- mining iv (rank 1)- science iv (rank 1)- spaceship command iv (rank 1)hulk:- astrogeology v (rank 3)- exhumers iii (rank 5)- industry v (rank 1)- mining barge v (rank 4)- mining iv (rank 1)- science iv (rank 1)- spaceship command iv (rank 1)(continues in next post...)"
7/2/2009,"as you can clearly see by this comparison chart, the training curve is far from being constant.to balance this curve, here's what i propose:(each ship is compared to its current requirements)legend: (new) (-1) (+1) (+2) (unchanged)procurer:- astrogeology iii (rank 3)- industry v (rank 1)- mining barge i (rank 4)- mining iv (rank 1)- science iv (rank 1)- spaceship command iii (rank 1)retriever:- astrogeology iv (rank 3)- industry v (rasnk 1)- mining barge iii (rank 4)- mining iv (rank 1)- science iv (rank 1)- spaceship command iii (rank 1)covetor:- astrogeology iv (rank 3)- industry v (rank 1)- mining barge iv (rank 4)- mining v (rank 1)- science iv (rank 1)- spaceship command iii (rank 1)skiff:- astrogeology v (rank 3)- exhumers i (rank 5)- industry v (rank 1)- mining barge v (rank 4)- mining v (rank 1)- science iv (rank 1)- spaceship command iv (rank 1)mackinaw:- astrogeology v (rank 3)- exhumers ii (rank 5)- industry v (rank 1)- mining barge v (rank 4)- mining v (rank 1)- science iv (rank 1)- spaceship command iv (rank 1)hulk:- astrogeology v (rank 3)- exhumers iii (rank 5)- industry v (rank 1)- mining barge v (rank 4)- mining v (rank 1)- science v (rank 1)- spaceship command iv (rank 1)i have added spaceship command iii for mining barges because it seems like a logical step up (considering you need it at level iv for exhumers). the mining barge requirement for the covetor would be lowered to iv, but there would be changes to mining and science (mining v required for the covetor and above, and science v required for the hulk and above), which would also have to be the same for industrial command ships (orca and rorqual). mining and science are both rank 1 (base training time), so training to level 5 wouldn't take that long when you have proper attributes and implants.i believe those changes would be just enough to make every mining barge and exhumer worthwhile and up the value of industrial command ships a little as the same time.so what do you think? do i make any sense or would that be too drastic?"
7/2/2009,"i like the addition of spaceship command, it just makes sense. i would also like to see a little diversity in t2 for miners. something like the did with haulers in the blockade runners. less raw mining potential but covert capabilities or inherent warp stabs. maybe even a miner that can fit probes and gets a good bonus to grav sites."
7/2/2009,"the procurer isn't worthless because of the time to train to a retreiver, the procurer is worthless because you can outmine it in a combat ship.before i trained for mining barges, i was using a hurricane to mine in. i didn't bother getting a procurer because the hurricane actually mined faster than a procurer could, even with an mlu fitted.i went straight to a retreiver because that was the first level of barge that actually boosted my mining rates.my only real problem with your suggestion is that it doesn't address the central problem that the procurer and the skiff are, essentially, useless ships.that aside, i do agree that mining barges need a good thorough looking at, as i pointed out in your other thread. however, in retrospect, i think it needs to go beyond just skill requirements."
7/2/2009,"the small versions (procurer and skiff) can be useful if someone doesn't want to train for cruisers and battleships (which is the case for most specialized miners out there). my mining character for example, concentrated all his training to go from frigate to mining barges as fast as possible.for someone who just wants something better than a frigate to mine, the procurer would be a good thing to buy if the learning gap between it and the retriever wasn't so small. same goes for the skiff.that said, i do agree that the ship bonuses for those two ships could be better to make it worth it even more."
7/2/2009,"no problems i see with the addition of spaceship command iii for t1 barges and mining v for covetor and above. i do find the idea of requiring science v for the hulk odd given that of the mining related science skills only hydromagnetic physics has that as a prereq (astrogeology requires it at iv, as does metallurgy). if you really want miners to train science v, the mackinaw is the place for it. if the intent is merely to add a few more days to the hulk requirements i think exhumers iv is a better way to go."
7/2/2009,"yeah, i thought about that too, but science is a rank 1 skill while exhumer is a rank 5 skill. one level of exhumer is more than a few days of training, which is why i thought it would be too much of a gap, but it would make sense to me as well if others are accepting the change.according to evemon, on my miner (which has learning skills and attributes optimized for industry skills with +3 implants), it would take around 4 days to get from science iv to science v, while it would take roughly 7 days to go from exhumer iii to exhumer iv. is 3 more days too much?"
7/2/2009,"i agree with both your points there. (and i'm adding my support, which i forgot to do earlier. this definately needs a looking over). pure miners, who aren't training cruisers and up probably would find the procurer useful. but i doubt my situation was unique or even that uncommon, especially for people who only have time to play one character.all of that aside, i agree with your proposed skill changes, but i sincerely hope that any review ccp does of these ships goes beyond the skill requirements alone."
7/2/2009,"humm, maybe that could be something done to make the procurer and the skiff more useful. make them the perfect ninja/exploration miners. they would be quicker than the other ships of their class, mine a little less (but still able to use a strip miner and gas harvesters), be able to fit a core probe launcher, and have a slight bonus to scan probe strength.i don't know if it's possible, but to make it very specialized, the strength bonus could be only for sites of a particular type (gravimetric for hidden belts, and ladar for gas clouds)."
7/2/2009,"it took me around 4 days to train exhumers iv (+4s, stats optimized around a plan that has a lot of other ship skills in it). seemed to me time well spent for the added yield (though i don't plan to do exhumers v any time soon), so i think a lot of miners would be training it anyway."

(currently i like the 20% tracking but hate the 20% extra optimal range). maybe it is time to revieuw the drone rigs aswell, ad a few more. i can place a damage mod rig on my deimost so why cant i place a drone damage rig on my ishtar? same go's for tracking rigs, rate of fire rigs, optimal range and falloff rigs. these rigs only need to be able to be placed on drone boats like the ishtar and the sin. the vexor and myrm are allready good enough and do not need this stuff."
7/2/2009,"this proposal simply makes no sense. sentry drones are fine, and balanced nicely - the range vs dps tradeoff works far better than it does on the standard combat drones. the only change i'd even consider making is to have the t2 versions require the drone spec skills, so that they ge the same 10% damage boost that the t2 combat drones get. also, why would you ever complain about having too much optimal range? having too much optimal is simply not possible - more is just better. and you can't limit rigs to a specific class of ships."

7/2/2009,"moms are never going to be defined as anti-capital platforms - the finances of it simply don't work. there are two ways to justify spending money on a supercapital(well, three, but i don't count epeen). they have to either defeat enemy fleets, or support your own fleet, to such an extent that the effect is worth the price tag. right now, titans do both of these, and moms do neither. thus, titans are the primary strategic asset of major alliances, and motherships are vanity hulls for people with more money than brains. bomber drones will not solve this(unless they're powerful enough to warrant comparison to ddds), and as such, they'll only distract from a mothership's true role on the battlefield."
7/2/2009,the problem is they do not any unique role atm. this will make them usefull actually. give this to moms
7/2/2009,"you're right that they don't have a role right now. my point is, this won't give them one. it'll just make them go from being 2x a carrier at 20x the cost to also being 1x a dreadnought at 10x the cost. it's exactly the same problem that they have right now, just in a slightly different flavour. their role is fleet support - the problem is that they aren't capable of it right now."
7/2/2009,"the issue, as i see it, is that the other race's turrets fight in optimal. lasers fight in optimal and blasters fight in optimal but projectiles, as we all know, fight in falloff.lasers get a better optimal range with each tier of gun in a class. blasters get a better optimal with each tier of blasters in a class... but projectiles have the same falloff no matter which tier you pick. a 220mm ac ii has the same falloff as a 425mm ac ii.so if dual 180mm ac ii's fire faster, track better and have the same optimal as a 425mm ac ii, then what is the benefit of fitting the bigger gun? the dual 180mm ac ii's track so much better in fact, that they will do more damage to same size targets and actually hit smaller targets unlike the 425's. therefore, there needs to be something that actually makes using theh 425's a viable option.i propose that the falloff should become increasingly better as the tier of gun becomes larger. for example:dual 180mm autocannon ii8km falloff220mm vulcan autocannon ii10km falloff425mm autocannon ii12km falloff"
7/2/2009,i support this even though i believe not just medium guns need a buff to falloff.
7/2/2009,"please do this to all projectiles.i noticed this when i was fitting large dual 425's to my dominix for additional damge in mission running (i had no spare cap, and no, i had no cc rigs)i niticed that difference between range on my dominix and my corpmate's teppest's 800mm guns is minimal, and the damage difference is tiny, and i get the benefit of having better tracking. so yes, that is not all right.also, turns out that large neutron blasters have range just couple kilometers shot that of large projectiles, but have massive advantage in dps. that is not the case with mediums. conclusion: increase range on large high-tier projectiles, and cut it a little on medium 220mm;s"

7/2/2009,not to be rude but if you only keep playing this game for the possibility of being able to walk into stations one day i think you're doing it wrong...
7/2/2009,"we'll get a new novel but seriously - when wis becomes available it has the potential to draw pilots away from what really matters: piloting a ship through space, exposing yourself to the inherent risks of being a pilot in a cruel world.wis needs to blend in with normal gameplay and yet give enough incentives to leave your ship. i prefer that ccp don't rush wis. it should work on release. also apocrypha 1.5 is not a full expansion, just some more content, appetizers if you want. if you're looking for something unique and new, you may want to try racing. there are two race organizers to my knowledge"

7/2/2009,"hi,while nicer and more realistic (what ever it means in a fictious environment)graphics are always welcome, i don't think that it is the biggest priority at this time. i give you three reasons for this:1) the graphic engine and effects have been improved recently and massively.2) eve is one of the few games that manages to get your heart pumping without special effects: i wouldn't have pulled this off.3) usually the most i see of my drones is an ""x"" floating in space. whatever graphic improvements ccp make, they have to scale up to large fleets aswell. rather then support additional effects, i'd like to see a replay function. why ? well because to appreciate the effects you need time to watch them. if you had time to watch shiny effects in this fleet , i'd say you where doing it wrong.i hope this was somewhat constructive."

7/3/2009,"the eagle is a cruiser, and costs quite a bit more- both in isk and sp. the harpy is a frigate. again, i'm not saying that afs are overpowered as is- but they certainly could use a nerf more than a boost.edit: typo"
7/3/2009,"the merlin is a frigate and the moa a cruiser, and they both have the same 2 bonuses. i guess the merlin needs a nerf?"
7/3/2009,i think this would be a great thing to do for the v1.5 release in august.
7/3/2009,"nope.""i guess the merlin needs a boost?"""
7/3/2009,"hmm, you're right. my comments above neglected the larger falloff range of the blasters, even though i was attempting to suggest the cat become a better blaster-boat. would suggest instead to give it either a double 50% falloff bonus (which is better than a single 100%, btw), 25% damage, or 25% rof bonus, so it suffers less when fighting in falloff. in other words, balance like the thrasher.unfortunately, your main point here would be a disaster. one of the major issues that all small ships have (and not just in solo play) is the range + speed + damage advantage that the interceptor has. if you, as a destroyer, are going up against t1 frigates this is not so much of an issue--you have the range bonus and tracking to deal with a relatively slow-moving frigate at about 24km, and they die fast enough that your anemic damage will drive them away in short-order.not so with interceptors. first, you will never be able to influence the fight due to speed, as even the slowest interceptor is going to be 4x the mwd speed of a destroyer. second, it is very hard to get enough range, damage, and tracking into one place on the ships to even drive an interceptor away. the cormorant is the one ship that can reliably do this, with rails and a sniper fit.meanwhile, since your dessie tanks like wet cardboard, the (often also small) damage the interceptor is doing will kill you first. god forbid they're using a ship with a range bonus to points, and orbiting you at 30km. it's extremely hard to get small guns out that far... trust me, i've tried.if anything, dessies could use even more optimal range, imo.----on to your second idea, and a related point:i'd love to see destroyers split into two main, base ships--a ranged ship (more or less like we have now), and a tackling ship, both of which are optimized to taking out or driving off frigates of various sorts. the ranged version would be better at taking on interceptors, and the tackling version better at handling assault frigates, and both would do fine versus t1 frigates. both would be able to tank to one degree or another, based on racial characteristics.i'd love to see the catalyst turned into the ""tackling"" destroyer variant, optimized for blaster work and possibly even having a scrambler range bonus. that would free up the ""ranged"" gallente ship to be a drone-boat with drone speed and mwd speed bonuses, drone damage, and an active tanking bonus. a kind of mini-myrmidon, but really designed to get drones out there fast and have them stick to the target without spending all their time in mwd-mode.anyway, i'm glad to see people agreeing that the destroyer needs some serious love. it's a beautiful ship--even though with weapon grouping we don't see that seductive, full row of guns anymore. :)--krum"
7/3/2009,i would love some dessy love supported!
7/3/2009,gimme!
7/3/2009,"lol! exactly. other games (such as world of warcraft) have this service, and it never caused any problems. you can't do it more than once a month and it costs 20 or 40$ i can't remember. either way, all of the arguments against this proposal are unfounded and unjustified, so i really hope ccp considers it regardless."
7/3/2009,i like this idea a lot! i personally had the bad luck to select name having 'd' for first character without knowing how the primary targets are called in this game. i hate to be usually the 2nd or 3rd primary - people with names from the first half of the alphabet tend to die much often or are forced to flee the battle than the other half. this is not fair and kills the fun. you carry the bad luck of selected name starting with 'a-f' for the entire life time of the character.i would suggest that you should be able to change your name once per 3 years. such a long period for certian wouldn't affect the eve world integrity in any extend.
7/3/2009,"1) csm did not really bring it to ccp - there was a lot of double talk from certain csm - who claimed that they have, when it turned out they devoted less than 5 minutes of time to it, because: ""ccp said it was too hard, so we did not even bother discussing it, getting details.""2) ccp never said it was impossible - just that it will take a lot of work. hence, we want ccp to take time, and do it properly, the way pos should have been done in the first place, not the half-arsed ""junk-in-space-ala-deadh-horse."" 3) do some research on what csm actually did, and you will find that that a discussion on ""musical instruments in eve"" took place, got approved, while the pos overhaul issue was barely mentioned as the ""funky pos idea."" now, be a good boy, and go conform somewhere else, with the rest of the csms who really did diddley-squat about this - longest running request in the history of eve, yea mate, longest running, longest asked for, longest desired, and completely legitimate, and yet ignored request from the eve community in the history of eve. support the pos overhaul! even if the ""musical instruments"" crowd would want you to give up!"
7/3/2009,"the lack of progress on this, and the awful state of the pos system as it is. is the reason i'm closing my accounts."
7/3/2009,i'm bumping this. it really has to be brought up to ccp.
7/3/2009,"i think pirates have it easy enough as it is now. i found it the hard way. a skilled player with faction probes and t2 covert ops ship can scan you down before you can see his probes coming. having ""cloaked"" probes would just make things ridiculously easy for them."

7/3/2009,this topic seems to pop up once a month. i've an idea in the past that would further enhance the orca and widen it's possible use.orca - dry dock bay moduleusing the same principle as described in the link above you could do the same with an xl cargo expander module and the orca into a mini freighter.
7/3/2009,yes
7/3/2009,"first: thanks for all comments here. :)as far as i can see, there are some major drawbacks in some eyes.- drugs: it's indeed somehow weird, that there would be an illegal part in the production of an legal product. well, see the mission ""war of the softdrinks"" (or so), especially the recipe. if i am right, there is one drug mentioned in it. so when quafe produces special soft drinks using illegal drugs, they could also be used in implants. perhaps the empire factions had certain certificates by concord, that allowed them to use drugs in production, pretty much as today's pharmacy uses morphium etc as well.to the ingame logics: my thoughts were mainly, that you'd have to use the drugs, so the body doesn't repel the implant.but it wouldn't destroy the idea's basic structure if you use something else than drugs.- corpses: well, yes it is morbid. ^^ but i don't really care about the maturity aspect.more interesting is an chronicle i think i read a long time ago, but i couldn't find it to link it here. there was a passage which descibed how a body was dissolved into its basic materials, which could be used in further processes. perhaps someone else does know which chronicle it was.- lp shop: right. uhm, a first idea would be that lp shops could seed researched bpcs (for t1 production) and unresearched bpcs (for invention). not sure about that, though. any real ideas around here?- existing resources: i personally think there are by far enough different items ingame. if you add new purposes to old things, you still increase the variety ingame. somehow. :p- t2-hardwirings: yeah, someone mentioned that in the german forums as well. ;)not sure about that, as i am not used to them. perhaps see them as special t1 hardwirings? (higher prod costs, other skill requirements in productions than normal hardwirings?)edited for less errors."
7/3/2009,"supported for sure.edit: just re-read and am not sure where you're going with the idea of drugs being useless? they're excellent as is, tbh. maybe a little on the expensive side for the harder core drugs, but the standards are spot on, imo.why do you say they're useless?and finally, i still support the idea of corpses being used in implant production. and implants being able to be produced as a general rule."
7/3/2009,i support this idea - corpses should have their use.
7/3/2009,we need this :)

7/3/2009,supportin dis'. having to escalate to senior gm's just to get a petition read is pathetic. some gm's could really do with getting sacked tbqfh. anyone who's had heartache on the 14th of febuary knows what i mean
7/3/2009,"""hi, i lost my ship due to a bug, the details of which can been seen below.""reply : ""unfortunately you were warp scrambled, and thus you could not warp away from the hostile players."" yes, thank you mr. gm. telling a 4 yr player what a warp scrambler is?"
7/3/2009,"i disagree. the gms do a pretty good job, most of the time. it takes <1 hour for my petitions to be responded to, often times just a matter of minutes. that's a phenomenal response time!i've heard of a few cases where players have actually schooled them on their own policies, quoting devblogs and showing just how an individual's actions were considered an exploit and whatnot, but these are the exception rather than the rule and are cases where a very knowledgeable player was able to determine an answer to a very complex ruleset.if anything, i think the problems brought up by people who have had negative gm interactions in this thread are due to the over-petitioning of people who overuse the petition system. the gms probably get 9 out of 10 petitions that are due to things like can flipping, ore theft, etc. and are specifically allowed under the eula. their automatic response is to dismiss it. when they get a legitimate one, they're likely so used to dismissing the petitions that they might be overeager to dismiss yours, which is a natural human response.tl/dr: no. gms do a good job. complain about noobs petitioning so much."
7/3/2009,"i really don't petition any more because, as the op stated, it's almost as if the respondent doesn't even bother reading the question. i once even got an answer that had nothing to do with the problem i opened the petition for.i've been in customer support for all of my career, whether at the retail level or as mid- or high-level systems/engineering support, and if i responded to any customer with the effect of a blank stare, i'd be fired. you guys want to improve your customer support? hire people like me. people who have experience with every aspect of what these guys are supposed to do."

7/3/2009,"supported. again. we were promised a fix to this and i'd like to see it happen. paying insurance for concordokken is beyond moronic. it's so stupid it would be out of place in a ridiculous fantasy my little pony mmo, much less the logical, economy-driven world of new eden."

7/3/2009,"insurance should be removed from all ships more expensive than t1 battlecruiserin the old days when making money was tough and owning a t1 bs actually meant something, insurance was justifiable. but in today's age when a month old noob is already flying raven, where real battleship cost is 3-5 mil, where isk is being printed in record numbers, we really don't need the insurance crutch.this game is supposed to be tough and losses are supposed to mean something. we are losing that."
7/3/2009,"wrong.highsec will never be risk free, and this proposal in no way prevents gankers from doing what it is they do. this in no way prevents them from locking my ship in a high sec system and pushing the fire button.wrong.once again, this proposal in no way prevents suicide ganking from occurring. if you want to fly into noob space, lock some guy in a noob frigate, and blast him to hell and back, i have absolutely no problem with you doing that. please tell me how removing insurance payouts turns off your ability to press f1-f8.it does however mean that you may have to choose your targets more intelligently instead of ganking everything that crosses your path. but please don't presume that i am stupid enough to believe that everyone in an npc corp is flying an ibis with civilian fittings. mmkay?i know i have the tools to defend myself, and i use them. my hulk is tanked, and i have combat drones loaded. my corp uses cov-ops scouts and escorts for high value merchandise. as for striking back at the gankers, it's kinda pointless to shoot at them once concord has asploded them all over the asteroid field.however, what the gankers are doing is defined, by the game mechanics, as a crime. please name one other criminal profession that offers insurance payouts to cover lost material.i'll wait while you come up with one. take your time, i have all year.and please stop misconstruing my arguments. i'm not telling you you can't suicide gank. by all means, feel free. i'm just don't want it to be free (or nearly free). talk about risk vs reward."
7/3/2009,"suicide ganking for isk will not be touched as it serach for good targets worth the attack even if there is no insurance subsiding. suicide gank for lulz and ""any target is good as my ship cost nothing"" will be hit hard. i (and i think most of the carebears) have noting against people suicide ganking against a worthy target to gain more than you spend. but i have a lot against people doing suicide attack only because the cost is 0, counting on insurance to make the 1 attack on 100 against a target with good stuff worth doing it. look the call for the new jihadswarm. it suggest suiciding one or more meghatron with faction ammo to get 1 tanked hulk. at best the drop will be some millions in modules. where is the economic logic in that? only insurance make it possible. there is no good quality target, no gain. if all you want is the killmail you should pay it. if insurance on concord kills is removed ccp can even roll back the last increase in concord reaction time, as that will help well thought suicide ganking attempts while insurance help the ""kill all you see, maybe something will drop"" people."
7/3/2009,"risk free, no. but a climate so adverse to risk as to make it a hugs n' rainbows carbear teaparty that might as well for all intents and purposes be called risk free- decidedly, yes.removing insurance payouts for concorded ships makes suicide ganking vastly less profitable. this translates directly to fewer ganks occurring and a safer highsec. it doesnt. it just anihilates the economic incentive to do so in 90% of cases. please leave the strawman alone.i dont think you are stupid, just that you are a carebear with an agenda that will change eve for the worse- completely different. mmkay?you know what killrights are, right? what merc. corps are?hint: -10 players live in lowsec. you can go there. you even get sentry guns to help you!lets see...piracy. or do you consider piracy griefing and not a 'profession' yep, you want to nerf the reward for the risk- we lose our ships, isk (yes, even after insurance its significant) and sec status.meanwhile you are merrily mining away making 10+ p/h mining veld in an essentially risk free enviroment; frankly if you get suicide ganked you are probably taking the shortbus, or too greedy to take precautions, or wound up the wrong people by whining on the forums.talk about risk vs reward."
7/3/2009,"i'll be truly shocked if that happens.if it does, then the change would be balanced; if concord reaction times were increased above the previous prior to nerf times in order to make ganking specific targets more profitable; more time = less isk invested.butop suggests nothing of the sort."
7/3/2009,"and you don't see being subsidized to destroy ships by the same insurance that pay the destroyed ships as wrong?or needing to get paid by the insurance as you don't care to search for a isk worthy target?is, as it appear you are doing it the wrong way, caring only to kill something as you don't select your targets it is only right that you pay for the privilege of getting the killmail."
7/3/2009,"my four paying accounts support this unimplemented, promised action by ccp. there should be no payments of insurance to gankers in high-sec. a common argument is that to eliminate this payment to those who profess that it's a ""profession"" is ludicrous, and clearly evidenced by the fact that concord spanks the actor. the majority of space in eve is not patrolled by concord, but these ""professionals"" choose to prey upon folks that rarely need to protect themselves from criminals? yes. it's a criminal activity in high-sec; go to low sec or null sec and your profession can roam free with no risk of concord death and with, as many will undoubtedly declare, much higher payout and enjoyment.yes. you know you stalk high-sec only because you can't survive with your ""profession"" in low sec or null sec. the real reasons why you choose to stay our of low sec is known only to you guys, but i think we all know the answer."
7/3/2009,"by all means let's make ""insurance"" more 'realistic'.as long as it's balanced by making concord more 'realistic' too."
7/3/2009,"everyone knows i dont actually play this game, i only like o post about it on the forums.everyone also knows that i'm in no way a lowsec pirate with a -10 sec status in a corp that lives in amamake; when they arent being ****s in 0.0"
7/3/2009,"yep, concord should be more realistic. they should bubble your pod and take you to prison for rest of your eve career for mass murder. yeah because having killrights or mercs attacking alts is really usefull and definately not a waste of time. and they will care so much when you kill one of their fully insured ships. suicide gankign should be done only when there is decent economic profit to be made, removing insurance wont change that much about that. you might use some other ships. but it does help against the: hey it moved lets gank it idea."
7/3/2009,"they should take 4-24 hours to turn up to the crime scene, ask you a lot of questions, make you feel like it's you that did something wrong, arrest you if you did anything like eg: shoot back, then take the nearest minmatar pilot back to the concord station and beat a confession out of him.all empire income will be taxed at 30% to pay for this service.now that would be realistic..."
7/3/2009,yes indeed. just shooting spaceships for fun has no place in a pvp spaceship game.
7/3/2009,"and the solution to that, as the pirates are so quick to point out to us, is to move out of high security space.it's not a strawman. your argument is it stops you from doing it. but you've just pointed out yourself that it doesn't - it just makes you have to be smarter about doing it. i thought that was what eve was all about? deciding if the risk is actually worth the reward. why should suicide gankers be the only profession that don't have to care about the risk, because it's subsidized?you say carebear like it's a bad thing. piracy, in and of itself, is not considered a crime by the game mechanics. concord does not jump out of the shadows and blast you into metal scrap if you lock someone in low sec, web them, point them, and then try and ransom their ship - or even if you destroy their ship.good try, but wrong. care to try again?let's talk about this for a minute. you didn't ""lose your ship"". you made a conscious decision to throw it away. and that, frankly, makes all the difference in the world."
7/3/2009,"remove insurance full stop.insurance breaks the risk-reward of suicide ganking, there's nearly nothing to lose, but also breaks the risk-reward of every other thing which involves flying a t1 ship. as such it should go completely. either that or overhaul with a more realistic system, which isn't just a blatant isk faucet to create isk from thin air"
7/3/2009,"sure, the ganker doesn't loose much isk when his ship gets blown up by concord, but he do loose sec status, which is a pain to rat back up again. gankers still need to consider if the profit is worth the 15 minutes of sitting in a station, possibly missing the motherload, waiting for gcc to expire and the sec hit that will take hours to recover.getting insurance after comitting a crime might be unrealistic by rl standards, but so is a society that encourage scamming and stuff like that."
7/3/2009,"insurance should not be a justification for crime, which it is at the moment. nobody gives a crap about sec status because there's so many ways to neutralize any hit you might take. nobody gives a crap about 15 minutes in a station because almost everyone has an alt. the real life argument is always the weakest one... it's the common sense argument that holds. don't pay people for being ****s to newbs."

7/3/2009,"some of you may have become accustomed to it by now, but i personally find the current directional scanner a little hard to use for one main reason: you can't see exactly where you're scanning and how wide your cone is visually.you have to point the camera to where you want to scan, but there's no visual center or cross to define exactly where you are precisely pointing at. you have to approximately line it up with your ship, or hold alt to get the brackets around your own ship and use that, which doesn't work that well due to mouse sensitivity (can sometimes be very hard to center the camera on a particular object far in the solar system).i think a visual representation of the scanner's cone/radius would really help. i would like to have a checkbox in the directional scanner window to show/hide the cone. when enabled, you would see a dim transparent blue (or other color) wireframe representation of the cone which would show exactly where you're pointing at and how wide your scanner angle is.the same cone should also be shown on the solar system map, this is very important! sometimes, especially when aiming at dead space to scan, it can be pretty hard to define exactly which way you were pointing at with the scanner before entering the map since the solar system map's camera doesn't sync with your ship's camera."

7/3/2009,"this. if i can warp to a point in space, i should be able to align to it."
7/3/2009,"i guess it'd be okay then, i just thought there was a specific reason why ccp didn't want us to align to x,y,z coordinates."
7/3/2009,"and there may be/have been a reason for it, but it doesn't make any kind of logical sense. my ship has to align to that point before warp, so the code to align to xyz coordinates is already in the game. the only reason i can not pre-align to a non-celestial at all is because there is no option to align to any bookmarks."
7/3/2009,"supported,i would also like to see my bookmarks in my overview. that way i could use the alredy existing allign-button."
7/3/2009,agreed
7/3/2009,the mining ships definitely need to revised skill wise and bonus wise. like you suggestions
7/3/2009,i agree with everything except science v for the hulk. either science v for all exhumers or do not change it for any of them. there is no reason for science to go up 1 rank. the only reason science iv is required is for the astro-geology. it then trumps the science as it is a more specialized skill.
7/3/2009,then we need something else to make the training gap between the mackinaw and the hulk longer (but not too much) so the mackinaw can be a worthy intermediate ship to use. maybe set the hulk requirement to exhumer iv instead of iii? this would add about 7 days of training which may make the mackinaw worth it at least for a week.
7/3/2009,good idea
7/3/2009,"the mackinaw is an ice mining ship. it doesn't matter if you make the hulk outright easier than the mackinaw, people will still use the mackinaw."
7/3/2009,"its logic, i support."
7/3/2009,"right, i forgot about the ship roles when i wrote this... humm, in this case, if both the mackinaw and the hulk should be somewhat at the same level (due to the specialized ice harvesting role of the mackinaw), then perhaps the mackinaw should have ice harvesting iv as a required skill."
7/3/2009,"i've noticed this a couple of times. when you attempt to train a skill to level one that requires certain prerequisites, then you can, only if you have completed training all the prereqs. my issue is that you are disallowed from training a skill to level one, even if the final prerequisite is in training to the required level. i suggest that this be changed, enabling the user to add entry-level skills to the queue when the final prerequisite is in the queue above it, and under 24 hours to completion.i realize that this feature was put in this to avoid people trying to skip prerequisites, but there is a way to work around this: should the prerequisite be canceled before completion, all skills after it in the skill queue which require that prereq. skill will also be removed.please take consideration to this, i believe it was a feature which should have been added, but was overlooked.thanks - in advance - for your support, ccp."
7/3/2009,"i agree with you, and in fact, so do some other people."

7/3/2009,"no, it's a tradeoff between damage and range. you want to hit farther out, you do less dps."

7/3/2009,sentry drones are used less as they are stationary which is also their main advantage. i like them and use them regulary even considering skilling t2 sentries and that considering i'm amarr only.
7/3/2009,"im a t2 sentry user and ill say now that i dont support this idea. the drones are balanced fine and as for differing damage types, its purely to do with racial types, wouldnt expect an amarr drone to deal kinetic.as for the tracking and range thing, the bouncers dont have as higher damage, but they are still enough to 1 shot frigates from 70km away, and by the time ive thinned out an enemy rat fleet, all thats left are a few bs at 20 km perfect for my garde ii's. i honestly think that sentry drones, whilst being difficult to get to grips with, are the most powerful drone, they dont need changing. (not counting fighters)"
7/3/2009,sentry drones are perfectly fine and well balanced.
7/3/2009,"this. perhaps we should just make all ships identical, with predefined identical fits, the only difference being that amarr do em, caldari kinetic, gallente thermal and minmatar explosive. sounds goodwhat a terrible terrible idea"

7/3/2009,"thoughts about sovereignityproblem/task:posses and their reinforce-timing leads to the fielding of large fleets, aka blobs. the success of defense and attack is unproportionally dependend on the numbers of pilots engaged.the situation is that a huge blob exactly knows when a pos leaves reinforcement and has only to be there for a short time to safe it. it doesn't matter whether you take the risk to attack many posses, since a great blob can defend them sequentially. no need to split. blob stays an entity. pure mass defends it all.resulting, we have, the building of large blocks/coalitions and the factual impossibility to conquer regions for smaller and lone alliances or to hold them.goal:more parallel attacked targets to force blobs to split. make large regions more difficult to defend than smaller ones.possible solution:get rid of the reinforcement-mode and modification of the sovereignity rules.to keep sovereignity with all the levels, enabling this and that, you sould now build expensive defense stations which you can expand with several toys and weapons.these do have a fixed area of control where they give sovereignity. loosing defense means loosing sovereignity.as soon as the defense stations are attacked and its lifepoints burned they enter an overtake-mode lasting for 48 hours. (depending on balancing), similar to the reinforcement-timer.the sovereignity-holder can go on using the defense (keyword: home advantage), this means using weapons which can be shot down by the enemy as well as repaired and reattached by the defender.instead of waiting, as in the current system, for the timer to go down and having a blob waiting to defend, we introduce some dynamics.while the overtake-mode lasts (timer) every side may attack the control bunker/command centre (however it'd be named). it's a part of the defensive system which otherwise would be immune (prior to overtake-mode). whenever the control bunker ist hold by one of the parties, a timer counts for that party. at the end of the 48 hours the one party gets the sovereignity whose timing counter is the highest. (all attached modules self-destruct then).a successful attacker can then take down/over all posses within the area of control of that defense station without any kind of reinforcement hindering him.so this would be a modified system of reinforcement which brings a dynamic engagement for 48 hours.advantageous is that noone knows when the enemy takes the control bunker/command centre. this would enable simultaneous attacks on several stations. as large as the region of control of the defender as difficult it gets to defend and hold.if your blob stays at position a, control centres from b to h could be conquered, under pretext the defense stations have fallen into overtake-mode then. the defender has to split his defensive blob into smaller forces the larger his area of control is. this can lead to interesting fights, even in smaller scale, which is the important point here.compilation:by attacking several defense stations, being the key factor in holding sovereignity, an attacker can break down the blob into smaller forces. it would be pointless to stay at one place only because you have to be at several ones at once.so the size of controlled areas thus increases the difficulty to defend them.the smaller the controlled area the less attackable you are.additional necessary changes:titans should loose the current doomsday ability to make normal sub-capital-fleets useful again. instead they should get a weapon which would inflict on a single target such an amount of damage so e.g. a usual capital sized ship would be destroyed immediately. be it a dreadnought or a carrier in triage mode or spidertank. the titan's rate of fire and its tracking has to be balanced though.jumpbridges (cynobridges) only work within the area of a defense station from the bridge to the border. there you'd have to fly again until you reach another area controlled by one of your defense stations. goal is to prohibit insta-blob-defensefleets.the attacker by this is enabled to scout the position and intention of the defense fleet and knows when a defensive fleet arrives at a border of sovereignity.yes, there will be still useful titan jumpbridges nevertheless."

7/3/2009,"i will admit that i hadn't thrown the numbers together and worked out how much isk is gained per hour off an r64 moon, the initial premise behind the idea is a way to grief moon mining operations beyond an all out assault on a death star.my initial belief was that a roqual would have been ideal for the task due the the fact a capital tank would allow support to assist and defend against an attack and stealing moon goo needs to have a risk factor built in to it.using a 2b ship would mean that anybody stealing moon resources would need to make sure that they have complete control over that system and/or a sizable defensive gang to back them up.however after i had considered profit from a r64 i agree that a roqual is to much risk for a small return.i still believe though that there needs to be a way for smaller groups to leech moon resources off towers for their own profit and in order to force the pos owners the have a presences around their assets to kill off leecher. in order to further the discussion regarding a suitable mechanic of stealing moon goo i might suggest the following alternative and then ask if others have better ideas or a refinement on that which has already been proposed.my understanding that a pos has a max engagement envelope of 250km for its guns, and that also moons generate 100 units of a mineral per hour.my alternative would be that instead of a roqual, perhaps a hulk could be utilized instead with a module to harvest material which would have an activation cycle of 15 minutes and would leach 25 units of material per cycle.the restrictions is would place on this module are these:1. must be activated with in 350km of the target pos harvester.(this should mean your ship is outside the engagement envelop of the pos but still on the same grid.)2. immobilizes the hulk for the 15 minute cycle.(no risk no reward)i will admit that while 20 mill per hour still isn't up there with other forms of income, the real objective behind the proposal is give us the tools to interfere with the passive pos revenue of an alliance."

7/4/2009,"your definition of fun differs vastly from mine, apparently."
7/4/2009,"all npc insurances should be removed and new contract type: insurance made.-> you can issue insurance contract which reserves certain amount of isk for certain ship type lost and put a price on it. you could also define time period from 1 day to whole year. this could be issued to corp, alliance, private, public etc."
7/4/2009,no.
7/4/2009,"what has no place is being subsidized by the game when doing that. and yes, i am fully aware that could and would include ship replacement losses in missions. as things stand today i would not be excessively troubled if insurance was removed for older characters or larger ships and not only for concord kills."
7/4/2009,"errrr, sorry. this current insurance ""scam"" is simply and logically wrong.what book of logic states that any criminal behavior is rewarded and paid for by the same society (hisec empires) that give other penalties for such behavior (sec standing loss)?"

7/4/2009,"but you're fine with empire carebears getting a massive free protection subsidy.or do you think should concord protection be paid for? that would be an excellent idea imo - instead of basing the concord response time on system sec, base it on the level of the contract you have with them. that gives the gankers their risk level - they cant be sure if they're shooting someone with platimum protection (concord turn up in 5 seconds) or just basic (faction police arrive after 1 minute)"

7/4/2009,"have a system where only a set number of ships can lock onto the same target at once.ex: if your commander is in a battleship, up to 15 people in your fleet can lock onto the same target as you. battlecruisers/cruisers 10 and so on and so on.if someone locks over the maximum amount, he will get his accuracy reduced, and the person after that will get his accuracy further reduced. or maybe reduce the accuracy for the entire group that is targetting. the rp reason for this could be because the locking signatures mess with each other or something.its not exactly a well refined idea, but it would work to some extent. it would large-scale fights a bit more interesting instead of having the entire fleet lock onto one person at a time.i dont know, what do you guys think?"
7/4/2009,"it's been proposed before. the problem is it's exploitable.. if 10 friendlies target me suddenly it's harder for my enemy to target me. we'd see the birth of ""spider locking"" fleets."

7/4/2009,"much as i'd love to see smaller gang warfare more prevalent, your proposal is far too exploitable. even if it didn't work on in corp/in alliance/in fleet members, what's to stop friends in different corps from abusing the mechanic?again, i do applaud the desire for smaller gang warfare- but this simply isn't the way to get there."
7/4/2009,"this is extremely horrible idea.also. ""blobs"" are not bad. they're pretty nice things in right places and are part of eve. not saying i would enjoy that kind of warfare but massive fleets are part of this game.instead of figuring out terribad things like this how about starting from why people gather up extremely massive fleets.here's couple of things to start:- current sovereignity system (more the merrier, no logistics problems)- titans (instead of being antiblob they just encourage for it with current mechanics)- pos warfare- cloak***ging, ewar, rr, buffer tanking, current tackling mechanics etc."

7/4/2009,"limiting damage or making up timers is not an answer, unless damage is limited to ""x-large"" smartbomb level to kill drones etc.whole dd as an idea is terrible.also defending current mechanics by isk invested in titans is ridiculous. more isk has been made obsolete nerfing different of smaller ships."

7/5/2009,"i support thrasher love.when i see a destroyer i see a target.even though i'm in a rifter, i should at least hesitate a little but i don't."
7/5/2009,i think a topick with 25 supports deserves some csm attention.
7/5/2009,"the ""call primary"" problem sounds olike something that wouldn't actually be solved by this, though. the problem there isn't with the name, but with whatever it is that makes the alphabetical order matter."
7/5/2009,"supported, just put a page in character info the same as employment history, ""alias history"" or some such so everyone knows your old identities, it would be logical, reasonable, prevent scamming. and to keep from overloading the server, maybe limit accounts to one name change every few months? that said, i support the idea."
7/5/2009,"as it is now, you cant see the probes coming for you.the prober has one goal.. find you, taking advantage of you not knowing that you get probed out and overwhelm you.a dedicated prober will put at least 10 minutes in this task if it gives him an advantage over you, especially as targets in low sec are already rare.the goal can be achieved by retreating probes when they completed the scan and replacing them.. so as target you got a 5-7 second time-frame to hit the probes with your directional scanner every time they're in range. (follow link)as you don't know when his probes are near you you have to use a sample rate higher than the maximal frequency of the probes staying in your range.. in our case you'll need to hit the scan button at least every 4 seconds.wasn't there some statement from ccp that their servers can't handle many directional scans?now try to do this with anything else going on around you and finding the probes in the directional scanner result list, which cant be filtered for probes./i support the op, and while you're at it ask for a one-window-intel-tool thats makes sense instead of the 4 i have to use now, please!"
7/5/2009,good solution
7/5/2009,assuming this is actually a proposal and not just a vague idea thrown in: supported.
7/5/2009,"another alternative would be to simply adjust the portion refine of all ores into something else more suitable to the ""needed"" percentages...so, for instance, you can have :veldspar : 276 tritanium, 69 pyerite, 16 mexallon, 3 isogenscordite : 281 trit, 70 pye, 17 mex, 14 iso, 3 nocpyroxeres : 1220 trit, 305 pye, 75 mex, 18 iso, 4 nocplagioclase : 1088 trit, 272 pye, 68 mex, 17 iso, 4 noc, 1 zydomber : 3539 trit, 883 pye, 220 mex, 54 iso, 13 noc, 3 zydkernite : 5666 trit, 1416 pye, 353 mex, 88 iso, 22 noc, 5 zyd, 1 mega[...]crokite : 109599 trit, 27399 pye, 6849 mex, 1712 iso, 428 noc, 107 zyd, 26 megabistot : 149884 trit, 37471 pye, 9367 mex, 2341 iso, 585 moc, 146 zyd, 36 megaarkonor : 219672 trit, 54917 pye, 13728 mex, 3432 iso, 857 noc, 214 zys, 53 megaor, if you prefer, we can include all ores and all minerals (actually, that's a better idea for many different reasons).then you'd get something like this:veldspar : 276 tritanium + 69 pyerite + 16 mexallon + 3 isogen + 0 nocxium + 0 zydrine + 0 megacyte + 0 morphite (portion base price = 2,000 isk).[...]scordite : 577 tritanium + 144 pyerite + 36 mexallon + 8 isogen + 1 nocxium + 0 zydrine + 0 megacyte + 0 morphite (portion base price = 4,994 isk).[...]arkonor : 193,624 tritanium + 48,405 pyerite + 12,100 mexallon + 3,025 isogen + 756 nocxium + 189 zydrine + 47 megacyte + 11 morphite (portion base price = 3,068,504 isk).[...]mercoxit : 1,086,272 tritanium + 271,568 pyerite + 67,892 mexallon + 16,973 isogen + 4,243 nocxium + 1,060 zydrine + 265 megacyte + 66 morphite (portion base price = 17,367,040 isk).magma mercoxit : 1,142,784 tritanium + 285,696 pyerite + 71,424 mexallon + 17,856 isogen + 4,464 nocxium + 1,116 zydrine + 278 megacyte + 69 morphite (portion base price = 18,251,776 isk).vitreous mercoxit : 1,196,032 tritanium + 299,008 pyerite + 74,752 mexallon + 18,688 isogen + 4,672 nocxium + 1,168 zydrine + 292 megacyte + 72 morphite (portion base price = 19,103,744 isk).___also, made it into a version with adjustable cummulative percentages for each mineral (cummulative of the remainder from the higher-tiered minerals, that is).highest value mineral (so, morphite or whatever else is highest that is non-zero) is the first to have its percentage adjusted, second highest value mineral is second to have its percentage adjusted, etc.tritanium is ""whatever's left"".orecalcs v2 - xls file, very smallgoogledocs version (not sure if it will remain functional since anybody can play with it - better get the xls, use this only if you don't have excel, hope nobody trashed it too hard).example output of the xls:pye 90%, mex 50%, iso 30%, noc 200%, zyd 90%, meg 130%, morph 400%, desired portion baseprice 19,103,744 isk (same as vitreous mercoxit, just so you can compare to the above results).using those percentage adjustments, you get the ""new"" orevitreous mercoxit : 843,216 tritanium + 172,476 pyerite + 19,164 mexallon + 2,330 isogen + 5,179 nocxium + 571 zydrine + 216 megacyte + 291 morphite (pbp = 19,103,744 isk).edit : added this post's contents to another unrelated post on page #1 (in case it gets lost in the rest)."
7/5/2009,"i'd love it if large, valuable asteroids had a bit of ice or frozen gas in em, detectable by surveyand when you activated either any mining laser or a laser with certain crystals, the asteroid would light up like a christmas tree and blast your barge from around your podbut that's just one man's fantasy. mining does need a re-vamp with some randomness to it. that's why you should support akita's idea and my idea as well mystery ore!"
7/5/2009,"km's are a great way to track the progess of a fight. to gauge resistance, and to get a feel for an alliances standard fleet fits, i would never ask them to be done away with. but the argument stands the implants are in the pod they are in the corpse, if anything the implants should be in that. the reason you die is when your shot in the pod a) your shot with a really big gun in a really small non armors pod. b) if/when it ruptures your body is exposed to the vacuum of space. both of these equal dead real fast. im not against implants being shown when lost, but i dont think the mechanic should be pod related i think the mechanic should be corpse related. also if your smart and your think that the other pvper is smart you should know withing a range of 5-8 different implants exactly what hes running. their is no gain to adding them to the lose mail as there is no way for them to drop/ be used or recovered. aswell as this would end up turning into the largest of e-peen stroking tools in the game and i dont think its needed personally. i would rather not had pilots targetting pods while theres still enemies on the field. sure if they are in a bubble/ in smartbomb range/ or your in a ship that doesnt take 15 seconds to lock them w.e but if you add implants to this your gonna get pilots in bs's and caps who are e-peen hungry enough that instead of locking the primary or the secondary they are locking pods to boost their isk efficiency. and that is fail.just my 2 cents"
7/5/2009,the winter release would be a nice treat.
7/5/2009,"yeah, i've also had a run in with a gm who gave a cut and paste answer that didn't even remotely answer my issue. i gave him a very low rating on my closed petition, of course, but i really feel like ccp doesn't give enough of a service feedback method.that and some of the gms could actually read the petitions they get. it'd take, what? an extra 30 seconds?"
7/5/2009,would be good.
7/5/2009,bump.
7/5/2009,"someone further up in this topic said he had his petitions responded to within an hour.... that has not happened to me once.i've got two petitions going now due to bugs ( ye olde "" i did not warp off when i disconnected, riddle me why, mr. gm? "" )the response basically has been that i did! yes, that i did warp off, but that vagabond obviously had an expanded probe launcher, using half it's cpu for that! because the vaga is awesome at prob..... wait, no. and of course the fact that i didn't have aggression would support the fact that i would stay in space for 15 mins?gm's either do not know enough about the game, or they give incredibly lame responses. i think two or three months back i had similar issues, and within a day i had gotten an educated response in which things were explained and my ships were returned to me promptly. the difference now is basically as others have said, you get a ""pre-made"" response saying they can't verify -anything- in their logs, and thusly you can go ""boohoo"" in the corner. it's just sad that customer support should revert to something as tragic as that, and as others have stated, yes they do get a lot of petitions, but it's their job.- i know damn sure that in other jobs, you can't lazy off and do a really poor job because there is a lot to do.that being said, some gm's do a good job. i presume they know who they are, and we love them."
7/5/2009,"agreed, plus raise insurance costs for frequent victims, too."
7/5/2009,"hey moron, ccp tried to gimp empire ganking afew times now, so you argument is a fail, think before you blog nub./agreed, dont live in empire but pussies who try to pvp in empire without a wardec should be nerfed as mouch as posible"
7/5/2009,"i support this mainly because the current system really don't make any sense.how powerful concord is doesn't really make any sense either though. i would certainly prefer it if concord ships were possible to beat in a direct confrontation, and possible and not considered an exploit to evade."
7/5/2009,"supported. and the above post doesn't bother addressing why criminals would receive insurance payouts for their destroyed ships, and for ""suicide ganking""since when should blowing up your own vessel, or going kamikaze, or self-destructing yield insurance payouts? the same principle applies to this issue. edit: and my god, the really need to stop howling. the way they scream about the ""carebears"" whenever ccp makes a move that would make piracy in any way more difficult is a little embarrassing. at least some of them offer valid reasoning, but some of them just rant on and on about the ""carebears"""
7/5/2009,"both self destruct and ship loss through concorde should invalidate the insurance on the ship -- i totally agree, what insurance company in their right mind would insure ships lost in these circs?"
7/5/2009,"*admits to having done it so he wouldn't have to move his mining barge through 0.0* no one would, but every time its proposed, and i've seen it proposed several times, the pirate community, especially those who go suicide ganking, go absolutely ballistic"
7/5/2009,yep they would wouldnt they
7/5/2009,supported.
7/5/2009,in what meaningful way are pod pilots citizens?
7/5/2009,"in what circumstances of ship loss would an insurance company pay?0.0 - neverlo-sec - neverratting - nevermining in a 0.8 or lower - nevermissioning - neverpirating - neveranti-pirating - neverwar-dec (either side) - neverpaying 40% above market value for a single 30% premium? - never""insurance"" in eve has nothing to do with rl concepts of insurance. just as rl concepts of law enforcement have nothing to do with a situation where immortal pilots who are allowed to fly battleships with nuclear weapon around ""safe"" areas. and where we can pay off the police to ignore huge battles directly outside public ports. you're trying to apply the rules and mores of 21st century western suburban civilization to a a game set in a hypertechnological far future with radically different cultures."
7/5/2009,"one of the silliest proposals ever.this isn't an issue. i'm sorry, but you're saying criminals should be treated differently from how ""legal citizens"" are when it comes to finances.personal property is personal property, and insurance is not the same as the police, you may notice that you get paid from an insurance company, and not from concord? no?this is because you are insured by the -company- not by the police. the contract is simply that when the ship blows up, insurance will be paid out.it's a non-issue."
7/5/2009,"for a ""silly...non-issue"" it sure seems to be generating a lot of support. doncha think?"
7/5/2009,"in the same meaningful way that an infant is. you seem to be laboring under the heinlein-esque notion of citizenship through service. of course, by that definition, anyone with a positive faction standing towards one of the empires could be considered a de facto citizen, since they have obviously rendered a service to that empire (they don't just hand out faction standing at the door, now do they?)"
7/5/2009,fact: the current ******ed system is making highsec ganking a zero-risk issue. stupid pirates can mis-gank worthless targets because their ships cost zero.
7/5/2009,"removing insurance for concord sanctionable actions makes perfect sense. ccp and devs always said that this game has consequences. so, consequences for a carebear who hauls really good stuff is that he will be suicide ganked. consequences to a ganker is that the carebear's cargo better be worth more than his ship and mods combined w/o insurance."
7/5/2009,"this really does sound like a no brainer. oh wait, because it is! ccp, fix it like you promised!"
7/5/2009,"i won't support removing insurance payouts for some arbitrary criteria like ""concord involvement"" (because just what constitutes ""involvement"" in the first place?).a better solution which would solve this and many other issues that i've been tossing around: the scc decides that it needs to be profitable so changes premiums so that the total premiums it takes in are always some percentage higher than what it pays out. this could be based on ship class or globally; i've not spent much time on it other than the initial idea.the other alternative is to remove insurance completely (though this would not solve one of the other issues with insurance that having variable premiums would solve). (i don't even like the idea ""keep insurance for ships sized a and b"" as that's arbitrary). after all, when you've basically got a 100% chance of having a ship destroyed, what company would insure it and hope to make a profit?"
7/5/2009,don't most insurance companies refuse to payout on damage you intentionally caused to your own stuff ?wouldn't triggering concord count as intentional damage ?concord involvement: you did something that makes concord want to blow your ship up. in this case you attacked an unaggressed target in high sec.sure pvp is going to be very high risk. but only triggering concord is guaranteed to destroy your ship.
7/5/2009,we pay taxes. we join militias. we run missions for empire corporations.
7/5/2009,"gladly. some recent ones...1234...a couple older ones...567...and some of the earliest...89there are hundreds - just check eve-search for ship and paint.interesting to see that the very feature was live in beta at some point. c/d anyone?also, i'd really be keen on seeing first hand some of those dev comments on the matter that everyone is alluding to. i really can't find any of them. myth?"

7/5/2009,"i learned to use it well about in a good week or so of using it constantly. the months afterwards were just to keep my skills with the scanner sharp. i wasnt very clear in my last post, but tbh it aint that hard to use it."
7/5/2009,neat.
7/5/2009,"the difficulty of a process shouldn't have to do with the ui surrounding it. signed.besides, if scanning and keeping track of different degree boundaries was so easy to do mentally, there wouldn't have already been overlay programs made to put nice circles corresponding with said radii on your screen."
7/5/2009,supported
7/5/2009,"i'm joining the ""oldschool"" crowd in how it's something you should learn, and it's not hard at all, i mean come on people z.z;;;but even so, i really wouldn't mind. i mean, there's no logical reason for this to not be nifty."
7/5/2009,what is that tool you're talking about? do you have the actual name of it? i've never heard of this before.
7/5/2009,"i'm having trouble visualizing how this would work when not in the map view. if there's a cone starting from your ship and going out to your max scan range, the indicator at the end of the cone is going to be a big circle, right? well, if an object is halfway between your ship and the end-cone circle.... it's going to look like it's inside the circle, but because the cone expands as it gets further from you, the circle at the halfway mark is going to be about half the size of the end-range circle. so the object could be visually within the end-range circle, while outside of the diameter of the half-range circle... so it looks like you're scanning it when you are not. (i'm not sure i made that make sense... need a picture)."
7/5/2009,"supported, this is a big usability issue because for low angles you're not really sure where the center of your ship is and the camera doesn't pan 100% smoothly. this ought to have been in from the beginning."
7/5/2009,i'm literally supporting this feature simply for that. it would help get rid of the isk sellers.
7/5/2009,"oh-so supported.some people can be horrible and ******ed, but ******s in large groups need blockage too."
7/5/2009,oh very supported.

7/5/2009,not supported.long live the imicus and probe!
7/5/2009,this is one of the ideas which make god kill a kitten every time they're posted.
7/5/2009,"yeah too exploitable and not sure if it's necessary to do anything like this although it sucks to be primarymeltend in 3 seconds. here is an idea i had some time ago but i think it would be tricky to balance. create a new module that remotely ""blurs"" the signature of a ship, similar to how flares are used today to divert missiles.once activated on a ship it results in all locks on that ship having a, say, 50% chance of breaking (skills and ship bonus apply too). cycle time is long, at least 20 seconds maybe even a minute. if you get primaried by 20 ships and then a friend sigblurs you, you can expect 10 locks to break, not enough to counter all of the dps but quite a bit. very heavy use of sigbluring could result in fleets having to simply go at it 1 on 1 pretty much or call priamries for each squad or whatever. there's no local module to sigblur yourself.this could be a new minmatar ewar in addition to their current wonderful one, because it's related, it messes with a ships signature."
7/5/2009,"take a look at this screenshot, and tell me this never happened to you...please visit your user settings to re-enable images.this happens to me every now and then, and nothing except completely resetting my windows settings will fix this. i am so sick of this! redoing all of my ui settings everytime is extremely aggravating.i can get a temporary fix by switching tabs, or minimizing and restoring the window, but then as soo as something new is shown on the overview, it is doubled as well.posting bug reports about it doesn't seem to help, and patch after patch, the bug persists. due to this not being reproducable on demand, bug reports usually get nowhere.please bring this to ccp in the next meeting, this has to be looked at already!here's links to other posts about this issue:"
7/5/2009,"that has never happened to me. still, seems like it ought to be fixed. what sort of responses are you getting to the bug reports?"
7/5/2009,"doesnt happen often to me, but when it does just minimizing the overview and the popping it back to normal fixes it everytime."
7/5/2009,"that has never happened to me.regardless, it should be fixed."

7/5/2009,"if you mean in the solar system map, you can already see those 2, just check your system map settings.if you mean in space then yeah, showing bookmark icons in space would help too!"

7/5/2009,"ive come up with a somewhat decent idea: when a dd is fired, everything is offlined (warp and jump drive also) this makes titan pilots think a bit harder before pressing f1 in a field of hostiles. it also helps control the titan population imo."

7/5/2009,"this is where i stopped: the skiff is a low sec or null sec space mining barge, its primary role as far as i can tell from the bonuses is that its for escaping a solo pirate or whoever using just one scrambler, and to mine mercoxite. i think a skiff is more valuable in non high sec space simply because of the +2 warp strength."
7/5/2009,"supported, but personally, i'm not sure i agree with your levels for astrogeology on the barges.i think 2,3,4 would be more reasonable, rather then 3,4,5. but then again, your the one crafting the idea, and i approve of this in general, just with that caveat i thought i'd mention."

7/5/2009,"walking in stations needs to add a bit of life to the gameworld- if it's just a cold empty space filled with alts wandering around begging for isk it won't be very palatable. the stsations need to be vibrant, busy places that give a real feel of the culture that they belong to. as for a reason for pod pilots to walk in stations? well what's the point of having loads of isk if you don't get to show off! i'd like to see player entourages- i want npc assistants and servants, i want to be carried around in a sedan chair and have npc bodyguards that push noobs out of my way!"
7/5/2009,"i would also love to see cockpit, that sounds really but i understand that it doesn't neccessarily mean we need manual piloting. there's lag issues, which really are a big consideration. and quite frankly, there's other issues i'd rather ccp work on then something that really isn't in demand at all.and really, there's no need. does anyone actually have any problems that would require this to fix them? i certainly don't."
7/5/2009,"i admit, when i saw that we weren't getting wis in the next expansion, i myself was extremely frustrated as well.... especially since i'd heard they were going to be doing some beta stuff with it at fanfest this year and stuff. oh well... *shrug* life moves on, and eve is still fun"
7/5/2009,"edit: what in the world is this thread doing in this section, by the way? i was at fanfest 2008 and got my hands on it. it exists. yet i do share your bewilderment at ccp's silence on it since then. the whole 'internet spaceships game' thing seems very derogatory and it perplexes me that eve's own fans would use it as a term of endearment.ccp has always made it clear that the goal with eve was to make good sci-fi. it only turned out to be 'internet spaceships' at launch because they needed to seriously cut back on their vision for obvious practical reasons. eve is a hell of a lot more in concept than it has had the chance to be thus far, and i can't believe you wouldn't want it to inch ever closer to fulfillment.if you think walking in stations is a betrayal of eve's essence, i'd love to see what you think of what comes ten, thirty, or one hundred years from now."
7/5/2009,"agreed. if walking in stations is implemented. then it will lead to a much more immersive universe. it will support greater role playing. it will allow our corps to hold awesome ic board meetings, it will allow eventual walking in ships. crew interaction, watching the loading/unloading of cargo.the game will become a lot more grapic and server intensive, but i'm dying to have a lot of the thinks represented by bare-bones menus to be replaced by interactive content. that said, you could still do it that way if you want/are in a hurry. but it'll be more fun. the idea of strolling around a station and meeting your agent in an office or bar seems much more entertaining then ""right click, click 'start conversation' click 'accept quest', and go."""

7/6/2009,"ccp please fix rockets, discussion on exactly how to do this can be found in this thread.see next post for a breakdown of the issues"
7/6/2009,main issue - very low applied dpsto fix this i would suggest putting these numbers on sisi for testing:increase base damage by 45%increase ev to 120 m/sdecrease drf to 1.5an explanation of why i chose those particular numbers can be found here. the spreadsheet and results of in game testing that led to these numbers can be found here:
7/6/2009,"i agree, rockets need a boost."
7/6/2009,i agree !
7/6/2009,missiles in general are so bad atm that i can't figure why anyone would use them outside of ratting. with that said i want an entire revision of the missile system and not just some tweaking here and there.however rockets are worst off atm and are in need off a fix desperately.
7/6/2009,.
7/6/2009,"heavy missiles, heavy assault and torps are not bad atm actually. would not mind them getting a little love tho like better expl velocity adn maby a bit less exp radius so torps do not require targets to be painter and webbed as much as now :).but rockets truly are horrible, need a real damage boost.one suggestion (in general) is to make the warhead upgrads (rank 5) skill more useful, currently a 2% damage peer level for a rank 5 skill is lots of sp for little gain imo. make it 3% rof bonus, or maby 3% damage bonus. that would give missiles in general some love."
7/6/2009,"/signedas someone new (5 days) and not planing on pvping soon, if i steal your loot you should be able to shoot me without concord getting involved. not sure about corp/alliance flag though (knee jerk reaction - no)."

7/6/2009,"absolutely not supported.one of the greatest things about eve is that consequences follow you wherever you go. it's what separates eve from everything else. accountability. if you buy a character without looking up that toon's reputation, then who's fault is that? yup. yours. no rez - no reroll - nothin."

7/6/2009,i am attempting to utilize my necromancy skills and revive some interest in personal storage arrays at towers. i know that it would make life a lot simpler for me.
7/6/2009,"i approve this with a live event about that.want to see the reaction of amarr empire: ""omg, wtf a capsuleers titan in amarr ?"""
7/6/2009,supported - eve needs more odd player driven quirks.the resulting forum spam could be inscribed on to the side of the ship for everyone to get a good lol at.

7/6/2009,"you select that by not posting here.that said, i'm thinking one at you right now. do you feel it?"

7/6/2009,bump.
7/6/2009,"while i agree that suicide ganking is currently risk free, high sec mining is pretty much risk free too. in this thread some pirates claim that killing 168 hulks is a good bragging number yet it must only be a tiny fraction of all the hulks in empire so the issue has been blown out of all proportion by paranoid idiots.even as a manufacturer and trader who routinely moves high value goods in empire i believe high sec is too safe and each time the whiners succeed in getting another nerf applied to high sec piracy the game gets a bit more sterile.would only support the proposal if greater risk vs reward was applied to both sides of the equation, eg by increasing concord response times in 0.4 and 0.5 and moving the best ores to these systems or some other means to make your proposal balanced.without balance this is just another step on the road to this."
7/6/2009,"not supported. insurance doesn't make suicide ganking risk free, and suicide ganking has already been nerfed. this thread is full of whiners who want highsec mining to be 100% safe - and it shouldn't be, not in a game like eve. otherwise eve loses that which makes it unique in the first place. and no, suicide ganking isn't risk free, like some in this thread are claiming. insurance might make it profitable if done right, but one runs into the risk of trying to gank a pilot who has basic fitting knowledge. in such a case, the ganker loses his ship, gets a criminal countdown, and loses sec status (which takes a very long time to recover).""realism"" is an idiotic reason to change such a game mechanic. unless those who want ""realism"" also want a 15 or so minute response delay on concord intervention."
7/6/2009,"they dont cost zero. the ships themselves cost marginally above zero; then they must be fitted.and there is a significant non-zero time factor, plus the sec hit.god we had all this last year. ccp increased the penalties for ganking already, and improved conord response time quite a bit as well. i said then that it was futile to do so because however much they increased the sec hit, carebears like you would never be satisfied until they were perfectly safe. whatever you get, you always demand more safety, more npc protection. tell you what: let's be fair. let's just remove insurance altogether."
7/6/2009,"i hear this alot in this thread. this means what ? that ganking is highsec is very unique to eve ? don't make me laugh...its a pathetic reason. first and foremost, think of the insurance company thats in eve. would you as a ceo (that tries to make isk) would want to ""give"" an insurance service to a ganker or someone that goes to low or zero sec when you know yourself that theres a high risk of losing that ship...hell no. no company or no agent would give a service to a person considered dangerous like that. your company would go bankrupt.ok, i used the story and logic behind eve to get this argument which makes sense by me. this proposal wont make ganker disappear...just more selectivep.s: i also hear lots of pirates go beserk when they hear the word carebear and hates them to their bones..well wake up, its because of them your flying that shiny ship.. lmao.. dumb a**"
7/6/2009,"the sec hit is laughable, and frankly a non-issue, since you can roll up an alt to do your shopping, and if worse comes to worse, you can roll up another gank alt in under a week. let's face it, all it has to be able to do is fly a destroyer and fit moderate weapons, as long as you can run in a pack. hell you can eve go ratting and get your security hit back. so don't feed me this ""we lose security status"" like it actually means anything to you. if it meant something, you wouldn't be ganking people, amirite?as for the rest of it - no, i don't want to be completely safe. i do, however, demand that people suffer the consequences for their choices. i chose to undock my ship, so yes, that means i chose to be available for non-consenual pvp - absolutely. nothing i can about that, except fit the best tank i can, and hope it's enough.however, you chose to throw your ship away - you chose to lose that ship, it's fittings, and the related sec status for attacking a neutral target in high security space. so come down off your ""save the gankers"" high horse like you're some kind of a martyr for suffering those things. you nailed yourself to that cross."
7/6/2009,"i am neutral on this topic.but...how about a 3-7 day cooldown period on insurance (just pick a reasonable timeframe) where basic insurance is refused and better packages cannot even be bought if you have recently lost your ship within this period for whatever reason?maybe just exclude t1 frigates from this rule...so many things are time-based in eve, why not insurance?~lagruna zegata"
7/6/2009,this.
7/6/2009,as in forbidding certain players docking privileges in empire space or destroying their pods in empire space etc? got to admit i like the way you think guy.
7/6/2009,banning insurance payouts to people killed by concord is long overdue. was promised several expansions back and patience is running short.
7/6/2009,not supported.eve is already colorful enough as it is with its colored ammo and rainbowlaz0rs
7/6/2009,in that case it is clearly in your best interest to support this proposal. paint your ships in shades of black and enjoy fewer colours on your display.
7/6/2009,"the login issues spawns from the fact that you are being bounced around in the load balancer.the csm already dealt with this issue last year. ccp isn't going to touch this forum code, but they are working on a new forum."
7/6/2009,"that's a ****ty logic on their part then. if something is broken that bad, it's worth working on even if it's to only have a temporary workaround in place. working on a new forum is not an excuse for leaving the old one broken like this.besides, the new forum could be months away (if not years)! do you really want to wait that long with this bug around?it's really getting out of hand. everybody who uses forums enough complain about it. if they tell me a new forum will be release within the end of the summer, then i'll wait. if it's any longer than that, i'd like a quick fix please!"
7/6/2009,"ah! i didn't see that post since i rarely go in the general forum... thanks for bringing it up.as for not finding the easy button, well, i never said it was easy to fix as i don't know how they programmed it in the first place. i do know however that asp really sucks to manage"
7/6/2009,"when im mining and see in the scan overview (not the main overview) tat roid is low in ore, then i chek where is the turret moving cycle at in console to determine when to turn it off. then i target another roid, turn off turret when i think current cycle point corresponds to quantity left in roid and restart it at newly locked roid -so turret wont be mining an empty roid to cycle end. to illustrate a little, say if cycle of laser is at half and quantity in roid is 6k ores, i turn it off, due to miners do around 12k a cycle. problem is i have no idea wat turret is targeting wat roid, so many times i end up turning off the wrong turret. there is not even a marker in scan overview. my suggestion is to assign different numbers, symbols, colors or something to turrets and to the corresponding marker in both the main and scanner overview to be able to see wat turret is targeting wat roid."
7/6/2009,double click on the mining turret indicator besides the locked roid?
7/6/2009,please read complete post
7/6/2009,"yeah i did. or is the problem that you cant get the correlation between your survey scanner and overview? sorry but it really isnt clear from your posts. because you say the problem is disabling the miner which is targetting a specific roid, that isnt hard, double clicking will do that."
7/6/2009,"ty, i updated the post to be more explanatory."
7/6/2009,"i support what he wants. basically what he means is, when you use a survey scanner, it doesn't show you which rocks in the scan results you already have targeted, so it's very hard to know if your rock is about to pop.you have to select each rock in the survey results one by one so the camera snaps on the rock in space, but this is the only visual help you get.a simple thing would be to highlight targeted survey results in a different color (i.e. green background or something similar), and also select the corresponding target when you click on the line. you can then click the turret icon next to that target to disable it."
7/6/2009,"if i'm reading the op right(which isn't easy to be sure of, because his writing is godawful), then this makes sense, and i can support it."
7/6/2009,"kaylan's post seems to make sense of the runon dribbling in the op. i'm ok with that, though tbh, i've never really had much trouble telling the roids apart, since you use the distance marker in the survey scanner to id them (or at least narrow the list to two or three possible choices)."
7/6/2009,"the survey scanner already does this part, actually.or at least it does on my windows vista client. that's how i tell which rocks in the list i am currently mining sometimes."
7/6/2009,"right, but if they are almost all at the same range, then you have to click on each of them until you find the right one. a simple highlighting would solve that really well."
7/6/2009,"no. and quite frankly, your ideas will be better received if you use proper grammar, sentence structure and grammar."
7/6/2009,"when ship is under attak, computer voice should alert as to when roid is depleted. then continously play an alert sound until u turn alert off or attak stops. sometimes im mining and managing my skills and have no idea my ship is being attaked (iim usually zoom out because dont like to hear mining lasers all the time so i cant hear attak either)"
7/6/2009,"yes, let's make afk miners' and macro writers' lives even easier.hell no!"
7/6/2009,"wow, i mean u r taking tat to a level where normal players are also affected. sometime i want to be managing my skills or doing corp stuff while mining and i have all the right to do tat. so if tat makes me and afk miner i have the right to b one. and as a miner i see the usefulness of computer voice alerting when ship under attak."
7/6/2009,"drones. get them, use them, turn them to aggressive.salvage the wrecks later."
7/6/2009,problem is if a can flipper shows up then my ship is history.
7/6/2009,"pay attention while mining? use a mining ship that can actually tank the frigates when they show up?if that's too boring for you, consider joining the help channel and assist noobs while you do it."
7/6/2009,i have never had my drones auto attack a can flipper. typically they only fire back when i am fired upon.edit: fail at quoting.
7/6/2009,great logic. good for progress. lets not have traffic lights. ppl should pay attention. lets not have cell phones. wait till u get home. alarm cloks are useless. be more aware of the time. lets get rid of honks of cars. ppl need to pay attention.
7/6/2009,"seriously?bad troll, 0/10. -1 for mentioning alarm clocks."
7/6/2009,macro programs can't detect specific sounds being played as triggers to do something specific. so i don't see a problem with that and support this.
7/6/2009,"eve has sound? </obligatory>seriously, sure. anyone who needs this is playing the game very wrong, but it should probably be included anyways."
7/6/2009,"i support the idea... however, should the sound react on rats and people attacking you or only on people, or could you change it or ould you have different sounds?"
7/6/2009,"from a mostly-a-carebear point of view, not supported. if you are in space, you should be paying attention, or be prepared to pay the consequences of not paying attention. if you want to manage your skills in a 100% safe environment, then dock up first.you can also drag your character sheet around so that it doesn't cover up your overview; then you can do both at the same time."
7/6/2009,"the only reason this would ""need"" to be implemented is for afkers. no support. play the stupid game.--isaac"
7/6/2009,"they dont need to. they just need to detect the line of code that requests the sound to be played.hell, client side modification can accomplish this already and 'warning noise on being locked' along with 'warning noise on damage notification' are listed as features of a ratting macro exposed here fairly recently."
7/6/2009,"you should be paying attention to the overview if you are playing and not be playing afkish its really, easy to spot a hostile npc or players already if you at least pay attention (even if your eyes are somewhere else).if you are mining deploy a few drones and set them on aggressive and your problem is solved."
7/6/2009,well it doesn't actually work like that but whatever. i still don't think this would be a bad thing and i don't use macro programs.
7/6/2009,"not supported. i tend to do other stuff when i mine, but unlike the op, i think its reasonable that there should be consequences for not paying attention."
7/6/2009,im not even involved in faction warfare. yet i think it's only fair. (no pun intended).supported.
7/6/2009,"i love the new exploration system however there is one aspect of the system that bothers me...a lot. for those of us who are unable to log on right after down time, you ever notice when you log on later on in the day, a good deal of the exploration sites have been cleared out? in terms of balance, this is not fair to those who don't have the luxury of getting up at odd hours of the morning/night to go get to the newest exploration site. my proposal is that, much like the ending time of a wormhole for example, all explorations sites should also have a generation time i.e. a time in which they will appear in a solar system. by not having all sites generate after downtime, this will allow those in different time zones an equal chance of getting to run the site without being left with partially taken radar sites and mined out grav sites."
7/6/2009,"you do know that as soon as a site is completed in a region, a new site will spawn within that region?"
7/6/2009,"are you sure about this? i've scanned a few systems on a few different occasions within the same day and it seems that new sites don't seem to appear within the 2-hour time frame. if new sites do appear within the region as other sites are completed, this would be the solution to the issue however i had been told that no new sites appear after downtime when inquiring on this on the exploration channel in eve."
7/6/2009,"i agree there should be regular spawns of exploration sites throughout the day, and not just a mass of spawns at the beginning of the day (after downtime), if they indeed only spawn once every 24 hours only. ccp would have to confirm this."
7/6/2009,i don't see a problem. i do most of my scanning in the late evening hours of my north american timezone (a good twelve hours after uptime) and i have very little trouble locating systems with sites to find.
7/6/2009,you should see how goons name their stations before suggesting stuff like that.
7/6/2009,case in point. not supported.

7/6/2009,"i don't see why it shouldn't be possible to bribe pirate factions to increase standings up to -2.0, so that the worst agents could be used as a starting point. i mean, come on, they're pirates, money is everything to them.of course, donating large sums of money to pirate organizations might get the attention of the officials, and faction / security ratings might be adjusted a bit as well."
7/6/2009,"when im looking for systems with a security level, map shows colors accordingly but some either have same color or is difficult to tell (ie, .7 and .8, both green). it would be better if instead of showing a colored dot, a number: ie, .7 instead of showing a green dot, a number 7."
7/6/2009,"your threads are all suspiciously geared towards making macro-mining easier. ccp, will you please look into that guy's operations/ :)"
7/6/2009,"because macro miners would be helped by this how exactly?the only one really helped by this are i guess pirates with low sec status, but not very low, who want to go arround systems with too high sec status. personally i wont support it, because i have serious doubts it will solve anything. a large mass of numbers wont make it clearer, use one of the pdf version eve maps to plot your route then. a better solution (i think) would be if autopilot could just avoid systems with a sec status higher than x and lower than y."
7/6/2009,"well, usually i think that if u zoom all the way out the map i think a mass of colors are no more useful than a mass of numbers. sometimes when im looking for certain level to mine to go to system where i can handle the rats i zoom the map all the way in. and i have to hover the mouse over the dots to see wats their security level which i think defeats in some measure the purpose of coloring the dots anyway."
7/6/2009,"the macro mining argument is baseless and silly, but the op is asking for a noticeably worse way to represent data. if you want to know the sec status of a system, hover over it. you can't put that many numbers onto a map as dense at the eve star map and have them stay readable."
7/6/2009,um. no. its fairly easy as it is.
7/6/2009,"greetings fellow pod pilots,i haven't played eve in a really long time, and i've been back since a few days, so please forgive me if my idea is complete and utter madnesstoday i was thinking about going out for a hunt in ""jet"", my little assault ship, possibly for a lonely miner. after some 20 minutes of wandering through low security space this stream of thought switches on in my mind; it's a shame we can't go after the lone miners in high sec. i'd usually discard these ideas immediately, but not this time... and this is where you guys come to give me a kick in the back (i'll understand it was a blasphemous thought from the get go) or elaborate on it with mekeep in mind this is involving high security systems. instead of the concord coming -within seconds- to the miner's aid when engaged by a bearded man with a patch on his eye and dispatch the unlucky criminal in a jiffy, you get organized mining corporations with security wings. so on their regular outings they are always protected by their own private security fleetso you might ask what would the newbie miner do if they're all big corporations taking care of extracting minerals? eve is famous for its player run economy, so no shortage of openings in said corporations for our newbie miners is to be expected!the bearded (and shaved) pirate might be more lucky finding a bold miner all by himself without the concord coming in to shoot him (after he killed the miner probably)concord could still take care of maintaining the law in 'empire' asteroid belts for example, where the a percentage of the ore extracted goes to one of the 4 empires. a place for newbies to start maybethe status quo, in my opinion greatly encourages isk farming, other than seriously reducing the more exciting aspect of being a miner (always having to keep an eye open) and of the small time pirate looking for a bit of fun, where in the current situation has to either gate camp or be a statistic having dealt 1% damage in the next blob killstrict policies may be put in place to prevent high security space becoming an open killing field, of courseagain, i beg for forgiveness if i just made you waste your time in case this was another crazy idea of mine-cheers,small time pirate with very dull prospects for his future"
7/6/2009,"i'm not against pvp per se, nor am i against the idea that mining operations should be bringing their own security with them. what i don't want is gatecamps on asteroid belts to the extent that it suddenly becomes necessary for every mining operation to have a 20 bs fleet escorting it.so though i say no now, understand that it's not the idea of pvp i'm arguing against, despite being a member of the species ursus caveo. i'm simply trying to protect the idea that there are places where you can go to mine without being hounded constantly by asshats with guns."
7/6/2009,"in practice this will never happen, because ccp's subscriber base is predominantly carebear. for that matter, i'm not sure that it should. mining is already lame, there is no conceivable reason it needs to be made worse by giving them a specific vulnerability to pirates, and if you're proposing that highsec be turned into lowsec, i'd support that even less."
7/6/2009,so you punish the guys who are mostlikely building your ships or mine the ore to build your ships? if you dont like they earn money with supplying you. maybe start mining yourself and get a chunk of the isk cake. but be warned mining is not exciting.not supported.
7/6/2009,wut?? i get plenty of excitement while i mine. perusing the forums is never boring...
7/6/2009,"i'm not saying i'm supporting the idea, but this argument seems one sided. this is one of those things that would balance out. the prices of ships would go up, and miners would be able to pay out their protection. but i also think this would escalate into something stupid - think of the p-wars and jihadswarm. they took a great concept and pushed it beyond it's limits. the same would happen here. (i miss the p-wars )"
7/6/2009,just remove naval faction spawns for outlaws and prevent people from hopping corp in the 12 hours prior to a wardec going live until 12 hours after the war dec has gone live.there is your highsec pvpsup carebears
7/6/2009,"actually, i'll go you one better and say that if a person leaves a corp during a war dec, the wt status follows the former member for a period of time (i think i once proposed 7 days) or until the war ends, which ever is shorter.carebear or not, corp hopping to avoid a war dec is fail, imo."
7/6/2009,if you detail that carefully in a proposal i can pretty much guarantee an armada of -10's supporting it.
7/6/2009,"i think we all see these proposals far too often... although it does seem more reasonable then most of the ""remove concord so we pirates can gank all the noobs"" crap that is usually what is posted.still, no, high-sec doesn't need to become less secure. this would just be a nightmare for the new players"
7/6/2009,"eris only got 5 turrets hardpoints, since 1 more high slot is used for the interdiction sphere launcher, the other 2 high slot should be fitted with 2 launchers... is this a joke?eris got a bonus for light missiles, so you could say that one could fit 4 launchers and 4 turrets, but we all know that it just don't work well on this ship.the sabre got a bonus to turrets falloff, this clearly show that there is no need for the launcher bonus for every ship.becouse of these considerations, i propose to give the eris 2 more turrets hardpoints and change it's bonus for a turret one (optimal range or bonus, or rof for example).if you do not agree with me you should really try an eris and see how bad it is compared to the other dictors."
7/6/2009,increase in drones subwarpspeed per level
7/6/2009,why? there is a skill called drone navigation and it makes your drones go a lot fast already. whats the point for another skill then.
7/6/2009,"it only increase their speed while mwding. this skills would increase their speed while not mwding. i think it's a good idea, there should eb a way to do it, but wouldn't mind if drone navigation was simply changed to give a 5% increase/level to drone speed (so both when mwding and when not mwding) instead of just drone mwd speed."
7/6/2009,"i can see how it could be useful, for example, to increase orbit speed so your drones are harder to track.name: drone maneuveringtraining time multiplier: 5 xdescription: ""increases drone orbit velocity. 2% increase to drone orbit velocity per skill level.""primary attribute: intelligencesecondary attribute: perceptionrequirements:drones vdrone navigation ivas an example, this would make the warrior light scout drone orbit at 825m/s instead of 750m/s at level 5."
7/6/2009,i'm not particularly interested in buffing your afk missionrunning domi by cutting travel times by 1/3rd and decreasing the time it takes for your drones to clear a room.
7/6/2009,"the whole reason drone navigation was changed away from applying all the time was that drones started out-tracking themselves if you got your navigation skill too high. i don't want to recreate that situation. also, this is a totally unnecessary skill. not supported."
7/6/2009,"i can<U+FFFD>t see what this should be good for? drones are alredy at their edge of tracking. if they are not fast enough for a specific target, they mwd to follow, which works just fine.and there<U+FFFD>s really no need for more dronekills at all. we already have an abundance of rank 5 skills there.not supported."
7/6/2009,this is your second proposal that would make life easier for macro users and afk players. hmm. what you want is drone navigation
7/6/2009,this would be a great addition to the tatical overlay.
7/6/2009,"i'd imagine a series of concentric circles with range markers on them would do the trick?i find the scanner to be quite intuitive as it is, simply click on your ship to get box round your ship and the tactical overlay and box work together as a kind of crosshair. that said new toys are always nice."
7/6/2009,"wtb ""reply"" link that doesn't put multiple session ids into the url.in any case, there used to be a feature similar to this. ccp removed it for whatever reason. would like to have it back. i know that there is a super 1337 scanner pro in this thread, but for the rest of us it would be nice to have this extra tool."
7/6/2009,"eve should be difficult to master because it has depth, not because of a crappy ui. supported."
7/6/2009,"they could use something like the tactical overlay for this when you arent in the system map and the basis is there in the system map too, tbh. seems that all this would require is a modification of existing tools. yes, i know that may be easier said than done."
7/6/2009,forgot to support.
7/6/2009,"not supportedtry using your alt key. the feature exists, you're just not using it ;)"
7/6/2009,"are you in a bad mood today or what?if you read my post completely you'd know i already use the alt key, but it's not good enough!"

7/6/2009,"i'm in a fantastic mood. eleven cups of coffee will do that to ya. no, no - you've got me all wrong, i'm really just an *******.the alt key works pretty well for me and everyone else i've trained to use it. is your alt key broken?lemme put this in context. i tend to object to your ideas because they tend to be ""make things easier"" ideas. some things should be easier, but usually the things you point out already have tools that exist for them, or shouldn't be made easier. sometimes your logic baffles the hell out of me - which is why i went after you when you started spouting off about ""i know ms sql, so i know tranquility"" nonsense (that's a square-peg-round-hole argument). you need to understand that i respect you for what you're trying to bring to the game - innovation and new ideas. i also genuinely like some of your ideas. i generally heartily disagree with your usual arguments of ""this should be implemented because i feel like it"". in this case, you really have no justification for implementing a feature that is already implemented."
7/6/2009,"ccp had announced extra attention to the lag issue in the q&a. and here we go : dierdra reports a supposed fix had worked well, which they tried yesterday in a noticeable fleet.read up on the facts and figures on the ""issues, workarounds & localization"" forum, the thread called ""fighting lag: faction warfare edition, round two!"", page 4 ff."
7/6/2009,"tell you what sparky - how about you fix it now i'm pretty sure that ccp knows what's goin on and it's probably not a quick switch flip. ""oh sven - why don't you hit the 'fast' switch over there on the wall. yeah - that one. ok, good - scratch that one off the list.""not supported because this is not a proposal, this is a whine."
7/6/2009,"basically, add a new popup yes/no warning when you're about to warp out while your drones are still in space. clicking no cancels the warp, clicking yes initiates it, and checking ""never show again"" would never show the warning again (oh really?)."
7/6/2009,/supporting myself
7/6/2009,"not supported.if i'm running away in a panic, the last thing i want is to have to click a little tiny confirm screen. i will already be busy watching my ship get destroyed and be spamming the warp button."
7/6/2009,"can't support, both because when you need to warp out you need to warp out now and because it's one of the things that separates good drone users form bad ones."
7/6/2009,"did you read my suggestion? if you check the ""never show again"" box the first time it pops up, you won't ever see it again, same as all other warnings."
7/6/2009,this is an attempt at making eve idiot-proof. this would be a bad thing so i'm going to say no.
7/6/2009,"thing is, i don't want this box to pop up as i'm trying to warp/jump out a moros whose sentry drones have deployed 25km away-especially when i need it to get the heck out of dodge *now*! might be nice for missioners that are too inattentive to notice their drones are still in the belt/mission site, but this is eve. you should be punished for ignorance-it's the only way to learn."
7/6/2009,"i am guilty of leaving drones in a belt. but after i did it a time or two and had to go back to get them, i learned to pay attention before i warp off.it would be wrong of us to deprive future players of this valuable learning eexperience.not supported"
7/6/2009,"what the hell? i don't understand any of these arguments, honestly. it's a simple warning message! it's not recalling drones for you, it's just letting you know you're about to warp out while they are still out.there's warnings for when you're about to attack someone in high-sec for the first time, there's warnings for when you're about to jettison something, but you can't have a simple warning for when you're about to warp out with drones out?your logic makes no sense at all. it would not break game balance, and wouldn't have any impact for the ones who don't want this (cause they can check it off the first time it pops up).if you leave all warnings enabled, eve is already pretty much idiot proof, except for this thing. some of you probably forgot how many warnings you get when they are all enabled, so i suggest you go in your options and reset them all just to remember.as for learning from your mistakes, well. i know plenty of veterans that still forget to recall drones once in a while before they warp, so i know many would still like this. everybody in my corp did anyway... guess i'm gonna have to ask them to come here to support this post then.again, you didn't read. how hard would it be to warp somewhere with drones out once on purpose, and check the box on the warning so it never shows up again for you?"
7/6/2009,supported because it can be turned off like all the other warnings.
7/6/2009,not supported. if you leave your drones in the first place thats your problem. what is this? hello kitty online?
7/6/2009,i support it...just have another button in the drone settings to turn on and off and it should be fine...basically if your pvp it would be off so when u try to warp it want give a warning msg saying u will leave your drones and then you die...and pve people would more than likely want it on so there drones don't die when they warp off...
7/6/2009,"supported. if there is a warning that pops up when you jump into lowsec to let you know you may get shot at, i see no problem with reminding the absent minded miner that a drone hasn't yet returned.ts"
7/6/2009,"i am going to revise my stance, after some further thought. it would probably have been nice, as a new player, to get some kind of notification that i'd left valuable assets laying about on the grid.as long as the ""don't show me again"" box gets implemented, i've no problem with it."
7/6/2009,"thanks de, i appreciate this! and yes, the warning popups are all the same. they all have the option to be turned off via a ""never show me again"" checkbox, and can all be reset in the reset settings tab of the game's options. this one wouldn't be different.cheers!"
7/6/2009,"i don<U+FFFD>t like it.everytime you make a new client setup, one of the most important things is to turn off all warnings that might get you killed. this would be just one more of them.and besides, what would be next?""warning! you are about to undock. are you sure you want to do this? space outside the station-environment might not be safe! y/n"""
7/6/2009,"totally supported.and seriously, the hello kitty joke is so old and that it tripped and broke its hip and so it became lame."
7/6/2009,"not supported.eve is one of those environments that gives the lesson after the test. you lose enough drones and you'll figure it out. it's not like drone expenses have broken anyone's bank. well, not since invention anyway."
7/6/2009,"i support the idea, but not sure about a pop-up maybe just a box similar to when taking damage letting the person know they still have drones out but doesn't effect their ability to jump when needed or have to turn it off."
7/6/2009,supported.
7/6/2009,hmmm - how about a global block on goonies?supported - i don't see why this *shouldn't* be an option.
7/6/2009,wouldn't use it but i'd say why not.

7/6/2009,"i don't know about you guys but i'm sick and tired of my credit card company charging me some silly foreign transaction fee for my subscription to eve. for me, it may only be 40 cents or so but the credit card company doesn't deserve it for doing nothing. one way around this fee is to pay by paypal however if you do this, ccp requires you to pay monthly manually every time which can get to be a pain if you have a bad memory for things like paying bills like me. i went to paypal's website and found out that there is a way to set up recurring payments directly through them. i propose that ccp create a way to accept recurring payments by simply publishing their paypal email address and then linking the payee with the eve account so we can forever say goodbye to these greedy scamming credit card companies once and for all."
7/6/2009,"i won't get into a debate over the ethics of credit card companies, but the proposal to have recurring paypal payments instead of needing to manual every time i do support."
7/6/2009,"i see no reason why paypal payments can't be made automagically, since paypal supports it."
7/6/2009,it is also safer to use paypal. i really like this. i already submitted a ettion on this matter. and i do suport the idea.
7/6/2009,"a slider bar. it's always frustrating when you're trying to scan something but don't want the 5 degree setting or the 30 degree setting. it always seems that 15 degrees is just too damn hard to get. so, either make it a drop down box or allow people to just enter a number."
7/6/2009,no no no please not another damn text menu. if anything the slide bar should be applied to things like orbit distance to make choosing between fighting in opitmal / falloff / edge of point easier.if it's really such a problem for you go to control panel and slow your mouse cursor down or simply learn to hold a mouse properly.
7/6/2009,"i agree with yani here, but why not use keyboard shortcuts ? this game lacks lots of shortcuts."
7/6/2009,"the solution is simple. leave it as it is currently, but have the number change inside an input box when you move the slider. you can either use the slider, or type it in manually.if you type it in and tab out, the slider changes to reflect the change and vice versa."
7/6/2009,"how about just spacing out the points so that they're all evenly spread, instead of being a linear relation to the angle?"

7/6/2009,"the only change i'd consider would be keeping the 1 jump/24 hours, but allow you to have an extra one buffered up, so you could jc to empire, buy some skillbooks and then jc back to 0.0 again. after 24 hours, you can make one jump again, after 48 hours, you have 2 jumps available to you, but after that it stops increasing, just like now."
7/6/2009,no idea why my previous reply here was removed but again: no. and especially not by half.i could see room for a rank 8 skill which reduces the cooldown by.. say.. 1 hour per level but it's not necessary.
7/6/2009,"while it would be nice when you live in paragon soul, the ore systems, or some far away part of 0.0 to get skill books and jump right back, this removes some of the risk from living in deep 0.0. it also removes one of the more interesting economies from the game: resale of npc seeded skillbooks in 0.0. eve needs more player interaction and forcing people to fly for skillbooks if they want it now, is a good one."
7/6/2009,there's little chance of a cockpit view ever happening in terms of ship piloting purely because of the fact that it completely contradicts the game's backstory and setting. ships are flown from the confines of a capsule. the only cockpit based flight is that of npcs and fighter pilots.i wouldn't be opposed to twitch based ship control and a cockpit view if the ability to pilot a fighter was ever made possible. i think doing so was something very briefly discussed and vaguely at fanfest 08 as something ccp may consider in future.
7/6/2009,"more inconvenience and more things to click to do the same thing you can do with a regular cargo bay. blackops have a fuel bay because they need a lot of fuel and aren't meant to be haulers, it's a specific need that couldnt be easily addressed any other way. sifting through 7 divisions of a corporate hangar array is enough for me. if you want to let's continue the discussion in the original thread about the idea."

7/6/2009,"all of which you have listed missed the point. i am trying to make selling stuff out of restricted corp hanger... to corp members not take a significant amount of time. it is a colossal pain in the ass for ppl with the roles to do so. a few of the problems with with the current system are:1. larger corps need to have the ability to sell items/ships to corp members. this requires they give more and more ppl director roles in order to unable them to sell from restricted corp hangar. this increases this risk of corp theft because of the need to add more and more directors to handle purchase requests.2. it takes a ridiculous amount of time to take out all individual items being purchased and give them to the member. it makes it infinitely worse if you are not in station with them.3. a simple store or automatic setting of prices for all items within the hangar that want to be sold could easily be programmed. it would reduce the over head ***** work needed to run many alliances.4. corp contracts are a headache to set up for every damn item. and it gets exponentially bad when ppl want there own set ups and not a prefit exact setup that the corp makes.my proposal: simply add a store tab to the corp hangars that would allow a director to set prices on all items within the hangar. any time any module is dropped in this hangar, it will automatically be priced and ready to be bought. you could also make a restriction per a corp member on amount bought or items bought to keep people from buying out the store. these restrictions could be set per the role you have in the corpthe point of this is to reduce the overhead running of larger corps and i think the feature could easily be added to the game via the corp hangar or via a special market tab. this same sort of time saving features have been set up in countless other mmos and it is about time eve online joined their ranks. obviously this is not a polished idea and i look forward to your comments and suggestions. please bring this up at the next csm. thank you-gv"

7/7/2009,agreed
7/7/2009,"and let's ignore the counter-arguments to this issue, while we're at it! gooooooo csm!!!"
7/7/2009,"you've just repeatedly stated that afs are overpowered, giving frankly unbelievable anecdotes as proof. i don't see any new points to address. perhaps you'd care to state your arguments clearly for me, i might be missing something?besides, this has already been forwarded to and approved by the csm. of course i'm glad the topic is still active, hopefully is attracting plenty of attention to the issue."
7/7/2009,"firstly, the anecdote was legitimate- whether or not you choose to accept it- however at this point, that's not my argument.secondly, i'm not asking for an af nerf- i'm saying that they're fine as is- and if anything overpowered.as for my argument, you've stated that the relationship between t1 frigates and t1 cruisers is balanced, and that it is the equivalent of the relationship between t2 frigates and t2 cruisers- therefore, you've argued yourself that the relationship between t2 frigates and t2 cruisers is even.additionally:afs are harder to hit than cruisers, therefore tank better by defaultafs have ridiculously high resistances- it's not hard to get >80% across the board, which means excellent active tanks, and ridiculously good remote rep (1 large remote rep on an 80% resistance tanks 426 dps- not even factoring in the size of the ship)afs cost a fraction of the price of t2 ships of other classes- a vengeance costs literally 1/7th the cost of a zealot in jita, and take about 1/3 the time to skill intoa competent af pilot will engage t2 cruisers, and leave if the fight doesn't go their way- i've engaged pilgrims, ishtars, deimos', to name a few in my afevery af has a role- but no af has every rolethe main argument for afs not receiving a boost is something that's hard for a lot of people to fathom. it's that their mobility is their greatest asset- you can really choose your fights if you know what you're doing, and if people aren't specifically set up to kill you (railguns on a deimos to catch an orbiting af? a full nano pilgrim to catch an mwd af in neut range?) then you can kill them with ease. what you cannot do with afs is go rambo into any fight with any ship and expect to win. you need to be cautious- if you're in a blaster harpy, you probably shouldn't be going after that vexor with small guns & drones. if you're in a rocket vengeance, your targets should be other afs and frigates- not cruisers.afs are not, and should not become 'i win' buttons. a competent af pilot should be capable of taking out some, but not all cruisers- and of course the occasional lucky kill of a better ship. i believe this is the case currently, for the long list of reasons stated above.i would appreciate some input from our delegates, if any of them have the cajones to actually make arguments for this buff rather than just apologies for the wall of text :)"
7/7/2009,"anecdotal evidence is still, you know, anecdotal and does not really add much.i don't believe everyone here is advocating a buff, but a coherent design with t2 ships. a fourth bonus does not necessary mean a better ship if it is rebalanced in the process. but coherency aside, there are some nagging issues with afs. for instance why should i bother with gallente afs when the taranis hits harder, fly faster and actually can withstand quite a beating? sure there are specific situations, but is this how it should be in general?"
7/7/2009,"if they're rebalanced in the process, sure- but quite frankly, they're fine as is, and while adding a 4th bonus might make them more coherent, the rebalancing entailed would just create more work that ccp doesn't need, with no gain. as for gallente afs vs 'ranis, that sounds like you'd be advocating a nerf of the 'ranis rather than a buff of afs- however if your 'ranis would like to 1v1 my ishkur, i'd be happy to oblige :)"
7/7/2009,supportedit seems to me that the general opinion among eve players is that rockets need to be boosted
7/7/2009,"i would personally love to see actual rocket barrages. much like the robotech (macross plus) rockets/missiles: click here for an exampleinstead of being fired like normal missiles, rockets would fire in bursts of several rockets. rockets would do more damage individually, but have less precision and possibly have a chance to miss. since rockets are so small, they should also be unguided (thus the need for a barrage).the range should also be slightly increased (should be faster), but shooting a target at longer range would mean you'd have more chances to miss due to their unguided nature. (much like torpedoes)"
7/7/2009,"explosion radius and explosion velocity both have to be buffed, that's an absolute minimum change. but that alone will not fix the problem. rocket damage must be increased to at least such a point that un-bonused, (non-blaster) small turrets do not out-damage them on ships which actually have a rocket weapon bonus ffs."

7/7/2009,"i agree, arazu and lachesis have the disruption bonus so they are very good tackling ships. but after the speed nerf u can't speed tank it and that was pretty much the only way to tank it. right now it needs it's rsd bonuses back so it can kill the lock on the ships they're tackling otherwise you're dead in a matter of seconds..."
7/7/2009,"when rigs were first introduced into this game, the idea was ""would you be willing to pay for the extra ump?"". when this patch was first announced, i like the idea because i and many others were under the impression that smaller rigs would be smaller bonuses for less cost. instead, what we're getting is cheaper ways to fit smaller ships. by doing this, not only are smaller ships going to be very easy to rig so much that it will be stupid not to rig them, but large rigs will likely drop in price drastically too because the demand on that grouping of rigs will drop heavily when frigs and cruiser will be using a different set for much lower cost.the issue i have with this patch is, it's removing the choice to fit rigs and replacing it with the necessity to fit rigs. at such low cost per rig, the choice not to fit a rig becomes as irrelevant as someone choosing not to fit their last high slot, or someone who has a 6 slot tank on a geddon. ultimately, it's removing choice and reward for choice and replacing it with common sense vs the lack there of. it's just another step towards cookie cutter bull**** gaming and that's why pvp is becoming so monotonous. in todays game, you get to see choices (less than in the past, but still some). with the issue of rigging a frigate for instance, it's usually about a 4k m/s frig going against a 6k m/s frigate. one shells out the cost for more umph. the other chooses not to. it doesn't dictate the fight, but it does factor into the fight.if the patch goes through as intended, instead what you'll see is every frig racing around at 6k m/s, b/c to justify not spending 500k to 2 mil on 3 rigs is just lunacy and stupidity. not only is this bad for diversity of game play, it's also bad for balance of ships. if everyone is fitting rigs rather than just some, it will re-tweak balance issues between ships. you're going to see more speed, more range, more hp added into the game overall which is going to affect the balance between levels of ships classes. while i don't' ask that people support the below, i do ask that everyone support the dislike of what this patch will bring. it's another set in the direction of cookie cutter bull**** pvp.=================the alternative which makes more sense to this is simple... more expensive rigs with greater bonuses, and cheaper rigs will lesser bonuses. a cheap rig would typically get about 1/3 the bonus of a large rig, but for 1/3 the cost. what that option does better than the proposed patch is simple, it provides benefits to those willing to scale cost vs reward still. it's essentially the middle ground b/t what we have now, and and the extremely ghetto proposed patch.ultimately, the point is, allow people to close the gap b/t those who are rich and those who are poor, but please please don't just make everyone get the same buffs for nothing.===============further explanation on why this is bad. currently, i often choose not to rig a small or medium size ship b/c i do not like the cost vs reward. i knowingly make the choice to put myself at a disadvantage and force myself to go beat better equipped ships with my skill rather than my fit. but when cost becomes a non factor, i'm getting more of an advantage over someone w/o really doing anything different. rigs are currently equivalent to the choice between fitting ship standard, faction, or complex. by removing this model, you're removing half of what makes ships diversified. and diversity is what makes pvp interesting."
7/7/2009,"supported and let me add this... under the proposed patch, unless prices change radically from what they're proposing:to rig a frigate's 3 slots will cost less than 1 tech 2 1mn mwd.to rig a battle cruiser's 3 slots will cost less than or equal to it's t2 guns.with those cost, how will virtually anyone not justify rigging their ship. bye bye prized ships, hello standard fits."
7/7/2009,"i support the general idea that pvp ships should be more expensive to lose. i don't like how easy money making has become in this game, and how ccp seem to be interested in making it cheaper and more meaningless"
7/7/2009,"with the current proposed rig changes it is a must-have to rig your ship, no matter what.the current rules proposed by the patch are to tight, there is no room left to play around.it is well explained in the op that not-rigging is as much as an option as not using your low slots for an armor tanker - you can do that but it is completely nonsense. with other words: a must have.a ruleset which basically enforces you to do something if you still want to be up to par is not a change for the better, it removes choice and variations."
7/7/2009,supported. i would be interested to see counter-arguments to this proposal-- op does an excellent job of proving their point.
7/7/2009,"not supported. at the moment rig slots on medium and especially small ships are essentially useless. while you can rig them, it's somewhat idiotic to do so. also, the patch should also make t2 rigs more reasonable, so if you want to be able to pay more for extra umph, they'll actually be an option.also, i don't see how allowing rigs on smaller ships more easily, which are intended to increase diversity, would do the opposite. particularly if ccp rebalances them correctly like they claim they will."
7/7/2009,"i like the concept behind ccp's idea, but i was very surprised to hear that rigs for medium-sized (cruiser) ships would be 20% the price of large (current) rigs, and that rigs for small-sized (frigae) ships would be 4% the price.that's too aggressive scaling, and will indeed produce the effect you're complaining about, where fitting rigs will be mandatory. according to the dev blog, a frigate rig is projected to cost between 100k and 1m isk.when i proposed sized rigs last year, my suggestion as much less aggressively scaled: small rigs should be 10% of the cost of large rigs, and medium rigs should be something like 30%-40% of the cost of large rigs.and perhaps even that was too aggressive. perhaps medium rigs should be half cost, and small rigs be 25% cost?i want to be able to rig my cruisers and frigates, without revealing to the world the fact that i'm a fool with far too many isk and far too little common sense, but i do agree with you that variety is highly desirable, and obviously if all frigates are rigged then there is no frigate-variety.so, what would be an appropriate scaling? 100%/20%/5% obviously isn't it. my original proposal, which was from last year and wasn't not thought through in terms of numbers but simply contained numbers because some numbers should be there, was 100%/40%/10%.what about 100%/50%/20%?also keep in mind that caldari carebears (like me) already fit their passive drakes with shield tanking rigs. that's not the issue. a battlecruiser is almost a battleship. the issue is frigates and cruisers, and also destroyers for those of you who can stomach the idea of flying a combat ship with no tubes."
7/7/2009,"i disagree. sized rigs are leveling the playing field for those who couldnt afford to fit rigs. pay more for more umph? its still the case, just more in line for average joe. ever since rigs were introduced, they should have been available for all ship sizes, but logic failures (and people being lazy about salvage) prevented that and thus we have the current price points (there were never any npc buyers to suggest a price either). it sounds more like a whine than a justification because you are worried about your over-priced rigged tiny ships losing their edge. if your complaint is that rigs will make pvp more cookie cutter, i couldnt disagree more again. people will choose rigs commensurate with their play style and/or skills. cant track well enough? ill fit a tracking rig. want to be more snipey? a range rig will do. more tank? there are rigs for that as well. this change doesnt enforce behavior, it only enables it. enforcement is like saying you have to fit this no matter what, and there is no rule against flying naked (a.k.a. no mods, etc).if anything, it will now be more difficult to predict what you will encounter when engaging a t1 target, and thinking about tactics would do eve a lot of good. if your soft targets are getting a tad more hard, its up to you to adjust for it."
7/7/2009,i agree. yet another stupid attempt to make eve identical for everyone.
7/7/2009,"not supported.you're talking all about choice, but the truth is: currently you do not have the choice to fit rigs on frigates, except for those who have too much money.this change gives me and other, who are always looking for isk-efficient ways into pvp, the choice to fit rigs on frigates.also, as has been remarked: prices of bs rigs might as well rise with the change, due to the higher demand for smaller sized rigs."
7/7/2009,"when everyone has identical fitting everything gets boring. we might as well all fly t1 ships with t1 fittings. rigs were those ""extra effort"" slots, anything but mandatory. now everyone will rig all ships. this isn't about elitist rich jerks versus poor average players. a set of rigs wouldn't kill anyone finacially but it was expensive enough to warrant a decision about risk and reward. now that entire aspect of the game is gone. everyone has rigs, people stop caring about them. rigs become yet another logistic nuisance for all players."
7/7/2009,+1ccp's price scaling is way too agressive. and combined with their idea of a salvage reactor to make t2 salvage from t1 parts will just have the same effect that the op puts forth on t2 rigs too.
7/7/2009,"this whole thread is based on the premise that there is only one ""right combination"" of rigs for each ship. my opinion is that this change will allow multiple equally valid combinations, especially for small ships where at the cost of some million you can try different set up and even change them at a vim. not supported."
7/7/2009,"not supported.presuming a cost of 2m to rig a frigate i'd say that fits with the idea of adding ""umph"" for more isk already. rigging a t1 frigate will still cost several times the price of the hull and on a t2 frigate they'd still represent a significant investment compared to the hull-cost. personally i don't think rigs will be cheap enough and should scale more appropriately with hull costs.if you are looking to invest more isk to get better performance there are faction, deadspace, and officer modules, these are far more suitable for pvp as they may drop in the wreck rewarding the victor.in my view the performance gap between the rich and the poor doesn't need increasing. the trader/dedicated mission runner/etc can splash out for t2 ships, rigs, and fits and spice it up with faction/deadspace/officer equipment. the weekend warrior who makes isk for perhaps one hour of the three hours he plays a week is looking at fielding unrigged, t1 ships, with t2/named fittings. i'd say the difference there is vast enough. forcing those with lives beyond the game, or whose talents don't lend themselves to passive isk generation to fly sub-par ships with sub-par fits and a rack of empty slots somewhat detracts from the impact of skill in pvp. there should be a gap, but it shouldn't be the deciding factor in as many conflicts as it is."
7/7/2009,"reducing prices allows greater variety for people whose current options are a: not fitting rigs and b: not fitting rigs. reducing the price of t2 rigs falls under the same premise only opening up more options for those with the cash to fit t1 rigs. all this is going along-side a re-balancing of rigs with the intent to ensure we see more use from rigs that are currently ""underpowered"" and the introduction of new rigs.i'd say that's a rather large increase in variety both for the game and for many individual pilots options."
7/7/2009,"yes, it's why we have t1, t2, t3, faction, deadspace, officer.. to make sure that different people have different stuff. if the majority can't afford premium then the math is solid.the problem here is that rigs are no longer premium that way. so there's really no middle-ground when it comes to giving your ship an extra kick. it's either million-isk t2 mods or the billion-isk deadspace mods.rigs were the option in between, with moderate expense and a tangible reward.in a game like world of warcraft everyone can wear everything, the problem is getting it (i.e. directly depends on time spent playing). in eve you can have anything off the market. it's beautiful because there are so many ways of earning money and so many 'premium' items threatened by permanent loss that people actually think not only what but if they should fit something.bulldozing the rigs takes a part of that away.i know i'm pretty vocal on the issue but in the end i understand ccp's decision. i'm a videogame marketing specialist, i have seen ccp's stats on player wealth and 0.0 versus empire population. dumbing down eve is profitable. this doesn't make me happier about the whole thing."
7/7/2009,"compelttly agree, supported"
7/7/2009,all i see is a rig manufacturer who doesn't want to lose money and waste all those researched (now large) rig bpos. good try though. and also rich ppls who pvp with isk...
7/7/2009,"i love it when every word of someone's objection just proves they didn't even read the op.as for your last paragraph, it'll be the exact same as it is today, but with people rigged. speed cruisers will get more speed, tank cruisers will get more tank, range cruisers will get more range, cap cruisers will get more cap.... the only difference is that you can assure yourself they'll have rigs rather than have to guess."
7/7/2009,"pvp is not supposed to be isk efficient. it supposed to show advantages for people willing to pay. what makes it so much fun is killing those people who put way more money into their ships and still lose. i took a t2 fitted absolution solo against a faction fit navy raven, imagine how fun a fight it was after 10 minutes and a win for me.so by your logic, should i be on here screaming about the cost of faction ships and faction gear or should i just learn how to pwn the asses of those who think fit is everything."
7/7/2009,what significant investment on a frigate are you talking about... it'll cost more to buy 1 t2 mod for the frigate than it will to fit 3 rigs? that's not investment.
7/7/2009,"not everyone can make tons of billions every week.pvp should not be for rich people only (and don't talk me about tackling in a t1 frig, becouse nobody wanna do that forever).this patch will be a good one, there is no reason for having only large rigs."
7/7/2009,"the cause of the easy money is the fact that l4's missions are more rewarding than anything else in the game.. thats the issue and with this patch salvage prices are going up vs more demand, so it gets even more rewarding"
7/7/2009,"salvage prices will fall, not go up. there will be tons more demand, but it will be at a 1/25 and 1/5 level removing a lot of the strain on the current bs sized rigs which if price holds, will stay at the same popularity. hacs anc bc typically already get rigged, so reducing their build cost will mean more parts left over to build more rigs.initially, people will boost their purchases of rigs to rig ships they would not have in the past. over the long term with ships sitting in hangers as they do already, you'll see the price drop b/c those same people will not have to repeat buy."
7/7/2009,"exactly the type of whining which brought this change upon us.rigs. are. not. mandatory. now. stop making everyone who is not a loser look like an elitist rich jerk.currently the price of rigs means that you actually have a chance of getting a small but meaningful advantage from fitting them. when everyone can afford them, you just pay less but get much less in return."
7/7/2009,"supported. as much as i like the idea of going 6-7k per second, i realize that everybody else will be also... lame. i would rather trust my superior skill and skills for interceptors then pay the money, but if rigs were cheap of course i would have them on my crow, just like everybody else..."
7/7/2009,"there are some very interesting views in this thread, though i tend to disagree with the idea that somehow the game will become magically less when more ships are rigged. in the end i think that this change will happen and that the rigs will be common and after a while cheap. there will be a time when all rigs are more expensive just due to materials costs. in the end, the benefits to the many are large enough that the negatives will be considered acceptable losses."
7/7/2009,"not supported.readily available and cheaper rigs will increase variability in fits rather than make combat generic or monotonous.further, the new rigs will be a buff to industry as relating to several other profession.further, people will be flying ships that are more expensive than they are now in several cases. more expensive ships (uninsured expense!) means people more likely to pay ransoms and ship losses matter more; aside from increasing isk sinks.i think your assertion that bs sized rigs will drastically fall in price is misguided and i think anyone involved in rig production could honestly agree with that."
7/7/2009,"i've yet to hear anyone say how this patch will diversify pvp more. people rig ships to complement setups, not to drastically change them. if i have a speed setup, i rig accordingly. if i have a tank setup, i rig accordingly. it doesn't diversify ships, it just makes them better at what they're already intended to do for that player. fittings diversify ships, rigs enhance that diversity through the choice to pay to use them or not. removing the question, ""should i fit rigs because they cost so much"" removes the enhanced diversity because when everyone does it, it's not diverse.i mean, if you were to tell me that oh, i'm going to fit speed rigs on my armor tanking ship now, i'd say ok cool, but wait, speed rigs hurt armor tanking, oh yeah, so maybe i should put shield tanking rigs, oh wait, that's kinda dumb. maybe instead i should put more damage rigs, but that's not really diversity, because i can only fit so many damage buffs with falloff, so it's more likely i'm just freeing a low doing that. well how about cap. well i need cap, but if i can 1 slot fit an injector, why the **** would i use 3 rig slots to even come close to that.so in the end, i decide to use armor rigs on my armor tanking ship, speed rigs on my speed ship, etc. it doesn't make you more diverse, it just makes you better at what you do already. that's where diversity is being hurt. it's just evening the playing field even more for players, which is exactly what this game is not about."
7/7/2009,"this blows!!!i was expecting a decrease in effect with decrease in size and the option to fit all sized rigs to all sized ships!!!large rig = what we have nowmed rig = 20 % of large effectsmall = 40% of large effectcan be fitted to any ship so if you still wanted to put larges on your frigate, help your self. if you were cheap and only wanted to fit smalls on your bb, go for it.this blows big time!!!"
7/7/2009,"i dont support this, its like crying about why low slot module are so cheap, now i cant choose to let them empty. obviously, if you want to pay more than any other person to rigs your ships, fit tech 2 rig.its not like its remove reward for isk, tech 2 rigs are like 10 to 20 times more costly than tech 1. and its actualy give more diversity in pvp: do i fit tank, capacitor, cpu, powergrid or dps rigs ?sure you will never use tank shield rig on an armor tank fregate but you can choice to add some dps rig or on a ships with low tank but high dps, make him more resistant. not only ""tank armor ---> armor rig."
7/7/2009,"not supported. the new change is great and i can only wonder why was it not done sooner. the only legitimate issue, that even remotely needs discussing is what is the correct ratio of cost between different rig sizes. your ""solution"" would be a fine addition to the size system, so each size class would also have different quality rigs, but a horrible subsititute to the ccp plan."
7/7/2009,"""the alternative which makes more sense to this is simple... more expensive rigs with greater bonuses""i like this, but- isint there already t2? maybe make a t3 and even out the prices?"
7/7/2009,"i don't think the rig patch is a really bad idea.rigs overall add more diversity it's not like your going to fit every bs you come across with trimark's or every cruiser you come across with polycarb rigs (maybe some people do but they aren't thinking when they ""make"" a setup).the level of this diversity ended up being mostly limited to t2 or bs ships because of the price. not all people have billions in their pocket so they wouldn't rig anything cruiser or frigate size atm. this patch however creates a much bigger market for salvaging parts (which will also lead towards the rise of the price in the end). this patch will make rigs more common which is a good thing because more customisation is always good.this patch however will not lead to loads of cookie cutter setups.you can fit every upgrade you wish in the rig slots (everything from ecm boost to tank boost) so what it boils down to is that its a load of modules which aren't limited except for the number of how many you can fit (and the calibration max which you will never reach). so this means (if you are not copying a setup) that you really need to choose to max out the potential of your setup.the op is also comparing individual ships and we all know 1 vs 1 almost never happens in eve and if it happens it is never fair."
7/7/2009,"let me know how much armor ehp you get from small trimarked rigged punishers or medium trimarked rigged ruptures because i'm pretty sure it's less than i get out of a (large) trimarked rigged armageddon already.reducing % is stupid when the ship sizes already scale the rigs appropriately. the only rigs that won't scale appropriately are speed rigs, which are used exclusively on small ships already, very very rarely on medium sized ships. so interceptors rigged for speed will maintain the same speed as before, it'll just cost less, instead of getting their speed nerfed, which is what would happen if you scaled it, since they will no longer be able to fit large rigs. that'd create a situation where the ships rigged pre-patch are irreplaceable and flatly superior to the ones rigged post patch. basically this thread is a whine about nothing. boohoo you won't be spending 50mil in rigs for a ship costing 15mil anymore. or are you worried the plebes will finally be able to match your 'leet' pvp skill ie your wallet when they're as fast as you are? the only class of ships this patch effects is interceptors, everything else already scales appropriately. seriously op should cry us a river then drown himself in it (in game)."
7/7/2009,"your logic is flawed. increased demand = price increase. in the earlier stages more people will fit rigs to smaller ships, but as time progresses, the price will go up, and then suddenly it's not the norm anymore.besides, saying that it removes diversity is pretty dumb. people won't fit trimarks to frigs, because it reduces the speed of the ship, which is the best way to tank a frig. you won't get a lot of armor hp out of it either, since it's % based, so you're effectively reducing your tank.i think it'll do the excact oppposite: increase diversity. now you have the option to increase grid without sacrificing a lowslot, and without dishing out 15mil for a grid rig. this means that people will do it in order to maximize dps for bigger guns, and people can fit ab's with speed rigs, thus making ab's viable in pvp./not supported"
7/7/2009,it's always been a no-brainer.no one rigs t1 frigs and cruisers. everyone rigs t1 bs and t2 cruisers and t2 bc. the only ships where there was actually real choice as to whether to fit rigs or not were t2 frigates t1 bc.this is an improvement on the current system.
7/7/2009,"first of all, your an idiot who would rather talk than read the op. secondly, the issue is that the changes they're making are not anywhere near the original intent of rigs. rigs were about choice. do i choose to fit these to my ship or do i choose to keep the price down. it has so little to do with the actual buff any rig may give. it's about peoples decision to fit rigs in the first place.they're removing the option and creating the mandate to fit rigs just like every other slot on the ship is basically manditory to fit. ever wonder why people get laughed at for not fitting that last high slot, or those 2 mid slots.... nobody cared if you had rigs or not because it was about choice. i'd be all for the premise of this patch if price weren't so drastically reduced. but when i can fit a taranis with rigs for less cost than an ion blaster t2, then there is a huge problem. it completely removes the edge people gained in the past by using rigs. what next, you going to argue for the drastic reduction in cost of implants because it's not fair someone else can use them but not you. are you going to ask for the drastic reduction in cost of titan skill books because someone else can train for it but not you. are you going to argue that it's unfair that someone else can tank 20x better with faction that cost a fortune so you should get that luxury too? when you start making everyone the same, the game get's dull.ever played paper rock scissors? how dull would it be if you removed rock from the game?"
7/7/2009,"not supported.first off those module choices aren't irrelevant; certain setups may only be able to afford (isk, cpu, power, cap) the setup if they leave that certain slots empty or suffice with not having max of one thing to get another.will people ""lol"" at those who don't fit rigs? maybe, or maybe they will realize that they only won the fight narrowly because of those rigs. maybe it will drive the loser to purchase rigs. people could laugh at a sub-meta 4 module setup.what will be interesting is the rig fits. some players may choose to further expand the ships specialty, while others may decide to make the ship more well rounded. these are the choices and variety that will be created.you may have a price change on the large (current) rigs, but as its components go up in price (due to higher demand for higher turn-over small & medium rigs) the price for the large will stablize at what the market can hold.a 425mm railgun cost more than a 125mm railgun; they have different material and time cost. they also have a different turn-over rate, fewer pilots fly battleships than frigates.overall, your concern seems misplaced. you are talking about keeping the status quo because it will keep rigs expensive and provide an edge to those with deep wallets. the edge for deep wallets is in t2 equipment (to include rigs) and having substantial skills (like appropriate rig skills to 5!) that minimize any negatives you may suffer."
7/7/2009,this.not supported
7/7/2009,"but not if they added tissue, grovel and diamond to replace rock. you talk about removing options in the sense of ""should i rig or not"". how about ""should i rig this, or this, or this, or this"". ccp did mention a rebalance of underused rigs."
7/7/2009,"hmmm. to support or to not support, i've very mixed feelings on this as it stands. guess i'll make my post and decide at the end.firstly, i'd like to take issue with a couple of statements that have been made so far. 1) yes, some people do rig t1 cruisers and t1 frigs. i happen to be one of them. 2) no, rigging ships is not a way to pvp through isk. i may rig t1 frigs but i do so to save isk, not extend my e-peen.i seem to have the impression that when rigging is discussed it is always assumed to be focussed around the cost for the top end rigs. trimarks, cccs, smcs etc.. with these highly priced ones there are certainly good reasons not to fit them to frigates (t1 or otherwise). seriously, how many extra armour points are you going to get from a trimark if you fit it to a frigate? yuh. no where near worth it at the current prices. but what about other rigs? let's take the rifter as my example and whack some projectile ambit extension rigs on it. sure they're still expensive and certainly ludicrously expensive when compared on cost per item as a percentage of hull cost, but what does it give me? well, it gives me survivability and/or increased dps depending on the circumstances. with a pair of ambits and 200mm ac iis i can fire barrage at 10km at still hit for acceptable dps. so for frig on frig encounters i am basically a hell of a lot more survivable and the ~15m cost of the rigs pays itself back through keeping the same ship. i proved this point to a corp mate in a brutix fit with blasters. i was able to stay outside of his range and still break his tank after taking out his drones. there is no way that would have happened if i was unrigged (i could have still shot him from outside of his range, but i wouldn't have had the dps to break him).is that a case of winning through isk? maybe, but it's not a massive amount of isk tbh - just an extra l4 for the rigs.i'm really unhappy with the concept of ""salvage alchemy"" as well. the markets have still to fully recover from the introduction of ""alchemy"" with the last expansion and i feel that this is going to lead to a large increase in salvage prices which will knock on to the cost of rigs. however, the supply of salvaged material is much more fluid than the supply of moon materials is so this should flatten out eventually.overall i think that different rig sizes with scaled levels of advantage/drawback would be the way to go without restricting hulls to certain rig sizes. those that believe there is an acceptable benefit in the largest/costliest rigs can still pursue that path whereas those that don't want to risk their isk can play safe with the minor mods. hell, if the alchemy side of things kicks off in a sensible way we can even add t2 rigs into the mix outside of super-caps and pimped mission boats.i guess this means it get's a thumbs up."
7/7/2009,"not supported.i'm disagree with your point that this will diversify pvp less. in fact, in your own words:that doesn't sound like there will be less diversity, since you're basically admitting that ships with have exactly the same roles and functionality with and without rigs. the only difference in the situation you mention is the performance of the ships, not the diversity.however, having three extra slots that can now viably be used can introduce diversity, by allowing ships to take on roles that were just not feasible without rigs. remote repair augmentors, for example, can now feasibly be fitted to t1 cruisers (asides from the oneiros) making remote repairing on these ships a more viable than it is today. many ships could fit falloff/range boosting rigs while they have trouble justifying tes/tcs over other modules, due to limited slots and module effectiveness. dynamic fuel valves can push speed ships to permarun that couldn't do so previously.i strongly disagree with your sentiment that giving people effectively more slots to fit a variety of performance-enhancing rigs to their ship, is something going to reduce diversity. in the absolute worst-case, the slots are used to improve the ship in exactly the same role it has now, so nothing has changed, and in every other case more diverse fittings become feasible.so definitely thumbs down on this one."
7/7/2009,very nice! we really need this.
7/7/2009,"i like the idea of moving on towards implant manufacturing but i think there are a few problems along the way.first of all production:- the drugs which you suggest to be implemented are highly illegal in most empire regions and if they are produced the same way now as when they are now then this makes me wonder how they do it without making implants illegal.- the gasses are some uncommon it's silly either they boost more gas clouds in high-sec/low-sec or it should not be included in production- corpse remains based on sp point might be a little too heavy for the server- t2 implants should only be able to be produced by buying a bpc from the faction shop of said pirate faction to keep them highly priced production process remains same and they keep dropping from wrecks so you don't undercut 0.0 folkswhat i suggest is that implants are build up out of sub-assemblies just like t2 manufacturing to keep the price a bit higher.per example a perception implant would exist out of:- bio-electronic neural link (biomass (read corpse), high grade minerals, new r.a.m unit bio-electronical engineering)- processing unit (build up out of mid grade minerals, miniature electronic, t1 salvage)- implant housing (low-grade minerals)with a system like this (mine is just an example) you get a more advanced line of production instead of the straight forward put everything togheter and watch it magicly transform to an implant.skills:rather name biologic engineering into bio-electronic engineering to really point out the link of bio and electronic interfacing. other than that the requirements seem good. not too high not to low.in the end i support this idea but the implant production should not be as straight forward as t1 production or include any gasses or drugs."
7/7/2009,this is how it should be.
7/7/2009,"i have to disagree with summoning up more gms. yes, it could be helpful, and yes, there is the rare chance that something that has been a noted bug made you lose x ship.but honestly? does it *really* require a petition to replace a t1 or t2 ship if it get blowededed up in combat? does it require a petition to report that 'x bug happened, no i didn't read the confirmed bug list, can i has ship?' simple answer, no. suck it up and just keep playing. i'm still in personal favor that petitions should be a group effort, and should cost a set isk fine that starts going up from the free, single one.like, you get your free petition, but if that isn't answered or found a 'good' one, the next one you send in costs 10m isk and goes up x2 for every further petition that is filed. if it's found a reasonable bug or such, then the gm should be able to clear it, and you'd again have 1 free petition."
7/7/2009,"and yes, bugs are my fault. horrible me. and yes, although this wasn't what my petition was about, it is worth petitioning about that. if it shouldn't have happened, it shouldn't have happened.an excellent system. we should also make it that you have to pay isk as well as real money subscribe and isk to post on the forums."

7/7/2009,"i don't know, i kind of like the idea.yes, there'll obviously be a small number of idiots who'll purposefully color their ships fluorescent to **** people off. there might even be a few people that do it to amuse themselves. the color palettes, if implemented, should retain the basic gritty and militarianistic shades they already retain. as for the tech ii problem, i figure we could always keep a distinguishing color for them (already implemented) that can't be changed, that won't be avaliable in their counterparts. i especially like the idea of corporation / alliance logos. if nothing else, implement these for the pure novelty and, shall we say, inherent pride that comes with flying your flag. i like it."

7/7/2009,"heartily support.and to those decrying lag and server strain, recall the part where hundreds of corporation logos are already being transmitted to your client by the server all the time. and that the proposed information can be easily encoded in 16 bits per ship. in a large fleet battle, we are talk about one maybe two kb of data. as the op says, almost any other conceivable added gameplay feature would create more overhead than this. if even this amount is unacceptable, then trimming the proposal down to just the alliance/corp logos could be encoded in two bits per ship.as per the client side lag, just turn the feature off if you have problems. many of us, even with older hardware, can run eve just fine with decent graphics setting 99% of the time."

7/7/2009,"there's a lot of good web developers and administrators in the eve online community. if ccp is having trouble finding a proper solution for their problem, maybe they should share the constraints and technical details of the problem so we can help provide potential solutions.personally, i think that they should manage sessions in a database instead of cookies. it would require a big database and a powerful server to run it (considering the amount of read/writes this database would have to support), but this would be the easiest solution in my opinion.this would also enable them to have a real unified logon type thing. basically, there would be a database table that would track user account settings by userid (community site settings and session info). when a user logs on for the first time, a record is created for his userid. a table would then be used to track session activity. when the user logs on, the ""last logon timestamp"" field would be updated. then everytime the user does something such as refresh a page, or post in a forum, that timestamp gets updated.if the user then goes afk past the time limit (let's say 1 hour), then the next time the user refreshes a page, the code checks that timestamp and logs the user out if his session is expired, or refreshes the timer if it's not. there could even be a background agent running to clear expired sessions from the database every minute or so.no more cookies (except static cookies for some minor settings), and load balancing wouldn't matter in this case since the same database would be queried (or same cluster, which ever).just a thought. it may be too complicated or too costly to do, and maybe an actual web design architech could comment on this, but it seems like a good idea to me."

7/7/2009,"hello, i had this interesting ideea earlier while watching tv. i mostly just pvp but this would add more action to high sec and hopefully draw more people into the pvp part of the game and it would also please the role players. i was thinking about having riots in high sec. imagine this, some amarr emperor or whoever makes a press conference which shows up in the news on the website. and some people might be displeased with their ideeas and wanna form a riot against it. a beacon lights up in certain systems or just one very reinforced (node) system, which is connected with the news. a team of random players form up for the riot, warp to the beacon with ""banners flying and drums beating"". they find a structure where the emperor is hiding and start shooting it. sleeper-like concord warps in to defend the structure, 3-4 spawns. spawns die, structure dies, emperor comes out in a capital ship and he dies too.. or not. i didn't think about the rewards i'll let someone else do that.pros : - everyone can join the riot, no matter of corp, alliance, race- mission runners and other high sec dwellers can discover their pvp side and improve their abilities- more people would start reading those storyline articles- those afraid of being ganked in wormholes would experience sleeper-like combatcons : - lagwhat do you think ? did i smoke too much or is it a cool ideea ?"
7/7/2009,"an interesting idea- i'd like to see roleplaying related events from ccp that actually involve something in-game --perhaps related to fw somehow? more diversity is always good, and while this idea definitely needs refining, it's got potential :)"
7/7/2009,"edit: spellingdrones were changed already, do you remember when scooping them used to instantly fully recharge their shield?yeah, you got the point: why is that bad for drones, but is good for ships?when a ship docks it gets his shield instantly repaired, it can then undock again completely ""healed"" (and it's free too, while if you want to repair armor you must pay.. alot).while at war, or in 0.0, this can be used almost like an exploit: get aggro, dock when almost in armor, then undock again. in the meanwhile anything can happen.so there are 3 options imo:1. give drones back their instant shield repair2. give ships a free and instant armor repair when docked3. remove instant shield repair for docked ships"
7/7/2009,"you really see an ""apples to apples"" comparison between a drone bay and a station dock? drone bay = open door to an open space in your shipstation = repair facilities, restaurants, living quarters, shops... hell it's a floating city. even a rv park in today's world will give you an extension cord to plug in and a place to empty the latrine.... more than a drone bay. i don't think it's beyond reason that the station dock would have a place to plug in your shield recharger, they'll probably even wipe the windows while they are at it."
7/7/2009,why they don't repair my armor then?
7/7/2009,"oh no he did not...when you dock up your ships is hooked on the stations power which immediately recharges your shield (it's made of energy) and your capacitor. this is the reason why they get recharged immediately.the station doesn't repair armor because its a solid and you can't recharge it. the only way you can fix it is by repairing it by replacing plates or using the nanobot technology on it at a super fast scale (see armor repair modules). so this takes a separate installation to do, which takes money to operate (if your going that deep down)"
7/7/2009,"you can say whatever you want, nothing change.talking about game mechanics there is something wrong, this is not real life, nor anything real, so stop say ""they plug the shiel recharger in and blablabla"".at the very least recharging the shields while docked should take some time, and not instantly bump it at full maximum capacity, wtf."
7/7/2009,"and btw, just to make it clear: energy got a cost too, so your point fail, becouse instead of using that energy to recharge the shield it could be used to power the repairers for the armor, it's the very same thing."

7/7/2009,"jorr orestis posted this suggestion in the features and ideas discussion forum, and i liked it so much that i thought it deserved to be considered by the csm.custom corporation certificates:a corp member with the proper role (corporation certificate manager) would be able to create corporation certificates that every corp member could then plan using the certification planner.those certificates would automatically be public to the corp only (can't make them private).a new corporation tool would be added (certificates) where you could create new ones, and also list who has which. this would not only allow corporations to make their own skill requirements, but also to easily see who is certified at a glance. for example, a corporation could create a special ""pvp tackler"" certificate, and when the time comes to select members for a special pvp operation, list all the members who completed the certificate to know who can fill that role.to prevent abuse (i.e. a corp making 100 certificates that are more or less the same as the ones currently present in the game), there would have to be a limit to the maximum number of certificates a corporation can create.another feature i'd like to have when creating a corporation certificate is the ability to import known certificates as pre-requirements for that certificate. a perfect example of this would be the core competency certificate, which regroups many other sub-certificates in it.i reallly think this idea has a lot of potential."
7/7/2009,medals arent good enough?
7/7/2009,"what has this to do with medals?medals are given when you do something good, or reach a goal or something like that.custom certificates could be nice to see who is capable to do what.nice idea."
7/7/2009,"wuh? medals have nothing to do with certificates, so no; medals are not good enough. medals are extremely expensive too, and they are given to members by the corp manually, not automatically awarded when members meet certain requirements.medals are awards or trophies, certificates are like a diploma that certifies you have trained a defined list of skills at defined levels.sure, a corp can develop a tool to read every member's api data and see if they meet certain skills and such, but as far as i know, nobody did this yet, and you wouldn't be able to see it ingame using the default interface."
7/7/2009,"honestly, this sounds like a way to get around the cost of corp medals, as cert have about the same use as medals. that is to say.. none beyond bragging rights."
7/7/2009,"if your corp gives out medals for having met certain skill requirements, then they are wasting a lot of isk! corp certificates wouldn't be a way around medals, because medals were never meant to be used as a sort of certificate in the first place. they are awards, not diplomas! and again, there is no way other than by having a custom api tool that will list member skills, to confirm that a member really has trained a certain skill at a certain level. certificates would automatically be granted to members who fill their requirements, which would be hard set in the game itself using a specific corporation tool (and not be something written on paper on the ceo's computer desk).lets say the corporation creates a certificate called ""elite tackler"" and uses the following for requirements:- interceptor v- afterburners v- high speed maneuvering v- spaceship command v- propulsion jamming v- long distance jamming v- signature analysis v- energy emission systems vas soon as one of the corporation members is finished training all those skills at those levels, a message would popup to inform the member he cam claim his new certificate. once claimed, the member would be listed in the corp certifications tab under ""elite tackler"" along with the date it was completed.then if the corp has to form a fleet and needs elite tacklers, instead of having to ask for everyone ""who has [list of all skills here]?"", the fleet commander can just go in that tab and see who has it at one glance."
7/7/2009,maybe include the number inside a colored circle or at least have more variety of colors
7/7/2009,you're quite paranoid aren't you? that was completely unfounded.
7/7/2009,"i would love to have the ingame eveonline map more like the official eve strategic maps. i own that book, so i rarely use the ingame map, but if the ingame version was more like it i would.the biggest problem i see with the ingame map, is that everything is always glowing. glow is nice, but the glow's feather is sometimes so wide that you can't even tell where the center of the glow is, or how large it exactly is.one way to rectify this would be to have static plain circles (fully filled, no blur or glow) with a number inside it like this guy acwdc78 suggested. that would make it much clearer to view!but regardless, i think the map should be redone anyway. the 3dness of the map is completely useless and serves no purpose at all for navigation. who cares if a system is above or below another one, we only care about how systems are connected together, not how they are truly laid out in space.i think the whole map should be redone completely as a flat tactical map, in the same format as the printed eve tactical maps (with the exception that the tactical info would be dynamic instead of being static)."
7/7/2009,well :p thats not mining thats interesting ;p
7/7/2009,"this confused me. i thought you were advocating removing concord protection from empire belts, then you went on to say that concord would still maintain law in empire belts.in any case, you don't seem to understand the realities of the situation. the reason people don't mine much in lowsec is that it's an economically moronic idea. at best, the rocks are only marginally better, but then the miners have to split the take with the security pilots, assuming they are still awake. (after all, mining is mind-numbingly dull; but watching miners mine is even moreso.) if you turn highsec into lowsec, then miners will (except for a handful of souls with more courage than profit sense) simply stop mining in the sec-formerly-known-as-high, too. if this affected only hstandard highsec belts, then the vast majority of minerals would come from miners mining in mission deadspaces or from recycled mission loot. if it affected mission deadspaces, then you'd force massive numbers of mission fans out of the game.and you'd still have no easy targets.if you'd like to find more highsec pew-pew, why not advocate changing the mechanics to allow anyone with -0.0 or less sec status to be engaged freely in highsec? it's a more reasonable proposal (why would concord protect lawbreakers, anyway?), and would give you unlimited combat simply by undocking in highsec. admitedly, your opponents might have actual weaponry, but there needs to be some compromise, doesn't there?"
7/7/2009,"thank you very much, everyonein response to becq; i thought that for those corps that couldn't afford security contractors there would be some 'empire' belts, but not whole systems, 2-3 asteroid belts out of 10 in a solar systemand the idea about not providing protection for outlaws sounds asbsolutely reasonable, should be worked oni guess all i'm advocating for is nothing drastic, a little more realism maybe. alas, judging from your response -that undoubtedly comes from more experience- it's not something that can be pulled off without overwhelming the whole game mechanic, it seemsthis solo wannabe pirate has to look elsewhere for other prospects..fly safeps: i've been lucky enough as it is that most of the responses i got are from pvp fans, not miners!"
7/7/2009,"because those you call pvp fans are gankers?the only way to keep a mining op safe and going is then to completely lock down a system. every gate needs to be bubble camped. (assuming ammount of people you see in high sec and not in average 0.0 system). those camps need then to shoot everyone coming through who isnt blue. protecting the miners in the belts just wont work, the ships are too fragile, snipers can warp in, kill some, warp out. and we allready have this in the game, it is called 0.0, go there. so basicly you want to change all of eve into 0.0, let me summarize what happens:1. 50% of the carebears quit, 50% just move to an alliance in current 0.0 or one for the new 0.0 areas.2. either you switch current empire to low true sec 0.0 with sov, or everyone leaves it for current 0.0 with sov. 3. result is that pirates wont be allowed to dock anywhere.4. even if you can dock in an npc station, only some things will be sold there and way overpriced. since everyone is in alliances/corporations, which also pvp to defend this 0.0 space, everyone mined/produced will either be only for alliance usage, or it will be traded directly with other alliances who have stuff you need (for example they got noxcium supply, you got zydrine). allthough probably preferable the powerblocks will be come even larger, and one powerblock will have access to all different kind of stuff needed. and wars wont just go about moons anymore, but also removing their ability to get certain minerals.5. we dont get new players.summarized:half carebears quit, half adapteve will die due to lack of new playerspirates will become extinct.you seriously need to change your definition of nothing drastic."

7/7/2009,why not have permanent roids tat wont get their ore reduced significantly during the day? probably ore prices would be coming crashing down but so would be all other prices then. i think this would get rid of the problem of macro miners competing for roids w other players. plus a miner would be able to mine to its heart content. instead of wondering mindlessly in empty belts or logging off until next respawn time.

7/8/2009,"-more people using rigs means more isk sink no matter how you cut it-this sounds like a whine from the same people who said t2 ships and mods should be artificially kept at a higher price so everyone don't fly it, cause you want the advantage over ""scrubs"
7/8/2009,"i fully support this thread. i'm really quite confused as to why ccp did it this way - the natural solution was rigs that can be fitted to any ship with variable cost and effect - if all you need on your battleship is 5% cap recharge, fit a ccc-small. if they were doing the proposal i had seen somewhere of class-specific rigs(i.e., ""this rig can only be fit to exhumers"") then i could see why they were going to a fitting-restriction model, but when it's just done by ship size, it's silly. and the dumbing down of t2 rigs is also the wrong move - those things are the officer mods of the rig world, they are supposed to be scary expensive. i don't want them any cheaper. i do support the re-examination of subpar rigs, and i hope they come up with some sort of implementation of all the proposals for moving rigged ships around(especially now that there are going to be so many more of them). but i think that they made the wrong call on sized rigs."
7/8/2009,"talking down to anyone who happens to disagree with you, really hurts any credibility you might have otherwise had."
7/8/2009,not supported.
7/8/2009,"the issue lies entirely with the categorization of ships.cheap rigs for t1 frigs and t1 cruisers are ment to help newer players and do not affect the power scale too much. yet drakes do not need 5x cheaper rigs or they become auto-include, ceptors do not need full rig job cheaper than single module or they become auto-include.the division should besmall: t1 frigs, t1 destroyersmedium: t1 cruisers, t2 frigates and destroyerslarge: t1 bc+, t2 cruiser+this preserves the current ballancing as close as possible while giving new toys to new players; lowering rig costs makes rigs still not automatic include but more plausible option. the result is richer eve, contrary to the rough draft ccp has now, that spends dev time to take choices away."
7/8/2009,it's not a rough draft 1 month from launch
7/8/2009,"i don't see the problem with this change, and actually encourage it.it's not because rigs will be made more affordable (and not just a luxury for the elite player) that everybody will use them. you gotta remember that rigs are skill intensive. you pretty much need to train a different skill for each type of rig. most players will probably start training them, but not everybody will. also, i don't think rigs will all of a sudden become that affordable. it will however increase the demand for salvaged materials greatly!i think rigs are great because they add a certain level of customization to ships that you can't have otherwise. i'm welcoming this change with open arms."

7/8/2009,"not sure about the whole topic, but i agree that the proposed material requirements for small and medium rigs are probably too low and are likely to make rigs into no-brainer options rather than (at a probable cost of less than 1m each for a small polycarb or aux thruster, who wouldn't rig every interceptor they owned?).however the difference in salvage requirements aren't set in stone and there's still time to tweak the numbers on the rigs (and hopefully fix some of the currently broken ones)."
7/8/2009,"i agree with this, but imo it is a good thing for them since now theres more variety, personally i found rigs very sticky to deal with.i think there will be alot more people happy with the patch and possibly the few that dont like 'change' that will cry but get use to it.prices change based on demand and stock, while it is true the market (which has already happened) will go crazy for rig related stuff it also means there's more stuff to work with and a challenge after the patch."
7/8/2009,"on t2 ships, rigs are already mandatory for anyone that isn't ******ed, possibly except for frigates, so what this comes down to is basically adding a choice as to if you want to rig your t1 ship or not. 2-3m may not be alot of money, but on a t1 frigate, which are usually only flown by newbies to whom 2-3m is alot of money, or by old players that want a super cheap disposable ship they can loose any number of without caring. adding 2-3m could quite possibly double the cost of loosing the ship.same applies to cruisers. you're now talking roughly 12m for a set of trimarks. when fitting a t1 cruiser, that's quite a significant increase in price compared to what it would cost unrigged. cruisers have roughly 12-13 slots each on average, average price for a t2 mod is about 1m (some are lower, some higher, should balance out somewhere around there), add in ship cost and you've again double the cost of loosing one. what this patch will do is lower the price of t2 rigs to a possibly viable level, while increasing the cost of the base materials since the use in t2 rigs will drive up the price. that means that after the patch, you get to choose in the isk vs efficency not only once for the rig slots, but twice: you have the cheap throwaway setup with no rigs, the average setup, not overpriced, but still not at full capability with t1 rigs, and the full price max performance setup with the now viable t2 rigs. do you want to ""pay for more oomph?"" if yes, how much do you want to pay for how much oomph?and finally, even if i'm wrong somehow and rigs become mandatory on all ships, you've still added more versatility: each ship gets 3 more slots that they can use to fine tune their ship to whatever they want: do you want to go all out with that thorax and bring its gank to the next level with dps rigs, or maybe speed rigs to get in **** range faster, or perhaps you'd like to fix its lack of buffer by fitting damage rigs and some tank in lows, or by simply adding tank rigs. at the same time as that is going on in the t1 tier, it's still mandatory to fit atleast t1 rigs in the t2/t3 ship tier, but you now get a real choice as to if you want to only fit t1 rigs, or pay for the extra oomph and go with t2 instead.not supported, the patch as proposed is great and exactly what's needed."
7/8/2009,"this is just like every other game i have ever played before. the people who have played so long they like the way things are hate it when the noobs have access to similar stuff. lets just play out a scenario...lets say for pretend that there is only a +6 implant and no +1 or +2 etc... of course it would be very expensive and only the most elite, powerful, or rich able to have it. ccp now says they are going to release a +1 - +5 so now everyone can have at least a little boost to attributes. of course this is awesome, i would fully support that kind of patch. now the new players can level up their skills lightly faster at a small cost and the old players are whining about it on the forums. sound similar?this is just about the same. a dumbed down item that noobs can now have. boo hoo, go cry to your f****ng mother. :d if it wasn't obvious, i do not support this sillyness. lol"
7/8/2009,there are some really good ideas here that i think would begin to address mining. i especially like having the new asteroids give a wider mineral spread than they do now. it might just make production a little easier both in empire and especially in 0.0hopefully a system like the one you propose will fix the current broken mechanics (imo) where in empire one of the most valuable asteroid's to mine is the one that is supposed to be the least desirable. making people want to seek out the better asteroids is a good thing since it will theoretically draw them out of empire and towards lowsec and 0.0i do feel a bit sorry for ccp on this one though. a change to mining cannot be avoided but i doubt any other part of eve could have the potential ramifications as tinkering with mining could. the benefit of the system proposed in this thread is that it should be easier to tweak on the fly than some of the other systems people have suggested.-vic
7/8/2009,"if you add a minigame to find the good mineral spots in the roids (something like finding the cosmic signatures in exploration, just to a much much smaller scale) then you have additionally an interesting and balanced system.so, yeah."
7/8/2009,"i'll support any idea which makes people leave empire for a decent risk vs reward. however i think that the difference between 1.0 to 0.5 shouldn't be that huge, as it's all protected by concord and any pirate attacking you in those systems will have a sure death, but the difference between 0.5 and 0.4 should be quite big, this to encourage mining in low-sec. although my knowledge of mining ships is small, i believe there isn't any mining ship which is can be fitted to get out when pirates come, in the event that this idea is implemented, such a ship should be implemented."
7/8/2009,"if someone is stupid enough (and fc is stupid enough to let it) to do that then odds are like he's gonna be the next failmail or get kicked if his (wrong) action turns the tides of the battle.nonetheless. the only thing i read against this proposal was ""no more e-peen"". well it's a game, where different people find different ways of having fun. some people grow e-peens (not that it fux a lady for them), so let them have their fun, it won't ruin yours whatever it may be.for war statistics it is useful, and for the lulz it's a definate must. (just like the guy killed recently in covops full of expensive bpos... it's for the lulz)it serves no intel, as noone is really interested in the losers' setup (unless he/they were outnumbered as hell), and you never see the winners' setups, and you can be quite sure, that the loser will change setup for the next fight.these are my 2 cents.still supporting."
7/8/2009,"yes, but first fix the buggy killmails."
7/8/2009,indeed
7/8/2009,now i know why all the replies to my petitions read with an indian accent.
7/8/2009,"durka durp. seems we have a hot-shot genius in the house tonight. first off, when did i even mention that the bugs were the player's fault? i think i was talking about how players who don't read the bug list whine to get their ship back. secondly, i don't think you bothered to really read what i wrote about the petition spamming solution. forums have their own moderation, can be seen and answered to by all who have posting rights. petitions are gm-eyes only, so the whine about 'zomg, my can was flipped, i shot at him, then he blew me up' or 'i lagged and couldn't shoot back, can i has ship?' can't be properly made-fun of by the populace, instead, a overworked gm has to take the time to say 'sorry little jimmy, but that's perfectly legal in eve.' in as nice a way as possible or risk losing his/her job.so please, take the time to read."
7/8/2009,"if some players were not so selfish in petitioning every little grivous(sp) action in the game the gm's may actually take the time to read our petitions. i know a whole corporation(16 failtards) that after every loss they open a petition, litterally every loss. not to mention the ammount of vet' idiot's that do something stupid and think it's the systems fault start crying over it.people need to stop being so selfish over little problems and move on."
7/8/2009,quoted for truth.
7/8/2009,"ironic. i think i stated earlier that i'm not petitioning about lag. i'm not petitioning about can-flipping. i'm not petitioning about any bugs - i don't actually have to tell you what i'm petitioning about, it's irrelevant to my proposal. my proposal is actually asking the gms to do what you are not and are accusing me of not doing.reading. and then giving a response that actually has something to do with the petition. would have stopped me in my tracks to begin with.less ccp fanbois, please. bump."
7/8/2009,"well, if you don't bother to hint at what you're petitioning about, then it's quite idiotic of yourself to try and yell at people that they don't understand you. if you're trying to bring up a point about gms not reading your petitions correctly, and giving cut & paste answers, perhaps it's because they've encountered that particular issue, investigated it, deemed whatever declaration as x, and moved on. either:a) clear up the mysteries of whatever it is you're reporting.--or--b) stop complaining about it and move on."
7/8/2009,so is the csm going to bring this up again in a way that lets us players know wtf is going on with our dead horse?
7/8/2009,"comfirming that i will vote 'no', should this be brought up in the csm.as cool as the idea is, the sheer amount of work involved in realising this can not be justified by the relatively minor payoff (yah pos's will look slightly cooler... woohoo)."
7/8/2009,"i support this, but make it so it can only be used in .8 and below"
7/8/2009,"premise, my sec status floats between -1 and -7.while high sec suicide attacks with no expense are intended to be?why shouldn't suicide ganking be like everything else in eve, that is a tradeoff between good and bad sides?with the current trend, you risk and lose zero because the insurance pays back the hull in full and the drops (expecially miners') more than cover for the t1 turrets loss.false. suicide gank an indy carrying 200m in modules with a destroyer and you lose like 10m and still earn 190m / 2.freigthers could be reverted to ""killable status"" again so that it's still profitable to kill the 2b afk ferry boat with a loss of 1b on your part.have people have to *think* before they push the trigger.i pay quite expensive starbase charters to the empire faction and regular fees to the owners of the stations hosting my corp offices. so?i can access the gallente and minmatar loyality points (odd name, it's like they want to prize you somehow) and i can even fly factional vessels.i feel more citizen in eve than in real life, where i have yet to get a state limousine handed in for my own perusal.could you please point me the name of the insurance company paying for you to destroying your car every day?so, you spend 2m to t1 fit a gallente cruiser and kill an hulk dropping 1.6-1.9m *tech i* mining lasers (more if tech 2) and possibly t2 mlus and t2 shields / gist shield repper @40m value a piece.it's clearly a bad deal!- attack miners with usual drones out on aggressive (for rats), targetting the drones first => no sec hit.- use -10 sec pilots boarding a ship dropped nearby off an orca => sec hit does not matter.no, insurance should be removed off all the ships if anything. because the suicide boats would almost all be covered and insured by the above statement. i'd be fine with the idea of making a guy blinky for all the characters of my account. so i could warp in my proper pvp ship and see who is the man."
7/8/2009,"no. ccp looked into this and buffed response time instead. you can take away our insurance if you reset the response time changes.cost isn't really an issue with suicide gankings. sec is, considering the grind to recover it after a successful gank.example 1when i was out suicide ganking i would rarely go after anything with a cargo value of less than 200 mil. assuming one has a 50% drop rate and assuming you are using a tier 2 battlecruiser (what are they now, 35 mil) that's still a minimum 65mil profit if insurance is voided. still worth doing.example 2pirate corp x is using destroyers to kill hulks mining in hisec. it takes 4-5 dessies to be able to reliably kill 1 hulk. total cost: 4-5 mil. well worth it to destroy some carebears.all that will happen if insurance is voided for concord actions is the alienation of carebears who accidently set off a smartbomb in a plex or turn their guns on a fleet member.this hysterical whining about suicide gankers has got to stop. carebears have had too many concessions over the years. pay attention, play smart and you won't get killed, simple as."
7/8/2009,"my father had an expression that went something like ""you made your bed, now lie in it"".i'm not proposing that we allow people to play less intelligently, lark. if anything, this will encourage more thought in the game, since you won't be able to gank anything that happens across your path with a reasonable expectation of at least breaking even economically.you'll have to actually pick your targets selectively and balance the costs versus the potential rewards.i thought that was sort of the point of eve?"
7/8/2009,this is the only good idea in this thread fyi
7/8/2009,"i'd support this as long as my contract is applicable everywhere in eve, including nullsec and wh space. after all, if i'm paying for protection, i expect my body guard to be nearby.that really is a good idea, thanks!"
7/8/2009,i support this. on the grounds that insurance companies aren't going to pay you to destroy your own vehicle. just because a mechanic is in a game doesn't mean it needs balanced if something changes. sure if there is a glaring issue. but basically you have people whining because they're going to make one of the ways to have non-consensual pvp involve a bit of thinking other than cheap fitting a ship.
7/8/2009,de'veldrin is spot on with this.
7/8/2009,"hmmmm,where do you start.1. ganking in high sec is griefing...period2. has a pvper i resent being tossed into this lot with these so-called pvpers ( gankers) 3. you should lose your insurance if you choose "" this profession"" 4. high sec should be safe . we must assume that when ccp made the empires they were pretty sure that said leaders of these empires would not allow a bunch of clowns going around attacking the taxpayers ( has any state or country would)5. high sec was created to give breathing room to folks in game ,l low sec was for the wild wild west.. so take your ""profession"" to low sec where it is intended.to stop all this just make anybody who commits a crime ( again ccp idea of a crime) a target for all in high sec, and any other toon they have on the accountif your yellow players can kill you .concord leaves you alone.. if your red your dead and not allowed into high sec ( even in a pod).that would truly make it risk and reward, tho i suspect the bad%ss pvpers in high sec will go away and to some other game. for it is they who are ruining eve with all this stuff not the carebears you so often whine about."
7/8/2009,no - do you realize how boring c&p would get?
7/8/2009,i was under the impression that certain overzealous individuals had already more or less killed that area of the forum?
7/8/2009,fine....as soon as l4's are moved to low sec. i see that as a good compromise.
7/8/2009,"full support. insurance payouts for concord kills makes no sense whatsoever.make the suicide gankers work for a living for a change. you whiners can still suicide gank, but you'll have to smartly pick your targets instead of just hitting every tom, richard, and harry who happens to be passing through a 0.5 system in an industrial or mining there.boo hoo, you might have to work."
7/8/2009,now someone please wake up the csm and make them ask ccp about something that was promised as a specific fix long time ago?
7/8/2009,"sure they can try. ""realistic"" concord being about as effective as faction police. when they turn up. if they turn up. if you have kept up on your payments."
7/8/2009,why on earth would concord protect you in 0.0 or lo-sec? they dont operate there.
7/8/2009,"you're the one that suggested making them a pay for use service. if i am paying them to show up when i'm in trouble, they'd better bloody well show up regardless of where i am."
7/8/2009,no support.
7/8/2009,"i've been thinking of this for a long while. the common sense factor of eve has always boggled my mind. right now, the tens of billions isk titans and motherships are generally unarmed in any special way. they're basically just bigger, more expensive versions of the dreadnought and carrier. with a doomsday firing, the titan is basically 'locked down' in that system for 10 or so minuets. the mothership's only real strengths in battle are triage and fighters. both are immune to general electronic warfare, but if a heavy interdictor get in, it won't matter that you can't be slowed or your locks disrupted, you can't escape until it's gone.what i wish to present to the floor is for a sort of point-defense system that is automated for the super capitals, and for the general ones as well. i would seriously doubt that, in a roleplaying/""real"" life situation in this universe, that the factions would not have designed their most powerful ships known to the game to be as weak as possible. there are two possible ways that i'll put forth to accomplish a viable point defense system for capitals. the first is actual turrets already built into the ship, with another ui menu via right-click on the ship to control their firing parameters and target-acquisition guidelines.the second possible way is a new capital modual. mountable only on capitals via the normal power grid and cpu costs being astronomical on norm. this modual would be activated to turn the guns on, which would allow 6-24 or so auto cannons/blasters/pulse lasers to open fire on objects targeted at you. these guns would need to have a very fast and accurate tracking speed to be useful enough to destroy drones and missiles, and have enough punch to scare off interceptors and other small craft.both of these choices would have the guns with unlimited ammo, or with a special new type of ammo which would deplete the cargo bay of the ship. they could have a range of 7-20 km to better defend the ship.i believe that this would not only allow carriers and motherships to be more than glorified, expensive logistics ships, but also allow dreadnoughts and titans the chance to put up more of a fight than just sitting there taking the brunt of 100+ drones, etc.now, a valid point-defense is the ""smart"" bomb, however, the smart bombs damage your own fighters, drones, fleet members, and even possibly yourself too. they're also only given one particular damage type, and have a comparatively slow cycle time to re-fire. the other, biggest reason is that they have a maximum possible range of 5 km (6 for t2) for the larges. all in all, for the tl;dr folks; super capitals should have a defensive system that allows the ship to fight off drones and missiles more effectively than what a smartbomb can bring in terms of re-fire rate, range, and damage output.for the folks who also enjoy eye candy, it could also be more than a little fun to watch as your capital ship's defense systems throw bullets, charges, or lasers into the space around it to shoot down all sorts of little things.---------"
7/8/2009,your point defense system is the support fleet for the super capital.titans or motherships should never be alone.not support.
7/8/2009,"this. despite how titans are used in practice at times, they should not be built to be capable of solo operation."
7/8/2009,"yeah this is dumb, no titan would ever die ever again if it could just fit multiple batteries of autocannons or pulse lasers and obliterate dictors and heavy dictors at will.if you want your titan to be safe(r), protect it with your support fleet."
7/8/2009,"for a titan..... maybe not, but for a carrier mothership hells yes! they need a little boost somehow and i think this would be perfect!""the second possible way is a new capital modual. mountable only on capitals via the normal power grid and cpu costs being astronomical on norm. this modual would be activated to turn the guns on, which would allow 6-24 or so auto cannons/blasters/pulse lasers to open fire on objects targeted at you. these guns would need to have a very fast and accurate tracking speed to be useful enough to destroy drones and missiles, and have enough punch to scare off interceptors and other small craft."""
7/8/2009,moronic.making titans even better suited to the role of solopwntoys is a bad idea. a titan pilot flying without such a defense system called 'support fleet' is an idiot who deserves to die. twice.
7/8/2009,"unless the support fleet is going to shoot down every single drone, every single missile-launching ship, and every single hostile ship; there's the need for a efficient way of defending oneself from the tiny buggers that a cloud of drones bring, or the pain of citadel torpedoes from dreadnoughts. this would be a point-defense system.titans aren't meant to die. they're flagships of alliances.wrong, the defense system would be a small grade of the racial ship's weapon type, perhaps even the civilian version. anything larger than a frigate isn't going to take worrisome damage from it, and the bigger ships will have the range to stay outside of the defense system's range.if anything, just make this system for mothership and carriers then, who are otherwise unarmed. that would help with the issue and defenselessness that carrier and mothership pilots deal with. i've seen a few major fleet fights where the primary damage on carrier killmails were drones if there wasn't a dreadnought there. this idea will not grant either of the super capitals the ability to weather fleets aimed to take them down. the current smartbombs aren't even able to protect the ship enough, let alone kill anything with 'em. this idea is not aimed at allowing the capitals to become invincible, but merely allow them to better defend against drones and missiles. in the real, out of game world, during wwii; all naval military vessels had some sort of mounted machine gun to discourage aircraft from attacking them. carriers and battleships had a very refined system that had a good chance of knocking almost anything that attacked the ship down.in almost all other sci-fi based universes, the capital ships have an established pds to help defend the ships from smaller starfighter attack, and in some cases even against missiles.the point-defense system here is mainly a reasoning that, if logic denotes that capital ships are more often than not armed with some sort of anti-fighter/munition defense system that protects the ship in battle should be represented here as well."
7/8/2009,"that is indeed exactly what they're supposed to do. your caps shoot the pos/hostile caps/other huge stuff, while your support fleet deal with small stuff. caps and supercaps deployed alone or with insufficient support need to die.smartbombs are more then enough defense against drones, juts scoop your own drones before activating, or send them out of range."
7/8/2009,"please visit your user settings to re-enable images.currently when someone receives a chat invite they aren't given any information about the character that invited them. as shown by the screenshot you can either accept, accept and add them to your personal addressbook, block them, minimize the window for ignoring it, or click the x and deny the request. if they're in your people & places the game automatically connects you regardless of whether you feel like conversing or not, but that is another matter i'll address in a different proposal. solution:add the ability to pull up their info from the chat invite window without having to dismiss it or pull up people & places and search their name manually. it could even show there portrait in place of the ? which serves very little purpose. one quick click and you can show info.pros:no longer will you have to blindly accept a conversation with a new name. you will have the ability to easily find out if they are friendly, hostile, or just neutral."
7/8/2009,supported.
7/8/2009,there is no reason whatsoever for this not to exist just fyi
7/8/2009,supporting this
7/8/2009,good idea! i would even go further and show the clickable portrait of the player requesting the conversation. much like how you see it when you view a player ship's info.
7/8/2009,y'know how some people are just magnets for pirates and lowsec bombers?this won't help your chances
7/8/2009,"i support this, it's the most thoughtful and realistic solution to date."
7/8/2009,"i honestly don't see why someone wouldn't like this idea. i have done a lot of programming in the last 20yrs and i know that this rather simple, and non hardware intensive idea, would be a great implement for the game. seeing as how corporate logos are already textured in the game it can easily be stamped on a ship... so there is little problem at all. in fact just take the same system eve uses to make logos for corps and use it to customize ships. why this hasn't been done before i will never know... and anyone that says nay to this is simply just being the devils advocate... if you would rather keep your ship plain than so be it but for everyone else we would like to see this customization take place soon.if it wasn't obvious before i completely endorse this idea."
7/8/2009,got my vote god knows i'm sick of looking at the same ship skins all the freaking time.
7/8/2009,i got in!!!!only 10 attempts to login today.
7/8/2009,the problem is in the addressbar..... asp.....the worst scripting language ever to be created. the only way to make an asp server work is to drastically destroy session in an attempt to regain a small percentage of system resources. it can't be fixed effectively without switching to a real language and real server.
7/8/2009,"the fact that you think that asp is a language, is enough to call you out on not knowing what you are talking about."
7/8/2009,"rofl! well, it's a language by definition, but it's a ""scripting"" language that seems to be a web adapted version of vbscript, which also sucks donkey d*cks.thing is, i think ccp has a partnership with microsoft, so they probably wouldn't change their system for an open source one such as php. all their infrastructure is using microsoft products (windows servers, iis, ms sql 2008 db's and such).as i pointed out before, one easy solution (well, easy depending from which perspective you look at it) would be to manage sessions using a database instead of cookies.to me, the only thing cookies are good for is to store static settings such as preferences and such, not session information. cookies can be copied, hacked, and are plain text (even if the session key is encrypted, but whatever). for this reason alone, they are bad in my opinion and shouldn't be used for anything related to security.unfortunately, asp doesn't have any native way to manage sessions other than with cookies (via a system called the session object). php has a native session management system ("
7/8/2009,"geek police?oh sorry.... it's a jit compiler based scripting ""language""... oops i said it again :-dwow... i'm an a**hole.... but seriously, you take the cake."
7/8/2009,"asp is a scripting engine.vbscript and jscript are languages, which was used to interact with the asp engine.there's a large difference."
7/8/2009,"asp is, in fact, a language.unfortunately, unlike latin, it isn't dead."
7/8/2009,"rofl! i laughed so hard on that one. seriously though, we don't care about the difference between an actual programming language and a scripting engine. now please stop geeking around and get back on topic"
7/8/2009,"multi-logging: a course of action which an individual is granted access to multiple accounts including new, old, and other individuals accounts repeatedly.i request a ban or lock of one account use per i.p. in gameplay login. consider the following:-indivual uses another better individuals account to make more money and put it into corp account. individual logs into personal account with access to corp funds and uses to his benifit or corps benifit.-indivdual wants to start a new account due to mistakes made on current account. individual then creates a new one and transfers funds.-individual wants to engage in war with another corp. or individual. individual then logs onto (example) 3 accounts at a single location to destroy other individual.-individual mines in 0 sec with one account and protect himself with another account. thusfore multilogs.-individual spams with one account and plays with another.these are a few multi-log uses i have come up with. there are possibly many, many, more that could be concidered. i request use of only one account per gameplay i.p. or log-in limit or something to make this action prohibited.so... i should have 3 accounts... turn them into full notch miners with drone protection support so they dont get blasted at by blood diviners and such in zoohen, which contains a significant amount of kernite and pyroxers and log into all 3 (or more with access to multiple accounts) and strip mine every belt in that system. then come out and sell it cheapest bc i control majority of the market of astroids therefore it will sell. then players who dont have high tech,great ships, multiple accounts and maybe just started. have to spend hours mining something to not even make anything close to what they need to support or get what they want and need. so this is fair? is there no such thing as equal gameplay? to get the same out of the game as the other players who can sit there on several acounts with sets of 3 char. ea reaping even the littlest simple inspiration to play? maybe you should look at what other players think of it instead of being selfish."
7/8/2009,"sorry, nope"
7/8/2009,"no.sorry, there's use for having an alt account.mining + haulercyno alt for capitalstrade alt to see market details without traveling.if someone is using 3 alts at the same time in a battle, then i take my hat off to them for their multi-tasking abilities. other than that, they're paying full subs for all of their alt accounts."
7/8/2009,"no.if someone wants to pay for multiple accounts, they should be able to use all of them (or as many as they can manage at one time)."
7/8/2009,"you failed to explain why any of those scenarios are bad. they're not. however:that would be account sharing, which is banned."
7/8/2009,"lolwut?this should be good...working as intended. that's done by just about everyone in a player corp anyway.and that is bad how?they are still just one person. can you imagine how hard it would be to engage in pvp with three accounts at once?and why shouldn't they be able to get security?the spam account would be useless very fast, since people are quite quick with the block option with spammers. making this a bannable offence won't stop it either; just like isk sellers they'll come right back.yes, there are many more uses. all equally within the eula, and any other rulesets you can think of as applies to eve. in fact, all of the things you listed are completely within normal game mechanics.6/10; convincing."
7/8/2009,i think you're being generous.

7/8/2009,so i guess then if there not bad this i guess should be a single player mmorpg because it obsoletes the need for co-op gameplay...

7/8/2009,"anyone who's spent a little time reading scifi will immediately recognize this:one day i decide i just absolutely need to run my dominix solo through curse. i jump into doril from sendaya and guess what? gate camp. no problem says i. i uncloak and immediately launch my 5 mimic drones. they shoot off signatures on all spectrums that exactly mimic my actions....except for movement which is mimiced at a 45 degree angle offset on each drone.if i lock a target, they lock a target. if i fire a gun, they fire a gun (obviously they do no damage). this gives the people trying to lock me down 6 targets to go after allowing me valuable time to escape.of course to keep this balanced the drones are one shot deals....in more than one sense of the word. the incredible amount of power required to create the exact signature of your ship means that they are rendered useless and are not recoverable. also, while locking them does no harm to them a single shot from a weapon immediately creates inconsistencies that allows your ship's computer system to disregard the mimic and copies the information to anyone in your gang network.a light drone could mimic frigate class ships, a medium drone cruiser/bc, a heavy drone bs, a fighter cap ships.additionally the drone would be assignable. this would allow a carrier or dedicated drone boat to create some severe havoc, but would force them to use up valuable drone space in order to do so.support / no-support...-or-.....improve the idea."
7/8/2009,"humm, not sure what i think of that yet. i like it, but at the same time, i'm worried about the consequence of such a type of drone. basically you want a sort of holographic decoy drone that mimics your every move. there's food for thoughts..."
7/8/2009,"you'd need random trajectories, i expect - if they're predictable, players will just memorize the patterns and shoot the right one every time. on top of that, i don't think your drone size to ship size conversion is the right approach - you just wind up with some frig pilot targeting them, potshotting them, and the drones being useless in practice. i think that if you want them to be viable, you need to give them hp and maybe duration or level of replication(e.g., do they bump as if they were real?) as the distinguishing characteristics. drones will appear to take damage as if they were the real ship(except in their owner's drones window), but when they hit their actual hp total, they will die. instead of mimicking actions directly, i'd give them probably four activation options:- ""activate, align, and warp""(where each decoy picks a random celestial, aligns, and warps - sub-fighter decoys are destroyed upon ""warp"")- ""activate and scatter""(where each decoy picks a random direction and heads there at its max speed)- ""activate and orbit target""(pick a range, all decoys attempt to orbit at that range)- ""activate and follow""(all decoys will follow exactly the same navigational commands as the real ship, except offset to form a line/cloud)this will give decoy users a better list of tactical options, while still being simple enough to use in a panic situation i think. also, be aware that this proposal will have serious effects on things like bumping and supercapital survivability. consider a carrier assigning a dozen decoy fighters to a titan. the titan pilot activates them, and all of a sudden, you have 13 nigh-untackleable ships which need to have 15km sigs in order to not be obvious fakes. can you imagine the pinball? also, given that fighters are fairly tough, and titans are a lot tougher, the level of firepower it'd take to kill a single titan backed by a single carrier will go up dramatically, and that's not considering the situation where a dozen carrier pilots put a hundred titans onto overview to save their fearless leader when he gets himself into a bad situation. you'd damn near fill the grid with avatars at times, which can't be healthy. you probably want to consider removing decoy fighters because of situations like this. that said, despite all the above stuff, i do think this is a very cool idea, and i do support it."

7/8/2009,"station games suck! i mean they really suck. bumping a harrassing ship off of a station can be a complete nightmare that is intensely frustrating. at the same time bumping can't be made so easy that it becomes impossible for a ship to find safety in a station.i'm proposing for consideration a new class of drones that would use repellers to effectively ""bump"" a ship. in truth the ""bump"" would actually be a reverse thrust enacted on the ship by the repellers on the drones. sort of like a reverse tractor beam. this would keep drones from making reaching warp an impossibility.so, i launch my 5 light repeller drones. upon launch my tactical overview comes up and my mouse pointer becomes the end of an arrow drawn from the center of whatever my drones are orbiting (currently my ship). by manipulating the arrow in the direction i want the drones to repel an object and clicking i give the drones their angle of attack. i then set them to engage the ship i want repelled and they go to work. for ships that are moving this would have a sort of webifying effect. however, there would be angles involved that would cause the ship to deviate from its set course. these angles would not move the engaged ship's actual heading....so a ship can still warp.....not sure i explained that correctly. if the chord from the nose to the tail of the ship is on the y axis the drones would have no effect that swings that chord off of that axis. (?? i'm confusing myself??) the important point is that a ship would still be able to get to warp normally. also, unlike with webifiers, enough drones would actually cause forward movement to be completely stopped and even reversed. also, incorrectly set drones would actually help the engaged ship move towards its desired goal. (could be useful for anyone who's ever waited for a battleship to get back to the gate after an engagement.)"
7/8/2009,"not supported, bumping is not an official offensive mechanic. besides, this kind of feature would allow for way too much exploiting."
7/8/2009,"sounds cool, but i can't imagine it being balanced well. no support."
7/8/2009,"on the fitting management screen, it would be useful on your saved fittings for each ship to be able to right click the module and be able to ""view market details"" which would make it quicker to go down the list quickly buying each module necessary for the fitting. good for those that loose lotsa ships."

7/8/2009,"you could also alter the derived faction gains/losses to compensate for that, make it perfectly balanced overall (total of gains equals total of losses for every action) and you could even add ""ship kills"" to both standings gains and standings losses... this way you could always return from any ""standings hole"", it will just take a very, very long time (and be potentially very, very dangerous, especially if you want to recover pirate faction negative standings)."
7/8/2009,great idea. fully support
7/8/2009,"i agree that the current curve is wrong, and i agree that the new curve is better. however, i completely disagree when you say that the gain curve should be the same as the loss curve so that a 10% gain can counter a 10% loss completely. this makes no sense.standing in eve is like reputation and should be treated as such.let's say someone has a very good reputation and is completely trusted by a corporation. suddenly, he makes a mistake of great consequences. because he was trusted so much, the first reactions will be ""that can't be, he wouldn't do that"" or ""since we like you very much, we'll give you another chance"". that means the loss of reputation would be minimal.now, let's say someone has a good, but low reputation with a corporation and is just starting to be trusted. then he makes a huge mistake. the corporation would probably say ""humm, looks like we were wrong about this one, he's not so trustworthy after all"". the loss in reputation would be bigger then.after a certain point, if that someone keeps on doing bad things the corporation doesn't like, his reputation with them would just drop faster and faster.however, let's say someone has a very bad reputation with a corporation and is not trusted at all because he did a lot of bad mistakes that ****ed them off. then all of a sudden, he wants to be nice and does one good thing for them. the corporation will be happy, but due to their lack of trust would probably say something like ""humm, okay, he did this for us, but it could just be a trick. let's see if he really means it this time."". the gain in reputation would be minimal.and then, if someone has a bad (but not that bad) reputation with a corporation decides to do something good for them, the corporation would probably say ""well, i can't say we like him that much yet, but he's shown some good sides. maybe we can give him a chance"". the gain in reputation would be slightly bigger.reputation is easy to lose, and not easy to gain, and trust is gained over time through repetitive trustworthy actions. it's a known fact, and it shouldn't be different in eve.therefore i think the curves should be more like this:please visit your user settings to re-enable images.that means it would take much more time to recover from deep low standing, but take much less time to lose it. it would also mean that pirates choosing a life of crime (by supporting evil npc corporations), would have the corresponding reputation and not be just on the ""edge"" because they go up and down in standing all the time."
7/8/2009,if this was the suggestion i would be for it. the current reputation grind is incredibly insane.
7/8/2009,"many systems store data for which there would not be need. so for example it when players after missioning dont pick up the loots and wrecks, which use server capacity and make lag in system. (reason: too little components falls from the wrecks already and loots nerfed to meta 1 crap, 800 cap booster and smallbombs reprocess nerfed too)one big system where 30+ players did missions and dont got the wrecks, create approximately within 1 hours approximately 6000 wrecks in system. and this is just one system. think his intestine is needed in more hundred systems so unnecessary to store these wrecks. the server store this data through 1.5-2 hours.my idea:when the players who got a mission, the server could be store the mission spot (grid) , and a script would clear this area.just need a code to server which clear the grid from wrecks and new answers for agents when completed the mission.like this:1. i completed your mission, but i did there a little mess. you may send over the cleaning units there.2. i completed your mission, share bounty for my fleet and you may send over the cleaning units there.3. i completed your mission, i want the bounty and i want to investigate personally those wrecks.4. i completed your mission, i want share the bounty and i want to investigate personally those wrecks."
7/8/2009,"you know i actually think i have to support this. i don't even mission that much or hang out around big hubs, but with the addition of options from talking to your agent to keep the wrecks there or to eliminate them, i just don't see why not.this also would be an awesome way to mess with ninja salvagers. hehe just imagine their faces when the wrecks just vanish."
7/8/2009,/signed
7/8/2009,"no way, not supported. there's already a 2 hours lifetime for wrecks, and this is fine as it is.personally, i don't salvage with the same ship as i do missions with. i have 2 thrashers. one is fitted for combat, and the other for salvaging (4x salvagers and 4x tractor beams). i usually complete 3-4 missions before i switch to my salvager and go salvage all the wrecks i have bookmarked. your suggestion means i would have to fit only 1 salvager and painfully salvage one wreck at a time as i go? there's just no way. it's fine as it is.and by the way, wrecks in deadspace that you do not see do not create lag for you. the only way objects will create lag is if the server has to send you their location because you can see them in space. objects have to be within range for them to create lag for you.since nobody but you (or maybe a small gang you fleeted with) will be at mission locations, the lag from floating mission wrecks is minimal."
7/8/2009,this.
7/8/2009,"not to mention ccp always intended for salvage to be a mini profession - if you don't clean up your wrecks, you can bet someone will probably scan them down and clean them up for you.you'd essentially nerf an entire intended profession into non-existence."
7/8/2009,"what do you talk about ? 1.all system checked 5 mins for wreck. using a script this.which wreck reached the time will delete for system.""i wrote, in one system where use agent 30+ player make +6000 wreck within one hour. this is just one system, if we reckon with 100 systems like this we will got 6.000.000 wreck within one hour, 12.000.000 within two hour.""2. my suggestion was you "" fit only 1 salvager and painfully salvage one wreck at a time as i go? ""no if you dont select first or second opition at agent, the wreck will still there man.you not lost anything, but you can clear that area if you dont need wrecks.and by the way all stored item in database eating source for server, so you told stupid things. and another thing the cleaning code on server always check each single wrecks of timer, deleteable or not. you believe it only that this cheque does not reserve a resource because of server."
7/8/2009,"if i understand correctly by reading between the lines of bad english, you say there would be an option when you complete a mission to either leave the wrecks there or tell the agent to send someone to clean them out?i don't think this would be needed. there's no benefit for the players in that change, and the performance of the server wouldn't be improved in any way.you would have a ""script"" to clear those wrecks on demand, yes, but there would still be a need for a background script running periodically to clear all wrecks that are older than 2 hours anyway. so you're actually adding a new task on the server, not removing one.and as for more records causing worse performance on the server, well it's debatable. technically, you would still have the same amount of records to delete in the end. either it's deleted by the periodic script that deletes wrecks older than 2 hours, or it's deleted by your new ""on demand"" script. either way, it would be the same number of delete queries in the end. in fact, right now, the deletion of wrecks is done at a constant rate, so the performance of the server is affected at a constant rate. if on top of that job, you add another one that players can call on demand, then you're throwing that smooth constant rate out of balance.i don't know how to explain it better...bottom line is, more wrecks in deadspace != more lag for everyone. get that out of your head.still not supported, this suggestion is pointless."
7/8/2009,"i dont care you support me or not, if you you do not see the forest from the tree and tell different things because of the reality.any who playing from old times can know, much object in system produce more lag so dont speak stupid thing like this : deadspace wrecks != more lag for everyonemore objects = lag.what do you think ccp why nerfed numbers of the drones ?because double objects use double server resources.what do you think why use ccp cleaning script ? because too many object in system produce more lag. with as much fewer objects can be found in the system, it more playable and it less the lag.why banned corps who made server collapses, who destroyed a freighter whith some objects in deadspace ? oh may be you you do not remember, because your character maybe too young, but old players remember, and known game mechanics. other thing what u said more 1 procedure to server, this is not true, because just half of players using this options (clean their grid) , the checker script half of resource will freed.another thing 1.5-2 hours not clearing all wrecks, because the players produce them continuously.always still there over thousands wrecks."
7/8/2009,"i'm not violently opposed to this, but at the same time, i don't see any good reason to support it. wrecks already expire fairly quickly, and the destruction of the scan-and-salvage profession(minor though it may be) is not something i want to encourage. unnecessary complication with poor gameplay effects? no thanks."
7/8/2009,"as a salvager by profession i would have to disagree with your proposal. this is one of those things where i kind of agree with you and i kind of don't. i think something must be done about the lag caused by wrecks but i don't believe i should have to slow down or stop my multi million isk job. perhaps a system where the wrecks would use less memory, or coding, to decrease the load. moreover, the ccp team could invest more in hardware to help this problem out. lag in general is the problem... not just the wrecks mind you. though wrecks can cause lag it causes far less lag than many other things in the game that could be changed in some way.anyways, nice proposal and your heart is somewhat in the right place, but i suggest you investigate a little more and come up with a proposal on how to confront lag by listing as much things as possible that can be altered to make lag less annoying."
7/8/2009,"i am tempted to support your idea only to see kahega amielden crying and screaming in this thread, but:1) as it as already been stated, wrecks create lag if you are on the same grid and only when loading the grid. exactly as all the other static object.people being banned for spawning items at the gates were creating lag on that grid for easier killing and that is why they were banned, they were not creating ""general"" lag. drone number was reduced as they were increasing on grid lag. what lag a system with 100+ persons running missions/using the market and so on is the database calls for new data, not the static data like wrecks. 2) it will damage the ninja salvagers, while i dislike kahega whining and self aggrandizement of a scavenger activity, it is a totally legitimate activity. any ecosystem need scavengers.3) it is not broke, so don't fix it."
7/8/2009,"you don't understand at all how it works. there could be 300,000 wrecks at a specific location in deadspace, and if nobody else is around them to see them (in the same grid), there won't be any lag at all in the system.lag is created when the server has to update multiple clients with too much information. if let's say, 10 players warp to that spot where all the containers are, then there would be a spike of lag because the server would have to send the location of 300,000 containers 10 times.as long as nobody sees objects in space, those objects will not interact with any player and therefore not create any lag.there's a big difference between server resources, and network lag. learn the difference!ccp didn't have wrecks despawn after 2 hours just because it caused lag. in fact, most wrecks won't cause lag unless too many of them are in a popular area (i.e. near stargates and asteroid belts). they will however, take more space in the database, and that could add-up overtime, which is why they clean them periodically.still wrong. your logic makes no sense. there's always going to be a process that clears wrecks older than 2 hours. that process probably runs every few minutes if not less. that means the load created by this delete request is constant (every few minutes, constant interval). now you're adding another on-demand option to delete those wrecks instantly. that means you would have the previous script still running every few minutes, and overlapping it, your new script that could be called anytime by players completing missions. the server would pretty much be spammed by this command (if you consider the number of players in the game, only half like you say would be thousands!).i really don't think it will happen for this very reason."

7/8/2009,"let's make them all more interesting and tie them together with configurable drones.are the advanced drones really all that special? they should and can be.first a high slot module: drone reconfiguration controller (or whatever).then advanced drones made from the stuff dropped in drone regions.then plentiful stuff harvested from wormholes that is manufactured into swappable drone modules that are fairly bulky to ensure not too many are carried.a player fits the drc in a high slot, pops 5 light advanced drones into his drone bay and 5 each combat modules, ecm modules, armor repair modules, etc. in his cargo hold. the drones must be recalled to the bay to be reconfigured. the modules are destroyed when removed in the bay but not if removed in a station fitting screen or corp hangar at a pos.this creates more possibilities for drone users, wormhole explorers and drone region dwellers. it's not unbalancing as the drone user loses modules when swapped in combat. support / not support......-or-.....help improve the idea."
7/8/2009,"so you want tech 3 drones? that sounds crazy to me, but i think it actually makes it into the category of ""so crazy it just might work"". it can't be done as a standalone thing, but as part of a broader drone overhaul, like we've been asking for for ages...maybe. i'll support it, because this is one i'd like to see get to ccp, see if they can come up with a cool way to do it."

7/8/2009,what he said.
7/8/2009,"interesting idea, but there's a lot more that needs to go into it. example: what's the benefit? if i saw something like that, i'd go grab a cloaky ceptor, wait for whatever the 'boss' was to die, and ninja-snatch the crap outta the loot. this then becomes a race to the wrecks more than anything. maybe some kind of badging system maybe? but then we'd have to implement and badging system, and yeah - bump that.random charley foxtrots would be pretty damn fun - particularly watching the scramble as people realize their log ships are two systems over and fawkfawkfawkfawkjumpyougiantpileofcrapwarpwarpwarpwarpnow! would be entertaining."
7/8/2009,"well this is just the base of the ideea, i'd wanted you guys to elaborate more on that. you could like have a fight for the loot at the end. say 10 players go .. do the npc stuff than they have to go against themselves for the loot. have like 5 expensive new mods in the wreck. each player that wins the pvp battle can only pick 1. you could have like 1-2 slots for saboteurs in the fleet and so on. there's ways to improve this to make it really fun and reward-worthy. i got a big exam in 2 days so i can't think about it more, but i still thing it could turn into a great ideea."

7/8/2009,"how about just making it so the shield recharge rate while docked is like 500% the normal rate, but doesn't completely recharge shields instantly?you would need to see the level of your shields somewhere like in the fitting window so you can tell when it's done, but other than that, it wouldn't require much development and i think it just makes sense.they could even make it so different station types have different recharge rates (depending on size)."

7/8/2009,"seriously, would it make a difference if you had to spend a whole 1-2min waiting for it to charge? every time i dock i spend far more time there anyways. there is no point and of course it should be instant anyways. you are thinking about how it would be like in our time... if we were in space we would have mastered and harvested energy that we could never imagine. to think it wouldn't be almost instant is clearly showing a limitation on your imagination."

7/8/2009,i do not support this proposal for a few reasons.1. goonswarm2. goonswarm3. i hate looking around and seeing people name things that kind of ruing the overall gameplay for me. i like to roleplay a bit but i get rather annoyed when i come across people with names that don't make sence or contain symbol's.if this proposal was to go through it would have to have complete control over the naming system... then i would probably be okay with it. until then.. helz no.

7/8/2009,"login #2 - thanx sessionmedals are awards.certificates are capabilities.completely different things, they just happened to be in the same patch, get over it.many alliances and corps have external api based systems that do exactly this.all he's suggesting is that corps get this ability in-game, so they can set-out in a structural way the career paths their corp supports for the members. it means they can point to the certs as pre-req for corp roles/titles/jobs/positions/divisions.don't jump all over the guy it's a 100% completely legit feature and area of need.completely unrelated to medals.p.s. evemail and fw first :-p"
7/8/2009,"sorry but ""if too expensive for you the medals, go and make isk. all carebear want to free stuffs. work for it."" sounded pretty moronic to me at the time, and still does. these are not constructive arguments, they are attacks that were targeted at me so i responded.i've explained this several times already but let me explain it again.first of all, medals were originally not meant to be used as certificates. there's no mechanic in place in the game to set skill requirements for a medal. it's all defined in ""text"" by someone. so yes, you could use medals as certificates, but then you'd need to really trust your members when they tell you they finished a certain skill requirement because there's no way for a corp to know it, except if someone in the corp develops some sort of tool that will list each member's skills using their api key. that means medals are not meant for this.what i'm asking is for an integrated system made just for this purpose, where a certificate would have set skill requirements (hard coded using the game interface), and be automatically awarded to members who meet those requirements.if you think i want free stuff, then just make the cert creation cost something. however since it's just paper (in theory) then it shouldn't cost anything to make, as opposed to medals that use precious metals and such.you might think medals used as certificates would be a clever thing to do, but i really don't see how it would considering the costs.see above...i thought it was clear enough in my original post why medals were not the solution, but i guess not... as far as the cost to make one, i agree there could be one to make them in the first place (create the cert), but not to give them out, since it would be automatically given."
7/8/2009,"no support because you're confusing gcc and player/corporate flagging timers with local aggression timers. though they seem similar they are different systems and trigger/countdown for different reasons. the local aggression timer (aka pvp timer) is what determines your ships status when you logoff or are disconnected from the game, and this timer is always hidden, even in highsec space."
7/8/2009,"it would be very helpful and less confusing if some sort of scan log was added to the overview in such way, that scanned entities which have reached a 100% signal detection were listed elliminating the clutter on the ppl and places bookmark area."
7/8/2009,"well technically, as long as you stay in the same system, you're last discoveries will stay in the scanner window. i don't see how this would really help.the actual request should be to show bookmarks that are in the current system in the overview."
7/8/2009,"thanks for your reply.. yes, ""...as long as you stay in the same system..."" but ask explorers about how good this is when scanning multiple systems or wh cahins. as soon as you leave the system, the bookmark piles up and you get multiple 250k+ jumps away bookmarks in your places tab which are hard to filter for deletion. in my case, i rarely come to a system on which i will end up using the same scanning ship that eventually fits the purpose of the finding. try a buzzard as sample.. not good for anything but the dedicated specialization of the modules fitted."
7/8/2009,"i understand your problem, but the overview is meant to show active objects only at the moment, and only those which are within visible range (except celestials and stations). the overview needs a source. showing bookmarks in the overview would be a solution, as the overview could look at your bookmarks to get information. however, there's no tracking of things you have discovered in other systems, only the current one.so the proper solution would either be to show bookmarks in the overview (but that wouldn't solve your cluttered places tab issue), or make the things you discover stick for as long as they exist even if they are in another system (you would have to run a scan in a given system to see the things you had already discovered before)."
7/8/2009,"thanks for your reply..maybe the overview is not the right place to put it. maybe we need an uberview or sort.. in any case, it's a bit frustrating having to bookmark something that is already listed in the system (scan window) and finding that if you did not bookmark that site or did tried to clean the clutter in your places tab accidentally deleting something important, you find out that after you come back with your specialized ship for the site (or worse, your team), there happens to be no bookmark or any way to retrieve what you've already done."
7/8/2009,"are we ever gonna get new ones?, think most missile users were hoping for a change in the last graphical update. and what about missile bays actually showing on your ship and not just missiles magicly coming out your ship.i think this needs to be adressed as the old school missile effects dont cut it anymore"
7/8/2009,"oh that's been requested many many times already, but i guess ccp doesn't listen or that they have some secret stuff in the works for it, because nothing is done about it.the whole turret and missile effects need to be reworked.missiles ""puffing"" out of nowhere around the ship makes no sense. you see turret guns, but not missile bays. this sucks.you should be able to see the missile bays on a ship just like turrets, and the smoke should be coming from the bays and not from the ship's hull.i would also love to see missile smoke trails (optional for lower end systems), and rocket barrages like the ones in robotech."
7/8/2009,"you obviously don't fly capital ships, do you?"
7/8/2009,"deal with it as it is, no problem doesnt need changing"
7/8/2009,"no i don't, but it doesn't make any different even if i did. i know capitals have maximum jump ranges in light-years, but you could still see those distances using a new filter on the map showing all systems within jump range in a different color for example. either way, the map as it is now is messy and not easy to use at all. it may ""look"" nice and glowy, but that's about it. if it has to be in 3d, then make it so you can hide everything you don't need to see, and still change the stars into flat circles instead of glowy spheres of light.the biggest problem with this map is that even when flattened, you still see every distant star overlapping each other, and that the glow makes some filters pretty much unusable because there's just too much feather effect."
7/8/2009,"that is drasatic indeed, i never realized (and never wanted) to have such dire consequences. probably you're right, considering the powerblocs' modus operandi -lame if you ask me- but the things is a really big smile gets drawn on my face when i hear the older eve players talking about how the game used to be before...lots and lots of roaming gangs with ships that didn't usually get any bigger than a cruiser (not assault ships) and all the fun they used to haveso yes, most probably my idea is nothing but trash material but i'm positive something can still be done to bring back those experiences, or new ones that can refresh the game. and i'm not talking about walking in stations because that's completely differentwe can still hope, right?"
7/8/2009,"even if you thnk split weapons need fixing(and i tend to), the eris is not the ship to start with. no support."
7/8/2009,"it doesn't have to be just about spaceships.anyway the problems involved in having combat in stations was talked about at the last fanfest (spoon death etc, check the videos). it doesn't fit in neatly with eve's player death system. i guess you could have a 'holodeck' style area for it, although personally i'm not keen on 'arena' areas in games, as it lessens the penalty of player death. unless you could bet on your holodeck games of course.."
7/8/2009,ui show info button with chat invitei'll be adding more. ;)
7/8/2009,accessibility for the eve impaired.
7/8/2009,"status quo is completely fine with regards to this issue. salvaging is a unique, fun, and profitable professions that would not exist without the ability to harvest from any wreck in the game with impunity. stop crying about it already."
7/8/2009,"well, i just made a noob character and played with it on evemon a bit, i trained this character to fly a vagabond decently (full t2 with most things level 4) and i was able to achieve that with some 8m sp and about 5 months.then i have made him to fly a vagabond with max skills, and i was able to easily put 30m sp just into flying the vagabond and maximizing it, (hac v, med ac spec v, support gunnery, shields, nav and all to v).you cannot say that the elite pilot will not have a considerable advantage over the normal one, maybe 50-75% better overall even if they have the same intellectual skill!it is impossible to deny there is a strong degree of elitism in eve, like someone said, in 2013 new players will have so much to catch up to, now the average requirement for a pvp corp is flying t2 hacs/recons, sniper/rr bs, but in a few years the standard will be flying, if not owning capital ships, maybe in 2017 ppl need to be able to fly a titan to be considered into good alliances!something must be done about that, i have no idea what, but it is a problem."
7/8/2009,here's my opinion to improve low sec: make all space from 0.1 to 0.8 low sec. only 0.9 and 1.0 will be true high sec space. eve needs more danger. you should be in a pvp environment everywhere you go.
7/8/2009,the last thing that needs to happen in eve is to make it more carebear friendly. suicide ganking is fine how it is. play smart. don't fly what you cannot afford to lose.
7/8/2009,"trolls who only want to abort any possible improvment or progress stfu pls.yes very good idea, it can be further improved by setting the prices of mods in relation to prices in a certain system, for examply 10% above or below jita average price, or 20% lower than rens price or something like that, this will make it easier than setting price for each module."

7/9/2009,"qtfi agree with you 100%, csm needs to take this back to ccp, even if they don't want to, its one of the most supported idea's in the game."
7/9/2009,/signed
7/9/2009,"you're arguement makes about as much sense as a new player flying a battleship after 1 month sporting medium sized gear. this game is about learning and stair stepping to bigger and better things. it's not about being handed a platter, it's about making your own damn food.ccp has more and more catered to fast ways to equalized new players because apparently, not power leveling in 10 days is a bad thing about this game.i'm tired of the dumbing down of game play to pander to the asshats who always whine about why they can't do something. guess what, it's a game that's not ment to let you do everything in a day, if you don't like, it, go find wow and pay some ******* to level you to 80 tomorrow. god forbid in this game it might take you an extra day to run missions or rat to get the same rigs joe schmoe millionaire got faster because he's one of the lucky ****s with a t2 bpo. i have like 0 income in this game. my income comes from effort, not from luck, not from industry. so why people think i am some rich asshat who just wants to keep the curve in his favor is beyond me. i just want this game to have some uniqueness to it for a smidge longer until some of the new mmo's come out, then i could give a **** what ccp does, because capitalism will play people like me out of this product and on to something i deem better just like it has with so many vets who were there from long ago when this game required work. eve was a harsh environment, now it's progressed into so much less. god forbid some of us want it to retain it's old qualities."
7/9/2009,"yes, because hacs costing 5 mil to rig instead of 40 is clearly a change intended to make life easier for newbies, because newbies are the ones who keep a half-dozen ishtars on hand to replace losses. oh, wait..."
7/9/2009,"i do not support this patch.it will decrease rigs from being high end modifications to common t1 crap.why would anyone like to see their stuff majorly devalued, i wonder.also the rig patch will remove a basis for income for small rig producers. those who invested into expensive rigs get the kick in the butt.those who invested into rig manufacturing get a kick in the butt.as usual ccp punishes any sort of long term planing.the only long term planning ccp will never touch is investment in t2 bpos.i guess lucky if ya got a good lobby at ccp .edit:in the very least existing rig blueprints should turn into small, medium and large blueprints (and not just the large one) - since they currently cover the complete range - that should not change.but i doubt that will happen. would probably be too much effort, and why bother."
7/9/2009,"sadly, i dont support the new rigs.why? because the current rig system is perfectly fine, but needs some balances. the idea is that rigs are on option, and that the risk of losing them should prevent them from bieng standard on every ship, like faction/deadspace/officer mods. much as t2 ships were once rare and extremely expensive, they now are essentially required to compete in the current pvp world because they have been made so widely available. this is what would happen to rigs, the same standard fits over and over using the same rigs with essentially no loss because of t1 insurancereally only balancing is needed. such changes like useless rigs having their bonuses re-assigned to more practical ones, rigs that cost 20-25+ mil have their manufacturing costs lowered (trimarks and cargo opts come to mind), hole filling resist rigs such as em shield hardening rigs costing more than 4 milexample: why pay 20 mil for a buzzard when you could fit your scanners and rigs on a heron for 300k? because the buzzard protects the 35 mil in rigs you have on it with a cloak, the heron has no cloak and is easy to find and kill."
7/9/2009,"no, because the buzzard can move around without telling hostiles that it's there, and assuming you have cov ops skill at more then level 2, a rigged buzzard has higher strength then a rigged heron."
7/9/2009,"not supported.ccp are doing the right thing here to increase diversity - op, please consider the following statement: the number of fitting combinations rises exponentially with the number of slots so it is a basic mathematical fact that increasing the number of used slots increases diversity.your logic seems to have mashed ship diversity and isk vs reward into the same paragraph because you've got stuck on the original concept rather than seeing that we are moving forward from there: there are many ways 'to pay for the extra ump' in the game already and by denying rigs to t1 frigates and more casual players you are harming the diversity of the game."
7/9/2009,"besides that, rigs have drawbacks. combined with the drawbacks of some modules it would make the ships way more diverse. an armor tanker will be slow as hell, a speed tanker will have the ehp of a wet paper bag, etc.what i don't get in the whole rig story is why t1 ships get 3 rigs, t2 get 2 rigs and t3 get 3 rigs... how about t1 with 1 rig, t2 with 2 rigs and t3 with 3 rigs? it would make the difference bigger and that would cause more people to go out roaming in an expensive pwn-boat instead of their cheap throw-away ship."
7/9/2009,"because that""s what the people are screaming for.remember 3 years ago when you had to work for things.....today people dont want to work for things....can you say.....wow i do agree with most of op points tho"
7/9/2009,g
7/9/2009,"actually i would like thow-away ships to stay valuable, as that's about the only way new pilots get in pvp.do small rigs make sence? yesdoes it make sence that they are cheaper? yesdoes it increase diversity? yesdoes it add more content? yesdoes it make game more interesting? yesdoes it make life easier for me? yeswill small rigs alow me to rig my destroyer and make it a badass ship and go shoot crap and get it blown up and have fun? yesis this topick trying to take away all of the above from me? yeswhat are the benefits of the stuff author offers, what is the alternative? ....is the tpick pure whine and trling? ....conclusion: no support.use your brain peoples! i feel that currently ai is often smarter then some people when i read topicks like this."
7/9/2009,"it's not ccp introducing smaller rigs that will cause more people to adopt ""cookie-cutter setups."" it's those setups working. people already fit and fly ships with cookie-cutter setups today, because someone else did the math for them, and it turned out some combination of modules did better in the majority of situations than another one. it is inevitable that someone, somewhere will do that math, as it is that people will pick up on it and copy successful fits. it's just simpler to do this today than it was three years ago, because of eft, battleclinic etc.i agree that smaller rigs should provide a slightly smaller bonus though, it makes sense. in fact, i hope ccp will review rigs in general and make sure that small rigs, for instance, have bonuses which are meaningful for frigates to have. but suggesting that adding other rig sizes ""dumbs down"" eve pvp is ridiculous. what is does is give small ship pilots more options."
7/9/2009,"this deserves clarification so bear with me:loggofski should always function as it does currently, mechanically, as people do from time to time genuinely lose connections.however, the practice of continually hammering ctrl+q to avoid threats, in successive instances one after antoher, needs to be nipped in the bud.the exact number of times before message display and lockout as discussed below can be tweakedi beleive these measures will prevent the amazing dissapearances of freighters, battleships, jf's and orca that abound in new eden when they are under attack.if someones connection really is so bad that they repeatedly lose it a score of times in a row in short succession then it really is too dangerous for them to be playing eve, as far as the risk of losing ship due to no fault of thier own.if they are a ctrl q'ing scumbag trying to save a freighter by exploiting game mechanics then they will be limited as to the number of times they can ctrl q in a row before they are stuck out of game for 15 minutes while thier ship is popped; if it has a agression timer. i propose:if you lose connection or ctrl+q, events occurr as they do currently.if they log back in entering the game on the same character and then ctrl + q again within the next two minutes of that logon the account gets flagged by the server as one potentially suffering connection issues.if the player then logs back in and enters the game on the same character that they did previously and then logs off or ctrl + q's within two minutes of logging on, then the following happens.- if they attempt to logon and enter the game on that character, within 15 minutes of the last ctrl + q they are presented with the message:'dear pod pilot, we believe you may be having issues with your neural uplink and you are having trouble maintaining a connection. for your safety, you will be unble to enter the game on 'x' character for the next 15 minutes while we perform essential maintenance and diagnostics. we suggest invetigate the eventuality that your connection may be damaged or inoperable in this time, or make a nice cup of tea'(edit: it doesnt have to be this message. if you are more coffee person thats fine)"
7/9/2009,because supporting a topic with your own alts is the 'done' thing at the moment it seems
7/9/2009,"while i am not sure that i support this exact method of doing so, i do cast general support at some kind of attempt to fix logoffskis.also, since i normally try and dock immediately if my connection gets this unstable, i would at least add that ctrl-q in a station doesn't count towards the total.at any rate, logoffski is something that definately needs to be looked at - whether it can be fixed is another matter.support for an investigation of fixes."
7/9/2009,"i found this link that officially explains the current logout mechanics: logging out of the gamei'll quote it too:so that being said, the current timer for pvp aggressed players loging off is 15 minutes before they vanish, and they won't be able to warp out if they are warp scrambled. their ship/pod can be probed down and killed while that time is still ticking. so what is the problem here?"
7/9/2009,"its a touchy issue given ccp cant really know if someone is genuinely losing connection or exploiting emergency warp and given stopping people from logging out is farcical.the proposal is aimed at stamping on those that routinely use ctrl + q as a get out of free jail card- such as logging a freighter off 6 times in a row to avoid tacklers and any possibility of being probed out.if you log back in the moment you log out it is impossible for someone to probe you out and then warp tackler to you catch you before you e-warp again-under the above proposal this no longer works as once you trip the limit, your ship (probably under an aggression timer at this point) will be hanging around in space for 15 minutes with you being able to log in.with careful assessment by ccp of the threshold that you have to break and associated times the likelihood of this proposal making life difficult for legitimate players is so infinitesimally small it need not be considered."
7/9/2009,"when you ctrl q your ship tries to perform an emergency warp.if you are pointed, your ship cannot e-warp. if you arent pointed you ewarp 1 au away.shortly before you e-warp you are invulnerable to damage and points, so your agressors have even less time to kill you than you might expect.now the important part:if you had an agression timer before you pressed ctrl q your ship will dissapear from space in 15 minutes; it ceases to exist in space.if you didnt have an agression timer before you ctrl q'd, after landing from the e-warp your ship dissapears in approx 15 seconds.if you were pointed after ctrl q and couldnt ewarp your ship still dissapears from space after 15-30 seconds; latency issues!the current exploitative issue is:people ctrl q'ing, then immediately logging back in and ctrl q'ing again- this second time, they will have landed in a safespot due to an e-warp or if they are fast enough will still be in the original emergency warp.now bear with me, still not done.people repeatedly ctrl q.you cant catch a ship that never leaves warp!if the abuser is a little slower, you have a window of mere seconds to probe him out and warp a tackler to him- you must point him before he e-warps again.worsethere is a related exploitative aspect to thiswhen you ctrl q in mid warp, when you log back in and ctrl q your destination (where you will warp to on logging back in the next time you log back in) is reset to be the location you were at the last time you ctrl q'd.sorry if thats a little muddled"
7/9/2009,according to this kb:
7/9/2009,"you're not wrong. but there's no way anyone could get aggro timer if he logs out after his aggro timer was reset by jumping into next system etc.logoffski should be fixed. this game shouldn't be up to playing around with ""out of character"" timers."
7/9/2009,"could be. dont know if that has been recently revised or if that is old though, ccp documentation isnt the best the fact is, what actually happens in space bears only passing resemblance to those times detailed in your link, for the users.warping from planet to planet will get you caught. warping from safespot to safespot you can still be caught.abusing ctrl q allows you to be invulnerable. do you understand the issue?you cant jump through a stargate in a freighter and expect to warp to a planet or indeed a safe normally if the gate has a tackler on the otherside.ctrl q allows you to avoid this initial tackle, or to escape it with no recourse from the attacker, and then infalliably avoid being tackled again provided you keep ctrl q'ing.perhaps you would like to dig up an interesting account by noir pilots posted a while back that details a freight that did exactly this, using ctrl q 6+ times in a row to escape them in a system; if memory serves even a double sensor boosted covops couldnt probe out and lock the freighter before he e-warped; this is post probe changes so in theory probing out a target you know is nearby, with probes out should be easy, especially with a freighter."
7/9/2009,as far as i know your aggro timer is reset (as in it restarts) every time you come in contact with a gate (i.e. jump) or with concord (for pvp aggro timers only). so jumping through a gate after getting pvp aggro won;t allow you to instantly vanish when you logout. you'll still have to wait 15 minutes.
7/9/2009,"kaylan,i think the real issue is this:if i genuinely disconnect, when i reconnect my ship will warp back to the spot i left from. if my attackers are still there, well and good, the fun resumes. if not, all the better for me.the problem comes in if i ctrl-q, i e-warp away. then i log in, and while my ship is warping back to my attackers, i ctrl-q again. that second ctrl-q moves my e-warp start point on the system to that random spot in space where the original e-warp would have ended.consider this:fight is at point a. i ctrl-q and the system immediately tries to e-warp me to point b. when i return to the game, my ship naturally tries to return to point a. however, if i immediately ctrl-q again, the system marks point b as my start point, and warps me off to point c. when i log back in, i get auto warped to point b with very little chance that my attacker will be there. forget the agression timer - most logoffskis will refuse to fire, or even lock their attackers so as to minimize their time spent in space.doing that repeatedly simply compounds the movement of my ship. essentially, these players are taking advantage of the server's current inability to distingish between a ctrl-q and a dropped connection. not because it can't do so, but because ccp has not told it to should care. to the server they look exactly the same, and are handled in exactly the same way.logoffski is a ""tactic"" that simply takes advantage of the way the game handles you suddenly not being there anymore."
7/9/2009,"ahhhhh ok, that makes sense then. it's basically making safe spots on the go. i was under the impression that when you log back on, you would finish coming out of warp before ctrl-q would e-warp you somewhere else again. that is indeed fubar then, and should be fixed.supported!what should happen is this:1. you come out of a jump into a known gate camp.2. you press ctrl-q but while you align, a tackler scrambles you and destroys your ship, then your pod.3. you log back on in station with a rookie ship.or1. you come out of a jump into a known gate camp.2. you press ctrl-q and manage to warp away before anyone can tackle you.3. you log back on and hit ctrl-q while you're still in warp.4. your ship still comes out of warp unattended at the same spot you were at before the first ctrl-q (the gate).5. the tackler wakes up this time and scrambles you before the new e-warp (from the second ctrl-q) can activate, destroys your ship, then your pod.6. you log back on in station with a rookie ship.is that pretty much what you were asking for?"
7/9/2009,"intentional logoffski is, to me, cheating.if you got your ship into a scrap, then you may lose it. the game must have winners and losers and we should all be on both sides of that coin from time to time. indeed, without that the game would be pointless.fully supported - this is a rational and reasonable balanced approach to both real connection issues and logoffski."
7/9/2009,"assuming your last post doesnt exist for a moment...- warping from safespot to safespot leaves you lockable for longer than continually controll q'ing does. very few people have enough safespots to not have to cycle them. fewer still have 5+ safespots in every system along thier travel route and have a ship that aligns to warp fast enough that it can avoid a waiting tackler in one of thier safespots- of course ctrl q makes that tackler impotent, you see?- you cant jump through a gate into a 0.0 gatecamp, then simply warp off. you can ctrl q, with no aggro. if you survive long enough for your ship to warp off of dissapear from space, when you log back in you can controll q again and instead of landing back at the camp you will be able to log back in at a point where there are no hostiles- and then do this again and again and again until they get bored of trying to catch a target that is either always in warp or invulnerable ('your targets is invulnerable' as he has logged off and e-warping."
7/9/2009,"i edited my last post quite a bit while you were probably posting this, so read it again and let me know if i understood correctly."
7/9/2009,"no! what i suggested was having someone unable to log in on that character after they have ctrl q'd repeatedly in a short timeframe.what you suggest would acheive the same thing, more or less. but with the exception that someone would possibly have to spend hours before they could log back in- assuming they are waiting for the camp to leave!if this proposal doesnt get any csm coverage maybe you should raise what you suggested here sometime as a separate proposal- it would solve the issue i think, albeit in another way."
7/9/2009,"i think my suggestion would probably be easier to implement than yours though, simply because all they have to do, is queue the second e-warp after the first one completes instead of interrupting it mid-warp to warp again."
7/9/2009,"i know most people don't use the mac client, but here's how it works:apple-q (ctrl-q basically) forces you to click 'ok' on a dialog box saying you're quitting and it's dangerous. also, in windowed mode, clicking the close button is disabled. so you have to tell the client / ccp that you are quitting.putting things like this in the windows client wouldn't stop the issue because resourceful players would still find a way, but it would stop a lot of the logofskies which i think are panic driven."
7/9/2009,"with experience from other games which detect the difference between quitting and disconnects, it doesnt help anything. it doesnt take a degree in rocket science to pull your network cable/click on your wireless button. while i fully agree logoffski's are a problem, i cant possibly support this topic. the only real difference this would make is screwing over the people who got some connection issues for a while, it doesnt help anything against logoffski. the people doing a logoffski wont be able to login for 15 minutes, but their freighter is still perfectly safe. it would only help against freighters with agro timer, but serious if you manage to get it agro timer how on earth did you manage to not have a point on it for the time it takes to allign?correct me if i am wrong, but for 99% the logoffski issue is ctrl+q'ing right after you jump through a gate. two possible solutions i see:give people who jump through a gate a 1.5 minutes agro timer, which goes to the normal 15 minutes when being fired upon. so when you logout, you got 1 minute gate cloak, and if someone shoots you the next 30 seconds you get a 15 minutes agro timer, and they got plenty of time to kill you.alternative is stop resetting agro timer when jumping through a gate. imo the better solution, with as downside that they are still pretty much invulnerable when jumping from high sec to 0.0/low sec without wardec going on, you got to suicide a frig on them to get the agro, and hope he jumps before he notices."
7/9/2009,"don't really think that is the solution, but a solution does need to be found.just switching the aggression mechanism so that aggression to the ship even if no logged in gives a 15min timer seems like the best solution to me. if you dc on a gate in a situation where youre not in danger then youll just ewarp and disappear a usual. if you dc in the middle of a gate camp you'll get pointed and die just as you would if you didnt log off.the current system is just far too leniant."
7/9/2009,"i'm not sure if i should post this here or if i should report it as a bug...currently cloaking devices shut off when they get within 2km from most objects. this includes stations, ships, asteroids... and invisible asteroid belt beacons (aka the center).i'm not sure if this is intended as i can see an asteroid, i can see a station, but i can't see the center of a belt (unless i'm 150km+ away from it).the problem is that it's now not possible for a covop ship to warp to a belt's center at 0m without being decloaked. not a big deal in reality, i just warp to the belt @ 10km, which gives me a 10% chance to be decloaked by the asteroids as i exit my warp, which is a way smaller chance then when i warp to 0m. anyway, even while i adapted to this, it is just not right..."
7/9/2009,"de-cloak range is now 2500mthe ability of a 'centre' of an asteroid belt to decloak things really should be removed.in the past i have warped to the 'center', seen there are no asteroids within 10km and still been decloaked by what is essentially an arbitrary point in space on a ships nav computer.if this 'beacon' is actually a physical object warning of asteroids in space (odd given ships arent damaged warping through an asteroid belt and exit war at 0 speed) then i can understand it decloaking.however, why were beacons for sleeper sites and for epheremal objects in certain sleeper sites and some known space sites altered so they didnt de-cloak covops, from the previous position they were- if this were the case?supported-that is, stop 'centres' of asteroid belts from decloaking ships"
7/9/2009,"supported - if the center of an asteroid belt is not a physical object, but merely an arbitrary nav point in space, it should not decloak a ship anymore than warpting to 0 on a safe spot does.if it is a physical object, perhaps they should put one of those beacon lights there"
7/9/2009,"supported, this is stupid. hidden objects or markers shouldn't de-cloak you.where have you seen this exactly? did i miss this from one of the recent patch notes?"
7/9/2009,"i actually thought decloak was 3000, the idea being you can't can flip someone while cloaked."
7/9/2009,you can't open cans and wrecks while cloaked so this wouldn't matter.
7/9/2009,"i just tested it ingame, and you do not get decloaked at 2500m, it's still 2000m."
7/9/2009,i was unaware of that. thanks for the information!
7/9/2009,you sure? i could swear i saw it in fairly recent patchnotes when they gave bombers the covops cloak..../goes insane
7/9/2009,"i just fitted a cloak, cloaked and slowly flew towards an object watching the distance indicator on the target box and i was uncloaked at 2000m not 2500m."
7/9/2009,"i saw the same thing in the patch notes....it ""sometimes"" does decloak you at 2500...not always though. in any case, supported. --isaac"
7/9/2009,"i went back 6 patch notes and couldn't find it anywhere using ctrl-f in firefox to search for the text ""cloak"". can you find it and link it here then?"
7/9/2009,"the funny thing about the belt's center is that as soon as you hit it your cloak disables. while on the center you can reactivate cloak. it used to give the message ""you can't activate your cloak because youre less than 2000m away from asteroid belt blahblah"". however it doesn't give you that message anymore and your cloak goes active, just to deactivate again in a few seconds. so it looks to me like they tried to fix it already but they missed seeing something in the code..."
7/9/2009,"aggression timers are still having problems here and there, expiring when they shouldnt be etc etc. the one major hole that i recently came accross is an ""feature"" (so called by the gms and aparently the devs) used by griefers. what happens is this; v=victim g= griefer, g loots a wreck belonging to v, v retaliates and destroys gs ship and then docks. g goes and fetches his pvp ship and systematically destroys wrecks belonging to v. v waits out his aggression timer and undocks, returning to business as usual,g arrives not showing as aggressed to v but is still allowed to attack v.its somewhat complex but if you can picture it happening, the wreck shooting aggression extension is clearly backwards, as the aggressor is shooting the victim's property it should be re-aggroing him, not the victim.(before the carebear **** starts getting thrown, yes this happened to me, yes it was a mission ransom/gank but i am far from a carebear)discuss, maybe we can finally get something accomplished with the devs."
7/9/2009,that is just wacky.
7/9/2009,"sounds similar to the ""shoot drones to keep the timer running so you can probe them out after logout""-bug."
7/9/2009,definitely supported. this always bugged me.
7/9/2009,"although ive never personally had a problem with responses, ive heard some pretty saddening first-hand stories. personally the one bug i reported was responded to and corrected in only 8 hours. i cant remember the guys name, but hats-off to him. but, anyway i support because i believe the first answer from a gm should not be copy-pasted, nor should more than 50% of the convo.as a side note: hows defy doing vyanr? last i knew they had it pretty rough. also give de my reguards"
7/9/2009,"for you, vyanr. please read. this is quoted from my opening post.for further clarification i'll retype some of what has already been discussed in the thread. i am making this proposal/whinge because many of the responses i've gotten from gms in the past have been inadequate, mainly due to it being (in my opinion and many others) a cut and past response that has been triggered (by the looks of it) by a keyword being used somewhere in the petition.the response i've recieved to the last few of my petitions has had nothing to do with the actual issue i've petitioned about. it would appear they've seen a keyword, assumed it's about 'issue a' and used 'response a' to just shut me up.this last issue was significant enough to me that i got jack of that and have had it escalated. if the the senior gm tells me i'm full of it after giving a 'good explanation', i'll leave it be. if i'm right and i get my way, even better. but for either to happen, he will have had to have read the petition.this is the core of my proposal/whinge. read first, think about your response and then reply. don't palm me off."
7/9/2009,"make your petitions consise, short, meaningfull. i never had any problems with my petitions. (and yes, i did not have too many of them) i agree with the two opinions i quoted. people that make stupid petitions are to blame in developers giving bad anwers, because when you have to answer 100 petitions, and more then half of them are tarded, i would also rive copy-paste ansers."
7/9/2009,"even if some wow mod was nice. most of them was a way to give you meta-game ability or/and an avantage again people who dont use them. im again that.even worse, you can actualy make alot of change to ui, its just badly or not explain in-game. here some exemple:- overload ---> you can create a shortcut in the shortcut section.- remove picture and picture column in the chat window ---> look in the say window, on the right upper corner. - color, you find it in the general settings. you have to remove easy theme selection.- font size/wide? ---> general setting section or for chat window, upper right corner. - in general settings, to make it easier to move around windows ---> only stack windows if shift pressed, lock windows when pinned, window snap distance: don't snap. that stop the ""move around when i log"" problem too.- you can minimize windows when you dont use it, usefull when you have multiple chat windows.- move the little picture when you lock something ---> a little cross called: ""targets origin"" close to the left or right upper corner. its hard to find because of it transparency. move it around and you can move the say picture.- right click on the clock in the bottom left corner ----> toggle auto hide on/off, toggle zooms on/off, configure (accesories,service and world information)- the overview, you can change alot of thing here.- dont forget, when you clean your cache, that remove most of the setting too.i really love the eve ui, probably because i play alot of gestion game, ui like that is common in these.a complicate game with alot of option will alway have a complicate ui and alot of windows."
7/9/2009,"why would ccp even let someone mess with there game?just start a petition asking for the "" mods you wish to see""you are talking about real money that can be lost on somthing like thisanother suggestion would be buy ccp then they would have no risk..."
7/9/2009,"/signed for the idea in .8 and below onlyive been considering training a widow or sin for ages, i might actually get around to it for once =d"
7/9/2009,"damn forum ate my actual reply....check again. you are insured by concord. they are the ones that shell out 100 million isk to you after they blow up your ship. why they give you money, no one knows. because ccp hasn't gotten around to changing it, i suppose.all this talk about ""carebears are dumdum headz that need to adapt and try harder!"" is bull****. thanks to massive insurance payouts, every ship in the game is able to be ganked into the ground before concord kills the ganker, regardless of any protection they might have. you aren't just ganking untanked retrievers, you're hitting tanked hulks, top of the line industrials, and freighters. as soon as you die, you're fully reimbursed for your trouble(if you're losing more then 5-10 million on a gank you're a ****ing idiot, and doin it wrong), and then you get to pick up the booty and do a little dance.yeah, suicide ganking takes a little bit of work, and i don't care if you all do it until your face turns blue. you should not be paid insurance for your ships destruction, because you very actively chose suicide, and your ""career"" is free of this risk you speak of. profits aren't high enough in high sec without insurance? try low sec, i hear you can make better money there where you risk getting killed.ps. miners in hi sec sucking down veldspar all day for superior profit to low sec is also borked."
7/9/2009,right on lets fix this :)
7/9/2009,"are you joking, or are you really that insane? like, i support the proposed alteration to insurance, but your taking it way too far."
7/9/2009,"i fully support this.come on, gankers get a cheap t1 ship, gank a fully loaded and equipped hulk which are hardly insurable and get the money for their ship back? the insurance company basically pays you for commiting a crime?it is not just the hulk that you lose, also all the fitting and the ore that you have been mining. it is not as if hulks are cheap ships or anything. if it weren't for the loads of miners you 'tough' pirates wouldn't be able to get a cheap ship since the ore would get too expensive.and that said, stop trash talking about carebears and eve is built on pvp. if you want to pvp and shoot people up, find a ship that can actually defend itself.this is not player versus player, this is player versus certain victim. pvp is based on fighting people, not shooting neutral industrialists who cannot defend themselves since the ship does not allow you to fit all kind of guns along with the strip miners.as soon as we get a big exhumer that can fit loads of guns and missile launchers you can come and shoot us up all you want, but untill that happens you should bare the consequences for your actions, just as it would be in real life.piracy is fine for me, it gives another dimension to the game. it shouldn't however be subsidized and insurable. want to gank someone? good for you. you get killed by concord, you go back and get the loot left behind, make sure it is worth it.it's like a bankrobber insuring his guns and getting paid when the police takes them away."
7/9/2009,"supported.you cause ""sanctioned"" by concord then you shouldn't be ""rewarded"" and while you're at it how about removing insurance on self-destructs too."
7/9/2009,"i'd be fine with removing insurance on self-destructed ships. again, you're making a conscious choice to destroy said property."
7/9/2009,"ok, please tell me where it is that your support fleet is able to intercept all the missiles and drones that attack the super capital?also, i do think that a lot of drones can shoot past the 5-6km range that the smart bomb gives off. with this system, it'd be able to pick off the drones with efficient accuracy and reliability."
7/9/2009,"at the point of origin. unless you've seen alot of supercaps being one-volleyed?also,what game are we discussing? i thought these were the eve-o forums."
7/9/2009,or four times.
7/9/2009,so basically a smartbomb that doesn't hurt your friends? get out.
7/9/2009,1. support can shoot drones and fighters.2. titans/motherships usually get faction/offer smartbombs. they hit up to 9k.3. dps wise battleships/hacs/dreads/carrier fighters are worse for the super capital than any drones.and last but not least the supercapitals are not supposed to defend themself against a fleet.
7/9/2009,"easy. shoot the drones, shoot the missile kaunching ships, or if you really want to kill the missiles instead of the source, fof missiles"
7/9/2009,terribad idea. pds for titan could be cool if it didn't have dd. but that's it.
7/9/2009,you lost all credibility right there.
7/9/2009,"actually that makes moderate amount o sence.shooting drones, interceptors and frigs. maybe they would scare off a t1 crouser.really it is 1 gun, it just looks like many guns placed all over the ship to make it look col, just like the dual/quadriple barrel versions of normal guns. they could even be made automatic and would take out drones and small ****. they will be rather weak. another way to do this is to make a capital smartbomb, twice the size of large smartbomb and more damage. would be almost same thing, but i think idea with guns sounds cooler. same thing as smartbomb, give the guns optimal same as current faction smartbombs have. 9-10 km. make it really a single gun, it is visually multiple guns to make it look cool.carrier and mothrship module. only one can be fitted. multiples can be fitted on mothership maybe? motherships need more love.so lt's get t for carriers and motherships.maybe he does not have a whole lot of experience with capitals, but idea makes sence, and is worth looking into."
7/9/2009,you got my support. i've always wanted to be able to identify someone by their paint job.
7/9/2009,supported. it would be nice to customize things a bit.
7/9/2009,"eve ships already have colors applied to them (the basic textures are grey-ish, so the blue parts of a megathron and yellow parts of a kronos are 'painted' as they use the same textures).since there is no server load for loading corp logos (they're stored clientside), all it needs it a few extra bits per ship and some slight effort from the art department to assign the appropriate spots.i don't understand why this hasn't been done already, tbh. every mmo out there allows to display 'guild' logos and most of them allow you to paint/dye your stuff."
7/9/2009,your need isn't everyone's need.you think? see the 'bring back old cyno effect' petition for a small idea of how unpopular aesthetic deviance can be. do not underestimate the players love for eve's darker and more mature art. otherwise we'd all be playing wow (or some variant)seeing the beautiful ships of eve suddenly transformed into rainbow-coloured earth & beyond style childs toys one day is a horribly disgusting thought and i'd like to avoid it.please try as hard as you can to imagine a little thumbs-down underneath my portrait.
7/9/2009,"if i whant to colour my ship into rainbow, that's my problem."
7/9/2009,"not if i'm the one who has to look at it, ace."
7/9/2009,login #3 todaybahahahaha!wow. i'm glad you clarified that!some people are very special. :-)edit: btw did you know you can write asp in perl also :-p
7/9/2009,i would like the portrait swap process to be expanded to the entire race of a character and not just the bloodline. now that in character creation the bloodline has no real game effects just plan looks and backstory i really dont see why it would matter.input please.
7/9/2009,"i expect the roleplayers would hate you, and that nobody else would care. if you can find people who want to, maybe, but i'm not sure who would."
7/9/2009,"no. because while it still makes no difference in terms of mechanics, i'm still an amarrian, so having a khanid portrait and wouldn't make sense.your character's portrait appearance, and whether you can live with it is one of the things you should have considered at character creation."
7/9/2009,"lolwut? i guess you've never been to a null-sec alliance fleet battle before. sad, sad.--edit--just looked up your chara's creation, relatively new, the corp you've joined is new; high-sec mining, mission running.ah yes, you've never actually done anything with a lot of folks before, and i think you're grumbling due to bot miners stripping the belts before you can do anything."
7/9/2009,"riiiight, noone ever need anyone else in this game atm at any point at all."
7/9/2009,"i really don't see how having an alt account is a bad thing. even if you don't like how they transfer money and items that just means it goes from one character to another... it all still exists no matter what. there is no point for a ban... something is telling me you had a bad experience with someone doing this. did you get killed? did you get ripped off? there needs to be some reason why you think they should be banned. if you ask me i think it would be more difficult to play multiple accounts than just one. but who cares, right? it doesn't matter. it doesn't ruin gameplay and it doesn't discourage teaming up with other people.i disagree."
7/9/2009,not supported.please play a few more months before judging a game as complex as eve.
7/9/2009,"yes, because we're going to convince ccp to throw away tens of thousands of subscriptions because you're annoyed that some people are better at managing multiple accounts than you are. boo freaking hoo."
7/9/2009,"you pay, you play. if you pay for 3 accounts, you should be able to play all 3.i personally have 2 accounts (this one, and marek jahlar). and i frequently use both at the same time.i'm not about to change this for you."
7/9/2009,"not for me but many new players, im not selfish like many players..."
7/9/2009,i think it's kinda selfish you want me to get rid of my alt so you can somehow play at an even level with me.
7/9/2009,so everyone can play evenly is all im saying..
7/9/2009,"it's about time you wake up and smell the coffee dude. the grown up world doesn't work like that. you have more money, you get more. you have more time, you do more. plain and simple. it's always been like that, and it's not about to change. you better learn how to cope with this or you'll be a very sad gamer no matter which mmorpg you play."
7/9/2009,what in eve's great wide verse made you think for one micro sec that this game was anything close to fair?
7/9/2009,quit eve. i've earned enough isk to pay for multiple accounts and so can you. qq more noob. hello kitty online adventures is more your style.
7/9/2009,no
7/9/2009,"dammit, you broke my bullsh*t-o-meter!"
7/9/2009,"i loled hard over that.... in eve it's alowed to use as many accounts simultaniosly and you whant, there are people who have 7 accounts and more. that's it. that is not changing."
7/9/2009,"more convinving if he supported it, esp if he used all his accounts and alts to support."
7/9/2009,"i would almost like to agree with the op.however, the game seems to be built around the idea that you're using second-account alts.few things can be done alone - or in a way that is worthwile for more than one person.a second account is too often simply necessary. few are willing to do boring tasks with hardly any interaction, for no reward.alts don't mind."
7/9/2009,"if i wanted to play a game that was fair it sure has heck would not be eve.if i can pay for more then one account (i have 3) and have fun doing it (i do) then, by golly, i will. ccp seems to have no problem taking my money. if you want to change that i suggest you get a loan and buy out ccp."
7/9/2009,"well, i play 6 accounts in eve and all my slots are full, i got miners , orca and haulers, pvpers builders etc. etc . i am a 1 man corps . so although i pay for all 6 accounts and can play any 4 at one time . i shouldnt be able to do so?and if my prober finds a good mining site , and i log my miners to go do some roid-o-cide i am somhow cheating?im really surprised you had the balls to even come here with that man , more than 1/2 of eve are somebodys alts weather they have multi-accounts or just one , i bet you have more then one toon rolled on that account your on ."
7/9/2009,covert ops are great and all but think about. why so you only get a strenght boost?covert ops are meant to be unseen and be able to track down and spy on enemy movements.how can you do this when everyone within 14 are scanning?i propose that the covert ops frigates get a role bonus that cloaks their probes.give them the ability to do their job. cloak the probes!
7/9/2009,everything has their counter. scannable probes are theirs.not supported.
7/9/2009,exactly. cloaking probes would make my job too easy :)
7/9/2009,"sure, as if pirate probers didn't have it easy enough as it is. not supported."
7/9/2009,i would support introduction of a new probe type that was cloaked.not the suggestion in op.if the new probes were such that only covops could use them and came with stats that neccesitated rigging a covops and having high scan skills to scan something down.
7/9/2009,"i could get maybe behind this with two conditions:1. they are horribly expensive.2. they have far shorter lifespans than normal probes (say about half as long).they would still be useful, but you'd have to be far more diligent in your probing to be able to recover them before the timer ran out and you lost them.as for the op - no."
7/9/2009,"half the lifespan of the current probes is still 30 minutes. if these things ever enter the game, let's give them a 1-2 minute lifetime then. two minutes is enough for probing most of the ships out there."
7/9/2009,"i constantly see fleet invitation (alliance) invites when i first log on, or when i come back from being afk for a while. no idea what they are for, where they are, where they are headed, or if one is different from another.now, requesting information is an option, but one that will sometimes get you unclear and conflicting answers (if there's more than one fleet and nobody knows which one your asking about) or make someone take the time out of a possible engagement to tell you that yes, it's important, get your @#$ out to xxx system.my idea would solve this. make a right click -> show info option (when you right click the fleet invitation (alliance) link) the same as there is for every other link. some of the following stuff that could be automatically shown...who is in the fleetwhat roll they have (fc, squad leader, etc)what they are flying (specific, megathron, or generic, battleship)where they are (so you can see the current location of the fleet)this would answer 90% of common questions there. if it's all battleships, you might recognize they could use some tackle in there. the fc would show what alliance (in region wide intel channels) it is, where they are is where you would have to head to, so you know it's not 5 regions from your current location. along with all of this though there could be an option somewhere for the fc to set notes, so he could include things like...where the fleet is headed (so you can just link up)what they are doing (so you know if it's important, or just roaming for the fun of it)expected resistance (if heading for a gate camp, etc)what vent channel everyone is on, so you don't have to be the 1232334th person to ask this.and with that, no more questions need to be answered when fleet invitations are posted, everyone will know what's going on.again, i know this stuff is something someone could take the time to answer, this just seems a faster and more efficient way to spread information to those just coming on than having someone answer all 7 example questions every single time someone joins up."
7/9/2009,"i wouldn't mind showing what you can see in the fleet window already (list of fleet members and hierarchy setup), but not showing what ship everybody is flying and what role everybody has. the fc should be the one telling you what is needed when he posts the fleet invite.the fleet notes is a good idea though. i could see how this would be used and i like it.i'll check the support box, but know that i only partially support this."
7/9/2009,"this mission is the most common storyline mission, yet has the worst standings increase. because it is usually completed 2 seconds after accepting the mission, the isk and standings change has become minuscule. the only reason to do this mission is for the implant.please remove this mission from the storyline missions."
7/9/2009,supporting my own topic
7/9/2009,"simple issue,as beautiful as eve can be, sometimes people just aren't interested in the eyecandy, whether for performance issues or perhaps and intense dislike of a particular ships model; the moa is eye achingly gruesome allow us to disable complex ship models entirely, replacing them with a simple cross on the screen much as bracketed objects or rats.make it an option alongside disabling drone models.as it is people zoom out during large fleet battles to reduce lag and the strain on their system, with the option to disable ship models people will be able to operate zoomed in far closer to the actual position of thier ship. 'but red, we only use our overviews, what do we care if we have to be zoomed out watching some crosses wink in and out of existence like someone doing a radiation count.'zoomed in you can manually fly ships and properly control transversal and approaches. this isn't possible zoomed out and rather irksome for tacklers of all kinds.'but surely the changes proposed would only be useful in huge fleet battles as a lag reduction feature- and we don't need to manually control our ship there!'have you tried having a 40 man fight in lowsec recently? lag and latency related issues are very real in fw areas and have been lamented at such length on the forums i wont go over the issues here- but its not just 400 a side un-reinforced node fleetfights that suffer crippling lag."
7/9/2009,"supported.this would take minimal effort to implement, so no real loss to ccp's time constraints.this option is available for drones, why not ships as well?if you don't like it, don't turn them off. everyone's happy."
7/9/2009,"supported, but with low priority.this will help alleviate the symptoms of lag, but it doesn't fix the underlying causes."
7/9/2009,"the fw lag are desyncs, not fps problems. so lower load on your gpu wont help you there. and from what people tell the fw fix works (which is probably also usefull to have for pirates who fight fw'ers)."
7/9/2009,"hopefully its something that would take a morning of work by the code bonobo'sand priority over other issues isnt an issue at all; the graphics already exist afterall as does the precedent and i assume the complicated stuff as we can disable drone models.the only losers would be the graphics artists (if thats what they are called) getting sulky, but i'm sure they can raise spirits by making /dance extra special for wis."
7/9/2009,fw and lowsec lag isnt going to magically dissapear with the next patch.can i take it you dont support this change on the grounds that it might not decrease lag in fw?
7/9/2009,"you realise the fw lag thingie is allready released and you can enable it in your client? while i havent tried it yet in fleet fights, people reported no desyncs with it enabled with 400 in local.and besides what you describe, which wont get improved by this, i dont see any usage for it. like you say yourself, you dont need to manually pilot arround your bs in a fleet fight."
7/9/2009,"i support this, but only if the icons the models would be replaced with would mean something. not just a bunch of brackets with all the same shape (like brackets now).the shapes would change depending on the ship size/class and their color would match their aggression level (i.e. red = enemy, grey or green = passive).as for shapes, i don't mean just concentric squares, but actually different shapes."
7/9/2009,i can dig it.
7/9/2009,sounds good to me.
7/9/2009,please.
7/9/2009,yeah.............hehe
7/9/2009,and also just a direct buy it option pls
7/9/2009,"you don't understand at all how it works. there could be 300,000 wrecks at a specific location in deadspace, and if nobody else is around them to see them (in the same grid), there won't be any lag at all in the system.lag is created when the server has to update multiple clients with too much information. if let's say, 10 players warp to that spot where all the containers are, then there would be a spike of lag because the server would have to send the location of 300,000 containers 10 times.as long as nobody sees objects in space, those objects will not interact with any player and therefore not create any lag.you talking stuppid things.read this and stop trolling."
7/9/2009,"where's a badass dev when you need one?hun, that particular instance caused a server crash because there was spam of dynamic objects which could move and had many variables associated with them at a very populated area (can you imagine how many players you would need to move all those shuttles?). mission wrecks are, predominantly, static, and sit at completely unpopulated areas.wrecks are nothing but a database entry when no one is on grid. whereas any ships need processing time to run their shield recharge, capacitor recharge, motion/collision calculations... what you're doing there is akin to comparing a pea to a elephant.oh, and 0/10; simply bad."
7/9/2009,not supported. 2hours waiting is ok. have an heart for the ninja salvager.
7/9/2009,"no, you stop ""talking stupid things""! wake up man, the fact they made the server crash was not because they spawned many objects only, it's because they did so in a very populated area. jita is a hub, and there's always a ton of people going through that system. they dropped shuttles around stargates and the main station where everybody always is. no wonder why it crashed the server. every time someone flew within the same grid as the shuttles, the server had to send that pilot the location of all those objects. so it 100 pilots were moving around those objects at times, that means 100 updates. that is what caused the server to crash. everybody's been explaining this to you but you still maintain your position. who's ""talking stupid things"" now?however, again, if they had dropped them in a deadspace location (random bookmark) where nobody ever goes, nothing would have happened.now maybe your english is so bad you can't understand this, but if it is so, get someone who is fully billingual and have them translate properly for you."
7/9/2009,explain how this isnt a stealth nerf to ninja salvaging as a profession?not supported.if you want to decrease server load and lag/latency issues in particular regions with mission hubs then space the agents out more.
7/9/2009,"let's be realistic.if lag was really caused by static objects just hanging in space, ccp wouldn't let people anchor cans, especially at stargates where they serve no useful purpose.the fact is, as has already been explained multiple times, that unless someone is on the grid with a static object, the game doesn't even bother to load it, since it doesn't need it.edit: i fail so badly at spelling today."
7/9/2009,just give up de'v... they are a lost cause. i don't think they will ever understand that even if we explain it 100 times more.
7/9/2009,i agree
7/9/2009,not supported.you didn't destroy it so no kill mail but no insurance payout either.
7/9/2009,"it's silly to claim that a ship destroyed during combat is not really a loss.that being said, leaving it this way is ok too, i enjoy the nerd-rage when we create one for them"
7/9/2009,"1. i say do away with kill mails all together, who cares .2. self destruction is a planed mechanic of the game.3. i think many people including the op , should just get togather and say they want ccp to insta warp scramble all noobs and pilots that can hurt them the second they come into local , then allow them to just fly around and pop them without any chance of them getting killed . and of course send a kill mail to all of them so they can give each other cyber-b%$wjobs on there corps websitesplease..........."
7/9/2009,drones!
7/9/2009,i'm just sick of them.
7/9/2009,"while um, this probably technically isn't the correct place to post this, i agree with you 100%."
7/9/2009,"all the whiny threads about that are lagging up the db, they must be stopped!"
7/9/2009,start with op.
7/9/2009,we will fre eve frums of half of the trolls and whiners. people are just looking for something to whine about. really annoing.
7/9/2009,troll...
7/9/2009,"troll or not, salvage whines are a pain in the behind.something needs to be added when a player first undocks:you do not own anything that isnt in your cargohold, can or hangar. you do not own wrecks, only the contents of them"
7/9/2009,"this is not something that the csm would need to bring up with the developers.please use the ""report"" feature on threads and the community team will investigate."
7/9/2009,no. this sounds stupid. people have riots on foot and in large mobs. they don't have riots in spaceships which costs millions or billions of isk.
7/9/2009,"the potential for abuse of this is ridiculous. not to mention you'd get something like goonswarm naming every system they own bees, or some crap like that so you never actually know where you really are in their space.horrible horrible idea."
7/9/2009,"this is easily resolved by ccp focusing on cosmos again.hard to find pirate datacenters (tag exchange agents) in empire space, as well as more pirate cosmos agents in the empire/lowsec cosmos constellations (there are already angel and guristas agents in these areas).boom done."
7/9/2009,"but this already is free - you can do it with titles and roles, or with out-of-game tools. the issue here is making the interface better and doing it in such a way that you can, say, id someone as a dread pilot internally without giving that info to everyone external. medals are just a total non sequitur. this idea isn't even in the same ballpark as medals, because no corp with two brain cells to its credit would ever consider using medals for this task. personally, i use an excel sheet. i'd just like to have an easier way for my members to look up endorsed training plans, and of keeping track of who is skilled into what, than having to poll people or read through 50 api keys in evemon. it's not about isk, because nobody spends isk on this. it's about saving effort and creating an easier interface. because nobody will ever, under any circumstances, spend 5-10 million to tell themselves that billsmith1 is a qualified thorax pilot. there is no conceivable circumstance where the medal system provides the correct approach to this problem. the fact that we're discussing this at all is making me lose faith in the human race. actually, the word you're both looking for is ""argument"". it is not a proof in any proper sense of the word, but it's a lot more than the pulling ideas out of the air that ""conjecture"" implies. it is his statement that he feels that medals don't provide anything like the functionality that he desires - a statement that i fully agree with, as it happens. yes, that would be exactly the point. that is exactly what the op is asking for, and it exactly the same reasoning he used in the first post. it's not like you had to draw this out from hidden depths - that was the whole idea all along. i trust it how has your support?"
7/9/2009,as long as there is the option to disable it from settings.i'll be happy.
7/9/2009,this *1000i guess ccp is catering to wow players that want to /dance
7/9/2009,login #6 i got ini too hope never.evemail upgrade is way more important and not even on the agenda it would appear.
7/9/2009,lol
7/9/2009,this was covered in meeting.. 3?edit: yup
7/9/2009,i will raise [issue] fix the forum's session cookie management please!
7/9/2009,was raised by csm1.the answer was to wait for the new forum.
7/9/2009,"bah yes, it was general ""fix the forums issue"" but i forgot contained awful cookie handling (which only got worse lately btw). scrap this issue but at least i know what will be my question for ccp this month :d"
7/10/2009,"anecdotal evidence is valid in any court, or for any decision. the deciders must determine if the witness is carrying some bias that taints his testimony, and then weight the preponderence of anecdotes for and against the decision. /legalfor my background: personally i like afs, but mostly use amarr ones, which are definitely not solomobiles (much less solopwnmobiles).both your stances are correct, depending on situation and skills (in-game and out) of the pilots. t2 ships used on their designed scenarios generally murder their targets unless a specific counter-setup is encountered. the point stands, however, that from a coherent design perspective the afs are lacking somethings. if you consider t2 resistence bonuses to be a ""bonus"" then hacs have 5 bonuses, same with hics, as do interceptors (4 normal + 1 role, but no resistences), and interdictors (4 + 1 special). marauders have 7(!) bonuses if you count role and resistences. recons have 5, not counting covert cyno gen as a bonus but counting resistences. exhumers have 5, including resistences but not counting fitting strips (which is shared with the mining barge, after all). command ships have 5. in fact the only other t2 ship that carries 4 bonuses is the electronic attack ship--which we could do a thread on arguing it is also under-powered and at least needs resistence bonuses.af may or may not be fine--especially after rockets are adjusted--but they deserve some special consideration as to whether given overall design and specifically versus their competitors in cost (the interceptor) they are not in fact underpowered. --krum"
7/10/2009,"i might agree with the first part, but the second. no. in any scientific study you look for statistically secure data, anecdotes has nothing to add there since they describe a single event. and i would argue that game design/balance has a lot more to gain from a scientific perspective."
7/10/2009,"tortugan, rockets are not fine, i have flown the retribution and vengeance quite a bit. and i have used both rockets and guns on my vengeances. it takes a sickening amount of time to kill the most trival of targets with rockets even when they are scrammed and webbed. i had 4 tech ii, rocket launcher and a bcuii fit and a freaking thrasher was able to de aggress and jump through a gate before dieing. sure i was in absolutely no danger of him breaking my tank but rockets are terrible.same ship, vengeance with 3 unbonused lazors, completely different story. rockets not only have worse on paper dps but suffer from horrible explosion radius and volocity so much so that a effing battleship with a ab can speed tank some of the damage.now on topic here i agree af's could use a fourth bonus, this has to be done correctly as some af's are very good ships currently. i do not aggree with wolf's and jags needing a tracking bonus they already use the best tracking turret in the game.if you are having tracking problems with small autocannons slow down a littel unless your target is also using small autocannons you should be able to start hitting him before he starts hitting you.as far as a 4th bonus for the retribution i think tracking would be a great bonus for it. rof might make it hit a leetle too hard.the ishkur was passable even before the speed rebalance and is a amazing ship now.also if your in a domi and you for whatever reason decide to use light drones vs a blarpy as opposed to medium drones wth are you doing. valk ii's travel faster then 3kms guys.i have on numorous occasions jumped a solo arbitrator into a 8 man frig / af gang and came out either alive or with 4-5 kills, if your domi can't swat them down i'm really at a loss."
7/10/2009,1
7/10/2009,why not give 10% bonus to afterburner velocity per frigate level?retribution definitely needs a second midslot for at least either a small cap booster or some kind of tackle gear.
7/10/2009,"absolutly supported 100%, its just wrong that neutrals get in on wars that ppl have paid good isk for"
7/10/2009,agreed 100% with pit boss read all the comments and the only people who seem to oppose are the people who dont wanna lose there alt reppers - just find that funny - if you dont wanna lose your alt repper dont interfear with the wars with him lol
7/10/2009,"here is an alt. supporting for the second time. if this enrages you, spare a thought for all the people ****blocked by exploitative neutral rr alts."
7/10/2009,"op's suggestion fails to prevent neutral assistance while massively nerfing rr bs gangs, all the people who have wondered why a privateer might suggest such a thing should look a little harder at the op's suggestion.in empire it's easy enough to put the neutral alt on the other side of the station or have them warp between safes to ensure that the extra danger from having an agro timer is minimal, however if you've got some idiots camping you into station and undock some rr bs's to force them off the station you now have added risk because you can not rr if you decide to deagress and dock.in simple terms this is a buff to the privateers and a nerf to station huggers, logistics ships and rr bs gangs.@ the op: getting a buff to station camping by hijacking popular sentiment about neutral rr is truly devious, you should go into politics with a mind like that. supported because the number of people who've given a thumbs up without thinking makes this thread the troll of the year."
7/10/2009,"yes, would be a very nice :d"
7/10/2009,"hear hear... csm so far has done a dismal job on a longest running, and most publicly supported issue in the existence of eve."
7/10/2009,deough eet...doeugh eet naoooooowwww!!
7/10/2009,"why not just make tech 1 rigs a bit cheaper, and tech 2 rigs a bit over what t1 are now? say the average t1 rig was 4m- i'd almost definitely be rigging my t1 cruisers, and if i felt the need to pvp in a t1 frig, i'd be tempted to rig it as well. then just make t2 rigs reasonably priced- maybe 25-40m so bigger ships will make the extra investment. rigging should always be a choice- it shouldn't be a necessity."
7/10/2009,negative do not support.should die in committee.ccp: we really need a thumbs down option.thumbs down on this issue.
7/10/2009,"i like what ccp is doing with this, it keeps the cost of the rigs in proportion with the cost of the ship. and that last part, with this rigs will not be more of a necessity than a regular module. i don't see people complain having to fit modules, they do complain if one module becomes mandatory, that is not the issue here. all i see is more options made more available, it just might make a destroyer slightly useful outside of salvaging even (while i doubt it, i'll at least try it)."
7/10/2009,rigs are too expensive.esp t2.patch will be gooood.not supported.
7/10/2009,"no, if i disconnect in the middle of a gate camp, and i'm not warp scrambled, i want to e-warp just like i would now. saying you would die anyway is absurd."
7/10/2009,i meant you'll die because you'll get pointed and aggrod. where did i mention removing ewarps?
7/10/2009,"so if it is so crystal clear, how would this change anything to ctrl+q'ing when you jumped your freighter into a camp? he still gets out without problems, only he cant ctrl+q very often to get far away in a random direction. so he got to wait untill he can ctrl+q a few times again or the camp is gone, but his freighter will be fine."
7/10/2009,"i dont think its the logg off thats broken.i think its the emg warp.when loggin in/out/in/out the freighters etc never return to where they originally left the game.if an emg warp is activated for whatever reason , that emg warp should allways complete by warping back to the point it came from.then if a players logs in/out quickly the ship in game needs to warp back to gate before doing another emg warp the ship should be tacklable during this manoveur.support for a fix whatever the issue is"
7/10/2009,"its a bug , needs fixing, very annoying."
7/10/2009,"i would like to suggest that bpcs with identical pe/me statistics should be able to be merged. the new bpc would have identical me/pe stats, but would have the run limit of bpc a+b. if you invent 50 bpcs from identical bpos, you could combine these 50 individual items into a single item in your hangar. this would greatly simplify hangar and bpc management.the only limitation would be that a merged bpc can not have a run limit higher then the built in limit for copies."
7/10/2009,supporting my own topic.
7/10/2009,"i would support stacking them into a pile. but merging them into a bigger bpc is not a good idea, you need the single bpcs for invention."
7/10/2009,i think 90% of the backlog is created by 10% of petitioners.mostly emo rage kids petetioning everytime one of there ships get popped.to add balance i would say that if you expect all petitions to be read without being preprossed or skimmed then you have to start limiting the number of petitions each player can raise.hard limit of 4 petitions per month per player is wholly overkill imo and more than enough for anyone.and the more often you petition the lower priority your petitions are given in the future.
7/10/2009,"not sure if a set ammount of petitions is a good idea. i had to petition 6 clone losses in a month on bad jumps, all with implants. you're idea would result in me losing my sets twice.there should be penalties for fraudulent petition reports. if you're a regular to the f12button(think that's the one, and many of the times it's a blatent lie start slapping people on the wrist with 1+ day bans. examples of this are the idiot's that petition every loss, mission runner's who try to petition to have a mission reset because the mission completion trigger failed (know a few who do this with ae and a few others hoping to get them reset to re-run them), ninja salvaging (people still petition it...), aggro mechanics that result in a ship loss because they are too lazy to ask how the game works. the idiot petitions are endless. punish the tools."
7/10/2009,"if you only had 4 pets per month you probably would not have used broken jump mechs 6 times in a month , therefore reducing load on the gm's until the issue was fixed."
7/10/2009,that logic is so broken. because of a set ammount of petitions per month i would not clone jump knowing that i risk losing a clone and petitioning for reimbursment. so you would punish those of us who once in a blue moon(expansion release) hit a real problem and need to use the petition system more then 4 times. poor solution to the problem. it just punishes the people who actually use the system as it was intended.
7/10/2009,"everyone was in the same boat as you , you are not special.if everyone did what you did there would have been approx 1 million petitions created.the problem affected everyone, everyone did not jump 6 times and require 6 petitions.yes a limit of 4 per month will stop selfish people from hoggin gm attention whether that is from mission running resets, ship loss petitions , or whoops i am a spanner and lost my implant for the 6th time this month , duh."
7/10/2009,"so computer savvy peops get a boost?no to giving advantages to select group of players.one game , one client , ban macro'rs if caught.no no to making it easier to macro or whatever."
7/10/2009,"as an addon author for the much maligned (on these forums) wow, i think you underestimate the allure of e-fame you get for releasing a good addon. lots of addon projects start out as personal things, but we usually release them straight away to the public because we love ourselves a good ego stroking.and an expanded userbase helps iron out bugs."
7/10/2009,over my dead body!
7/10/2009,"i'm not going to lean towards or against removing insurance for suicide ganking, but i would like to say that people need to step away from the idea that they're making things anymore 'realistic'. the entire insurance system in eve is beyond unrealistic. let's compare eve ship insurance to car insurance.have so many of you not even thought about how insurance companies work in real life? insurance companies in real life work by using mathematics figures and statistics to determine how much of a risk each insured person is and how much their premiums are. levels of coverage, deductible amounts, past incidents, vehicle type, and a range of other variables are taken into account when an insurance company issues a policy. they also issue the policies knowing that every customer will use their policy to the fullest extent [ie, replacing the entire vehicle, or in eve's case, ship]. eve is vastly different from the real world. in eve, insurance isn't used to cover the cost of fixing minor damages caused to a ship, nor is it used to pay for damage done to other people's ships. in eve, it is almost guaranteed that the user's ship will be lost. if such an occurrence was true in real life, only a mad man would attempt to run an insurance business. there is also the matter of concord being realistic, but i'm sure you get where i'm going."
7/10/2009,"supported.no to ""isk support for suicide gankage"".criminal should sholder the cost of the loss.payouts for criminal actions is utterly ridiculous."
7/10/2009,tru dat.
7/10/2009,supported
7/10/2009,how can you judge something without having experience with it?
7/10/2009,"thats what pvp is for. ccp wouldn't ruin the dark gothic grungy coloring and atmosphere of eve, even if they did consider this idea the option for hot pink ships would be the first one to hit the wastebasket. color choices would probably still conform to the entirety of eve as a gaming experience, meaning they won't be over the top and stupid."
7/10/2009,i wanna put flames on my vaga
7/10/2009,"although this idea is interesting. but few technical issues:if you have ships painted differently and have different names of makers of them - how can you repackage them, make a stack and put a sell order of like 10 of them on the market in one single sell order?if this idea goes through, it would be good if in eve settings there would be an option of turning off those logos/additional colours, so that the lag in fleet battle is rediced.but overall, of course the idea of painting ships your way, having pretty corp/alliance logo and makerstamps on items would be good, if those technical 'buts' are dealt with :)"
7/10/2009,i do only have one account.... no want to get another.
7/10/2009,"wow... you were stoned when you posted, weren't you, op? :)"
7/10/2009,"hrm, i read this as ""people do stuff that i don't want to do and get advantages over me because of it! it's not fair! umpire!!!!"".eve is not a fair game. get over it."
7/10/2009,"gentle readers,there's been a significant amount of tears shed over the years regarding salvage rights or the lack thereof, and the existence of the ""salvaging profession"" employed independently.here is a simple change that would both address some of the mission-runners concerns while both retaining salvaging as an independent activity, and reduce database bloat:* enable wrecks not located inside a deadspace to be scanned-down and warped to.this change would permit mission-runners who care about their wrecks to come back and salvage them, while giving most independent salvagers another target in the form of ""abandoned"" wrecks left over from completed missions.it would draw away (some) salvagers from active missions--the source of much tears in the community, decrease database entries as they are cleared out sooner by salvagers, and increase available salvage in advance the increased demand from tiered rigs.it would disadvantage players who like to clear out their missions and return in a mwd ship for salvage, but they already compete with independent salvagers who can easily scan-down their mission-salvage ships and race to clear the wrecks. i view this as a valid, but very minor compromise.please discuss.--krum"
7/10/2009,"deadspace is already harder to probe out than regular space, i believe. and these complaints really don't need to be addressed - the status quo is fine."
7/10/2009,"thumbs down.ccp is swinging the nerf bat quite a bit, lately at targets that don't need nerfing. the salvage mechanic works perfectly as is; missioner whining and their 40 mil/hour income is not nearly enough to warrant any changes to the mechanic. either salvage as you go along, missioners, or move along.i salvage as i go along; get greedy and expect to get your icing licked off that bountiful cake you guys love eating."
7/10/2009,"not supported, unneeded change."
7/10/2009,not supported
7/10/2009,"not supported.what you are asking for is a direct nerf to ninja salvaging. i'll paraphrase a gm:salvage isnt there to increase your isk/hr, its there to provide a mini profession for others.redsplat is being particulalry slow today."
7/10/2009,scanning abandoned wreck with the onboard scanner ?if so = win.
7/10/2009,"not supported. many people turn missions in before they start salvaging. so from the mission runners side you wouldnt change much.if they want parts of my salvage fine, you have to support those poor pvp folks so they can afford later to buy more ships from me. :)"
7/10/2009,you know you can just bookmark the wreck(s) turn the mission in and warp there right?
7/10/2009,"deadspace is no harder to probe out than regular space, and this is a suggestion to enhance salvaging, not nerf ninjasalvaging.how the **** do you get that idea? what part of his idea would nerf the act of scanning someone down in his mission and salvaging the wrecks he leaves behind?supported, though i would probably not use it in most cases."
7/10/2009,"currently the maximum range of the on-board directional scanner is 14au (approx). i think that since it's now more possible to scan down a ship on a mission in low sec, or in a hidden belt, directional scanner should increase in distance when the angle is reduced - much like a real world directional beam antenna increases decibels in the direction with a loss to the sides and read of said beam. that directional scanning beam should also be allowed to be set to rotate around much like a real world radar system, and such a display comparable to one (or a 3d display) could be helpful. it's hard to consider that this is 1940s technology i mention here, and over 20k years into the future we cannot have this on a spacecraft...of course the ""radar"" should not pinpoint like scan probes. it should also be possible, and beneficial for all players, to be able to filter hits on the rader and warn with an audio tone if certain objects are detected, such as probes or ships of certain types or sizes. this can be beneficial not only to missioners and miners, but 0.0 sov space defense as well. perhaps this could also open a whole new realm of modules and skills to utilize them. furthermore, perhaps through module or skill, and having worked on real world fighter aircraft myself (eccm is real!), being scanned down or hit with a radar/attenuated directional scan should be detectable. again, 20k+ years in the future, and now i write of technology that has been quite efficient since the 1970s but is not seen in eve."
7/10/2009,eve online is nowhere near what the future would translate into for normal human beings.
7/10/2009,"while i dont know if some of the ideas wont have really negative consequences, in general i will support it for the help the directional scanner needs (especially when they would decide to remove local one day).and about the audio tone, soon the pirates will come whining and telling you are a carebear. and maybe the audio tone isnt the best idea (for sure it shouldnt be instanious when someone enters 14au distance). however the current game mechanics are just terrible, being forced to click the scan button every few seconds isnt skill, but just bad game design."
7/10/2009,"nobody said it was skill. it's alertness. if you want to know what's lurking out in the black, then you need to ping the scanner - not have ccp implement a feature to have the client ping the scanner for you.be alert or stay in highsec."
7/10/2009,"note that i also put in that a scanning radar system could alert to detection of certain sized objects as well.when i make a suggestion, it's not political styled in that one group gets the one-up over another through manipulation of authorities or mechanics. an audio tone and setting of directional scanners for certain conditions would be a beneficial tool to both pirates and carebears. it goes, from that point, from being all about clicking on a button to how well thought out your parameters are, and your experience in such matters. i would also like to add that it appears directional scans are making a database query of sorts, considering the time delay that does not appear arbitrary. to see what i mean, run a d-scan in both crowded hub systems and empty dead end systems, and notice the time difference. if the day should come that local is eliminated in 0.0, you will have a lot of people hitting that scan button more often, and that could become a major load on the cluster as all these queries are being fired off. a more refinsed and automatic scanning system for directional scanning could help this issue."
7/10/2009,"sometimes there is a reason that our eve future selfs cannot figure out antiquated tech' that we often talk about on the forums. simply it takes away from the way the game is intended to be played. doing this just automates you're need to be aware of your situation.i cannot support a system that reduces the need for player skills. it has taken time to master the directional scanner, and when an object show's up i can usually find it within 10 seconds, and if its static i can get an aproximate range. if any thing a directional radial sweep you're speaking of would potentially create more db calls. consider every degree it sweeps it needs to make a call to get information on that single degree/mil. also in most fleet fights i have encountered not everyone is banging the scan button, the scout's are because it is their job to tell the fc what's inbound. with this automated system every player sitting at a gate bored will sit there watching their pretty little radar for the all might red dot of incoming impending doom creating even more db calls."
7/10/2009,making it easier for people to avoid pvp at all costs? cant support this.
7/10/2009,"i have had the pleasure of working with people who have been sent by the military into very bad parts of this world with some of the best fighting equipment coerced tax dollars could buy, backed with the best training a national infrastructire could offer. and every one of them will tell you ""contact with the enemy on these missions was the last thing we wanted. if you had to use your rifle, it's because you or your intel screwed up.""so, where in the rules of the game does it say that just because some other players want pvp, i have to go line up to them for it? avoiding the fight is just as much pvp as getting into one. just because you want killmails, it does not mean that i have to see that and think: ""oh, well, i have to go sit here and wait for him. oh, i should just fly into their camp now and take it"". sorry, but the jan bradys of eve really should just accept that people will outsmart them, just as much they claim at every step that non-consenting pvp is a part of the gam and how their intended victims should just accept tha. i guess if someone builds a camp and points to the cattle car, i am therefore required to climb in and take the ride? no. it's better to vanish, and hunt down those who built the camp and sent the train."
7/10/2009,"welcome to internet spaceships, not rl. ccp said it themselves eve is a game of non-consenting pvp. directional scan and local are more then adequate. if you are sitting in a belt with a neutral in local and you see a stilleto you're best bet is to gtfo. better yet, instead of waiting for him to show up on scan get to a safe or dock up.i don't want to be rude but this is a useless idea. a warning for ships on scan of a certain size or larger. if a pod is in system consider it a threat, he could be a scout and when he arrives in your belt his friends in ships are going to follow. this idea just support's people playing semi afk in a dangerous situation. they can just sit in their belt and mine, crank their speaking while fornicating the a goat and when the alarm sounds run back to the pc and dock. learn to use the directional scanner, it is amazing. you can determine general area and range to target within seconds."
7/10/2009,"i am continiously amazed by people who actually defend being forced to click a button every few seconds is good game design.yes i see the problem, immediatly getting an audio warning when someone comes near you is not a really good solution probably. but the alternative also is crappy. having it work on autorepeat or something (go database lag) would allready help alot, you would still need to watch the result of the scanner, but you dont need to click a button like a stupid drone."
7/10/2009,supported.
7/10/2009,"i pretty much agree with this. the fleet invite should not give more info than fleet membership, but barring that, this is a good idea."
7/10/2009,"i support my own idea!also, the idea behind the fc notes is so he can tell people what to bring, showing what they are flying is just an easy way of letting people know what the fleet makeup is. my idea was that the there would be as much information as possible automatically available. hey, knowlege is power right? but the fc notes section would have the final say over anything above.if in the end parts get dropped and/or parts get added, thats just fine with me. i just think there needs to be -some- kind of information available. as long as your all for that, then support this!ps - the ability to edit the fc notes section should be something the actual fleet commander can give to a person. so the person -actually- commanding the fleet can turn over the position of fc to someone with higher skills than him, but still have the ability to edit this. wow, that sounds complicated, hopefully ya'll understand it."
7/10/2009,"jove storyline arcfrom the blog.finally, as many of you have noted the complex fullerene shards are not included in these buy backs. the shards will be used at a later stage for another jove related story arc. so hold onto it until then. when is this bit gonna happen ?i have been waiting 5 years now :("
7/10/2009,2017 third quarter.
7/10/2009,"going to be a big expansion, together with wis."
7/10/2009,wts complex fullerene shards
7/10/2009,1m isk b/o
7/10/2009,here here .. whats the word on this?btw: wtb complex fullerene shards and jove body parts ... please contact me in-game.
7/10/2009,"i was just kiddin with the wts i would really like the csm to ask ccp if they ever intend to do anything with the unfinished jove arc and cf's inparticular.i brought and collected hundreads of the thing way back then and they have collected dust ever since , no reward was forthcoming :("
7/10/2009,"in memory of t20, ccp cannot have any story line that results in any kind of item exchange between player and ccp, that cannot be equally enjoyed by all players.since complex fullerenes are mostly collected by several players, doing any kind of event with them is out of the question. sorry guys"
7/10/2009,"just fyi, cf's were given to all players and were available in rat drops for all players.so theres no issue in providing a finish to this saga."
7/10/2009,but you cannot deny that several players has spent a lot of time and money collecting them. any sort of story would have to deal with a large collection of the fullerenes - otherwise it won't make sense. so only the people with large numbers be able to get anything
7/10/2009,"stupid point of view imo. not just carebears want to get through gatecamps.anyway. the raw idea is fine, but it would make fleet-battles:1: extra laggy2: impossible to manage at alli have no idea how such a drone-type could be implemented, and no matter how i like the base idea, i cannot support ops proposal."
7/10/2009,"fleetbattle of 1000+ people involved = 6000 people+mimics = a big hole in iceland, with centre at where ccp server was, untill it exploded"
7/10/2009,"noone would use the drones in fleet battles. instead, theywoul b used solo/smal gang, in fleet you whant dps. the drones have sigradius of the ship they mimic, and not too much hp so tehy are easy to ill. great proposal, it makes sence since we have cloacking devices that mke you invis. full suport, great idea."
7/10/2009,an interesting idea. if launching a whole wing is an issue though increase the size of the drone so that only the dedicated drone boats can deploy a full set of 5.they are also going to need some decent ai. you propose that they fly off in random vectors. what if i am in my typhoon and drop 2-3 of this little bad boys and i being close range fit start burning at my target to rain the pain and my decoy's are running off in oposite direction firing t2 torps from 20km when they have a range of 9km? any pilot that is not prone to crapping his pants in a pvp situation will take a two second looks and see 1 typhoon 500m away and the rest random range.
7/10/2009,in sniper bses with 160+km range you don't use drones :) and most serious fleetbattles are sniper ones. it might get close range if caps are involved.
7/10/2009,"/me sees how pos defenders will spam mimic drones so that hostile fleet lags out on warp in. imagine carriers doing that. also gatecampers, using those drones for the same reason and to uncloak cloakers."
7/10/2009,"a corp mate and i were ranting and raving over this topic for a while. we came up with what we feel is a viable and intelligent solution to the issue. a simple adaption of many other mmo's solution to logging out, a camp timer.it's a simple idea. when you go to log out under conventional means, ctrlq, esc-quit-confirm, right click window-close(while in window'd mode you are presented with a message informing you that you must cease all actions for 10 seconds to be succesfully logged out. during that time you sit there and wait for the countdown and you're client closes. during this time you are able to be aggro'd thus giving a countdown. if you decided to wait out the timer you would still e-warp 1m km away like normal and be probable if aggression was taken. or you could react and stop the cycle and try and make a run for it.the same principle should be applied to a ship that ctrl-q's/dc's. if this happens you break cloak and for 10 seconds any target has the ability to aggro you. if you dc at a gate it is tough luck, it happens, to date i am down 8 ships due to dc life moves on.the idea behind the 10 second timer is if you are being chased and do have to resort to a lame ctrl-q because you are a fail at getting a scout the chasing forces have 10 seconds to warp threw the system, jump, wait out the change delay, lock and get a shot off. it is really not a major affect to those that log off safely. it does affect those that do choose to try and blindly run ships without a scout threw hostile territory knowing that it is virtually impossible to catch them unless in 0.0 with a dictor.the argument that such a change is unfair to those without a stable connection is really an example to lazyness and stupidity. you should not be able to run with impunity solo threw a hostile environment. use a damn scout, ask a friend, roll a temp alt to scout you and stop using a faulty game mechanic like a buch of tools. that said it is also no major affect if you are unstable but in a safe environment. by the time you log in you will not have noticed that 10 seconds.what will happen to a ship for those 10 seconds? simple he will start his align as usual but if the align time to warp is less then 10 seconds he sits at speed for the remaining seconds.tl:dr 10 second camping timer when you log out. you're ship sits in space for 10 seconds aligned out and when the timer is down you e-warp. during said time you may recieve agression."
7/10/2009,"fully supported. doesn't hurt people logging off in safes, but makes sure people who ctrl-q to avoid a fight because they were too stupid or lazy to scout can't get away with it."
7/10/2009,"thumbs down. a merc corp whining about losing kills on carebears, i'll bet."
7/10/2009,not at all. infact i have not played in three weeks to lose a kill. this is just a topic that affects all pvp'rs be it on a small scale level or grand 0.0 escapades. albeit that said this is more an issue for us empire dwellers that see this kind of garbage happen every day does not make it any less of an issue as many try to make other's believe. it is not all about the 0.0 and the massive fleets.
7/10/2009,logoff mechanics have changed a fair bit without anyone really noticing.before with good skills you could catch a logoff with a single probe.however the probing system changed....... are logoffs catchable still?
7/10/2009,"you can catch them fine, it's just the problem of killing them before they disappear. this idea is supported."
7/10/2009,seems reasonable. i may have not purposly closed my client while in my hauler hitting a hostile camp.
7/10/2009,"logoffski- seen it done by targets and they do it in a way that suggests it is not the first time they have done it: normally a ratter in 0.0 gets caught by a fleet of ships when he had every opportunity to use scanner /look at local / have a scout /learn to play the game etc and get somewhere safe. is tackled and attacked, then disapears. the only way that this could happen is if they intentionally log off and log in an alt on the same account. eve doesn't let you have two alts on the same account online for very good reasons, hence the ship which should have blown up disappears immediatly due to what i believe is an abuse of game mechanics by said player. said player then also logs in and out before navigation is finished and ends up +1 mil km each time hence avoiding anyone waiting for them to log in at the point they warped to.if this is not outright abuse of game mechanics (and hence bannable) i don't know what is.this is particuly likely in certain areas of space where certain pet corp ships with alts called something like say 'hef6d7' seem to repeatativly do the same pve tasks. regardless of what is in local or sitting there watching them, that is until they are attacked. which to me isn't 100% proof of what i am suggesting but it certainly brings up even more worries about this mechanics, errr 'use'.the fix is simple, if you disconnect the ship and pod remain in game and a (ld) flag shows up, at which point they basicly become an npc with the same abilities and with skills applied ect (hence you are unlikely to be killed by rats or indeed a player that awould never kill you anyway if you get connection issues but of course you will lose your piloting skill and will remain stationary and attempts to emergency warp every few seconds, once a warp to 1mil km is acheived within 45 seconds the ship leaves game unless pointed, this is an improvement over the current system but prevents abuse). if this player tries to log in another alt they get a warning that they cannot and they need to log back in to connect to the (ld) alt. if the player logs in and immediatly logs off they stay at the safe point (ld) for 30 seconds again, they don't warp.this is similar to how it works in other online pvp games and i don't see why it cannot be implimented in eve."
7/10/2009,"[issue] rmt trading.real example;the person behind ricdic was caught doing real money trading with over 200b isk that he stole from ebank. the isk was sold for about 6,000 australian dollars. however, only his alternative character was banned for this act. the main character ricdic is not banned and is posting happily on the forums and playing the game with no penalty attached. i would like for the csm to bring this issue up to ccp; can one really do real money trading, be caught and still be able to play like nothing happend?"
7/10/2009,"butthurt over losing your isk, eh? not supported."
7/10/2009,this is about rmt and not isk.
7/10/2009,i agree. the policies around this needs to be revised by the csm
7/10/2009,"supported.some consistency from ccp would be good, but ""retrospective-banning"" shouldn't be done either i believe.certainly in future occurrences."
7/10/2009,"did you lose money iceblock, or are you just indignant over the horrible injustice in this situation? :)"
7/10/2009,i just want to clarify so i can rmt isk too without getting banned.
7/10/2009,"i understand why they don't get rid of farmers then, just the rmting accounts and not not isk making ones... we'll pop haulers full of dolls and ""team of janitors"" for a long time..."
7/10/2009,"why would they want to get rid of farmers, they are paying accounts. much easier to take away bought isk now and then, and still have people keep playing!"
7/10/2009,"unfortunately we don't know the circumstances behind why ricdic was reinstated, and even if we ask, ccp have a policy of not discussing individual accounts/players (which imho, is correct). however, we can ask about the rmt banning guidelines they do employ. personally i'd rather ask that question straight out as part of the q&a session for this month tho..."
7/10/2009,ebank is just one big scam waiting to happen.if you choose to trust 3rd parties with your iskies dont cry to the council when you get ripped off.also council is for game related issues.council has no rights to decide rl penalties handed out to players.big lols and thumbs down.
7/10/2009,how far do you want to take this?should his name be censored for all time like the eponymous ********** ?
7/10/2009,"i agree omber. however, ricdic is an example where something went wrong in the banning process in my eyes. what i think should be brought to attention is this, not ricdic in particular. he is just an example. this is nothing to do with the isk nor ebank itself. they are here for attention and example only. the real issue is the rules and policies behind rmt. if i can sell isk on my alternative account and get away with it with my main untouched and unbanned, something is wrong with the rules and policies don't you think?"
7/10/2009,how far do you want to take this?should his name be censored for all time like the eponymous ********** ?this is one guy. ccp is allowing rmt to be propagated on a massive scale in 0.0.make another proposal addressing the real issues rather than a witchunt- i'll support that.
7/10/2009,"ccp customer relation policies are not in the remit of the csm afaiucsm is for game design related issues, let them concentrate there efforts in this area."
7/10/2009,"they could because farmers are massively immersion breaking and thus ruining the experience for some. either it is you undock in highsec to a pack of cnrs named rtyu and cnjlkh and fgriogj or because you don't bother popping haulers anymore in lowsec because the good stuff is a droplet in a sea of worthless mission items.also farmers are not per se paying account it seems but mostly sustaining themselves on gtc/plex, so banning them at worst would crash that market a bit, if plex went low enough many people would resub secondary account and the prices would rise again..."
7/10/2009,indeed i want to know if only alts who actually handled the rmt transaction get banned. if that is the case i need to make some alts up soon.i need to buy an iron lung for my non exsistant child.
7/10/2009,you have no idea how wrong you are.

7/10/2009,"it's a storyline mission, and it gives you a good implant for 10 seconds work. besides, one of the missions has to give the lowest reward - why is it any worse if it's this one instead of another?"
7/10/2009,"not supported. this is a good mission for new polayers (and old players with new toons) to get standings increase on. if you want higher increases, train the appropriate skills."

7/10/2009,"i think this mission pops up more often than any other. i didn't do any statistics, though.not sure, but i seem to remember it doesn't even always give you an implant.missions need to be reworked anyway. especially the way payment is calculated..."
7/10/2009,this i agree with. and i think that's probably part of ccp's grand plan for epic arcs - though i have no proof of that.but randomly removing missions becuse they seem useless is probably not the best way to effect change.
7/10/2009,"i like this mission when i'm whoring, hands off."
7/10/2009,"did i possibly overestimate the understanding of the average player?mission rewards and standings changes are based off of the average completion time of a mission. so any mission that allows for the gathering of resources before accepting the mission allows for a completion time of seconds, rather than hours/minutes that the formula was designed for. this leads to off the chart low mission rewards/standings change."
7/10/2009,"no, we understand you just fine.we just don't share your concern about the situation."
7/10/2009,"i just did some investigating on my own and it does seem that throughout the day, wormholes begin to close but i have yet to find a new wormhole that wasn't detected at an earlier point in the game.it does seem that no new exploration sites spwan after down time and after asking about it in the exploration channel, they also seemed to agree that new sites don't spawn after dt which, if this is true, creates an unfair balance for those of us who are unable to log on shortly after dt.to the person that says that they always manage to find sites, this in itself doesn't mean much unless you can show that a site you haven't seen pops up on the scanner from a previous time during the day. for example, i always log on at lunch time and scan then scan later on in the evening when i return from work. there are always less sites and i have yet to find a new site that i haven't found previously during the day.can ccp comment on the exploration system as to whether this is in fact the case here?"
7/10/2009,"i know that if you're in a wormhole when the way out collapses, a new one spawns instantly. i'd wager that this doesn't happen especially often, though."
7/10/2009,definitely not often enough. is it me or have you found the quality and frequency of the wormholes to be less now than before the last game patch? it seems like the quality is way down...
7/10/2009,"what are you talking about? completed sites respawn all the time, not only on downtime.the downtime respawns expired sites - those that weren't found or weren't completed in time"
7/10/2009,"sites always respawn, in a different system in the same constellation. not supported."
7/10/2009,"i have yet to see any evidence that the site re-spawns. as i said, even those on the exploration site don't agree that sites will spontaneously appear in a system anytime during the time after downtime. if it does happen, it doesn't happen enough..."
7/10/2009,"what evidence do you need? to see it do some exploring and learn mechanics instead of posting nonsence like ""partially taken radar sites""if you want sites move to a less populated area, sites tend to drift to rarely visited systems, 5-6 signatures in system isn't uncommon in those. and drift happens exatly because of instant respawn of completed ones."
7/10/2009,people who spend more time worrying about other people getting more stuff than them end up getting less stuff than people who just go out and do it.
7/10/2009,"wh's spawn in all areas of eve in areas of all securitys.try lowsec, there are an annoying number of wormholes there that link to both highsec 'easy' wh space and slightly harder areas.this is really just people complaining they have to explore to get exploration content..."

7/10/2009,"seeing all these jan brady types who only go on the offensive only to add a km to their board, being able to deny them a km by self destructing is only fitting. after all, if they want to deny you your ship for the sake of getting a km, then you should have a right to deny them the km by:1. being faster on the self destruct initiation and2. if they can't destroy your ship fast enough, then tough luck. gankers should at least be good gankers if they think they are entitled to a km."
7/10/2009,god forbid a game allowed someone to serve some of your own medicine back to you.
7/10/2009,"not really supporting. stealth bombers are not meant for mass-destruction... just like small bombers in rl, they go, they release their few bombs, and gtfo if they can, that's the way it is, and that's the way it should be. bombers being able to deploy zoundz of bombs would be overpower.on the other hand, something like ""heavy bombers"" should be quite nice new ship-types.edit: i fly nemesis, so i could do with some buff, but i feel it would be way too much. bombers got buffed recently so that now they are usable, but it shouldn't be overdone imo.edit2: if normal cargo capacity gets nerfed at the same time, you'll have my support! :)"
7/10/2009,"hrm. crazy. interesting and doable, but crazy.let's put it this way: for the same effort we could have t3 battleships with a true ""escort carrier"" configuration carrying enough drone-bay space to let you hold your four flights of heavy drones.there's also the dominix, but that is of course restricted to gallente skills.i don't support the proposed change.--krum"

7/10/2009,"i normally don't post on the eve forums but this thread made me angry for some reason so here it goes.even though ninja salvagers do indeed need to invest a lot of time and money into their profession, the actual process of ninja salvaging has more or less no risk involved. therefore to solve this problem there needs to be a solution that adds a little risk but doesn't shut out ninja salvagers completely (i.e. instant aggro on salvage).so i propose that deadspace mission complexes act sort of like a room that is ""owned"" by the mission runner(s). by trespassing on the room a ninja salvager is given a certain amount of time (2 mins maybe?) to do whatever he wants, and then after that time has elapsed the mission runner(s) get aggro on the salvager. this basically makes it so there is a risk to salvaging right under peoples noses, but it is still possible. it also would make salvaging jobs a bit more complicated, you may have to get more than 1 person to be able to salvage a decent amount of loot before the time is up."
7/10/2009,while the current state of the system for your character's 'bio' is probably less important to others than it is to me (see
7/10/2009,"this has been complained about before, and the stated policy of ccp is that increasing bio lengths would lead to exploits, with no further explanation given(since they do not discuss exploits). there are plans in the works to overhaul these systems, and they can't come to fruition soon enough for my tastes, but for now, we're stuck with the godawful status quo. also, when raising an issue for the csm, you generally want to put it in the assembly hall, not jita park, fyi."

7/11/2009,"if rockets aren't fine, it's not your af that needs a bonus, it's the weapons system- however if you try your unbonused lazorz versus the rockets when attacking another af, i think you may consider changing your stance. back when i was pirating, a local would fly around in her rocket vengeance and utterly **** other afs she fought- just a matter of finding the right targets.as for the drones- i did indeed use hobgoblin iis at the time, and decided to use that example as most people don't realize valks track frigates with good skills. however, i have since tanked an arbitrator with a flight of valk iis in my ishkur- one of the weaker tanked afs. and if you don't believe that, i'd be happy to prove it to you. (clarification: i tanked his drones, i did not pop them, as the arby was friendly, and i was testing a setup- i would have been able to tank them as long as i had cap boosters)"
7/11/2009,"any af can sport a strong enough tank to tank 4 rocket launchers on a vengeance, any of them. its on paper dps is a measely not much over a hundred and you don't get anywhere near that due to the horrible explosion volocity. rockets currently are terrible. also i have no idea how your having so much success against drone boats with a small ship as i **** anything frigate sized in my arbitrator. enyo's and ishkurs included. also not sure if your aware but a thrasher sports a horrible tank compaired to a af especially if its scrammed and webbed and it takes a laughable amount of time to kill even them.seriously get in a vengeance, fit rocket launchers and go try to kill something beefier then a executioner, then come back and tell me how it feels to try beating someone to death with limp noodles.i fly the retribution a lot, its crazy survivable and does decent dps. would i love a 4th bonus yes i would. would i worship the dev incharge of a decision to give it a 2nd mid hell ya. is it useable now, yes. is it worth the cost maybe.do i look at ishkurs and wish i was skilled for them yup, do i look at a jag and wish i could fly them yes i do. 4 effing mids. most the af's ishkur excluded need a little love. some of them either themselves or there weapon systems (rockets) need love. if a vengeance did 240 dps with rockets and tanked like it currently does that would be very broken, if it got a good 150 dps and could actually applied taht to a webbed scrammed target it would be worth what it costs for something other then a amazing tackler. and yes the vengeance with dual sarii's and dual nos is a amazing heavy tackler but buffing rockets wouldn't make that better as at that point it can't fit them.quit going on about your ishkur as everyone here aggree's that is the only af thats about where they should be."
7/11/2009,"i suggest you contact brigita grohman if you'd like to learn how to fly a vengeance :) also, the ishkur is good for its dps, and its speed. the reference i used was in regards to its tank, which is regarded by most as subpar compared to the other afs."
7/11/2009,give the ret a 2nd mid!
7/11/2009,"oh look everybody, there is this brigita grohman who knows how to fly a vengeance when nobody else doesquick ccp! hire this brigita grohman person and let him/her train the remaining thousands on how to fly the vengeance since everybody else is stupid, and its easier than fixing rockets"

7/11/2009,"wow, this is still going on? i'd have thought it would have been a done deal by now tortugan, i totally see where you're coming from (see earlier posts) - i love af. there are however 2 considerations to consider.1st is design. it is clearly anomalous to have one class of t2 frig excluded from being 4th bonused. the question is - can you conceive of what that bonus might be without making the ship overpowered.2nd is principle. yes af rock, and roll, and bugger your granny sideways if you don't respect their authorotah (just yesterday we killed 2 bs and a hic that made the age old mistake of ""oh it's just a gang of frigs how bad can it - augh! my gran!! noooooo!!!"") but as you fly around in them there's just a little that's not quite there. i've tested them all out and for some it's clearer than others. ishkur not so much - any of the caldari ones, oh hell yes!i think what was proposed earlier was a solid proposal to fill both gaps, but it needs people like you and me to stand on wang et al to make sure that ccp don't take a nerf bat to our beloved ships.and sorry, but that means no 2nd mid for the retri - even if it is my favourite."
7/11/2009,yes hijacking popular sentiment was my ultimate goal but wait ...sentiment didn't become popular until the subject was brought up and voted on ... so now we're in a sort of time loop according you you.but i like your argument ... making the issue about who brought it up ... not what the game mechanic lacks ...
7/11/2009,woohoo!
7/11/2009,"but i like your reply ... failing to have a sense of humour ... and ingoring everything i said about the mechanic ..adding an agression timer will....- not prevent neutral rr- make rr bs's unable to rep each other if they want to jump / dock- prevent null / low sec logistics cruisers from jumping when they are inevitably primariedadding aggression mechanics to remote buff modules has far more consequences outside of empire than inside it.you are never going to get rid of neutral alts altering fights in high sec because any mechanic that can be used by mission runners to provide remote assistance is going to be used by empire war deckers.no, most of the people who oppose this are aware of the wider consequences and understand that the small nerf to neutral rr in empire that is being suggested would result in a much bigger nerf elsewhere.fyi i've never used a neutral rr alt but if the situation arose then i'd have no hesitation in doing so and don't see how the proposed mechanic would stop me."
7/11/2009,it probably won't but it will make you think twice about sticking your nose into a fight that is not yours ... who wants to run the risk of losing a ship if they have to wait to dock like everyone else doesmaybe its time we look into the whole rr bs thing ... just like they made cloaking devices ... maybe rr modules should be ship specific and hard to kit on anything but a logistics ship -or- impractical to use on anything but a logistics ship.perfect example for this would be: why did the alliance tourny ban their use in the last tourny? they realized it drags pvp out and is potentially the 'i win' button.why should they get a free pass ... get off the gate just like the ecm pilot does ... the logistics is a ranged ship.ask any ecm pilot ... using the ship on a gate is asking for a kick in the mouth.but i thought 0.0 was supposed to be the land of milk and honey? once again you're making it an issue of who suggested the fix ... i have never used a neutral rr alt either ... and the proposed mechanic would make me think twice about using rr if i had to wait just like everyone else to redock or jump if i had aggression for trying to turn the tide of a battle ...
7/11/2009,"so you agree with me that the proposal will not prevent neutral rr in empire but will affect rr bs gangs and logistics?this is very much the point i'm making, the issue is far more complex than simply adding aggression timers to remote buff modules. if you actually do understand this then why is there no mention of it in the op?thank you for pointing out the exact tactic that will be used by empire rr alts to make your suggested fix pointless. if the rr alt in question doesn't have the skills to fly a dedicated logistics ship then use a buffer fit t1 logistics and simply let it die then the alt can dock up and grab a new ship for a few pennies.those are just two possible tactics but i'm sure there's plenty more ways to make your suggested fix utterly and totally irrelevant. once again you've taken this personally instead of looking at the mechanic i was highlighting. the server has no way to distinguish between a mission runner applying remote rep to their friends and a war decker applying remote rep to their friends which is a very significant fact when trying to think of alternative ways to prevent neutral rr.i know that your your op doesn't affect mission runners but it doesn't affect neutral rr much either because it's mainly a nerf to rr bs gangs.any suggestion that makes remote repping neutrals a criminal offense will hurt mission runners and any suggestion that involves adding an aggression timer fails to solve the problem of neutral rr. catch 22."
7/11/2009,absolutely notzombie disposable rr ... while theoretically possible .. get real .. who's going to do that ... thats like saying i have a throw away falcon for my station camping as for making logistics work at range ... i fail to see how that is a work around to a fix? it will put a neutral rr at way more risk of losing his ship than he is right now hugging a station ... a fast tackler will catch him with his pants down ... exactly how will this hurt a mission runner ... examples please
7/11/2009,with that ability to utterly contradict yourself i go back to my original assessment that you should be a politician.are you seriously trying to say that adding an agro timer to rr modules will have more effect on neutral rr alts than rr bs gangs?

7/11/2009,"if a csm could comment on what i have typed below i would really appreciate it. i'm afraid to say it but the problem is actually graver than the fix being proposed can manage. even if this fix goes through it won't help much. why? because currently probers are catching on to a ""technique"" that allows them to keep their combat probes tucked away in their cargo holds while still being able to probe players down. the technique is as follows: 1. use the onboard scanner to pinpoint the location of a player to within an au. since no probes are used the prey will not suspect he's being ""probed"".2. once the prober has the location pinpointed he could now launch the combat probes for just about 5 seconds, get a result, and get a 100% warp-able hit. probes only remain in space for that long.3. warp to target and bust mission.basically, combat probes only have one function at the moment; to give the prober a bookmark to warp to. the rest of the process can be accomplished by the onboard scanner. what this means to the prey is that if he wants to detect the probes he will need to press the onboard scanner every 5 seconds. even if this fix manages to be implemented youll still have to press the button 540 times for a mission lasting you 45 minutes. there is little to no reason to use combat probes to probe. the onboard scanner does the same job and is silent. this is just really stupid mechanics. i would appreciate it if a csm could bring this up to ccps attention since this is destroying the possibility of running missions in low sec. once the mission has been probed down the chances of a mission runner completing the mission dwindle significantly.i started a thread on this here:combat probes + directional scanner = overpoweredfeel free to check it out and comment. on any case, i support this thread regardless. good luck and thanks for reading."
7/11/2009,"bump...i'm up to 50,000 mouse clicks.ccp....... usability like this creates problems like rsi and carpal-tunnel.do you wish to be responsible for your software causing injuries?is that something you'd like to be accountable for?"
7/11/2009,"faction gear is too expensive, especially deadspace. the ""bump everything 5 meta levels"" patch is going to be awesome."
7/11/2009,"hint: this is more along the lines of keeping deadspace modules at the exact same price but having varying sizes, with larger sizes tending to cost more. ... oh wait.. *looks at deadspace frigate mwd. looks at deadspace cruiser mwd.* it's already implemented! 1mn microwarpdrives are turning eve into wow since frigate pilots pay less to fit deadspace mwd than cruiser and battleship pilots"
7/11/2009,"that actually has a lot more to do with demand. ccp is bypassing demand by affecting build cost with rigs. i mean, say small rigs were 10x more popular after patch. if they're implemented at 200k build cost, they're only going to cost 2 mil. by comparison, if ccp were to half the about of small gisti shield boosters dropped, they're price would go through the roof. and since they already run at 700 mil a pop, that's significant. btw, small gisti boosters are already in heavy demand which is why their cost is so much greater than most small faction loot."
7/11/2009,"i was referring to the ""esp t2"" bit - i can sort of see the way they did sized rigs(disagree with it, but understand it), but the move to make t2 rigs cheaper is just fundamentally dumb imo. t2 rigs are the equivalent of deadspace gear - they're supposed to be luxury goods that are only really cost-effective choices on mission ships and supercaps. making them cheaper just defeats the purpose."
7/11/2009,"not supported.you seem to be completely missing the point- you're right that rigs are supposed to allow you to add extra power to a ship in exchange for an additional investment. perfectly correct. but why the hell should rigs cost the same across all ship sizes? only a twit with more money than sense (or someone entering a restricted tournament like the alliance tournaments) would rig any t1 ship smaller than a battlecruiser because a single rig would cost several times the value of the damned hull! that's just silly. yes, i admit the new price scaling is a bit surprising, but to my mind rigs have always been badly overpriced anyway. and from a purely fluff/common sense perspective it's frankly ridiculous that rigs cost the same for all ship sizes- why would a kit designed to modify your ship's entire hull cost the same regardless of whether it's put on a t1 frigate or a titan?"
7/11/2009,not supported.on the whole pvp gains from it and if those oldies wanna play with expensive gear there is plenty of that left.
7/11/2009,something does need to be done about this. we tried to get a hulk a few nights back and the jerk just insta warped off as our interdictors were in warp. that's pretty lame...he had an alt in a covert ops there to watch until we left. i don't think this is what ccp had in mind when they created the disconnect rules. i support this thread wholeheartedly.
7/11/2009,"i'm not going to mark this thread supported, but i do think the issue needs to be fixed. i just don't think the ops idea is the correct fix. personally i favor the fix suggested by another posted (bloody eve forums not showing full discussion on reply). when you log back in after e-warping off, you should -always- return to the original point you e-warped off from. now, there is another problem with this i see though. so the person logs back on, and ctrl-q's on their way back to their original position (assuming we use this fix). now they hit their original position, but it doesn't matter as they just e-warp off again. proposal 1: 5 second time window after coming out of warp where you don't e-warp and you aren't invulnerable. its a short time, so you'd have to be fast on the lock and scram, but the advantage is that he'll come back to the same spot. some honest bad connections might get caught in this, but i don't think that many, especially once people know this rule and learn to be careful about logging back in right away on a bad connection.proposal 2: you e-warp off like normal. this still favors the loggofskis, but at least this way you know the person is going to stay within 1au of your position, and no matter what they will always be returning to the place they warped off from. this would increase your odds of probing them down (you know about where they'll be) and won't allow them to completely escape (they can log off and on as much as they want, but they'll always be coming back to your spot).personally i think i'm in favor of 2. if its an honest disconnect they can stay gone for a few hours and come back after the gatecamp leaves, sorry to interrupt your eve time. if its a loggofski or a macro, they may be safe, but it helps your odds a lot. middle of the road/everyone but loggofskis are happy idea."
7/11/2009,"hell, i'm more than happy to just see the issue getting some csm airtime and a memo landing on some overtasked dev's desk.i of course like my soloution and i think it would work. but i am gladly supporting others that have cropped up that i think might be better, simpler, fixes."
7/11/2009,makes sense.
7/11/2009,lets fix sentry aggro first.
7/11/2009,"make mining more interactive. you shouldn't be able to afk mine, the same way you cant afk pvp. this would sort out the macros and and then the supply and demand would be back in the hands of the players, and not the npc's. if they dont remove the possibility of macro's, then they may as well remove high sec mining from the game completely. sorry for making this a macro flame (didnt mean to insult the ppl who macro), its just that they are the root of all our problems. at the end of the day, missions are fun and mining is not. that is why mining should be more profitable."
7/11/2009,"i would support this provided that you mean stacking them, not merely merging the runs in a single bpc, as darius said."
7/11/2009,"this would defeat the purpose that invention serves. invention requires you to install essentially daily jobs to continue production. with ability to merge bpcs, you can just merge bpcs into a few 30 day jobs (like t2 bpo owners do) then go away for few weeks.not supported for this reason."
7/11/2009,"i don't think the game's database supports building piles of bpcs, and that won't be an easy thing to fix. the only way i would favour merging copies otherwise would be to have a merge/split copies science job that takes maybe half as long as making those copies from a bpo would, subject to all the same limits. let inventors fix screwups in their runs, but don't give people instant changes or anything like that."

7/11/2009,"ui modding supported.a modding community can adapt much faster to player needs than ccp (or any game company) ever could.if ccp have to implement ui modifications, first they would have to survey the actual ui needs of the community, than each idea would have to go through a lengthy decision chain, internal testing, bug fixing. after that it has to be patched to the test server client and if it goes right, to tq client. having the best ui design team in the world wouldn't make this process much faster.on the other hand, if they implemented costumisable ui support in a simple language, like lua, a small team or a single enthusiast can create an addon, test it with some friends and release it. if there's a bug, there's no long corporate decision chain to go through, no patching to worry about, after fixing the code you can release it right away.in the long run creating a proper, moddable ui would be much less time consuming and produce much better results, than ccp playing hit-or-miss. if you want precedent just look at wow, look around on modding sites like curse gaming and ask yourself if ccp could create such diverse ui content by itself."
7/11/2009,"the op of the dead horse had a couple of ideas when he created the dead horse. from that has come 2 ideas that people in that thread want.1) make the pos look right. modulation or using plex or mission pos stuff, ( walls barriers elevators...) make the pos look like better than a stick with mods floating around it.2) is all about pos funcanality. having the pos upgradable to make it feel more of a miny station. additionally have new moduals and things that can increase the usefullnes of the pos i know that the most popular of the ideas is the first one. almost anyone that has seen or works with a pos thinks they look like crap and contray to our wonderful csm who thinks that the looks of the game doen't matter, i would suggest they go play a space mud. i want my game to look good. and at one point ccp said that it was very important to them. for some reason the decided looking good was only for spaceship and not the pos.i would like to have the 2 ideas brought up separatly and see if we can get any kind of answer to either."
7/11/2009,"then lets make sure that everyone knows that diedra vaal not only an imbecile, but also a sell out - since it is not a job of csm to present their opinions, or notions, likes, or dislikes, but those of the electing public... what kind of a moron would even say that?! i mean seriously, if any sensible person takes more than 60 seconds to think about that csms statement they would see that they are clearly not there for the players. whatever individual csm's personal agenda might be - the reason why they were elected was to represent the bloody public, the ""public"" in this case are the players. one might hate the idea, or have unfavorable opinions on it, but one still must bring it to ccp if the damn public demands it, no? otherwise it clearly shows that the csm in question discredited themselves, since they choose not to represent those who voted for them, and hence are an utter tosser.placing a dead horse where it belongs, on the front page. ccp devs should be ashamed of themselves. and, some csms too, i think a tripy trip to iceland went to some of their little heads.reaffirming that csm are there to represent what ""electorate"" wants, not only their own opinions on the matter. also, i might actually enter into csm campaign, since some of the ****ers are really ****ing me off - and would run on two issues:issue one: pos - fix, fix, fix it!!!!issue two: csm - no confidence vote - to make it possible to kick the csms out of the office if certain amount of support garnered, in particular related to cases where csm in question feels that their opinion on the matter outweighs the thousand other opinions - in other words if csm is a prick."
7/11/2009,"i see a whole lot rabble here.so here's where we are standing:ccp can not justify ripping out the whole pos system, to implement it in a modular style. it will take a lot of time, labour and considerable amounts of pain, when the poses we have on tq, has to be converted to the new ones.so a full re-implementation is out of the picture.ccp did agree to looking into the possibility of using this idea for personal anchor-able structures.i see a whole lot of ""waah, this isn't good enough, raise this to ccp until they agree entirely."".but what exactly should ccp say, in order to make you happy? that is pretty unclear."
7/11/2009,i would love to see this idea happen it would add an intresting aspect to the game.
7/11/2009,"1) the insurance company is not concord. not all corporations abide by the law in eve. the insurance company is clearly a neutral entity who doesn't care who is paying them, so long as they get paid. (and they most likely make a profit, since an insured carebear ship is very unlikely to die.) 2) making a real life to eve comparison is silly. ""law abiding citizen"" and all. are you pretending to be a guy who wakes up and goes to work and makes money then comes home and watches tv and goes to sleep and does it again.. but in space? do you want the life of a pod pilot to be comparable to the life of an average citizen in real life? it's a silly thing. furthermore, real insurance companies: would they insure you for hunting pirates? (player or npc.) no, no they would not. you may think of npc pirates as 'resources', but by your logic, you're taking far too much risk. intentionally fighting dozens of battleships is about as bad as intentionally getting concord on you. the silly, nonrealistic eve mechanic of invincible npcs that kill anyone who shoots is the only thing that changes this. so, if you want realism? 1) no insurance for anything except highsec mining or hauling. any combat is non-insurable, pvp or pve. 2) higher taxes for empire protection. no npc pirates of any kind in highsec. (how can concord / faction police destroy any player, yet ignore the massive fields of farmable npcs? unrealistic, nerf it!) 3) slower concord response. concord could not instantly warp in and save the day, and would not be invincible. it would be possible to escape concord. it would be possible to kill concord. (although you'd, of course, be wanted and pursued. the life of a criminal, realistic, and not a one shot 'you die instantly'.) 4) all ships would be slowed down exponentially; faster than light travel? nonsense! it should take hours to cross a solar systems, because ftl travel is unrealistic. the same for communication; it should take hours to send someone a message. 5) you should actually have to spend time reading long boring manuals to learn skills; autotraining is unrealistic. 6) you should have a 99.99% chance of never becoming a pod pilot, and instead being a mindless npc on a planet somewhere who probably works at a burger king. ...see where i'm going with this? eve is unrealistic. intentionally so. unrealistic things make the game fun; insurance is a game mechanic, not a real insurance company. if it was real, you'd have to spend months arguing in court that you deserve the payment you're guaranteed by contract, only to get half as much as you deserve. concord would not be instant. you'd probably not be a pod pilot. you'd spend years to move from one system to the next. there would be no highsec pve, and highsec mining would require you to get government approval to harvest the resources... but eve is not life on earth. it's silly to think space inhabited by immortal pod pilots is going to function like a 20th century western suburb..."
7/11/2009,supported. insurance sucks. what's the point of pvp when there is little to no isk risk to doing it?
7/11/2009,"i agree. i can honestly lose about 4bs a day for a week and still really not feel the wallet pain because of insurance.as it stands i fly faction fit and that is still pretty cheap. current claymore setup costs 700m, i went from 45m to 700m in a week of mission running (was sick from work :p). a normal schedual of isk whoring for me would take about 2-2.5 weeks of slack mission running to fit a 700m isk ship.the risk is just not there any more. the only risk is really in t2 ships, and that said making 150m on a sunday afternoon is not that hard."
7/11/2009,"nerf concord about 5 times over, and then sure. after the last concord boost not a chance."
7/11/2009,"this.so, no."
7/11/2009,"not to support suicide ganking, but from a logical standpoint.. the insurance company =/= concord. not all factions and corporations work together just because they're npcs. so, really, the only question is how much risk a pilot is to insure. and if we're going to go that route.. any pvpers will have insurance voided for engaging in combat. pve mission runners? same thing. anyone who jumps into lowsec or 0.0? yep. a miner who kills a few rat frigates in a belt? risked his ship, no insurance. if you try to compare a pod pilot to a normal person, you'd have to assume they'd be in prison for life. (they'd kill thousands of crew by killing a single battleship.) but, really, pod pilots are above the law. only concord polices them effectively. and since concord isn't the insurance company, and concord jurisdiction only covers pod pilots (ie, they can't arrest corporations who indirectly support criminals)... well, you get the idea. basically, imagine you're insuring your car. except you're an immortal who is above the law and you're insuring a spaceship that could wipe out a moderately sized city on a whim. also, you can probably afford to buy your own city and blow it up. just because you can. do you really think a 'mundane car insurance' company is going to have the same policy as a company that insures spaceships to be used in combat with other spaceships? and, again, low sec status means concord and faction police don't like you. if you'll check the mails 'pend insurance company' is the name; not ""concord insurance""."
7/11/2009,"mmmmmm wasnt comparing insurance in rl with every scenario eve has to offer ffs, as far as insurance gos anyway you would be wrong as insurance is based on risk and if the element of risk is sooooo great the co wont insure ie self destruct and loss of a ship through criminal acts"

7/11/2009,"agreed. you do realize that after the eve wormhole closed, the settler civilizations collapsed into the stone age for a few thousand years, right?"
7/11/2009,"i don't know about that, i'm ex military myself, every time we went out we were hoping this was the time the enemy would actually show some guts and do something, most professional warriors i knew longed for a real battle instead of mile after file if presence patrols,oh well maybe were ""different"" in the infantry."
7/11/2009,"while i'm willing to agree that the audio alert is a bit over the top, i think that having a sweeping real-time directional radar is something the game needs. not only is it closer to real-life but it could potentially cut down on the constant database calls. i don't agree that the status quo is good enough. in order for the game to evolve, some of these nascent flaws should be fixed. the scanning system is pretty much the same as it was when the game was still in beta. ccp improved the graphics and the ui. i remember when the game used to have some 3d scanner thingie but i think it only used to work for ships in the immediate vicinity (ccp dumped it because it wasn't very useful when the overview provided better information).at any rate, i give this idea a thumbs up."
7/11/2009,"i can support you're statement fully, it is an arduous and meaningless drone task. but to automate the scanner is not the solution, atleast not the proposed extent.i would agree with being able to use the same directional scanner but have it auto run every 2-4 seconds. the player of course would still be required to watch the scanner window for contacts and not rely on a voice telling them. not pro automating any task other then an auto repeat for the scanner button."
7/11/2009,"redsplat....this: that's been bugging me all day. congrats, you have managed to grief me.why?because whilst you may gank someone tonight, be that someone looking for a fight, or an afk/bot miner, or a noob, that is the player you have met, in one way or the other.whome you have not met, yet perhaps as they might make an error, or may never meet, are those who are engaged in pvp with you before they even undock.yes yes, i know. people say ""you don't want to get blown up, the best way is not to undock"".but really, when i go into dangerous places, i do all of the intel work first, before i leave, and keep it going, during the trip. the protocols themselves are draining, to say the least, but interesting, captivating, and can be exciting too. without firing a shot. because a miner, hauler, or an explorer already pvps, but the goal is not to tank and spank, it's to evade, escape, avoid. what that player plots a course, stays aware, keeps an eye out for scouts, changes course abruptly, and all the other tricks, they are actually engaged in pvp.sure, if i step into a boxing ring with gloves on, i expect to hit and be hit. but is this game strictly a boxing match? i can understand that some people get so much of their experience (and self esteem) tied up in dealing and taking damage, that it might bother them to consider another way. it's like a political party hack who never admits that their candidate was wrong. this weekend you might kill a hauler and that will be all you know, because you might have caught him off guard, or perhaps his ip connection stinks or his kids distracted him. what you don't know is that he might have already dissed you twenty times, and will diss you twenty more times before he moves on. all those other things that don't involve how well your armor resists or how well your guns hit, you may be failing at. or maybe your scouts are, who knows. my suggestions for the improvement of directional scanning have nothing to do with making it easier to ""avoid pvp at all costs"". hello? that is how some people pvp. you may have a gripe about someone who simply stays in high-sec, but even carebears have to compete with each other for belts and business. in fact, i think being able to increase the range of a d-scanner by narrowing the beam would be quite the tool for people on the hunt. when i think of ""improvements"", i think of everybody, because what's good for my opponent, can be good for me too. and for everybody."
7/11/2009,"well agrued and reasoned. it, rather interesting. i suport. direcional need some tweaking."
7/11/2009,"the thing is, the real world doesn't have to put up with server lag. i'd support changes to the directional scanner(e.g., longer ranges at narrower angles, like you said), but auto-scan is just not possible, and the devs have said this before."
7/11/2009,"at the moment webbers have a positive effect, they massively increase the ability of a ship to get into warp. a freighter with a rapier/huginn in support can get into warp in less than 3 seconds instead of the normal 37s (max with v, 73s max with 0).in realistic terms (yes i know it's a game), a freighter would not benefit from being slowed down and currently they warp so fast that they often enter warp side ways.in addition in pvp a target may get away just because the webber got lock milliseconds before a warp disruptor/field could take effect.i propose a change to webbers. instead of reducing max speed, it should affect either propulsion strength (hidden value) so it takes longer to accelerate and/or inertia modifier. this would make webbers do what they were intended without the positive effect.ships should still have to reach ~75% max speed to warp, they should just align slower and/or accelerate slower. to balance it, it could also reduce max speed but not to the amount it is currently doing.pros:fixes the broken game mechanicmakes webbers more usefulremoves freighter blitzkrieg jumpingcons:makes webbers into mini-warp disruptors by delaying alignment and reducing accelerationremoves freighter blitzkrieg jumping"
7/11/2009,"i don't think that webbing freighters is that terrible a mechanic, and i don't think that your fixes would actually work. propulsion strength isn't implemented, and changing the inertia modifier won't actually web people in any sort of way anyone would recognize. if this is a problem, change the align mechanics, not the webs."
7/11/2009,"'in realistic terms', a stasis webifier is curving spacetime so that an object's actual velocity remains the same but it's relative velocity is lowered. tl;dr: assuming it's going to work like throwing a net on someone to slow them down is a bit silly. as warp is also an effect of altering spacetime, one would assume the two would have some effects (intended or otherwise) on each other. why shouldn't there be a way to assist slower gang mates getting into warp?"
7/11/2009,"um, no support. you would nerf the ability for freighters and orcas from getting into low/null sec at all. and if you seriously cannot contend with one/two dudes webifying the freighter, kill the dude. shocking. also, your change wouldn't happen.--isaac"
7/11/2009,"rofl no! the slower the ships go, the more they can benefit from their agility thus the tighter their turning circle becomes.put it simply - orbit a can in an interceptor at 500m on full base speed you have more ability to make use your agility so you stay relatively close. pop your micro warp drive on, or heavens forbid overload it, your agility remains the same but it's insufficient to keep a tight turning circle at high speed. also don't forget about inertia! all that's happening with the big boys is they're able to align on a penny, turning like they're on caterpillar tracks travelling in opposing directions, instead of travelling aroung a planet at speed with front wheel steering.yes it may seem silly, but in effect it's literally exactly what is happening!"
7/11/2009,"they are freighters, in an ideal world they shoul have to be vulnerable and to be escorted along trade routes..i dont support op's idea.i do support changing webs to massively decrease acceleration but not max speed.if anyone cant understand how that would effect the game, then get your head out of the sand."
7/11/2009,escorted...like with frigates and recon ships?
7/11/2009,"of course. as scouts.but further...like with a fleet prepared to duke it out with a gatecamp to get the freighter through safely, or hold down each gate ahead and behind on the jump route and actually protect the freighter- as opposed to using scouts and silly stasis web mechanics to instawarps your freighter sideways across the galaxy."
7/11/2009,"are you saying your gate camp can't kill a huginn or a kestrel? or target a freighter in those three seconds? it's not like he's fitting stabs, after all."

7/11/2009,"i disagree, dav. i think the csm exists to bridge the gap between player base and ccp. not focus exclusively on gameplay issues (which this arguably is, by the way)and as it is, as obvious as ebank was a bit of a scam, i agree with the original poster in the matter of harsher punishments for rmt."
7/11/2009,"all parts of the game are part of csm purview (if you need an example look how the csm was involved in both the pos exploit and the alliance disbanding thing). however, in both those cases, ccp requested to discuss them with the csm.as part of our trip to iceland, there is a day before we start discussing raised issues used for information and general discussion between csm and ccp. in the past it has been used to brief csm on the pos exploit situation, the apocrypha expansion, how gm's go abou ttheir roles within the petition system, and a new qa testing system they were looking to implement.i'd be more than happy to formally ask ccp to spend part of that day on rmt and it's consequences if they are interested in hearing the csm thoughts on it. personally i think that would be a better avenue for discussion on this topic as a simple ""we want moar people banz0red"" issue would not really help us to understand why there seems to be a flexible banning system for rmt, nor would we be able to understand the background behind why that system exists and in what circumstances it is applied.if that is cool with you guys, i'm happy to bring the question up at csm level and if those guys agree, we can ask for the info session."
7/11/2009,"i think it would be good if rmting doesn't just result in the actual rmting account being banned, but also all other accounts held by that same person.the problem is, how can ccp determine that the same person is behind two accounts, with absolute certainty, so that innocents don't get their accounts banned because they look like alts of the criminal?"
7/11/2009,i think you definitly should do that omber to clarify what the policies are and how and to what degree they are enforced.first thing one could do is check the name and addresse of the rmt account and ban all accounts that match. kind of obvious i would think? :p

7/11/2009,"an update making it so that it would be possible to veiw the actual isk amount of insurance (along with insurance level, platinum ect) would be usefull. the price you pay for a ship at a particular moment in time influences the amount insurance costs/pays out. being able to see that would be usefull.on a related note, the ability to veiw how much you payed for an item would be very usefull as well. i (like many i think) have one main station with a lot of items, and knowing how much you payed for an item a month ago without putting it into a note is impossible. trading would be a lot easier if i knew if i was making a profit off this old item or if it was actually worth less now."
7/11/2009,"i'd support the insurance mails having isk figures in them. as for how much you paid for an item, go into your transaction history, and search for the item type. adding it as actual info on the item is just completely impractical. and as a word of advice on your trading - once you've bought it, it doesn't matter what you paid. that's a sunk cost, your goal is just to sell it for as much as you can."

7/12/2009,"#1 agreed that it will not prevent neutral rr, that is not the purpose of the proposed change. rather, it means that neutral rr has *consequences*, i.e. you cannot just jump/dock/undock etc with impunity - after you start repping and involve yourself in a fight, it commits you for a time.#2 i see no problem with rr bs gangs needing to wait out an aggro timer before jumping.#3 stay far out from the fights and aligned to a ss?that's fine, a t1 logistics will instapop if any good bs pilot shot it - and not rep enough to meaningfully influence the fight.can you elaborate on this? how would people remote repping a friend in a mission be significantly harmed by not being able to dock/jumped for a minute?"
7/12/2009,articulated my thoughts precisely. supported.
7/12/2009,"irrespective of it being a problem or not, it is a massive change in game mechanics that needs looked at in it's own right and not something that can be blithely ignored as a minor consequence of nerfing neutral rr. 60 seconds is a long time if you're being pounded by an enemy fleet and have got no rr.they won't be, i mentioned mission runners in the context of finding alternatives to the aggression timer solution.the problem is one of neutral rr being invulnerable so there may be a solution involving rr becoming an aggressive act unless you are in fleet or some other device however i've not managed to think of anything satisfactory that would cure the neutral rr problem without having knock on consequences elsewhere.i support the idea of removing the neutral rr 'i win' docking button but the exact mechanic and consequences need more thought."
7/12/2009,"how is it a massive change?it wouldn't be a new change, as far as i can tell aggro flagging has been around for a long time.the only thing ""massive"" about it is now it applies to players who are providing rr support whereas before it didn't.the effects are well understood, everyone needs to adjust accordingly.i'm thinking you have a fleet of rr alts that you don't want nerfed."
7/12/2009,"i was completely lost in the beginning of my eve career. i didn't skill train, i didn't use the free implants from the n00b missions, i didn't even mission. i made all my initial isj by ratting in hisec belts, and i only started missioning after getting my thrasher, but the thrasher proved to be the one ship that, at that low level, could really do all i wanted. i could go ratting in losec and with t2 arties and t2 ammo, and sensor boosters and an ab could orbit cruiser rats at 40kms, and could salvage the rest no problemthe wake up call came as soon as i started playing against real players or higher level missions. the thrasher got thrashed.with an alt i eventually tried a coercer, and promptly ran out of cap, and then a catalyst and ran out of grid. the cormorant makes a good salvager as it has a larger bay than the thrasher, but that's about it.the destroyers need to be in all aspects between frigates and cruisers. they need one less turret and one more mid/low slot (there were there is currently only two). they need to lose the 25% rof penalty. and they need the sig radius reduced a bit. a t2 combat version would be nice as well."
7/12/2009,"i like the idea of dropping the rof penalty while dropping to 6 guns and gaining another low/mid slot. that also takes care of the fitting problem on the catalyst. i would however, prefer a 3rd mid slot to a 4th low slot, as that gives you the option to fit a web or cap booster to power a repper in the lows.the main problem i see with destroyers though is the ease with which they die. lowering the sig radius will help a lot against larger ships, but iirc, they got left behind back when all ships got a significant hp buff. bring their ehp up 20-25% so they actually have more tank than say, a cov ops.i also really like the idea of adding a tier 2 variant as well as a t2 version that is meant as a t2 anti frig platform instead of a bubbler."

7/12/2009,"nothing to make it ""easier for carebears"". real carebears don't go into the dangerous places anyway, that's why they are carebears.but those who want to go for exploring and the extra benefit of a risky mission need better tools. it would not be good to see the directional scanner go, and hope this is not the case, but it takes patience to use that and since the missions are always the same old ""fly around and fight for 30-45 minutes"", the pirate or ganker has all the time he needs. from this point the laws of economics - which is why missioning in lowsec is breaking under this - take over. yes even if low sec missions are boosted or lvl 4 moved to lowsec, losing more isk worth of ship running them, and the lost time of not being able to complete them, will drive off even the most motivated non-carebear as he runs out of money. there is also the option of loading the mids with eccm. kiters using drone boats or missiles might get away with that if every mission was ""warp to"" something other than zero which is not the case with deadspaces, otherwise it won't be possible to survive that mission without hardeners or having more than 6m skill points. i know the other snide remark is ""well, just don't go alone"". that really means ""well, get divorced, quit your job, get rid of your kids, and live in your mothers basement and play eve for 20 hours a day with others just like you"". even a faction warfare fleet takes more time to organize than that what most people have time to play this game daily. perhaps we need more exploration, survey, hacking, and courier missions too, that don't require a long stay in the first place. thumbs up."

7/12/2009,"if i might point out that this solution while being the simplest it implement would in effect dumb down mining negatively.if the original suggestion was adopted i myself would prefer to have multiple ore veins an asteroid as apposed to all minerals possible out of an ore refine as the former requires that a miner make a choice about which crystal to use and which vein (ore) to mine.ideally a survey scanner would be adjusted (perhaps through ""focused"" / ""area"" scripts) so that it could scan an individual targeted asteroid and listed the ores available which can then be separately targeted for mining (a bit like station service icons that can only be targeted through the survey result screen).if you didn't scan a roid then the miners just grab a random chunk of ore which happens to be in a roid (with the likely inefficiency received if you happen to be using the wrong crystal).alternatively you could introduce standard t1/t2 mining crystals that just give a basic/average bonus to any ore so that you can still strip mine belts if you wish grabbing random ores each cycle until all deposits are gone.admittedly mining specific ships may need to get their midslots adjusted to accommodate a survey scanner which may end up being mandatory on these ships but thats a fine tune idea for development."

7/12/2009,"just a few comments on this:1. i like the idea, i think it's great, i always have.2. ccp, while much more flexible now, is still a slave to it's art department. this means that anything that involves major art assets (like this is asking for) are only put into consideration as part of a major patch/expansion. that consideration is then looked at as to how important it is relative to everything else they want to do.3. wis is completely separate and not part of the overall pool of things to consider.4. as has been previously mentioned in here, in the past ccp has considered sov overhaul, mining revamp, lowsec revamp, bountyhunting/merc system, wormholes/t3, as more important major items than a pos overhaul.5. also as already mentioned, because this was raised with ccp already and did not have a conclusion, csm automatically discuss it again with ccp in our trip to iceland as part of a review of previous issues. it does not need to be raised again.6. part of this proposal was being looked at to be included in personal player habitats, that is still on the drawing board.so, from here all i can do is say that csm can question the importance of this overhaul in relation to all the other things ccp want to do and possibly bump it up the timeline of when it would be implemented. that will happen, it's just a question of where in the pipeline it ends up after that discussion."
7/12/2009,"it did go to the ccp meetings. it did go through the proper channels. unless you can prove that it didn't, i suggest that you stop making such outrageous claims. how about it did?that you need to talk to jade about. but really, the ccp guys knew about this proposal waaaay before the csm was even created(the current csm, not the original launch csm). how can a name change anything about that? nice argument, but flawed due to the fact that i created this character as an alt character quite a bit after i started eve. that was done. due to the oversight by the secretary, it wasn't taken to iceland, sadly."
7/12/2009,"ok, so when is this going to happen, in other words when will you be talking to ccp about the pos overhaul again... and while you at it you should explain to them the degree of frustration many of us are experiencing with the pos - especially when we see it being ignored year, after year, after year, after year. although csm does assure us that ""everything is ok"" and ""ccp knows."" perhaps a developer should address the four years of pent up frustration with a blog to which we can point, which we can examine, with which we can argue - you know in case they will treat us like idiots and say thing like ""we do not have art"" but we point to the l4 missions and poss there.. and say yes you do sir."
7/12/2009,"i don't blame you personally, but the csm as a whole, the only reason i direct anything towards you, is because at the time, you were the major csm member supporting this idea.and despite the fact that you feel this has been raised, the fact that people are still signing this post and the other 2 says that others on the forums agree with me, that this needs to go back to ccp and be if anything pushed again.my replies in bold"
7/12/2009,"cool, then you gave a thumbs up? i do understand this completely, and while i do understand it, i have to say, trinity, apoc, both got huge gfx and art changes, i don't think its asking to much for them to make new models for this, seeing as almost everything else in game has new models.i agree that saying we want this over wis doesn't change anything, i also understand that it has its own set of dev's and doesn't effect the rest of eve development. at this point, when considering priority, i think ccp might consider what the player base is asking for the most, and most consistently, sov being up this winter, this would make a nice summer expansion for next year, or even next winter. doesn't really matter when it happens, pos's have been the same since pos's came out for the most part, sure they added array's and the like but thats not an update but an addon. i myself and many others believe its time for pos's to get some love too. i myself disagree with that, as to many others, who feel that the idea was misrepresented, and not shown any consideration, or even studied properly.in addition, i haven't seen any other posts in the iceland meetings about this idea aside from funky pos idea, and that was a joke of a job done by the first csm. i will admit, i am pushing this idea very hard, but thats only because its the only great idea for pos revamp, and bar myself or someone else writing one better, ill support the one that fits the bill the best. what we want is meaningful pos reform, pos's that work well, are easy to use, don't look like junk in space. this idea fits the bill, so its pushed, propose a better one, or have ccp clue us in on what they are doing about the issue, and the subject can drop.pushing pos reform is something a majority of the players that use pos's is interested in. and anything you, or the current csm can do to push that cause will make a lot of pos manager's, and techs very happy. keep in mind that pos's even if they don't control sov after the winter expantion are still the logistical backbone of every major alliance, and any corp hoping to build t3 and profitable t2 items.something that effects the eve markets, and game in general so much, really should be considered a fairly high priority, just because it works, doesn't mean leave it as is, its 1/2 broken, and buged to death. time to step up and fix it."
7/12/2009,sign!
7/12/2009,"just to be clear (mostly for the guys quoting me), i completely agree that this is an important thing. pos's are unwieldy, ugly and a pita. i'm more than happy to push a pos revamp as part of the expansion post november, but other csm delegates may think other things are more important, that's their prerogative.personally i'm of the opinion that since ccp are already looking at sov & 0.0, a pos revamp would already be in the pipeline for an expansion/patch depending on the outcome of the sov/0.0 expansion. pushing this as an option for that revamp (in part or in whole) would be better timed now than it was previously."

7/12/2009,"define a criminal act? something the amarr empire declares is illegal? what if the insurance company does not agree with amarrian law? laws vary from empire to empire. various items are legal/illegal at different levels. something that concord declares is illegal? not all corporations have good standing with concord. this is not real life. law will not be universally agreed on. as for risk.. fighting armed gangs of criminals alone in deadspace seems a bit risky, no? so why should pve get insurance? and again: eve is not reality. insurance is a game mechanic, not a business. say that with me. game mechanic. game mechanic. game mechanic. you know, like shooting energy across space with an energy transfer and creating more than you sent, violating the laws of thermodynamics. or never needing fuel for subcapitals. or faster than light travel. or implants which somehow effect the integrity of your ship. or, oh, invincible npcs which have a 100% chance to kill whoever attacks you. people treat 'suicide ganking' like it's self destructing ones ship to make a kill.. logically, it should not be this way. it's only suicide because people whine so hard that they need invincible npcs who never fail to protect them.and you have invincible npcs which kill anyone who shoots you. and yet, you're still whining that the other guy (without the army of invincible npcs) is at the advantage. do you have any idea how pathetic that is? yeah, yeah, their ship is cheap, etc etc etc. i get it. but if you get killed in a matter of seconds to an insurance fraud fitted tech1 ship, methinks you've done something wrong. maybe, just maybe, when a gang of thoraxes warps into an asteroid belt, you should warp out? for a real life comparison, lets say you see a group of people screaming and waving guns. do you.. a) leave b) sit there and say ""there are laws here, nothing can go wrong. ^^"" for all the whines about realism, no one addresses how overpowered the police are when they arrive in seconds and never fail to punish the suspect.. so i'll echo someone else. remove insurance for concord, but make concord slower, escapable, fallible, destructable, etc. highsec is not meant to be safe, only a bit safer."
7/12/2009,"it doesn't matter either way to be honest, because some of us have figured out how to make high sec a very dangerous place for anyone who resides there with current high sec mechanics."
7/12/2009,"no. i only support the complete removal of insurance. leave as is or get rid of it completely, just to shake things up a little.but seriously, no."
7/12/2009,"i'm sorry, but the statement that ""the insurance company =/= concord"" is completely untrue. insurance is payed out by the company called ""secure commerce comission"", and that corporation is in fact a member of the faction called ""concord assembly"". just right click on an insurance evemail and select show info, and you will see that this is the case."
7/12/2009,"incident description:1. assume high-sec space, the attacker and the defender are corp mates.2. the attacker is actually a traitor/griefer and starts shooting the defenders ship.3. the attacker gets repair support from a different out-of-corp character in a logistic ship. 4. the defender can only attack the logistic ship by breaking the law and triggering concord punishment. (even though the support is involved in the fight by repairing the attacker)5. the defender loses.arguments:the problem, i would like to highlight, is that the supporter could only be attacked by clicking yes on the concord notification, and that means getting destroyed one way or the other. even in low security systems, still, you lose securing standings by attacking the supporter. although the support is directly involved into the fight by repairing the attacker, he does not have to commit to it (i.e. he cannot be attacked). the csm has stated before that they acknowledge the principle where the remote support must commit to the fight in the same way a shooting attacker does. without destroying the support ship first, there is realistically no other way such battle against a traitor can be won. to give a very real life example, this would be like banning you from shooting the driver of a car, where the front passenger is firing on you with a machinegun.i actually believe this incident should be considered an exploit since it can be compared to the following gank exploit used in the past:1. the attacker starts supporting (remote repairing, shield transferring ...) the defender.2. the attacker then shoots anything law protected (another player, station, mission gate ...). 3. the attacker gets destroyed by concord, yes, but...4. the defender being supported gets destroyed as well, since the support act of the attacker made him an instant enemy for concord.it is hard to understand that it used to work this way, but it does not work the other way around to the present day. in the latter case, supporting implies inheritance of the aggression flag to the supported, whereas in the first case, supporting does not imply inheritance of the aggression flag to the supporter. i am sorry but that just does not make sense. you probably think: ""hey, but they are corp mates, so no aggression is involved, that could be inherited in the first place!"" we'll come to that in possible solutions; as that is just a minor technical issue.what i would like to point out is that i accept corporate treason is a valid game tactics, following the sandbox paradigm. and of course the ceos or hros of corporations, be it high-sec or established in 0.0 need to screen new applications strictly. nonetheless, once the traitor shows his real face, he and his out-of-corp support should have to commit to the fight and face the consequences of that in the same way the attacker does.possible solutions:as it is today, every character supporting an attacker by any means (remote armor repair, shield transfer, energy transfer, tracking link etc.) inherits the aggression flag. now, i acknowledged further up that no aggression is involved when two corp mate fight; thus, some aggression needs to be introduced here, yet being suppressed by the fact that attacker and defender share a corporation. any other pilot inheriting that flag, would not be covered, and hence the aggression would be visible. of course, not in a way that concord would intervene.please do note that i wrote this knowing that my losses caused by an incident of this sort will not reimbursed, and i invested my time, which i paid for to play eve, to gain nothing at all, because my money was all in my ship. i know this issue is a high-sec/young corp problem but i will not engage in any discussions that the current system is fine, since that can only be argued by the current abusers of it. any feedback on where i missed possible exploits or downsides of the solution is highly welcome."
7/12/2009,"never fly more than you can afford to lose.as to the rest, get a better corp."
7/12/2009,"shooting corpmates is legal, and rring someone who is doing nothing wrong will not give you an aggression timer. i don't see any plausible fix to this mechanic. be more careful with your applicants."
7/12/2009,"i am sorry. i was talking about real money, not isk. by that i meant that i am losing my time here writting proposals to get the kind of responses like yours is. i would like to ask you to stay on topic and post feedback to the solution i suggested."
7/12/2009,then make a proposal that is less whine. deal with the fact that you got killed and pick better next time.
7/12/2009,"in my opinion, ankhra is pointing out a real flaw in rr mechanics. since he referred to that one exploit in his op, and given a number of past csm issues [1, 2, 3], we know that, in the past already, a lot of the rr logic needed to be adjusted in terms of aggression and other penalties.if you subtract the whining about his personal loss, i think it is valid to demand that the remote repper needs to commit to the fight in the way that he becomes shootable by the defending corp-mate.@hershel : if the attacker does nothing wrong by shooting his corp mate, no wrong is done either when - including the suggested fix - the repper starts flashing to the defender. if the defender is fine with being shot at, he will not exploit the fire clearance on the remote repper.and given that the remote repper actively enters into the fight (different to the exploit mentioned) this fix is not exploitable.i will take this to the csm assembly."
7/12/2009,i hope that the result from csm meeting will be positive to fix the issue where people counting in the dinamic of fight are pretending that their involment in fight is nonexistant and the reality is sadly different .
7/12/2009,"you... are a capsuleer, ""wired in"" to your ship and receiving neural warnings about it's status.notsat in your captains cabin with a beer and a good book relying on a noisy alarm.not supporting afk gameplay sorry."
7/12/2009,the exact reason it shouldn't be.
7/12/2009,"currently there is a technique being used in low sec to probe mission runners which circumvents the steps required to properly probe someone down. combat probes are supposed to be used to probe ships. this isnt the case. players are learning to use the directional (onboard) scanner to probe ships to within 1 au. why? because using the directional scanner does not send any alerts that a ship is being probed and it can be just as accurate as using combat probes themselves. once a ship has been probed with the directional scanner the player only needs a warpable 100% hit to warp to the target. this is the only reason combat probes are needed; and this for only around 6 seconds.what this means is that if i am mission-running in low sec with a neutral in the system even if i am alert, spamming the scan button every 30 to 60 seconds, my chances of detecting any combat probes in space are slim to none. i will say that i am usually aligned to station in case my mission does get busted. but my concern is once the mission is busted profitability hits the floor. in low sec there should definitely be more risk than high sec. but the new probing system has decreased the profit, or rather, the profitability of low sec substantially.ask yourself this: is using the directional scanner to probe players down an intended game mechanic? should the combat probes primary function be to simply spit out a bookmark? should a low sec mission runner be expected to spam a button and sort through results every 5 seconds to increase his chance of survivability in low sec? does this sound like intended game mechanics?this is not an issue of my ship being destroyed or being podded. i expect this to happen every now and again. however, this is an issue of being able not just to survive in low sec, but also make a better living there than in high sec. since the directional scanner is no longer effective for a mission runner my pve ship spends more time docked, which means zero earning potential in low sec. as an example, think of the following scenario:for a 45-minute mission in low sec and near a celestial object (since most missions occur near celestial bodies) and with even one neutral in the system it would require a mission runner to smash the scan button and go over results 12 * 45 = 540 times, in addition to the pilot having to micromanage his ship! i ask that any csm reading this brings this issue up to ccps attention.i have created a thread in eve general discussion forum. if you would like to read further click here.thanks for reading.edit: corrected grammatical errors."
7/12/2009,welcome to directional scanner operation 101. working as intended.
7/12/2009,"it bites, of course, but i'm not sure what you can really expect. if you can't secure the system, you're missioning in an insecure system. have fun with that."
7/12/2009,this has been functioning correctly for as long as i can remember. i believe it is working the way it was intended.
7/12/2009,login attempt #3 workedcurrently the minutes of meetings are not being released on-time.the csm can not function if the users submitting proposals and participating are not informed of the results of meetings in a timely fashion.this lag is creating problems.there needs to be a limit set on this delay so users can know when to expect minutes.if the securtary can't handle it then someone needs to be appointed who has the time for the job.
7/12/2009,"i'd like to see it be faster, but you can't expect hard limits on this - rl intervenes, ndas intervene, and random assorted crap comes up. if meissa is the bottleneck here then replacing him as secretary might be the solution, i don't know. but it's entirely believable that the problem is somewhere the csm has no control over."
7/12/2009,"believe it or not eve players often have lives. i know, silly isnt it how they think familys are more important than internet spaceship and real money actually matters."
7/12/2009,"perhaps using a freighter as an example was a bad idea. this proposal is not about freighters, it's about a game mechanic.if propulsion strength is not used, then a webber should affect inertia modifier instead.a poster above said that slower ships should turn quicker, that poster has forgotten the rules of momentum and inertia. also centrifugal forces within a structure. something that is a mile long, weighs 820 million kg and rotates at 120 degrees a second or 20rpm is going to create massives amount of force and use even more energy to do so.the webber in this case creates energy from nothing instead doing it's job which is slowing something down.edit: effectively what i am saying is, webbers should not affect alignment time in a beneficial way, whether it is the change of direction or acceleration up to speed."
7/12/2009,"we are getting off topic here, drop me an evemail sometime."
7/12/2009,/me gives this a little nudge to see who else is interested
7/12/2009,"supporting because you are on the right track, but you don't quite have the right idea. 10 seconds is not enough time to make the slightest bit of difference in stopping logoffskies. my idea, that i have been pushing for years now, is that when you try to log off, you ewarp to a safe spot and have to camp there for 2 minutes before your ship vanishes. you can choose to disconnect and leave the computer early if you want and feel safe, but your ship stays put for 2 minutes where it can be probed out and killed. if you don't want to take that chance, then sit there for the 2 minutes and fight back or try to run if someone finds you. i'm sick and tired of chicken **** hostiles just hitting ctrl-q the moment they realize that juicy ratter they thought they were going to gank has friends who are coming after him. or worse yet, entire chicken **** fleets logging off when the gates are bubbled and they know they are boned."
7/12/2009,this would be great >_>
7/12/2009,bah wrong meeting #
7/12/2009,bah someone pointed me here for #4... wrong meeting.
7/13/2009,"will definitely support.if nothing else the complete lack of any other assault frigates in almost any fleet i encounter, friendly or hostile, gives a strong hint that something is wrong."
7/13/2009,i want my rail-sniper-harpy to be able to alpha pods or at least get the top damage on them.
7/13/2009,"i'm new here, but all the vets seem to talk smack about pos functionality and this seems to address a lot of what i hear."
7/13/2009,good ideas deserve support.
7/13/2009,this is needed.
7/13/2009,"and you fail to see the point.it is about balance, not economic issues. i know how the economy functions very well, it is what i do. as i have pointed out many times already. for the complexities involved in manufacturing the stuff t2 should far surpass faction which can be made simply by running one (yes two) level 4 mission and supplying a handful of t1 ammo.and this can be done in the amount of time it takes to blitz one level 4 mission. the production of the ammo is instantaneous.economically i'm withdrawing from the argument there; t2 ammo is economically viable and indeed more profitable than faction depending on how you value your lp. i am only concerned with the stacking nerfs that make most t2 ammo utterly unusable.yeah, resurrecting a thread that the csms still refuse to take a look at."
7/13/2009,back to the top. though ccp really don't seem to care...
7/13/2009,"all this support...and none of you actually went to the ""center"" of a belt to look around?hint: set your overview to show all. there is a shoebox sized beacon floating in space, i'm guessing about 2000m away from you. select it, and look at and you'll see it's a real object.the same beacons are at the end of every accel gate, and at the warp in of every exploration site.while i agree that only substantial objects should decloak you... it's not a ""bug""."
7/13/2009,"bump for great justice!also, why not just go on an aggro fixing binge and fix everything thats currently wrong with aggro timers at present..."
7/13/2009,"like showing them, for example."
7/13/2009,not supported.
7/13/2009,"supported. some events currently do not refresh the aggression timer visually, but internally, the timer has been reset. this is just wrong. if the internal timer says i'm gonna be flagged for 15 minutes, my on-screen timer should reflect that.it says so clearly in the wiki too, in a big red box...i think this should be changed..."
7/13/2009,lol this actually explains an entire war.
7/13/2009,"topics are brought to the csm based on if csm members want to discuss them, nothing else. support is intended as a straw poll of the public on an issue - your support is only directly relevant to the actual csm election. a lot of the reason for the low support percentage is because of the assembly hall support mechanic - a thread with debate looks a whole lot like a thread with low support from the outside. i support this proposal wholeheartedly(to the point where i ran two csm campaigns with this at the centre of them), but this post will go onto the front-page stats as if i didn't."
7/13/2009,"anything that brings life back to the black ops...otherwise they're a rather useless ship, by most opinions."
7/13/2009,"supported.i have no problem with suicide ganking a ship in high sec, not my cup of tea. but i don't think they should get an insurance payout either."
7/13/2009,"criminal act as defined by the game mechanics. shooting a neutral target in high security space, for example"
7/13/2009,"just create the mechanics for players/corporations to handle insurance themselves.just create an item that acts as a policy that represents the object directly and that each person involved holds that automatically transfers a set amount of isk from the insured to the insurer on a time frame agreed upon by both parties and pays out upon destruction automatically as well. maybe even create additional values concerning losses in low sec, null sec, wh space, piracy, mining, pve'ing, etc. that effect the rates.the policy will always show the date created, the object insured and it's owner, any special conditions, cost, and payout. if the object is traded, sold, or destroyed an email is generated and sent to both parties describing the event and the policy either pays out and vanishes or just vanishes.the rest of the mechanics are in place to keep track of the insurance records of your clients by simply using the notes section in a players bio.file 13 the current insurance almost entirely. only keep the current insurance model for players that have the sp boost as to buffer there losses a bit."
7/13/2009,"your error is forgiven. no, the above idea is not a nerf of ninja-salvaging. all it would do is reduce the number of pilots who intrude on missions solely for the salvage--because they would have another option.... if you wanted to do it for the sweet, sweet tears, then nothing would change. the idea is for the core scan probes to pick up wrecks, not the directional scanner.the idea would actually increase the danger for pilots who turn in their missions and then go back to salvage. that's a disadvantage from the perspective of those pilots. :) it's an advantage from the ns perspective. i think in the balance the change is worth it for the potential to reduce mission intrusions (limiting it to those who harvest tears, primarily).--krum"
7/13/2009,sounds cool to me.
7/13/2009,"i suppose my objection here is that you all seem to be trying to balance the game for the vanishingly unlikely case of genuine combat between corpmates involving out-of-corp rr, instead of the normal state of affairs the other 99.99% of the time. your solution will cause more problems than it solves, even if it does solve this problem."
7/13/2009,"in corp fights between corp-mates can serve multiple genuine purpose as corpmates testing their fittings see if it works with different scenarios, logistic support is part of the game and each side either willingly or unwillingly high sec, low sec, 0.0 can fight according to different mechanics and conditions, every side either if they want to fight or not should have a chance to fight back that is fair to either side, but to use this non aggresion way with out of corp support that puts a player with a no win situation, basically he has a chance to fight back, because the mechanics at the moment in this situation puts the person using the tactic in a 100% win situation with the person being attacked with 0% to win and no way to fight back in a fair fight puts an imbalance and favors one side over the other and is simply wrong anyone who is against such change is most likely a person using the method...."
7/13/2009,no.pay attention or die.
7/13/2009,"it's not a ui designer's job to tell you how to play the game, that's the job of the forumers and occasionally the balance team and gms. it's a ui designer's job to make it easy for you to play the game however you want. this game isn't hardcore because the notification systems are crap, it's hardcore because you can actually lose your ship for real. trying to make this a pvp game by making a crap interface is unnecessary and foolish - game mechanics should be telling me how to play, not a godawful interface."
7/13/2009,this! or should is say tat! op even has a macro miner name! this is better than turning titans into monster trucks.
7/13/2009,"as much as i would love to see this change, and that i also find the current system a bit abusive, i doubt it will ever change in your favor. it will not for the simple reason that there's too many people benefiting from this at the moment.i seriously doubt that ccp actually intended us to spam the scan button every few seconds in order to find probes, but then ccp is not doing anything toc hange that, so it must not be that important to them.anyway, 1.5 is supposed to include some fixes to probing, and hopefully some tweaking as well. maybe they will do something about this..."
7/13/2009,the only thing that is wrong with the current system is the lag that keeps us from scanning you without getting aggro versus ccp again.
7/13/2009,"just to clear up some misconceptions you seem to be having.the directional scanner has always been used to find ships, probing is an additional step required if the target ship is in mission ds or safe spot.any ship at a celestial location. star/planet/moon/belt/station/gate can be found exclusivelly by d scanner and it has allways been this way.what has changed is that probes can be positioned arbitarilly in system, whereas previously they could only be dropped at celestials or bookmarks , which were difficult to produce near a random mission location.mission runners allways were scanned out with the d scanner before probing changes, but it was usually impossible to get a probe close first time due to lack of warpable point near the target.nowhere is it stated that probes ""must"" be used to find ships. probes are and allways were a last resort for finding ships ie. those in mission ds.scanning with the ds is nowhere near as accurate or easy as using probes.it takes considerable skill to get probes into the right location on the map just from dscanner results to within 1 au.as a hunter you must identify both the distance and direction of the target ship in ""space view"" from a known location.then you have to go to the system map and corelate the space view direction and range to a x,y,z position in the system map. in order to do this you need to reconcile the positions of the planets/gates etc with what you see in space view.the dropping of probes is an estimated guess at best and getting it right to within 1au would take considerable experience and skill.in fact in most cases i dought a range of less than 4au is used for the initial ping on the target.scanning out to a range just below the range to the closest celestial and listing results by range ( closest first ) will identify any probes at the top of the scanner results , enableing a much faster 5 sec if you want ping time.you will need to salvage / destroy wrecks in multi room missions for this to work.doing any kind of activity in low sec ( running / mining / rattin / exploration ) requires either evasion or force to deal with other players.considering that solo mining/rattin or anamoly expo will result 99% of the time in the loss of your ship , i think mission runners have it easy by comparison.it is always possible to go to another agent and get a different mission to do while the pirate gets bored waiting for you to return to your mission."
7/13/2009,"yes thats exactly what the d scanner is for finding other ships.combat probes spit out bookmarks or provide direct warps, yes thats what they have allways done even in previos incarnations.the results list thing is being attented to by the csm as you well know.all game mechs seem to be in order yes, whether they should be changed is debatable.find quiter low sec.if your running for a highly profitable agent expect competition.run missions in gangs for protection in numbers.the results list issue is allready on the csm list of thing to bring to ccp attention.as you have previously posted in that thread before the op of this post i guess you allready know this.so why this thread ?"
7/13/2009,if's funny how the only ones who have anything against this proposal are the ones benefiting from this loophole...
7/13/2009,"there is no loophole.dscanner remains unchanged.probes got a buff which makes them easier to use on specific locations of space however identified.i support the probes checkable issue for which there is a thread which doesnt insinuate issue with the dscanner.low sec is supposed to be dangerous, its not supposed to be 2x iskperhour highsec for whoever chooses to go there."
7/13/2009,this is how the d scanner is supposed to be used.please think about playing another game if you dislike pvp.
7/13/2009,"loophole? the directional scanner is clearly designed for identifying objects and ships in space, the direction, and distance... i mean directional is in the name. it has a distance modification tool right there in the interface. what loophole?"
7/13/2009,lol what kind of problems are being caused exactlyyou will survive waiting
7/13/2009,service with a smile.
7/13/2009,"the rule for the control tower is always one big problem. i have had one idea and i hope it's will be possible to use them without make a lot of modification in the game play.the idea it's the possibility to create some group of user. in this group you can put the character, or corporation or alliance.if you are in this group you have the full right and the module that use this rule.exemple :i create one group ""my farmer"" inside i put :farmer x ""character""farmer y ""character""corp the farmer ""corporation""in the control tower management. i use this group for the right on the corporate hangar.all people of this group have the full acces at this corporate hangar with a new space inside with the name of the group."
7/13/2009,"this isn't the only thing they need to do with poses(god knows...), but something in this vein would be a useful part of the change. supported."
7/13/2009,yes please make it more simple. i support this
7/13/2009,"i would really like it if the texture and model for the combat version of each races command ship had its texture and model changed to resemble that of the teir 2 version of the battlecruiser. i know there are many out there that agree with me, so let's see what kind of support we can get in here."
7/13/2009,"um no, make a t2 tier 2 instead thanks"
7/13/2009,"and what do you suggest as a role for this new possible tech 2 ship? the problem is, is that there is no new real possible role imo."
7/13/2009,"i can think of half a dozen that have been proposed over the years, and that's just what i've seen. besides, what you propose is unnecessary, and you can't really find a tier/type matchup. for gallente, the fleet would be tier 2(eos and myrmidon are drone boats), for caldari the field would be tier 2(drake and nighthawk are missile boats), and amarr/minmatar have no obvious matchup(damnation/claymore pretty much have to be tier 1, but absolution/sleipnir are also closer to the tier 1 than the tier 2). besides, this would be a fairly noticeable mechanical change too - the 5-10 mil difference is actually noticeable, unlike the covops changes a while back. not supported."
7/13/2009,"well, surprisingly the game has changed a bit over the years, so why don't you recall what these were as they may not be applicable anymore.also, how is the absolution and sleipnir closer to teir 1 than teir 2? nanocane resembles the sleipnir and the absolution is extremely similiar to the harbinger."
7/13/2009,"personally i think having a concord ships spawning for every entity that is hit with a smartbomb hits etc to be a waste of time. in fact having concord ships is a waste of time.replace them with the faction navy and relegate concord to station sweeping. make the appropriate storyline changes etc. instead of having 10,000 ships appear to instantly blast someone, have the faction navy appear gradually (might be easier on servers too). let ships able to warp away from non-scrambling faction navy ships. let them suicide bomb, in exchange for voiding their insurance, giving them a criminal counter and standing hit. give the players a change to be the police."
7/13/2009,all in favor of a free for all on nubs and carebares support this thread
7/13/2009,voiding my ship insurance won't matter if i don't lose my ship. you're trying to turn concord into a set of gate guns. not supported.
7/13/2009,"let the gank begin pirates. i can smell rocket fuel in every system with that change. ...let them gradually appear.. mwuahah, i can see a big flaw there.i can't see how i can support this even if the insurrance is voided. unless they void the insurrance and have to pay for the loss of the other ship they ganked..then yeah sure.afaik, thats what the ""police"" and justice do anywy, they charge you for whatever you destroyed."
7/13/2009,"i can see it happen as long as the faction navy always has time to ""prepare"" for your arrival on the gates and get sleeper ai. hell, give them sleeper guns as well (kidding). oh, and they warp after you. like concord, i think they should be unbeatable, but they'll be unbeatable in that whenever you kill a number of their ships, a bigger number warps in to reinforce the defense party. this happens continuously until the pirate or pirate gang can no longer deal with the faction police, which would probably always happen after the second wave of ships warps in (make it something like 10 battleships or mix it up i don't care). also, give the faction fleets web and ewar ships. you'd have to be really ****ing dedicated to get 2 or 3 jumps into high sec if faction navies got a big buff."
7/13/2009,i think not
7/13/2009,"hersch, you cant avoid the faction navy with a gcc long enough to wait it out:unless you fancy warping through safes until downtime hits."
7/13/2009,so the proposal is basically to eliminate insurance (no biggie) and also to eliminate high sec. i predict a bit of resistance to the latter.
7/13/2009,"downtime? you warp to a safe or two to wait out the timer and then dock. wait 15 minutes for the gcc to clear, and you're good to go. it's a bit more annoying than lowsec, but hardly lethal."
7/13/2009,"op was complaining about freighters breaking through gate camps. that trick only works if nobody puts a point on the freighter and if nobody kills the webber. if your gate camp can't do one of those two things, you deserve to get bypassed. if the freighter was capable of doing this stuff solo, then i'd agree that there was a problem, and be all over trying to get it fixed. but the thing is, it can't. and given the practical limits on webbing freighters into warp, i don't believe there are any problems with the mechanic. it's like they're encouraging team play in a mmo."
7/13/2009,"webs already affect the agility.and it takes exactly the same time to warp if you're webbed all the time (webbed before you started aligning).the positive effect comes in when you align at normal agility for the first couple seconds, easily reaching about 10-20% of your max speed, and you are webbed then.this means that for example if a freighter max speed is 100 m/s (just for easier calculations).it starts aligning and reaches lets say 15m/s after first 3 seconds.now it is double webbed first web takes the max speed down to 40 m/s, second web decreases it further to about 20 m/s, but you're still at 15 m/s so you have just reached your 75% of max speed - hence you warp.the problem in here is that the max speed value reduction is instant and the actual speed drops over time.to fix the insta warp mechanic, the web max speed change would have to be over time not instant, but that would make webs even weaker than they are now."
7/13/2009,"the title of this topic will no doubt make many curious and i don't doubt there will be a debate about this, however i'm proposing a way to give armor a passive regenerative trait like shields.i'm proposing, regenerative ablative armor plating, which has its basis in both sci-fi and real life. currently as things stand the main difference between armor and shield tanking is that shield tanking, you have your primary defense, after thats gone you have two layers of buffer to get out if you need to which can be setup passively. on the flip side with armor tanking you have one layer of buffer before you get to your primary defense and when its gone you have a very small buffer to get out at that point and currently there is no means for a true passive defense with it. now ablative armor works through a process of ablation (ablation is defined as the removal of material from the surface of an object by vaporization, chipping, or other erosive processes.) and is currently used in a few military applications as well as in the space program. its extremely useful although can be very heavy in various applications making speed and maneuvering difficult. so it is something that can be done and is being done currently, the only part that makes this more sci-fi is that currently we do not have the technology to make it regenerative (think of it working like skin cells, as old ones fall away from the body, the body regenerates more to replace the ones lost only its fullerene *an allotrope of carbon even more durable than diamond* armor), however thousands of years into the future that is eve i'm sure we would have a way to make it work.now stepping away from the real life and into game terms, this module would allow armor to ""recharge"" like shields along with a low resistance boost but would be off-set by increasing the weight and lowering the agility of this ship equiped with it. doing it this way requires an additional skill to train and an equiped module to boot. its not a natural regen like shields are. the balance with this comes with the weight increase and the agility decrease, making it easier to hit in the same way shield boosting items increase signature radius, plus the regen rate would be around 66-75% of what the max regen of shields would be with maxed out skills.for example;regenerative ablative armor i - this module gives a passive repair trait similar to shields to armor plating and a low boost to armor resistances at the expense of increased mass and lowered agility (+5% to all armor resists and gives ""recharge"" rate to armor to a max of 2/3 to 3/4 of what shield regen would be with maxed out skills; +10% mass increase and -10% agility)can only fit one per ship*uses new skill - regenerative armor systems +5% ""recharge"" rate per lvl *this allows a passive recharge rate to armor similar to shields, and has pluses and minuses in line with shields (with an armor based twist). allowing armor tankers the same benefits as shield tankers in being able to have both true active and true passive tanks. along with this we can include modules that help with armor repairing and boosting in the same way that shields have.for example;ablative armor matrix i - increases armor repair rate while lowering maximum armor cap. +25% repair rate, -15% armor hp *based off of shield flux coil iablative armor re-enforcement i - diverts power from the ships engines to increase the armor repair rate. +20% repair rate, -35% velocity *based off of shield power relay iablative armor accelerator i - improves repair armor repair rate. +10% repair rate. *based off of shield recharger ii want to open the floor for people to share there opinions and any other ideas to go along with this, i've spent a few years looking into this and thought it was time to bring it up and see what people think, and maybe have something new brought to this wonderful playground that is eve."
7/13/2009,actually if the armor repair modules are based on nanites you don't even need to stretch the technology very far. it would just need a change that as a base line all ships have an x-factor armor regeneration like shields. the active armor boosting would then be an increasing multiplicative effect while actively tanking.then you could make other modules like you suggest that parallel the passive shield tanking for armor tanking.**************for the other issue that you mention where you have for shield tanking and 2 layers after (tanking) layer. there should just be an option for shields -> armor -> structure or armor -> (emergency shielding) -> structure. let us choose which gets used first armor or shields.
7/13/2009,"doesn't make fluff sense(armor gets repaired when you repair it, not just from sitting still), doesn't make gameplay sense, and it'll never be an interesting fitting option. not supported."
7/13/2009,"in case you didn't notice cause it looks like you didn't take something very important.armor tanker : use med for ewar or something that could help him in pvp and low for defenseshield tanker : use med for defense so that leaves less ewar which means less effective in pvp... possible but very poor.that should be a good balance anyway so this idea is not supported. armor tanking shouldn't regen imo because of that.and in other words, since its that case, let shield resist passively only since there numbers are already low anyway. if you ask me ccp should increase shield defence since shield tankers cant use ewar effectively...of course not with every setup or ship ...im awarre of that."
7/13/2009,"i realize this sounds like a skewed idea at first...but take a look at ccps own stance on shields.we don't have big fancy energy bubbles being powered by the capacitor.we have big nasty clouds of nanobots ""taking one for the team"".the passive regeneration on shields is the capacitor being channeled without your attention, into replenishing that cloud.all passive armor would have to do, is casually recharge the nanobots that wander your hull repairing it when you use active reppers."
7/13/2009,not supported. in general it is easier to get higher resists on armor than on shields. that compensates for the missing recharge.your suggestion would break that balance.
7/13/2009,"i'm sure you can make it work with the eve fiction, but i would like to keep shields and armor clearly different. the only reason for this is, that i would like to have clearly different styles of gameplay available. you idea adds more options in a way, but at the same time you water down existing differences, since you just copy existing mechanics. there might be rl reaons for doing this, but i don't put much value on this type or argumentation. this is a game and it would be nice, if these things are mainly considered from gameplay perspective. i'm not claiming this couldn't be balanced right or would ruin the game, but like different weapon systems, shields and armor should clearly work in different ways just for gameplay reasons."
7/13/2009,and we should not forget shield recharge is working on armor tanks aswell.there are even some shield tanked setups for e.g. myrm which easily can compete with the active armor tank you can get on it. (700+ dps)
7/13/2009,wtf? armor tanking is already superior to shield tank and you ask to boost it even more?
7/13/2009,that article is very badly written imho and as far as i can tell written by one of the isd members who has more imagination than sense for realism.on the op:i think this could be interesting but a possibility of horrendously overpowering armor buffer tanks come looking around the corner with this implementation so no support.

7/13/2009,"ccp has done alot to buff the recon/cloaky fleets but they left out the ability for high leadership skill folks to have a good impact on these fleets. i guess technically you could sneak a vulture deep into someone's backyard to support a stealth fleet...but you'd be awfully silly to do so.my proposal is to commission a new command ship, the long range reconnaisance command ship (lurks). lightly tanked, with light offensive power and the ability to fit a covops cloak ii the lrrcs can fit up to two gang mods.additionally the lrrcs can be equipped with a new module.1.) the command link extender. this high slot module allows the lrrcs equipped with it to extend its command bonuses a number of jumps equal to the lrrcs pilot's command ship skill level. the bonuses will only effect one other system which is determined by the highest sensor strength gang ship outside of the lrrcs piot's system but within the cle range. up to 3 command link extenders can be fitted to a lrrcs.the lrrcs would utilize the model of the tier 1 battle cruiser. one of the other two cs would be redesignated in the tier 2 bc model.oh! and, no, i'm not suggesting the gang mods should be abe to be used while cloaked. traditional, not cloaked, not warping rules pertain."
7/13/2009,"tldr: please put republic fleet target painters into minmatar lp stores.reasoning:minmatar lp stores are sadly lacking in decent modules. empire factions tend to have a selection of ""best of breed"" modules in their respective lp stores. amarr has armor tanking modules like hardeners and reppers to match the best faction (non-deadspace or officer) ones like sansha and blood. gallente have sensor boosters and tracking computers to match shadow serpentis, and they also have arguably the best webber, the gallente navy stasis web. caldari has shield mods that match dread guristas. minmatar have speed mods that match domination. each empire faction also has (naturally) the best version of their ""primary"" weapons system. amarr = lasers, gallente = hybrids, caldari = missiles, minmatar = projectiles.speed mods haven't exactly been popular recently with the, errr, rebalancing, so while republic fleet overdrives, afterburners and microwarpdrives are still best of breed, eg the same as domination ones, they're a very low demand item. domination drops seem to be sufficient to satisfy demand and keep prices low enough to make buying these items with loyalty points unappealing for all but hardcore minmatar roleplayers. target painters had long been the lolfit ew. with the recent missile changes, they're now actually useful, or at least, more useful in some situations than other potential midslot items. they're far from overpowered, but at least there's a niche for them. however, the best named painter (pwnage) has two-thirds the cap use and cpu requirement of the t2 painter for the exact same stats. the only reason that there's demand for a t2 painter is for ships where fitting isn't an issue and because pwnage drops are pretty rare hence quite pricy.since target painting is considered the minmatar ew, would it not be logical to give minmatar lp stores a faction painter? the stats needn't be excessive to ensure there's demand. maybe a 40% or 42.5% signature bonus compared to a 37.5% bonus for t2."

7/13/2009,read his proposla carefully.his 'scanner' s not omniscient and hence nothing like local.
7/13/2009,"supported for setting local to recent speakers mode and proposing a creative improvement to scanning. suggestion - in addition to scanning improvements, the ability to see outside a station from inside a station is also probably needed to accompany the change to local."
7/13/2009,"this seems like a good idea you have there but i would still like to see where are they when they enter the system. with todays technology anyway like a sonar ie, you have a pretty good idea where the ""object"" is. if that little feature can be implemented on top of yours, you got my vote on this one."
7/13/2009,"currently, the local channel serves the following purposes:- tells you who is in the system with you- tells you the standing and criminal flag status of everyone- allows everybody in the same system to communicate instantly- watch for incoming threats (based on standing and criminal flag status)- watch for incoming friendliesnow if we compare this with the proposed solution:- tells you who is in the system with you : no- tells you the standing and criminal flag status of everyone: no- allows everybody in the same system to communicate instantly: yes- watch for incoming threats (based on standing and criminal flag status): no- watch for incoming friendlies: nothe proposed system will only give you a rough idea on the number of pilots in a system, but in order to find more information, you will need to dock in each station (if any) to see who is docked, and use combat scanner probes + directional scanner to find who is in space and what their standing is. because this system would be too dependent on having a prober at all times in the system with you, i'm strongly against it. that would just make it way too easy for pirate gangs to surprise targets in the system without them ever knowing they were even in the system.for the ones who think that knowing who is in local is not realistic, well put it this way: every ship had to jump through a stargate to get to the system unless they jumped in using a cyno field. that means the stargate would have logs of everybody who jumped in and jumped out, logs which anyone entering the system could access.there is no stargate in wormhole space, so it makes sense that you can't see anyone in the local communication channel until they speak, since there's no logs to know who jumped in and who jumped out.they could ships that used a cyno field to jump in a system not appear in local until they break silence, but anything more than that would break the game in my opinion.so basically:- if you used a stargate to go in a system, you will appear in local automatically (no change).- if you used a cynosural field to jump in a system, you will only appear in local if you break silence.- if you're in a wormhole (no stargate), you will only appear in local if you break silence (no change)."

7/14/2009,"as it stands, the npcs guarding the plexes in fw are severely unbalanced.on the minnie/amarr front, i can speedtank all amarr plexes in a t1 ship because almost all amarr ships are turret based, and they just can't hit anything. meanwhile, the minmatar spawns (especially the elites) deal heavy damage with their torps and targetpainter combo and are near impossible to tank.on the gallente/caldari front, the gallente ships suck, most of them have blasters and are easily kited and kept out of range, plus they suffer from the same hitting problems as the amarr turret ships. caldari npcs have missiles which are a lot harder to speedtank, but the worst part is their unbalanced jamming, they can easily permajam several people at once, and since npc ewar doesnt take sensor strength into account there is no way to defend against them.with the fw overhaul coming up, ccp should put the fw npcs into review as well."

7/14/2009,"totally disagree.for a few year old vets with 2 accounts both having marauders grinding lvl 4 missions it might be a matter of: should i spend 45mill extra on rigs or not?for however another rather large portion of the player base. the more casually orientated crowd. the question is instead: should i spend 45mill... ow wait, don't actually have that much money to waste. nvm.for us the current rigging system does not give options. in fact it takes about every single choice i have away. because i can't use ccc rigs i have to fill my med slots with cap recharges to become cap-stable. because i can't use damage rigs i have to fill my low slots with heat sinks or gyrostabs to deal ganky damage.i would love access to ccc rigs for a decent price so that when fitting my bc i can actually make the choice if i want to use ccc rigs so i can free a med slot for an afterburner, or maybe a tracking computer. wait, even a web could work. or i could decide for some armor rigs so i can free up a low-slot and maybe fit a heatsink or keep as it is and benefit from an increased tank. maybe i'll even go for some weapon rigs to increase my optimal or my damage.you say this system removes choice? i say it adds hundreds.the only thing that will come from the change you're suggesting is that richer players will have even more advantages over those that do not spend 16 hours a day grinding isk.what this patch will do is introduce a more reasonable spending limit on ships. it will make it so that you can only spend 10mill on a frigate before it reaches around it's max performance.exactly the same as you can only have so many sps dedicated to flying frigates before it reaches it's max performance.this patch will not remove choices. it will add tons of choices. instead of wondering only about what modules to fit you also have to wonder about rigs and how the 2 interact.all this patch will do is even out the playing field so that newer poorer players can also enjoy flying rigged drakes into lvl 4 missions. so that they also get the joy of flying those 6km/s frigates in pvp.and for the older richer players it will only make it so that they'll have to spend less time grinding isk and can spend more time doing what they enjoy because the rigs they buy are cheaper.everybody wins save for the players that win fights not by skill, intelligence or tactics but instead by spending insane amounts of isk on their ships."

7/14/2009,"actually, the option i gave provides a chance for the less wealthy to close the gap without making everyone equal. my system essentially implements meta levels to the system rather than sizes that skew cost. want better performance, fine, pay for it, want to just boost your ship a bit, fine too, but don't cheapen the work of some for the sake of others.i have never understood this casual player arguement. i'm a casual player. i don't expect to be as wealthy as some mom's basement dweller who plays eve 16 hrs a day. what ****es me off is people who want the easy road to life b/c they can't figure out how to make things work faster. half the nay arguments in this thread remind me of a thread a while back about 0.0 income from ratting. people were constantly saying 20-30 mil an hr is the limit, yet i could go out there in a standard t2 hac with a hauler on standby in a station and pull in much closer to 60 mil an hr. is it my fault for understanding how to utilize my time to the full benefit over someone who'd rather go out there and do it the wrong way?i've got alts in newer corps, i've got spies in alliances. the truth is, the guys who complain about being causal players are really the guys who are a) too young to know better (people who prolly shouldn't be in a battle cruiser less not a rigged ship) or b) people to stupid or lazy to play this game effectively."

7/14/2009,"i see where you're coming from.but imho you're coming from the totally wrong direction.i'm not saying that your tiered rigs are a bad idea. in fact had it not been a replacement for the sized rigs idea i would have definitely supported it.but what exactly is wrong with the sized rigs idea? what's so bad about giving poorer players the option to fly the same quality frigates as you can?making 60mill an hour you can still field rigged t2 equipped bs for pvp while i can not as they're simply way too expensive. you can still field rigged t2 command ships which i can't. maybe you can even field carriers or even better, i don't know. i sure can't.what's so horribly wrong with allowing me to field the same quality frigate as you can? why does your frigate have to be better just because you have found a perfect way to rat? it's not my fault either that i don't have access to your method of ratting.i don't want the easy way. i don't want t2 fit rigged sleipnirs appearing instead of reapers when i dock in my pod.i just don't want to have to own a marauder, hac, cs or whatever and grind rats, missions or whatever to be able to field a competitive frigate! i want to be able to field a good ship in pvp after 2-3 months of playing. not just throw-away ships for me to 'learn' in until i manage your 60mill/hr technique after 2 years of playing before i can field a well fit frigate!notice how i said frigate every time. i totally agree that it's not fair that those who go around wasting time and following cookie cutters not earn the same as people who went out and managed to get real information and tactics first hand and as such should not be able to fit and field expensive ships such as bs, cs, dreads, carriers etc.but we're talking about frigates and cruisers here. every time i hear pro pvpers talking about newbies they say that you can join from day 1 in a tackling frigate helping out. but now that this patch is on the horizon enabling those very same newbies to field more properly fit frigates that can potentially match those of more experienced players we get complaints.please explain: what is wrong with somebody that's at the stage he's doing lvl 3 missions in a bc is able to field a rigged frigate in pvp? and i'm not talking about any kind of diminished meta rigs, i'm talking about full blown rigs.for the coming months i won't be able to field properly fit hacs, bs, recons etc. and probably for the coming year cs, carriers and/or dreads. but i'd like to be able to field a properly fit and rigged frigate by now....."

7/14/2009,"you didn't even mention the worst of the bunch - the blood ships. i want them to be awesome, but they're just not. here's how i think the five factions lay out:sanshas: perfect as-is. needs no changes. serpentis: just fine. needs no changes. angels: bonuses are okay, but ships are a bit weak. needs a small buff of some variety(extra turrets, increased speed/reduced mass, something)guristas: the rattlesnake is just a raven with a crappy third bonus nobody uses, and it's basically the same for the gila and worm. i'd like to see these changed into ships with a role. ecm/blaster or maybe ecm/rail seems a natural option to me - give dps, ecm strength, and either range or tracking. blood: worst of the bunch. three bonuses with absolutely nothing in common. i don't think it's actually possible to make a coherent ship out of the blood vessels these days. it's hard to fix this while keeping true to the blood faction - the best i can come up with is to make the ship's base bonus be that it uses the old rules for nossing, where relative cap levels don't matter. expensive faction ships can be awesome like that without wrecking the game, and it gives you a reason to fit a couple nos on your ship and fill the rest with lasery death. oh yeah, and change the laser bonus away from cap use and to dps, maybe even rof, to make nos-users even happier. leave the web bonus, or maybe improve upon it(to +30%/level, say). you take the bhaalgorn from being a billion-isk neuting support ship that can't actually fight to being a ship that does battleship dps, steals 20 or 30 cap a second under the old rules, and can hold enemies down to leech off of and kill at range. with these changes, i think the blood and gurista failboats become viable solo ships, while keeping a role in smaller gangs as well. obviously, no faction bs is ever going to do well in fleet combat, but i think that these would make them work a whole lot better at the roles where they can actually be used reasonably. but yeah, supporting some kind of change for sure."

7/14/2009,"i agree with your assumption that the case is less likely (though hardly 0.01%) to happen than normal in-corp fights. does that mean we have to ignore the fact? does that mean that all of us have to count on the possibility, that any corp member can use out-of-corp rr to put us in a no win situation? you are suggesting to ignore this ""unlikely incident"" in favor of what? what is in your opinion worth fixing more in the 99.99% cases, as you sate, than what i proposed in the 0.01% deparment?i cannot acknowledge your assumption that solving the problem will cause more problems of its own unless you can prove that statement. or perhaps you would not mind giving any example of a problem the solution would have caused were it implemented."
7/14/2009,we are not discussing my ship loss but my proposal to change game mechanics.
7/14/2009,"exlegion confirmed here that it is indeed ""easy"" to survive missioning in lowsec without pressing the scan button 12 times per minute. i think we can safely assume this issue is settled. thank you all for your time and patience."
7/14/2009,"the loophole that lets you bypass the time it would take to localize a target using only combat probes so the target can't see you coming as you are narrowing the strength of the probes to get a lock.the loophole that allows you to pretty much drop 4 probes dead on a target using the directional scanner and get a 100% hit almost instantly.that loophole.i know it's proper usage of the current game mechanics, but that's the problem; it's pretty much rendering the whole scanner probe concept useless. the mini-game that probing is has no point if all you use it for, is to get a warpable bookmark, and that you don't actually have to search for the target. what i'm saying is that probing is supposed to be hard, and it's supposed to take some time. probing has never been supposed to be used like a radar would be used, but when used in combination with the directional scanner, that's exactly what it becomes.as for lowsec space supposed to be dangerous, well... if you go back several years when eve first started, a safe spot was truly a safe spot and knowing how to find someone in space was actually much more work. it's only afterward that this changed, so it could change again.it's just become way too easy to get a scan lock on an unsuspecting target now with the way the probing system and directional scanner work. something has to change. it just has to. it's not balanced at all at the moment.like most people, i like pvp but only if i can have some level of control over it. having little to no way to see in advance that you're about to be jumped by someone really sucks. even if you spam that directional scanner scan button every second, you still won't see probes coming when they are used that way. what the hell can you do against this? nothing. right now, this system is being abused a bit too much.you have to remember that this is first and foremost a game, and a game is meant to be fun to play. when only one side is having all the fun (referring to probe gankers) and pretty much dictates how the game is played, there's no fun anymore.before the probing mechanics were implemented, lowsec and nullsec was very interesting, even for the ones who were more casual players or wanted to do more than just pvping.in case you wonder how i can say all this when my character is so young, well, lookup ehxo in the game, that used to be my character and i sold it a few years ago. i played eve when it first started (for a little more than 1 year), starting in open beta, and it was a whole different ballgame back then. you had no probing then, and you only had some basic form of the directional scanner. for some reason, life in lowsec was a lot more fun in some aspect because of it. i was also in a pirate corp (m3g4), and i can tell you it was a lot harder to be a pirate back then than it is today.anyway, all i'm saying is that the current way scanning has been implemented needs to be revised so that it's a bit more balanced. the prey has to have some way to detect the predator before it strikes. if then the predator outsmarts or outplays the prey, so be it, but the prey should still have a chance.just look at nature as an example: if a cat always had a 100% chance of killing a mouse whenever it wants to, there would just be a lot of fat cats around, and no mice left."
7/14/2009,"that's just silly man. anyone what hasn't been using the directional scanner to assist with probing, old probes or new probes, has been self-nerfing. the directional scanner has always been one of the least understood tools in the game by the masses, and one of the most powerful tools of the seasoned pilots. it took me about a year of flying to figure out exactly how useful the scanner could be and in how many different situations i could use it. for those of you who seem to be just figuring out what that scanner thing is for: congratulations! welcome to the next level of piloting. yes, it's always been this way and yes, you've been missing out before now. hell, i've found ships before using only the directional scanner when i was fortunate enough to end up close enough to do so (like just-off-the-grid gate safes)."
7/14/2009,"i never said the directional scanner was not used the way it was intended, i'm saying that with the addition of combat scanner probes on top of it, it's become too good of a tool. either do one, or the other, but don't do both. that is silly.see the last quote in my previous post for more arguments..."
7/14/2009,"myra2007,i expect players like you to try and discredit players whose style of play you dont agree with or even dislike. but i will ask you to stop slandering me, or try and keep it to a minimum at least. my problem isnt dying in low sec. i expect to die in low sec. the problem is profitability in low sec. with the current mechanics im having to press a button and go over results every 5 seconds so that my mission deadspace doesnt get intruded on. yes, i align. yes, i drop cans to uncloak intruders. i believe i mention this in the op above. did you even read it? my point is that once my mission is busted the ball is on the pirates courtside. choosing to spam a button every 5 seconds is stupidity! you know it. but you dont want this changed because you benefit from this. i dont expect you to change your mind, but to the rest of the readers what i say is the following:1. unless youre spamming the scan button and reading results every 5 seconds you will miss combat probes scanning you down.2. once your mission is busted in low sec there are procedures that can still offer you some safety. but once your mission is busted expect to make zero isk for quite a while. nothing short from your own blob will change this.3. at the moment there is no compromise in low sec. if you choose to be safe in low sec expect to make very low isk. no other options on the slider. thats it.before the probe changes alert players at least had a chance to pick up combat probes on the directional scanner that would allow them to save their mission deadspaces. protecting your deadspace makes the difference whether you will be successful in low sec or not."
7/14/2009,"i just don't agree with you. i'm not primarily a pvp pilot, but i fly almost exclusively outside of empire spce with my corp mates. we're not in an alliance, so we get hunted pretty consistently by alliances, roving gangs, etc. we have none of the epic, game-breaking problems that are being discussed here. supplimenting scan probes with good positioning via the directional scanner was standard practice 2 years ago with the old probes, and it's still standard practice now. how is it that my corp mates and i don't have these problems? i assure you that the probes and directional scanners don't work any differently when we are hunted than when others are hunted. if the tools are the same it must be the technique.i commend the mission runners who have ventured out of high sec. good for them! i seriously hope they continue the journey. i highly advise them to hook up with a corp that knows how to survive outside of high-sec and can teach them the ropes. this isn't a mechanics issue, this is a knowledge and skills issue."
7/14/2009,"and this is relevant because ...? the fact you haven't had those issues may mean you're just being lucky so far.exactly, it was standard practice 2 years ago. probing has been changed a lot since, but the directional scanner has not. it was fine then, it's not anymore.then please ho mighty player, show us how it should be done! if you have a technique we don't know, why not share it instead of sending us away like that? is there a trick we don't know or what? if so, what is it?"
7/14/2009,"not supportedscanning is only one of the ways mission runners can avoid losing ships in missions. local, scouts, aligning your ship to get out, multi gate missions, dropping a can, leaving a scout on your in gate, ss, and cloaks all combine to make you very safe if you choose to do so.you have the option given to you by ccp if you wish to be 100% safe of taking less reward and running missions in high sec."
7/14/2009,"i'm not trying to be high and mighty, i'm trying to help. when we take a new member into our corp it takes a few weeks to a few months for them to really get a grip on the methods of operation that keep ships alive in hostile space (far less time than it originally took me to learn). that's one of the things i love about this game, the depth of the learning that is sometimes neccessary to master a nuance. it's also one of the reasons i speak out against suggestions to put training wheels on our spaceships. i don't want eve easy-fied; that would get boring fast. i didn't learn to stay alive in hostile systems from a forum, i learned by flying with a good group of pilots in hostile space and learning from them. i can't teach it on a forum... theory vs. application. this is why i recommended in my last post that the pilots who are having trouble with this join a good corp that is already successful in low-sec or 0.0 operations. it's the way to learn."
7/14/2009,"santiago,my concern isn't just staying alive in low sec. i've already said it numerous times but we keep going in circles. i not only want to extend my survivability in low sec. i want to profit in low sec!yes, i can align and warp out when my mission is probed down.yes, i can drop cans to detect pirates once my mission is probed down.yes, i can remain docked, or go fight the pirates by bringing a bigger blob.yes, i can wait until they leave by staying neatly docked up.but what can i do in order to protect my mission deadspace location from being discovered by players using d-scan to probe me? yes, i can dock every time a neutral is in the area. yes, i can fight them, yes, i can do other things. but i'm still not making isk with my ship docked up because there is a neutral in the system and i don't know if he's scanning me or not. yes! this has happened to me a few times already, twice last week alone!so please, tell me how i can remain profitable with even one neutral in the system?"

7/14/2009,"you're not helping at all so far. you still haven't answered my questions. what are the techniques you're using that make you quasi impervious to probe gankers? keeping it a secret just because you had to learn it the hard way is extremely selfish on your part. you keep saying no, that you don't need it because you know how to counter this issue, but you don't say how you do it. how is this a valid argument?"
7/14/2009,"thanks, marlona sky. it's comforting to see you recognize there is a problem, even if we may not have a solution for it. it's certainly a break from the usual spam of ""stop being lazy!1!"", ""greedy carebear!1!"", ""go back to hi sec lulz!1!"".anyway, it's nice to see some people recognize and understand what it is i'm trying to say, even though some times i'm not that clear i admit :)."

7/14/2009,"well the radar thingie is an interesting aproach.together with a removal of local it could boost pvp to a new dimension.now recon ships would become a realy usefull toy, as you need to send out active elekromagnetic waves to scan for threads it also means you are detectable to that threads, visa versa if one doesnt send out active waves he doesnt know whats arround him but makes him undetectable at long ranges (out of visible).i could imagine a system like this:-close range visual (up to 500km)everything like it is now using just optical sensors and passive detectors detecting the normal electromagnetical and infrared pollution an active ship gives away- med range (500-5000km)no passive detection of ships without special ir or em sensor banks (could be standard build ins for recons as bonus other with extra modules)- long range (5000km-14au)active sensoring needed for scanning the area what means if you dont send out active waves you are blind to the spot except for the signals that are send out from other ships if they use active scanners.now what you get at long ranges is different for 2 situations:-passive the ship detects radiation from other ships but all you get is the direction the strenght and the type (ladar, radar etc for the races) but no distance, strenght isnt an indicator as different ships / setups have different senosr strenght-active you get a good indication of the sourrounding, meaning u get a direction and distance and also a massindex from the other ships, but no race as long as they dont send active signals out them self.extra:- recon ship passive ability to pin down enemy ships when they send active waves.u need 2 recons in an angle greater then 5<U+FFFD> of the outgoing waves to locate the other ship passive (no probes) the greater the angle towards 120-130<U+FFFD> is the more acurate the triometric scan will be greater then 120<U+FFFD> it will lower the acuracy until it is allmost impossible at 175<U+FFFD> again (getting just in on a line again)-communications like chat and getting other informations from other players in system generates some detectable noise too as using radio even if it is not hackable generates em potulion toowhat u could get is:- without a local no chance to per se say a system is empty as long as the enemy holds discipline in staying quiet- recons could get a realy important function in locating and pinning fleets/enemy ships- cat and mouse games between fleets - covered camps no one expects as the stay quiet- finaly usefull situations for those passive and automatic targeting systems (increasing range for loging targets in close to med range situations etc.)- ways for pirates to sneak to the carebear (he is the one searching for rats wich he might need to locate by active searching first)- ways for carebear to stay quiet and try to avoid bypass the pirates- signal disturber probes producing ""wrong signatures and targets"" so you produce multiple signatures to hide between them wich you could fire in different directions at different ranges (maybe randomized)well after all it sounds for me way more interesting then many of you might imagine that are so used to ""local"" and flying to belts station gates to find other ships"

7/14/2009,"the harby/proph and clone/cane have three bonuses between them, all three of which appear on the abso/sleip. in that regard they're both fairly close to each t1 version. however, the ones on the t1 ship skill - i.e., the ones that always operate at full strength - are the ones from the tier 1 hull. the absolution has a locked 25% resist bonus, but a variable 5-25% dps bonus. in that regard, it's more like a prophecy than a harbinger. i admit, it wouldn't be much of a stretch to change the model for those two, but if i had to pick a hull without changing the current stats, it's be tier 1 in both cases. as for proposals for t2 tier 2 bcs, the most common i can recall is an all-in-one exploration ship. this has sort of been supplanted by tech 3, but it might still work. a quick eve search of f+i shows ideas for t2 tier 2 bcs that can nerf inbound rr on the target, command extra pos guns, boost fleet resists, and that's just on the first page. and of course, in the time between my last post and this one, someone proposed a gang-bonus-at-distance ship for this slot. i'm not a huge fan of most of these, but this is an oft-requested ship class, and there has been a hell of a lot of ideas thrown around for it over the years. you do not need to reassign hulls in order to get t2 variants of those ships, you just need to pick the least-crazy idea on f+i and go forward with it."
7/14/2009,stop looking at the ship class and determining how it operates by looking at its t1 bonuses. look how each of those ships is piloted and then tell me they resemble the t1 version. this game isn't played on eft for a reason.

7/14/2009,"the role of statis webifiers is to slow down a moving target so it becomes easier to track, or just so you can stay in range better. if a target is already at maximum velocity and you web them, what would be the point if all it does is reduce their acceleration speed?in order to make this work the way you intended, the web would have to do two things:1. reduce the max velocity of the target ship by a certain percentage.2. proportionally reduce the inertia modifier of that ship so that it takes as much time for it to attain 75% of that new max speed as it would have if the ship wasn't webbed.orcompletely change the way the ""time to warp"" value is calculated. now hear me out... i am a big fan of battlestar galactica (the new series), and in it, ships have to spool their ftl drives in order to jump. ccp could apply that sort of mechanic to eve online ships as well. each ship would have a base attribute (visible in ship info windows), defining how much time it takes for its warp drive engines to ""spool up"" or warm up to the point they can warp. pilots would have the option to ""pre-spool"" their warp engines, which would build up heat over time, or spool just before they warp.the time to warp calculation would then only take into account that value, unless the ship has a velocity. in that case, the current mechanic would be applied, where in order to warp, you have be aligned (pointing at a destination) and that if you're moving at a certain speed, it will take more time to turn towards that destination. however, if you were already pointing and spooled, you could warp instantly (much like you can now if you're already aligned)."

7/14/2009,i think that a upgrade to the current ship movment system would be a great idea especially for frigs and interceptors a joystick control would be a huge improvement. would make the ship easer to handle and make them move effective in any combat setting especially when you need to get a point on something or someone.

7/14/2009,why is it that we can shoot through anything this game i think asteroids and other objects should be able to be used as cover. meaning your bullets from your autocannons will not go through solid rock instead they would just bounce off and make things more realistic.

7/15/2009,seems reasonable.
7/15/2009,"here are the downsides:1. alliances get to minimize their enemies. you can pick just one of the fw militia entities to pick on and don't have to worry about reinforcements or npc attacks in the other militia's area. easy mode for alliances.2. alliances shouldn't interfere in fw, they're simply too much coordinated logistically and there isn't a balancing force in the current fw setup. just imagine the chaos of current fw versus a well organized force of capitals of a massive alliance. also, low sec should not be incentivized for alliances like 0.0 is because there needs to be a no mans land for small corps and gangs to roam for pvp without huge gate camps protecting these new ""sovereign"" spaces. this will happen even if they can't secure plexes because its just as beneficial if you can block opposition (pirates and nonaligned being opposition as well) from entering your space.the upsides for alliances significantly outweigh the downsides with this idea. if you're going to allow alliances into fw, at the very least they should not be able to pick and choose who their enemies are. either you're all in and lose access to all opposing faction space, or you stay neutral."
7/15/2009,"as someone with a freighter, orca, transports and t1 haulers i see absolutely no need for a mini freighter to fill a non-existent gap. what we have already does the job well enough. all of the complaints i have seen so far about the orca is that they don't want to train the mining skills. i sympathize but the train is really not that long and a little diversity is not a bad thing.if we need anything it would be a way to haul rigged battleships around and there have already been several clever suggestions for ways to make our current ships fill those needs (modules that convert cargo hold to ship maintenance array capacity for both the orca and freighter/jf)-vic"
7/15/2009,"ok here we go an need to spell things out for those that can't keep up.what the complaint/issue was an observation that the progression for ships with ""cargo"" space was ass backwards.100-1,000 m3 - normal ships cruisers and battleships.1000-10,000 m3 - industrial ships750k - 1m m3 - freighters300k - 500k m3 - jump freighters but also have a jump drive.now out in left field under mining command ships we have the orca60k - 120k m3 - orca: mining command shipok now look at the lower limit progression.100, 1000, 750k???? wtf? we are missing a base level ship for 2 orders of magnitude. to get one of the orders out of a different ship progression path the orca we need a crap ton ~2-4 months worth or training just to make up for ccps lack of vision on transportation and shipping.is that clear enough?"
7/15/2009,"so basically the only reason you want a ""light-freighter"" is because you want it for progression....right...--isaacp.s. no support."
7/15/2009,"no, the reason is that there is no medium sized ship for hauling good around, we have massive freighters and small industrials.. that's like saying that we do not need cruisers, cause we anyway have frigates and battleships. do you you pilot crousers? probably you do. why? aguments against this proposal do not have any legitimate basis. full support."
7/15/2009,im need to transfer 160k m3 on 14 jumps. what can i do?signed.
7/15/2009,"i for one support the idea of having something a little more useful.even though there is the orca, it can't fit a battleship, repackaged or rigged, which, to me, in a lot of people's minds is one of the best value's for needing to have a mini-freighter(oversized transport). the orca falls short in both regards.the jf still can't pilot a rigged ship, and is insanely expensive, neither can the freighters themselves tbh.though i support the idea in general, i don't think we need a new ship to do this. increase the ship maint. bay to carry 500k m3 and the cargo to be able to carry a minimum of 50-55k m3(if it does with proper skill scratch this). neither are outrageous increases, and maybe with its low slot availability this can also be acheived with expanders."
7/15/2009,"the problem is, rigs were ment to define differences in ships. they were advantage at a cost. there is nothing that says a rigged ship will always beat a non rigged ship. the problem is, if you let this one go, just like we've let so many others go in the past, then it's one more step towards making everyone equal for no cost.this game was built on cost vs reward. risk vs reward. you drop the price on rigs, you remove risk. the lower the risk in game, the less fun it is for everyone. i always loved the quote in the incredible that said when everyone becomes special, nobody is. this is a step away from uniqueness. it's also a step away from competition to have the best stuff. both of those things are what drive this game. this game is the competition to be the best at whatever cost. for some that means hours played, for some that means blobbing, for some that means griefing for hours on end, or scamming, or whatever. it's supposed to be hard, it's supposed to be demanding. that's what motivates people to do better.i just do not like removing aspirations from the game. and removing rig cost for frigates and cruisers in the manner in which they are choosing is doing just that."
7/15/2009,"oh yaay, never change. ""anyone who disagrees with my idea or wants some part of this game to be more accessible in some way is just stupid or lazy""not supported. tech 1 rigs should be relatively cheap, such that a little more money can grant you a little extra performance out of your ship, relative to its size. tech 2 rigs are for the people who want to spend the big bucks min/maxing their ship."
7/15/2009,a goon telling me about stupidity
7/15/2009,"no one fits t2 rigs anyway. is 100x the cost (isk or salvage components) for a 5% increase worth it, i think not. the only issue i may have with these is new smaller rigs will be if there not available like the existing rigs. ccp will have to seed the market with 250k x how many of the new rigs. if this doesnt happen they'll become just like the old t2 bpo's, ie dam i wasnt on the day of release and now i cant get any of them."
7/15/2009,"they were. now they become increased options instead. it is like they add yet another layer of slots where you now can realistically modify even a frig. and how do you get it to become a step away from uniqueness? one sold gtc would make any type of rig available for anyone, even in the good ol days. with rebalanced and perhaps even new rigs there will be an increase in diversity between ships. suddenly you have more ways to address a role. now how is that bad? i could afford rigs before, so for me it's no different except that i might meet a greater variation of ships. and i consider that fun.also, i have to admit, the goon has a point."
7/15/2009,"not an issue - bpos will be for sale, just like the present rigs."
7/15/2009,actually lower tech ship should get always more rig slots with reasonable logic. salvage is supposed to be floating junk in space. you just gather useful parts.you put together this junk and add some positive effects on your ship. it shouldn't cost much at all.general idea should be that you can put rigs in your rifter or kestrel without worrying too much about cost.battleship costs 50-100mil. frigate costs 10-100k. rig prices should follow similar scale by all logic.this rig patch will be great and should've been done ages ago.
7/15/2009,"let me breakdown your arguments for you:-less difference in ships due to everyone having rigs.did i miss the patch note saying they removed all rigs save for 1? last time i checked there were 78 rigs total. with about 25 or so useful ones.so in the case of frigates and cruisers we got from almost every single ship with no rigs to almost every single ship with one of possible 25 rigs. doesn't that make for more differences?-less risk/reward. well currently paying 45 million isk to make a frigate slightly better ( as you said, rigs aren't auto-win but instead a small advantage. ) seems like a pretty darn messed up risk/reward mechanism. so unless you're mistaken about rigs not being such a huge factor this argument holds no value. and in the case that rigs are a huge factor then this patch only evens the playing field. giving newer players a chance as well.-removes the motivation to improveyou remember that immense feeling of despair when you made your first skill plan to get into that awesome ship you really liked with a perfect fit and realised it would take you over a year to get there? you remember that same feeling of despair when you were flying your first cruiser gawking over battleships, hacs and carries and thinking how the hell you were ever going to afford that?that's not motivating at all. long term goals don't motivate. short term goals do. moving from no rigs to small rigs is a short term goal. moving from small to medium another short term goal. moving from no rigs to normal rigs is not. this will instead add a lot of motivation to do better. instead of goals attainable only by those with years of experience and billions of isk rigs will become goals attainable by all players. rigs on a frig will still make it 10 times as expensive. it's still a risk and an investment. but now it will become a realistic risk and investment.just because 5mill for a t1 frig is nothing to you doesn't mean that it's nothing to everyone. it's definitely a small amount but by no means something i'd personally throw away on a whim. that's not even speaking about cruisers totalling 25mill. which i'd say are already on the expensive side for a ship you're expecting to lose in pvp."
7/15/2009,"seems like rigs are going to be like t1 named mods...boring. before you go and make even more ships harder to move without physically being in them, how about making them available to being removed and added when necessary."

7/15/2009,"i support this with 2 caveats:(1) only add-ons which are available to all players should be permitted.(2) there should be some kind of review process to make sure that game-breaking ""wall hack"" style changes aren't introduced.edit: and (3) that ccp should have the right to incorporate any add-ons into the main client."

7/15/2009,no.there's already too much hi sec this and that in eve.
7/15/2009,around covert jump hauling. well not really something that should be a concern. its so easy to use an hauling alt so the covert stuff wont have any benefit unless if in war or going directly to/from low/0.0 sec. then its okay anyway. it wont make any impact on trading in general imo.but you really have to study these pages:
7/15/2009,ok on the topic of tactics first there has to be a ship equiped with a covert ops cyno for the ship to by-pass the gate ( an effective camp will pop said ship in seconds ) so the point of ships by-passing pinch points hear is not a valid.offensive tactics ( for the force with black ops ) well one of the oldest tactics known the pincer move this could ( if done right ) be a deverstating move on the side of the attacking force stoping the campers retreat through a gate. yes this tactic could be used already but with little option than to find alt routs ( if any exist ) to perform such a tactic the black ops is the ship for the job ( after all it is a specialist ship ).for the above reasons and plenty more i stand by my vote of let the black ops have the ability to cyno jump into high sec systems ( like said else where 0.8 sec systems) would be good.why should there be aspects of the game that can only be lerned / used in low / 0.0 sec systems ?
7/15/2009,"well a covert recon also nearly just slip through all gate camps. its what i do today in my blokade runner and in my recons and covert ops. you just fit a covert cyno on a cloaked covert and call in the rest of the covert gang including the black ops.covert and black ops do circumvent all gate camping especially in high sec.how would you make a tight gate camp in high sec with no bubbles what so ever.?besides the ship lighting the covert cyno can be an alt thats just joining the fleet.!taking the original critic from csm suggestion around alt in warfare over to black ops use.no.let black ops get popular in pvp in 0.0 and then lets talk again. just because it hasnt been popular in 0.0. i think its wrong to try to get this going by taking it to high sec. let do it in 0.0 first.! and by alll means lets use it for popping pirates in low sec when the tide has turned and ccp has made the needed change to black ops it will find it niche use.btw. there are many many aspects in eve you have to do in low sec/0.0. moon mining. attacking whom you want, build capitals, light a cyno etc. high sec is - well - high sec.(in fact a redeemer has the exact same dps as a an apoc.! range is just shorter.)"

7/15/2009,rat bounties are allready nerfed in missions compared to 0.0.this does not need to be looked at again.there is little risk ratting in 0 when you have intel channels and are surrounded by blue and can warp to pos/safe and cloak when neutral/hostile in local.

7/15/2009,"i propose that rather than a single definitive assailable structure being the end-all be-all of 0.0 sovereignty, sovereignty should be a relatively accurate representation of how much influence an alliance holds over a certain tract of space. this could be accomplished in the following way.have sovereignty represent a general confidence level that an npc population (represented as simple statistics, without any actual physical presence needed) has in an alliances ability to protect them from harm. the construction by an alliance of a few initial settlement structures revolving around the planets in a system could trigger the influx of settlers into the various planets of a system. as time passes, the confidence level would raise, and more settlers would inhabit the planets of a system. this confidence level could be assailed by hostile pilots by making assaults directly on the planetary structures, on some of the moon-based industrial complexes, or on settler built defenses (to be explained later).these settlers would pay taxes to the controlling alliance (which would directly scale with the number of settlers in the system, which in a sense is the sovereignty level of that system), and overtime could provide more dynamic benefits such as the production and sale of unique ships and modules in systems with player owned stations, a source for missions that would have a unique 0.0 flavor, and they could even provide a novel defense force (in the form of friendly npcs) that could protect the planet against invaders.the system i envision could look something like this:sov 1: build a planetary inhabiting module (pim) in at least one planet in a system. this triggers the start of sov 1. gradually settlers begin inhabiting the planets that have this pim structure. the more pims in the system (at a max of one for every planet) the faster the overall system population rises. one important aspect of this is that the population growth has to be predictable, based on the number of planets in a system, so as to make managing multiple systems easier for an alliance. as the population rises, gradually simple defenses like orbital defense guns and npc frigates and cruisers can develop around the planets. once a certain threshold is reached (say, 60 million inhabitants)sov 2: sov 2 enables an alliance to build terraforming module for their planets, increasing the population cap of the planet. at this sov level, the population begins to settle down and offer missions for the home alliance (these missions come from a set of missions that are specifically created for sov related agents, and are in no way region specific), as well as increased defensive (npc battleships and larger caliber guns) and industrial benefits (offering assistance in moon pos maintenance, such as a reduction in fuel costs). at another population threshold (600 million?) sov 3 is reached.sov 3: this would be another gradual step up in the industrial and defensive benefits of the settling population. better missions, better industrial rewards, more npc planet protection, etc. sov 4: this would rely on a certain population (in the billions) that would only be achievable at a constellation level, across multiple systems (much the way const. sov works now, except not station dependent). sov 4 populations could be more resilient to confidence declines (explained later) as they have developed a long standing interrelationship with their host alliance. i would like to see the removal of mysteriously invincible structures that exist with current sov 4 mechanics, and instead concentrate on it simply being a more difficult path to uproot the infrastructure (in the form of settlements) in such well-developed systems."
7/15/2009,"of course, thus far this has seemed pretty one-sided in favor of the defender. while there should be a definite advantage for wanting to put the effort into holding 0.0 space, it should not be a fortress that is unassailable to anything but the largest of capital fleets. that is why i want to see a system where the potential damage an assailing force can do is scalable with the size of that force.the confidence in alliance protection is the ultimate thing that an assailing force wants to destroy. a small gang could assault some of the moon based, more lightly defended industrial structures which would have a minor negative impact on settler confidence (as well as causing some financial damage to the defending alliance). a massive fleet could directly assault the planets themselves, causing a markedly larger impact on settler confidence. as confidence goes down, settlers abandon the system. this essentially makes sovereignty a dynamic tug-if-war rather than set of hard, artificial levels of representation. however, concrete levels at some of the milestones would still exist (sov levels 1,2,3, and 4) so that both the attacking forces and defending alliance has a clear gauge on their current standing. the intent is not for a small roaming gang of hacs to be able to cripple alliance infrastructure in backwater systems that are not scouted 24 hours a day. such a gang could knock a few points off the confidence level in a region by going around and hunting settler npcs and less defended structures which would succeed in hurting the finances of the defending alliance a bit, but it would take a concentrated effort over time to have a more drastic effect such as lowering the sovereignty level of a system. eventually, i think it would be interesting to see player kills also contribute to settler confidence (so by killing a member of the defending alliance, confidence goes down, if the defending alliance successfully defends a structure or system, confidence goes up). the details would have to be worked out for such a system though.the advantages of this type of system are many.- incentivizes 0.0 space holding by providing 0.0 exclusive benefits (special missions and items offered by settlers) and creating a dynamic building over time infrastructure base- makes 0.0 space more interesting and flexible. as it is, aside from the occasional gatecamp or ratter, 0.0 space is a barren, desolate place. seeing some activity in the form of npc settlers around planets, dynamic structures built in systems, and the ability for less valuable systems (resource-wise) to be made valuable by space holding alliances would be a great boost to the overall attractiveness of 0.0 space.- utilizes existing alliance infrastructure by allowing settelers to make use of moon mining poses and player owned stations (for selling their goods on the market).- allows for both small gangs and large alliances to assault defended space with scalable degrees of impact.- increases the range of options for both attack and defense, evolving 0.0 warefare beyond attack/defend the pos)- allows for more vibrant, player driven stories and better represents the epic scale that 0.0 warfare should involve.thank you for taking the time to read all of this. comments/suggestions/criticisms are all welcome."
7/15/2009,"i like it. though it needs some building, expanding. the basic idea i think is worthy of a big fat old support ^_^good idea chap."
7/15/2009,"as with every sov revamp thread, this is clearly a first draft. it needs work before ccp can even think of implementing it. however, it's certainly one of the more interesting first drafts i've seen in a while. you seem to have addressed all the usual issues fairly cleanly, and if it's done right, it'd be easier to understand and easier to get into than the current system. i like this, a lot."
7/15/2009,"this is similar to some thoughts i've posted before as well, but goes a bit further by making planet populations automate as do improvements to the systems.bluntly, i don't think automation of the process is the wise way to go, as it cuts out the actions of the sov-holding alliance as economic entities.better would be to make planetary populations be trade goods sourced from empire, and employed in specific planetary structures that produce sov points over time (or materials/goods of use, if you'd rather use your colonists in other ways). rather than automatically causing targets to appear in a system, sov would permit useful structures (defense, offense, and economic) to be anchored by the spaceholding alliance. that said, i could see a model in which probe-able ""civilian"" structures are automatically seeded as exploration sites in a system, and attacking those becomes one of the means to reduce sov points for attackers, as would taking out npc ""convoys"" and the like. in many ways, i think the future of sovreignty could (and should) be looked at as a mini-game similar to managing your cities in colonization--only instead of the mother-country sending invincible elite troops to smash you flat, some other space-holding alliance eventually does that for you. colonization, in short, was all about generating advancement points, recruiting bonus people, and harvesting raw materials to be either sold in the distant market or refined to a finished good and then sold.so, in general i support this idea.--krum"

7/15/2009,"pre-speed nerf, we had ridiculous speeds without counters. after patch, we have insanely slower speeds and more counters to that speed.i think we've seen the bad of speed gone forever. i would like to bring back some of the speed we once saw though.changes below are an attempt to get cruiser closer to the 3500-5000 speeds if fully fit for speed with the vaga hitting maybe a slightly higher end fully faction fit and snaked.these same changes should give frigates high ends around 8-9k speeds if fully fit, implanted and set for speed.doing this, would be a good middle ground for speed freaks and provide a ground between speed and range setups, where as right now, almost always range wins with the exception of rr platforms.there are also more counters to speed now than before, most begrudgingly the mwd turn off switch that is just disastrous for speed setups. lets face it, only a ****** would fit a mwd and ab, and then he'd be laughed at for dieing anyways. snakes:there is no reason they give so little buff for their intended purpose. return snakes to a mid point level from where they are to where they were.mwd'skeep the capacitor changes in, but add some distinction in speed between meta's.ship mass:increase all tank cruiser/bs types mass by 5%. reduce all speed cruiser/bs types mass by 5%.ship skills:recalibrate ships meant for speed to get speed geared bonuses such as agility, tracking, scrambling, falloffs, and remove their ability dish out higher dps.frigates:boost all frigate speeds by 10% base.=============================these types of changes should bring speed back to some extent while not overpowering it like before where mass, and massive stacking bonuses made cruiser hit 13-25k speeds. in short, give us back some speed."
7/15/2009,"i want to note that i was one of the most adamant supporters of speed nerfing, but even i knew from day one they went way overboard with the changes."
7/15/2009,"speeds are pretty fine now. also, these suggestions above put together would mess everything up pretty bad. especially cruiser speeds are very fine now. not supported."
7/15/2009,a vaga pilot can already hit 6-7k on overload. what do you want more?and my not fully speed fitted fleet scythe (3nanofiber ii) easily hits 3k/s.your point was again?oh and yes. not supported.

7/15/2009,"alright just the title says, why hasn't the insurance company come to a point in their history of payouts, to numerous pod pilots, to actually give more accurate payouts? and sorry if this has already been brought up, i rarely read this forum, nor do i have the time to repeatedly search for a thread i'd probably never find.issues:tech 1 - obviously many of these ships worth insuring have a payout that actually lowers the cost of the insurance in the first place.tech 2 - obviously many of these ships are insuring for the value of the cost to build, not the market value of the ship. which in rl, it is generally what it would take to get a new one. even if you make the cost of insuring a t2 version of a ship more, it is still worth doing in my opinion. most people drop some serious cash on these beautiestech 3 - to be honest, on a modifible(msp?) ship there isn't really any way i can see this being very possible, at least at the moment.and for all of them, maybe a bi-yearly update of the average cost, in empire, it would take to buy a new one. taken randomly twice a year to prevent players hiking prices up of course. it would be interesting to see one day, the insurance company adverting more competitive tech 2 insurance available. and more over, as all things in eve have pretty much gotten more expensive, this could lighten the load some players are taking on now. there isn't really an increase in ways to make more isk, just more ways to spend it quicker."
7/15/2009,supporting myself.
7/15/2009,"i've come to notice that in eve, there is a capital ship for almost every type of ship in the game; capital cargo ships, capital mining support ships, capital combat ships, even capital drone carriers.so my question is, why not add a capital mining ship to the game? say, a eight high-slot strip mining ship, with a 500m3 drone bay with 10x or even 15x drone control ability?this way, it would be the ultimate mining ship; enough drones to defend itself, and superior mining capabilities that are limited only by its low/null-sec restriction. a ship like this could make low/null-sec space a lot more valuable to hold, as an alliance could hold the space a lot easier, as it can mine itself a new fleet much more quickly. and of course, it has no abilities like the rorqual, making its use still valuable.just a thought. :)edit - upgrading to proposal, please vote if you have not as of yet."
7/15/2009,"i think just making a large mining drone would solve your issue tbh, and giving a orca/rorq a larger drone ability/bay. but only the higher bandwidth, than normal, to run a heavy mining drone. there isn't really any need to increase the number of pve capital ships even more."
7/15/2009,"that ship wouldn't stay pve for long, i can only imagine the pirate gloat/wine threads that would spawn. i actually like that idea"
7/15/2009,"sometimes when you see big corporations and alliances slave at harvesting resources at the expense of fun i wonder when the time will come when we can harvest moons for raw resources.or heck, just stick a factory on a moon and it will churn out ships, once done the moon's gone. our fleet ate a moon."

7/15/2009,"low sec profitability has nothing to do with this so called 'loophole'- in fact, by discouraging people to enter low-sec, it if anything increases profitability due to supply and demand (people less likely to enter low-sec means few plex runners- less competition). the problem is that low sec profitability is minuscule at best- not that it's easy for people to scan out your mission. but that's for a different thread.not supported."
7/15/2009,"ok, you're not going to get my support, but i'm definitely not going to flame you for calling into question the profitability of low-sec. i will however, suggest to you that the scanning mechanics may not be the problem.it's supposed to be dangerous. in order to circumvent this, you bring more people in to support you. when you do this however, your profit margin lowers. however, in what way do you think that this situation of losing profit would change if probes were changed so that they were required to be in space close to you longer?what you're asking for is that the directional scanner be nerfed in order to fit better with the new scan-probe mechanics. so what would happen if the numbers were changed so that it required, say, 60 seconds to scan a ship down with probes?the ganker drops his probes and begins scanning. you are spamming on the directional scanner and as soon as the probes get within 14 au of you, you warp off to the station, safe spot, etc...from here you are in exactly the same boat except you have ""saved"" the mission site. you still are experiencing the same profit loss however. you still have to wait for the ganker to leave or kill him/her/them. all they have to do is wait. as soon as you go back to the site, if the ganker is still active, they will find you before you could possibly have a chance to finish the mission.so you've saved the site and you could potentially do it later and get the reward and not lose standing with your agent, but you still have to either wait, leave, or kill. almost nothing has changed.so, all said and done, i do see where you're coming from in that the risk/reward ratio for lowsec seems skewed (ore not really worth it, crappy rats, etc...) but i don't believe that a nerf of the directional scanner is the way to fix it. a change like this would affect everyone negatively, not just low-sec mission runners. trying to come up with a suggestion to increase the profitability of low-sec is good in my book but changing this mechanic around will solve nothing because it's not the root of the issue, and even if it was changed to what you propose, nothing would change."
7/15/2009,"commanderdata211,i haven't done a good job explaining how changing the probing mechanics would improve profitability. but in a nutshell here it is:pre-apocrypha - i could mission in low sec even when neutrals and pirates were in the system. why? because i had a window of at least 30-60 seconds to detect probes. i had a better chance at detecting them. if there were no probes in sight i could continue with my mission.post-apocrypha  even with one neutral in system i have to dock my pve ship (ie, the profit earner) and do something else because i have no idea whether that neutral is probing me or not. what i do afterwards is irrelevant, whether its go fight, go dock, go twiddle my thumbs, go blob, it doesnt matter. one neutral in my system means stop earning isk. and no other safety measure will help this situation.in order to use my directional scanner properly i would need to be bashing it every 5 seconds. its just physically impossible considering i have to read the results and micromanage the ship all at the same time. id probably last 10 minutes before having to quit for the day.people keep suggesting drop a can at warp-in, stay aligned which is very good advice to try and keep my ship alive but does nothing more. once my deadspace is discovered my profits hit the floor."
7/15/2009,"as i explained in my previous response, it takes time to learn these things. when we train a new pilot i expect several weeks to several months of learning to take place before they are able to function comfortably in a hostile area. i could no more teach all of this via forum post than i could write a few paragraphs on archery and expect someone to read them and go hit bullseyes with a bow and arrow. this is why i would again recommend that pilots having trouble operating outside of high-sec join a good group that is already successful in low or null sec. obviously one of these groups has adapted to the environment in which they thrive and have lessons to teach. making a couple assumptions (which i hate to do), it seems that those endorsing this scanner nerf are attacking the wrong problem, and using unwise techniques in dangerous space. by attacking the wrong problem i mean: it's not the scanner or the probes that are broken. there's a pretty good arguement that low-sec isn't really worth the time or effort. i personally skip through low sec rather quickly and spend my time in 0.0. others have already made this point in this thread. by using unwise techniques i mean: * flying solo while hunted by groups* expecting to continue churning isk while being hunted* continuing to churn isk while being hunted instead of reacting to the hunters* flying pure pve fit ships in a hostile areawhile i couldn't possibly ""train"" a pilot to thrive in hostile space on the forum, i can tell you that we don't use any of the unwise techniques i just listed. refusing to adapt to a hostile space by changing methods is like refusing to buy bug repellent when hiking in a jungle, because normally you hike in the city and you don't have to take that extra precaution, so you shouldn't have to do it in the jungle. it's not the mosquitos fault if said hiker gets eaten up, and we certainly shouldn't nerf the wind for carrying the scent of dumb hiker to the mosquito."
7/15/2009,"the expectation that you can maintain 100% profitable activities while operating solo and being hunted is a false and unrealistic expectation. in my experience, unrealistic expectations are one of the main causes of human frustration."
7/15/2009,maybe we need a module that informs us we are being scanned with an exception being made for covert ops scans (which either can't be detected or have a much greater chance of being undetected).
7/15/2009,"so what this really comes down to, is that pre-apocrypha probes gave you the ability to ascertain the motives of neutrals in local in advance of them actually arriving in missions.in both the pre- and post-apocrypha world, if someone comes into local and tries to scan you down you need to dock until they're gone. the difference is that pre-apocrypha, if someone in local wasn't scanning you then you could usually determine this, whereas now the majority of the scanning happens in a way that doesn't show up on your own directional scanner, and thus you get little or no advance warning.and you're not worried about losing your ship as such, you're trying to ""protect the location"" of your mission by warping out when the probing starts. once someone appears in the mission you're happy enough about warping out to save your mission ship, but at that point they already have a 100% hit on the location, which they wouldn't have got if you had known to warp out two minutes earlier.is this understanding right?if so, i'm not sure that having your site discovered is as big a deal as you seem to think. regardless of whether the prober gets a warpable hit the first time round or not, you'll need to stay docked up while they're in system, and you're safe when they're gone. the only distinction, and i don't know how relevant this is, is that the prober could leave the system, and trade the bookmark to another player who could then enter your system and warp straight to your mission.but since you seem to be not worried about losing your ship to something like this, and since you need to dock if people who are hunting you are in your system anyway, i'm not sure how this changes things. besides, it's not like you could guarantee you warped out before they had a fix on your location pre-apocrypha anyway."
7/15/2009,"i have written a guide on the technique that being talked about in the op. see the link in my signature for more details.i still thinks it sucks that there is pretty much no possible defense to counter this technique, but at least, now you'll know how it's done so you can get some payback"
7/15/2009,"you anwsered your own question , to be profitable in low sec you need to be in a blob so you can spank local pirates.if you absolutelly insist on doing it solo , make sure you fit eccm to your ship.scan strength = sig radius / sensor strength.by increasing sensor strength you reduce the ability of a pirate to get a 100% hit on you when they do launch probes.if you go to low in a maurader with a big fat sig and no sensor stength , dont be surprised if the pirates get a 100% hit on you first time."
7/15/2009,"oh, and since i forgot to actually reply to the op earlier:as soon as the apocrypha scanning system was announced, i was pleased that finally knowledge of where someone was in the system could be integrated into scanning, so that you could tell your probes to focus on a particular area if you knew where the area was. i considered this a deliberate and fundamental element of the system, and never considered that someone might consider it a ""loophole"".in response to your second pair of questions, yes and yes in my opinion. the d-scanner has always been the tool of choice to locate someone in a system; the only time you ever resort to probes is when you determine someone's location to away from celestial objects - in which case, the sole purpose of the scanner probes is to generate a warpable hit to a location that you already know of, but otherwise have no way to get to. this is in fact exactly what was happening before, but because it was impossible to integrate your knowledge of a player's location into the scanning system (short of trying to drop a probe as close to that player as possible), the probing took longer and was more chance-based.i do sympathise with your side of the coin, though - i think that the situational intelligence system does need a bit on an overhaul, rather than pinging the directional scanner ever few seconds. this has been talked about in relation to putting local in delayed mode in k-space (at which point some kind of changes to scanning/early warning systems would be a good idea), and when this is addressed it should make your situation much better too."
7/15/2009,"loophole or not, i think everybody can agree: having to click a button every 4 seconds and roll the results in a scrolled text area does not make much sense. some automation or advanced filtering will not make low-sec afk missioning possible, or make anything easier for anybody. an operator is still required, attention is still needed."

7/15/2009,or you could simply create a channel specifically to issue fleet orders....
7/15/2009,"if your fleet members are so insecure about themselves that they don't want to do what needs to be done to create an effective fleet, that's your own damn problem for not hanging out with good people.nevertheless, if this could somehow be implemented properly, it would be a cool feature to see everyone involved in the fight. unfortunately, given the complexity of the game, i just don't think it's feasible. too often, you'll be in a situation where you're involved in a fight, fighting on the same side as neutrals- or even reds- and the system would have no real way of telling what's what. cool idea, yes- but not possible to implement effectively."

7/15/2009,"how about a simple solution?scanner button is removed, instead it is constantly active! scanning angels remain the same.this way there is no more mindless spamming the scan button, but nothing changes to the human skill of scanning down stuff.and the scanner does need a lot of tweaking, but not in a direction that discourages pvp."

7/15/2009,"not supported.managing your weapons is something that you need to do.you need to remember to cycle the cap booster after it reloads, you need to remember to turn off your mwd once you've burned to the target, you need to toggle heat at the right time, you need to manage capacitor, orbit range, etc...why should you not have to also reengage weapons after they reload?however, if this does make it to the game, here's how it should be done:reload becomes like a cycle. it has a visible activation timer, and you can click on the weapon in mid-reload for it not to cycle another time (so for it to stop shooting after the reload)."
7/15/2009,"in options of the game let us tweak the client. 1) you will type in ranges that appear when you click warp to/orbit at/ keep at range2) in client options you can enter speshial mode where you can change colours, fonts, font sizes on every button, and change relative scale of every button.3) you can moove around buttons in menu. why?person a pilots a interseptor. the first thing he whant to come up when he clicks on a object is orbit, not aproach. person b pilots a long-range ship with limited tracking and whants the first thing from the top to be keep at range with his optimal at the top. you will not be able to setup macroes or significantly change interface in order to gain advantage.woul be nice to be able to make simple commands using in-build editor such as: if the angular velosty is over traking of my guns, the line in the overview with the tracking turns red.if target is in my faloff it is shown yello, if it is in my optimal is had a green tag. if target is warp scrambling me a big red blinky tag appears next to it. those are just examples of interface adjustments, and simple tweaks. all commands should be limited to interface and not perform any actions in game, like ""when my cargo is full drop a jetcan"" will not work. script modules could be sold in-game by players for isk. (would be cool) as they only work when you log in and cannot perfor any actions other then changing colour of buttons and other stuff they can't be malisios. any script can be disabled before logging in, from the menu, so before it takes effect, if user does not like it."
7/15/2009,"not supported, for the following reasons:1. most people wouldn't bother to customise the ui.2. in a well-designed ui, people shouldn't need the level of customisation you're asking for.3. it would involve ccp designing a whole new, easy-to-use ui, just to allow a few people to make the original ui a little bit better suited to them. i'd rather have one decent ui for everybody.3. we still can't set the text size above 12pt or change the font, and people have been asking for that for years.4. for menus, it would be better and easier for ccp to implement a sensible menu ordering, where all options are easy to find.

7/16/2009,"all missiles need some serious examination.ever since the titanic missile changes 3 years ago they've become a terribly sub-par damage system relegating ships that rely on them to the back burner and pve content.increase the explosion velocity on all missiles to be equal or greater to the afterburner velocity of their intended targets (i.e. rockets should have an explosion velocity equal to an overdrive equipped frigate on afterburner: about 1200-1500 meters/sec). the radius should be adjusted by type (javelins/precision having very small radii putting more hurt on small things, fury/rage having a larger radius and slower exp velocity to damage larger targets).precisions should hurt smaller targets than their class (cruise intended for cruisers/bc rather than bs), javelins should fly 2x as far as their t1 counterparts, rage should put considerable pain on ships larger than their class (heavies not doing so well against cruisers, but smacking bc/bs almost as hard as a cruise) where fury should possibly have a splash damage effect but fly 1/2 as far as t1.all nerfs should be removed from t2 missiles (and all t2 ammos) to bring them into line with faction ammos."
7/16/2009,"no. t2 ammo is great the way it is.explosion velocity should be lower than the base speed of the target ship class, because turret ships need to fit a web, so missiles ships should also need to, and because ab is specifically meant to let you speed tank a bunch of damage, and it should also work against missile ships."

7/16/2009,"while i like the idea (and agree with evanda's post about supporting anything that would give us shooting rights against the largest block of 'amarrian loyalists' in the game, i agree with micia and rodj's concerns about this implementation. that is, avoiding war with your chosen enemy's partner is a very strong advantage (both militarily and economically), and lacking automatic standings of some sort with the (quasi-)friendly militia is a recipe for organizational disaster.the second problem could be ignored, but at the very least, i think it would be reasonable to assume that when a pod-pilot alliance (which in game-world terms represents a significant hostile force) declares war on an empire, that empire's ally would join in its defense.conceptually, though, i support this. but given ccp's total lack of anything resembling interest in including rp alliances in the war (which is either completely off the table or soon(tm) to be worked on depending on which dev is answering), i don't see them paying any more attention to this."

7/16/2009,"i (and others) believe that ccp slightly overcooked the web balance especially in the case of the minmatar recons. while a balance was needed as 90% at 40km+ was a bit much the current state of webs in this case along with the rebalance of speed in the game has significantly reduced the ability of the rapier/huginn to act properly as force multipliers. not to mention the hyena (urrrrg).those who fly any of the three listed ships are fully aware of how slow the recons have become and the general ""meh"" of the hyena. as all 3 are designed to dictate engagement range and/or act as a multi-support webbing platform for a gang/fleet it would seem the max web speed reduction of 60% is simply not quite right.i would suggest (as with other ewar) that webs be left as is for ships without a bonus (i.e.60% speed reduction)..but perhaps introduce a 2.5-5% bonus per level to web strength for both minmatar recons and the hyena.mathwise (based on base 60% with best case 5%/level) this would work out to approx:recon/eaf i=63% web strengthrecon/eaf ii=66% web strengthrecon/eaf iii=69% web strengthrecon/eaf iv=72% web strengthrecon/eaf v=75%. web strengthat recon v/eaf v this would go a long way towards correctly re-balancing these ships.thank you for your attention.**edit**edited for clarity**edit**for further clarity this proposal is not a replacement for existing web range bonus. it is to make the web range bonus have a real point-which is lacking in it's current form. it can be implemented as an additional bonus (best case to make up for ccp's overcooking things) or reduce the awesome and feared painter bonus so others will not whine ""ooo unfair third bonus"" while enjoying td, neuts, damps, scrams, and jams that actually mean something useful to the average competent combat pilot ."
7/16/2009,oh yeah. i support this.
7/16/2009,"only if these can not be jetissoned into space. can mining is fine the way it is, but to allow locking(secure) cans bigger than gsc will make mining in high sec even easier."
7/16/2009,it wont make it easier to mine in high sec as u still would need to empty a section like 5km/5km of roids and then its not even worth the effort to do so especially if u already got a corpmate/friend/alt with a hauler helping you out.
7/16/2009,supporting this
7/16/2009,"the entire can system is crap, and needs a lot more work than just this. still, supported."
7/16/2009,"yes very good idea.i was thinking the same thing, people should be able to have a new chance to remap if they screw up.we all can screw up.nothing happens if ppl remap more frequently, this wont be an abuse.they dont gain anything extra..so this cant obviously be called an abuse..he has the right to shift some of this attributes to another way..this is just about frequency..what happens if he shifts more frequently..nothing..who would care? noone cos none will be offended by this..there may be a limit like once in a month but, imagine ppl are remapping everyweek..so what? it wouldnot matter since most of the skills leaning time are shorter than a week.you wont be ale to remap for every skill train for it to be called an abuse) i totally agree this is a great idea.we should be able buy a remap to like 5-10$ directly via account management or should be available to same price with an item like plex..ccp please read this"
7/16/2009,"this. different ships, fittings, ammo types, need different orbit ranges too, it's a pain to change it every time or alternatively having to take a lucky pick from the default hoping to get something close to usefull."
7/16/2009,"you are limiting the ability of this ship to just pvp and this is a bit one track what about faction war's or even just corp wars in high sec systems ( yes the mentioned have pvp aspects but its not just pvp combat ) pvp is not the be all and end all of this game just the role you may want to play ( this could realy make faction war's intresting ).effective camps in high sec you mean you dont know already well im not guna give you hints on that front at the end of the day the ship needs to be used more ( at least thats what im hearing ) and changing the abilities like with high sec cyno's would add a new lease of life to the ship and im all for that.yes i know there are many many aspects in eve you have to do in low sec / 0.0 my question was why like what was said at the begining of the thread "" covert cynos already ignore cyno jammers, and cannot be easily detected (dont show up system wide on overview). so what is preventing pilots from using covert portals in high sec empire space? "".my vote is still yes to this idea my opinion has been posted and my mind made up."
7/16/2009,"we have more and more players which means more sell orders. the effect is:-it is getting harder and harder to sell or buy anything . if you put something for sell order now it is gone in 100s of other sell orders in around 20minuts. it is not only hard to sell product but also find what you looking for.the solution for that: create subdivisions in ""sell orders"". for example one sudivision for capitals/supercap/t3/fraction ships , another one for modules , another one for non capitals/supercaps/t3/fraction ships , another one for services (freighter transport, creating corporations , lotteries , pos fueling etc.).maybe additional one or two representing similar products.that way it will make finding/selling stuff much more easier."

7/16/2009,"nice straw man. who's complaining about suicide ganking? gank all you want, i just don't think you should get an automatic payout for doing it. either suicide ganking itself is profitable, or it isn't. if it is, then you don't need insurance payouts. if it's not profitable, then it's not profitable and you shouldn't get a concord bailout for doing it."
7/16/2009,"this, tbh.suicide ganks are a part of the game, and i don't expect that to change. but those performing the ganks should bear the weight of that choice, instead of having it subsidized by the very agency thatis going to punish them for it."
7/16/2009,"theres no straw man here, the reason this is being suggested is to reduce the number of suicide gankings is it not?you may want to pay more attention to c&p happenings so you understand why this specific issue has popped up at this time. also, had you read the thread you would see that the argument is against mindless ganks not necessarily ones for profit.all i'm saying is that the ganks people are aiming to combat with this change don't have a profit motive."
7/16/2009,"actually, i read (and post) in c&p quite frequently. that aside, this thread isn't intentioned to reduce suicide ganks. the only thing that would reduce suicide ganks would be removing guns from high security space.and you're right, removing the insurance payout will not at all limit the suicide ganks that are done strictly for tears. i think you may be under estimating the number of ganks that are done for profit though. let's face it, if c&p'ers are famous for anything, it's misinformation"
7/16/2009,support
7/16/2009,i support this
7/16/2009,"as someone who makes most a lot of money ratting in 0.0, i'd say no to this idea but i have a counter proposal:currently, the faction spawn distribution is slanted heavily in favor of those people who spawn belts right after dt. in general, my experience shows that i get at least 30% (now maybe 60%) more commander and officer spawns when i search belts after dt than i do when i farm hours laterfix to income distribution to be independent of time zones and you will see a more profitable 0.0 - from point of view of regular people.to achieve this, ccp would need to add a special flag in the spawn generation code, that if it is the very first spawn after server reboot, then it will never be a faction spawn. faction spawn would only have a chance of appearing if you, or someone else, has killed at least 1 default spawn.however, since eliminating faction spawn chance from first spawn after dt would significantly reduce to overall rate of finding commanders/officers, the default random algorithm should be adjusted to increase the chances of getting faction spawns. in my estimate, the chances would need to be upped by about 20%."
7/16/2009,"dude stop hijacking this proposal, the issue here is that l4's make more isk than belt ratting in general."
7/16/2009,"0.0 belt ratting income is heavily dependent on faction spawns. the regular spawns are about 50% of the income, then faction mods you find, rarely, make up the other 50%.increasing faction spawns is certainly more interesting than flat bounty increase, and doesn't raise inflation."
7/16/2009,"that is a option. what about chaining. i know if u kill every npc in the belt (avarage 12 belts) for 3 hours u get 1 ""special"" spawn. that means hauler/faction/officer. if someone is chaining it can take far longer before u even get such a spawn. chaining wil give u every 4-5 hours a special spawn (on avarage). what if such a spawn is a hauler spawn containing 7m tri and 80k isogen. the fluctuations are just too big. if u get a officer spawn u might earn more than l4's. im playing eve for over 2 yrs, 1 yr ratting in 0.0 and i only had a offcier spawn once. a ahremen meta 13 that dropped a ahremen armour expl hadner ahremen cabbooster and 250m db stuff. close to a bilion in loot. how fast do u have a bilion isk worth in lp's?"
7/16/2009,fantastic idea.
7/16/2009,return webs to what they once were.return all speeds to what they once wereenable weapons to *hit* at that speed (drones & missiles which were too easy to speed tank).if people want to speed... *let them*... but enable everyone else to counter them a lot more smoothly than they could in the past.
7/16/2009,"no, speeds are fine"
7/16/2009,"i could live with some of these changes(mass and skills, mostly), but on the whole, you have the wrong approach. your mwd changes, for example, would make high-meta mwds better than they used to be - not only would they be fast again, but they'd be better on cap and sig as well. i also think most frigs are fast enough these days. not supported."
7/16/2009,"its fine, fianly no more 17km/s vaga's anymore"
7/16/2009,i miss the speed
7/16/2009,"rapiers, huginns - 40km web with 0.01 speed multiplier with 2x, or up to 90km with overloaded factionoverloaded faction web - 19.5 km web on any ship that cared to spend as much money as a fast nanoship was spendingcurse, heavy neuts - 40-25km shut off mwdother nanoships - tacle tacticssmart maneuvering that allows much slower ship to intercept a known orbit of the enemy that orbits another targetwhy are so many people so blind to basic game features? even ccpthe whole nano nerf was done on invalid logic and has been a horrible disgrace to beauty of game design."
7/16/2009,"they clearly went too drastic with the nerf, but i dont expect them to ever come up with a more reasonable compromise. ccp is stubborn like that, and whoever makes the final decisions obviously doesn't play."
7/16/2009,"i think more appropriately it would be not enough counters. i think the implementation of a mwd killing 2 pt scram was more than enough extra counter to this as it's absolutely devastating to speed setups far more so than any other counter. neuts can be countered, webs can be outranged, but scrams are a kill or be killed counter only.let's face it, pre patch, a 15km/s vaga could be outta your curse neut range in 3-5 seconds from 0 to speed. it only takes 1 injector to ensure that pulse of a mwd. so to really catch it, you'd probably be talking a combo of a few neuts, a web or 3, a long point, and enough speed to track it down still. 90% web on a 15000 m/s vaga only takes it down to 1500, not to mention how long it'll take to slow it down, so drift often carried it outta most ranges if the pilot was good. primarying rapiers hindered this problem substantially more. 20 speed hacs against 20 of anything else, guess what died first for the anything else... so what do they do, bring 20 rapiers... well then who does dmg?that's why this suggestion brings old and new together.i have no desire for speeds to be increased to anywhere near their pre nerf levels. i would like to see ceptors more regularly hitting 9km m/s w/o over heating and more, but not all cruiser hitting closer to 3k speeds and overloading to maybe 4. simply enough, if a ceptor can hit 9k and a fast cruiser can hit 3k, then a vaga should be 5-6 rather than it's current 3-4km/sexamples of cruiser sizes that would probably get speedy bonuses as tradeoff's for their current ones:sacvagadiemios ( middle of the road speeds b/t tank and speed)osprey navyvigilantomen navycurse-and other current short range platformsan example of what i'd do to the deimos as a fix for this style of patch would be to change the falloff bonus for a mwd sig reduction penalty or tracking, or 5% scrambler range bonus... ie only scrams, not disruptors to help it counter the speed issues it currently has.================examples of ships that would loses some mass/speed to the current ones:heavy tanks/ranges:zealotmuninnishtarcerbpilgrim"
7/16/2009,given the bonuses most people would see the sac as tank and the zealot as sniper/nano.
7/16/2009,"which is why i believe i stated that some ship bonuses would need to change. sac is a decent tank but it's slot layout is not really conducive to a great tank. yes i know you can get a great tank, but it doesn't mean ship is optimal for it. you'd be far better served by a multitude of other amarr options for the tank choice.sac works much better as a speed boat since it's ideal choice of weaponry is pretty close range. honestly, if the changes went through as proposed, the sac bonuses could stay exactly the same and it still be good at either option, but not really a combo of both. only difference would be it's top end speed would increase by about 800 hopefully.sac is ultimately a versatile utility boat, so make it faster but still slower than a lot of the other speed boats. zealot has a much greater range dynamic than the sac and the instant damage bonus where as the sac's range choice is a) missiles and b)slow missiles. so if you plated and or tanked the sac, it's speeds would be considerably slower for considerably more tank. if you modded for speed, it'd be good speed, close range dmg or long range meh. sounds good to me."
7/16/2009,"you want to make insurance payments more market-based? yeah, i can support that. not sure what you're getting at with the t3 bit, but i'll give it a thumb."
7/16/2009,"u need to remove blue salvage from t2 ships, or else im going to fraud the insurance . buy t2 ships, insure, get killed, salvage your ship and print isk"
7/16/2009,insurance is supposed to cost 30% when fully insured. the only reason insurance makes some ship losses essentially free is that t1 mineral prices are 30% below the values that the insurance company uses. you think the average hac drops 35 mil in t2 salvage?
7/16/2009,"this will never happen, and this should never happen. i don't support obsoleting every other mining ship in the game, thanks anyways."
7/16/2009,"caps and supercaps are great for mining, that said, i'm all for a pure capital mining vessle of course!"
7/16/2009,"only if it had to cycle for 10 min stationary to be useful. personally, rather than strip miners i think it should use miner 2's with a bonus so that market can be revived after i gank about 30 of these ships in a day."
7/16/2009,"meh it will happen eventually when and how exactly we dont know.the mineral market is very sensible . and the real problem is that mining as a profession is obsolete . as 40% of the minerals come from the loot , it's silly. once such a thing has been fixed we will be able to fix the mining profession"
7/16/2009,"this, tbh.the reprocessing rates for items needs some serious looking at"
7/16/2009,"bad idea, it would flood the market"
7/16/2009,"would love to see a capital mining ship, with an onboard refinery and silos/reactors that can be accessed in the same manner as a pos.-make it unable to cloak-paper thin shields/amrour, but with massive hull hp-small ship maintenance bay.-10 (!) strip miners- logging off with reactions etc.. active destroys the components."
7/16/2009,"so uh... quick question: why the hell does it matter if someone's scanning you down if you're already aligned out? the moment you see a hostile on grid, you have about a 3 second window to **** yourself and press warp before you get locked down- more if they're in something larger than a cruiser."
7/16/2009,i explained it here.
7/16/2009,people have been using the d-scanner in this manner since before the latest probe re-vamp; and were doing so when it was chance based even before that!this is what the d-scanner is for.
7/16/2009,"its easy, with practice, to make yourself pretty much totally safe whilst running missions in lowsec. briefly, its to do with aligning your ship, watching local, and using the scanner. i wont go into details here but feel free to mail me and i can give you the hints and tips that will keep you safe everytime"
7/16/2009,there is one underlying difference. pre-apocrypha probes were in space for a hell of a lot longer than just 5 seconds.
7/16/2009,"thanks, but my concern isn't surviving in low sec. i think i have that pretty well managed. my problem is not being able to protect my deadspace when missioning. before apocrypha, an alert mission runner had a decent chance at detecting probes in space before getting busted. after apocrypha there is only a 5-second window. if i am in low sec to make profits i just cannot take that risk after the patch. what i'm asking is for ccp to increase that window from 5 seconds to something more reasonable."
7/16/2009,"supported, on the condition that the fc also gets ""/dance"" technology incorporated into the fleet interface."
7/16/2009,i also would like a conga command for fleet
7/16/2009,wha? where are all the pvpers??

7/16/2009,the csm did have a meeting right?stuff was discussed?
7/16/2009,"from what i hear, they actually spent at least half their time figuring out how best to annoy you personally. seriously man, bumping this thread isn't going to get you anywhere. stop."
7/16/2009,"meissa hasnt been able to do the minutes due to personal reasons (which i wont go into here), erik has assured me he will try to get them done asap."
7/16/2009,do you know how i got into the csm? sheer charisma ! it's just been too much time working as a pl diplomat in their customer relations department
7/16/2009,"i see in some other threads that being scanned down in missions is also another problem, and after doing some experimentation with the ""probe drop"" trick, it seems that to counter it you either have to hit the scan button every 4 seconds, or load up the mids with eccm. but both pirates and mission runners are in agreement: having to hit a button like captain pike every 3-4 seconds is bad ui.eccm seems to reduce signature radius by side effect. i once put medium scout drones and light drones in the same place and when i had the mediums at 100 percent, the lights were at 86 percent. but there is no module intending to reduce signature radius for scanning resistance, and perhaps such special ""stealth"" modules would not be a bad idea. it would not break the ""cost-consequence"" model of eve since skills are needed to use modules, and slots are taken up by them. since there are already ""plate"" modules for ships as far as armor is concerned, why not ""radar absorbing material"" modules? fact of the matter is, someone with the top lvl 5 skills and sisters gear can scan down a target very fast without having to narrow the probes down and scan repeatedly (actions that warn the target). these are the rewards for taking the time for the skills and paying the isk for the gear (or grinding the lps). but there is no stealth avenue aside from cloaking, and you can't do anything while cloaked. so where is the avenue for resistance to the instascan ability of those thus rewarded by taking the time for skills, that could be rewarded to those also looking to adhere to the ""cost-consequence"" model? the hunter can get top reward for their effort but there is nothing for the hunted except the outdated directional scanner. if you can skill up for sisters gear and pinpointing and aquisition, others should also be given the ability to equipp stealth modules and skill up for sigrad reduction. surely those who boast about their pvp ganking skills could not complain about making a ""hunt"" truly a hunt? nobody admits to wanting an ""i win"" button, and instad fall backto the skills-versus-skills argument. and i think such an argument can be made in this case."
7/16/2009,supported. minnies need some love (and bigger clip sizes for large arties would be nice too)
7/16/2009,"while i'd like to see all of this functionality, this is simultaneously too much and too little to be a good proposal(except #1, that's fine). by the time they started making stuff like this work, they could be halfway to just making a properly moddable ui. the return on dev time just isn't there for doing this."

7/17/2009,"there's a lot of very silly suggestions in this thread. why do you hate my poor little hawk so much that you want to give it a split weapons system?this would only work if you increased the clip size of rocket launchers, you often find yourself reloading mid fight as it is.the hawk's problem is dps and slot layout - 5% missile damage would keep it in line with the kestrel but more importantly it's a bonus that the ship desperately needs and won't make it overpowered.4 mids for an active shield tank is pretty laughable too, i've seen many medium shield extender hawk fits and it should ring alarm bells that in thread after thread pvpers post fits that recommend you ignore the active tank bonus.swapping a low to a mid would cure the problem. if the slot layout can't be changed then move the boost bonus to a 5% resist bonus, drop the shield recharge rate slightly and adjust the cpu / pg so that it can take a passive tank.i've been posting in hawk threads for nearly 3 years now during which time i've changed career, bought my first flat and acquired my first grey hairs yet the same problems with the hawk get discussed time and time again without any action from ccp.....no wait......i forgot.....they gave it spinny bits and borked rockets.please ccp fix the hawk otherwise many years from now i'll end up as a senile old man in a care home confusing the nurses by asking for one more mid slot to fit a web."
7/17/2009,"clip size is another issue, anyone who's used rockets much will know how long 10 seconds can feel when someone's shooting you and you're waiting for your launchers to reload, however i've done some eft warrioring to show the case in point.using all level 5 skills and one damage mod i switched between having reload time included and not included and the results were:3x 150mm autocannon on a jag - 133dps / 141dps (94.3%)4x rockets on a hawk - 109dps / 123dps (88.6%)more important that the paper numbers however is the point in game where you have to reload. i can't ever remember having to reload in a jag during a 1vs1 however it's common in a rocket ship:hawk, bcu, 4 launchers and lvl 5 skills gives a volley damage of 242 and there's 40 rockets in a clip so if you magically hit for full damage every time you'll do a total of 9,680 damage, the jag in comparison does 24,480 damage before it needs to reload.the clip size needs doubled at least."

7/17/2009,"i am not 100% sure that the arazu/lach/keres are as out of whack as the minmatar recons. with advanced damp skills trained, recon/eaf v, and sound fitting the gallente boats are fully capable of shutting down an individual ship in two-even three-different ways:-warp disruption from extended range.-warp scram from extended range shutting down mwd's.-skilled arazu/lach pilot should be able to damp to under 21km any non-sensor-boosted ship other than a recon.not to mention intelligent damp users on both recons having the ability to follow wingman ewar cycles with porked lock times on multiple targets...even supporting mid-long range engagements by damping down target range of multiple ships. this of course is depending on the pilot to not suck and fit/fly correctly.compared to the minmatar ability to use 60% long range webs (currently pretty bleah) and the ridiculous situational use (or pointlessness) of the painter bonus i would suggest the minnie recons/eaf's are far more broken in terms of overall usefulness.and yeah...i'm gonna add the gallente recons shortly to my personal stable (with prop jam v and advanced damps to l4 ).anyway-i have edited the op for a bit of clarity. and much <3 to mazz for actually taking to time to pay attention to the wee folk's suggestions amoungst the general high snr present in this forum area. i'm glad i voted for you ."

7/17/2009,"so you could just use a single ship, a rapier at 10km range? rapiers are supposed to stop ships, and they aren't doing that right now."
7/17/2009,"so you want a solo pwn-mobile? its an mmo, why don't you team up with somebody? warp scramblers were introduced for exactly this reason, to stop people! webifiers only slow them down."
7/17/2009,"the days of the solo ""pwn-mobile"" rapier/huginn went away with the damp balance (unless target bs/bc/hac pilots were stupid). the dps capabilities of both ships are fairly bleah which is how they should be given they are-or should be-force multipliers in any given engagement.with the huge whine over speed fits (which i personally had no issue with given i was-and remain-known for flying with up to 4 webs onboard) the speed balance was introduced along with an excessive penalty to web-bonussed ships.to take the vagabond example-given that the role of the minnie recons is to slow them (and everything else for that matter) and dictate range (key bit)...they simply cannot espcially when dealing with multiple targets. remember key=force multiplier. a competent vagabond pilot can currently overheat the mwd to speeds approaching 5km/s. 60% of 5km/s=roughly a crapload faster than a mwd'ing rapier/huginn.look..prior to the current state of affairs i would cheerfully pack triple webs and a flight of ewar drones allowing me to web multiple targets and send ewar around the battlefield as needed. again...force multiplier.while 90% webs were a bit overpowered...60% webs are underpowered given the role of the minnie recons...and the failhyena. i am offering a compromise that is reasonable, balanced, and probably easy to implement for at least a test drive on sisi.and chucking out comments like ""fit a scrambler"" is random silliness really. if you don't support the idea...state why you don't support it and leave it there and i'm sure your comments will be taken onboard by those that may actually read and find the proposal worth a second look.cheersbone"

7/17/2009,"i'd support this. the rapier is only capable of holding one ship at the moment, compared to an arazu which could damp 2-3 (or tackle 2-3), or especially the falcon which can jam several ships at once. for a question of balance, look at the rapier and it's ability to be a force multiplier. then look at the falcon and it's ability to be a force multiplier. though, i must say, one web should be enough to keep up with a vagabond; an overheating vaga with a single 60% web on will get to under 2k/second. two webs and they won't break 1k.. but the fact that a ship could be limited to ""only 900 m/s"" when the complete attention of a recon designed to use webs to slow other ships is on it... dual webs on an interceptor will not even slow it below 1000... two 60% webs as of now: 16% speed remaining (before stacking factors) 75% webs with the proposed change: 6.25% speed remaining (before stacking). suddenly, stacking webs to stop a target becomes powerful and viable, while a single web is not overpowered again by buffing it to 90%. alternatively, more midslots please."
7/17/2009,"heres why this doesnt really work:pilgrim(amarr, allied with caldari) gets an effectiveness bonus.falcon(caldari, allied with amarr) gets an effectiveness bonus.buuuut the gallente/minmatar get a range bonus instead.range bonus on rapier.range bonus on arazu.----------------now if amarr/caldari recons (cloaky) get range bonuses i might support this."
7/17/2009,bumped b/c i care
7/17/2009,"motherships don't make sense as frontline ships, they're more of a giant logistics / long range support ship (fighters). this is not, however, an entertaining way to play. i'd be all for buffing supercaps if there weren't so many titans in the game. as it is, titans need to be easy to kill, because they're no longer a rarity. when you can have a dozen titans on one side, it won't be an 'epic battle to kill one', you'll just have more titans warp in and nuke everything off the field to save the tackled titan, unless the titan goes down quickly. edit: unless the proposed titan change came as well. personally, i'd make the doomsday a single target 100k damage with a rof of a minute or so. this way, the titan can melt through battleships, but has to stay on the field and fight rather than nuking the field and warping out. or a titan class siege module, capital turrets that can track battleships and the ability to be rr'd (unlike a dread in siege), basically making the titan fight like an improved dreadnought designed to kill battleships. though 6 capital turrets and a doomsday would work nicely against capitals, too... thinking it's role in battle compared to a dread would be similar to a mothership compared to a carrier."
7/17/2009,"i disagree,rigs while having a heavy cost where imo more about getting a bonus in one area for a sacrifice in another area. they do this quite well and people have chosen to ignore or sacrifice aspects of their ships they don't care about for important parts (shield/armour rigs).also i think this is actually going to push it further away from cookie cutter setups, after all there's say 10 good or 20 ok ways to rig your ship. so now cause there's 20 more options for your frigates that will greatly change it's performance it's more cookie cutter? not even sure how you get that =s"
7/17/2009,"since you cant search corp assets and see contents of containers, and containers are the only way to be 99% secure with assets in eve these days, corps have their hands tied. theft is such a prolific problem in eve that noone trusts anyone anymore. also the corp has no way to track assets at all, once it enters the corp hangar its in the black hole no papertrail. now i understand that ccp wants the whole harsh world sh*t happens aspect to eve which is great, but theres really no way to defend yourself or your corp anymore.the usual chain of events.something goes missing, you look other corp mates look, you dont find it.so you petition it wait a week and a half and ccp says the items still exist but are in posession of another player and therefore we cannot disclose their whereabouts.though adding an audit log wouldnt eliminate the problem it would how ever allow leadership to rid the corp of the theif immediately. cause as it stands with game mechanics if your good you will never get caught because theres no way to track assets, in and out of a corp hangar without using containers. containers arent bad either but they are at current game mechanics black holes where items once put inside cant be searched or found, unless your in system with the container."
7/17/2009,support
7/17/2009,"supported.best defense is not putting all your eggs in one basket, limiting as much fingering of the eggs, or no eggs in the basket at all. however, you shouldn't have to ask ccp what happened to the items, you should be able to retrieve it somehow on your own, however generic the information is."
7/17/2009,"hmm yeah, existing auditing tools really suck for this purpose."
7/17/2009,"supported, there isn't much you can do versus corp theft atm other than putting everything really restricted areas. even then you can't always trust people higher up with roles from time to time.audit logs to corp hangars are in my eyes a must especially for people who live purely in posses."
7/17/2009,"yeah, the system sucks. containers need to be ripped apart and recoded from the ground up - they simply don't do what they need to do. i don't support adding audit logs to corp hangars, but i do entirely support making containers functional."
7/17/2009,also true. its a sentance i hear all too often about eve nowadays
7/17/2009,"completely agree if not audit logs in the corp hangar then rework containers so that they can do the job. with a role like security officer, and the ability to check member hangars why isnt there a way to track items cause as it stands. something happens and if you think its worth it you can go through all the members hangars and find out that it was prolly traded to an out of corp alt**link to mazz's can thread good side note to this post*linkage"
7/17/2009,"well yeah, this is what happens when you read a forum i post in i've said that about(and this list is not exhaustive) containers, pos mechanics, the corp interface, the industry interface, the interface in general, every social-networking type tool eve has(forums, mail, etc), intel systems, and probably half a dozen other things. i love the core of eve, but all the crap that accumulates around it i can't stand."
7/17/2009,"i thought you guys were talking about different kinds of cans,oh well i still support it."
7/17/2009,"i support the idea of only one of these cans, and that's if it could be anchored. mainly because i think the game punishes players that can only afford or only have 1 account and try to mine. jet can mining has long been a way to abuse these players, as well as people that aren't smart enough to use 2 accounts or more to successfully remove ore from a belt(but these i don't care about).i'm not a miner, but there isn't really anything giant about a gsc when you're running a slowly driven hulk/covetor around a belt, so you don't have to risk what little you're already making to a thieving pilot.as said above, i support some of this idea."
7/17/2009,i have a different container proposal already up that simplifies things a little bit more then this thread does. its going to be presented at csm meeting after next.
7/17/2009,looks like this issue went completely off the rails at csm 3.004turned into a discussion about 0.0 ratting.would like to see it raised again but this time focusing on caldari vrs others.
7/17/2009,you don't like the csm response so you want csm to raise it again?
7/17/2009,"dr battlesmith, like so many frequenting this forum, doesnt lke to consider the impact of proposals on other aspects of gameplay besides the immediately relevant.now, on topic- new agents should be spread around lowsec."

7/17/2009,i like!
7/17/2009,fully supported.especially that it could be easilly implemented without any special updates.

7/17/2009,i am completely in support of removing insurance payouts for concord actions. i think the current mechanic is ridiculous.
7/17/2009,supported
7/17/2009,"lets take away insurance for self destructs too and id say its fairthe measure still doesnt stop the use of stealth bombers for suicide ganking too, or really really expensive kills. if implemented, i suspect this will lead to more deaths as carebears think its finally safe to come out of the station and carry even higher values in the freighters."
7/17/2009,yes yes and yesremove insurance and to counterbalance that remove last concord-boostit should be easier to gank macrominers and ganking for tactical or isk-reasons again and also it should discourage ganking just for the lulz.
7/17/2009,i'd agree to that. no insurance payout for self-destructs or concord actions. neither makes sense.
7/17/2009,we also have to look at the sheer stupidity of it. why would your insurance company pay you for your ship loss when you did something illegal and got owned by the police? it's obsurd. it would go a long way towards curbing the lulz incidents. hell saturday there were 30 pirates ganking noobs outside a station in amarr. that will really expand the player base idiots.
7/17/2009,"supported, again!"
7/17/2009,"i must have found over 60 officers since they were introduced, i can't really count them all. i had every officer in game except hakimif you login right after dt and spawn all belts you can, you get about 1 officer per week (a few times i had 2 officers in 1 day).i'd say, about 75% of all officers i ever found happened during first 2 hours after dt.as it is now, the people who login right after dt have a huge advantage in making big money in 0.0"
7/17/2009,"ccp should rather nerf lvl 4 income, tbh."
7/17/2009,"this is a better idea, but i still support raising bounties.incidentally, all these proposal threads, how much support do you need before anyone actually gives a toss?"
7/17/2009,"agree with ephemeron.the faction spawns at this time are really worthless...the nerf to them was a total load of bull.and a slight correction to bounties as well wouldn't hurt. ephemeron, come to n-54. want your gotan's 425mm's/"
7/17/2009,"while i see the selfish benefit of raising 0.0 bounties, i don't see a good logical backing for that idea. i really doubt ccp will be moved to take that step. so i propose a fix that makes more sense, that they are more likely to act upon.also, why do you need gotan's 425? i don't think any of you got the balls to fly with them fitted, sorry to say - being realistic"
7/17/2009,not supported and pls dont write an another topic for i need more officer spawn in 0.0
7/17/2009,"if u would have spend some time reading the above posts serious, u would have seen that it isnt the issue here."
7/17/2009,"i think any sort of 0.0 ratting boost will have to be in the form of improving materials drops, not isk bounties. remember whatever is done, isk farmers will abuse it to the furthest extent possible. if we increase bounties, that will increase inflation and undo what we are trying to do.how about this idea?the unnamed module drops should be removed, and high meta level named modules drops increased. and leave isk bounties, faction, officer, everything else as they are. adjust rates so the average income with a typical battleship appropriately fit to the local area will turn in about 20 mil per hour(if i recall the average is 12 right now?). anyways my goal is a 40-60% increase. after office spawns and such are accounted for, that's not really that big of a boost but for casual players who cant check belts after dt, it is probably significant.that would help casual players make a bit more money while also forcing isk farmers to deal more with stations/poses while bringing in their haul and therefore potential dangers posed by players. it would also reduce costs for casual players when fitting their ships since they have to buy less t2(i know it wont reduce the real costs since those named mods cost time to get, but it makes things more convenient). for members who rat and are in large alliances at war, they basically cant participate unless there is a reimbursmenet program running funded by moongold. that's how it was when goon+bob+aaa+pl+etcetera were going at it, we just threw battleships at each other that were funded by infinite money anyways. i know its not like that anymore with the war over but my point is that ratting is not a good primary method of income, compared to everything else you can do in the game. and ratting is the primary method of income for many casual players.i want to put some more thought into this issue before i actually start writing a proposal, so i'd appreciate some feedback on this post as it is. keep in mind i haven't personally ratted seriously for a long time, and most of my information about ratting is a little old or secondhand."
7/17/2009,"it will nerf ratting income, not increase it.currently a player ratting in bad 0.0 can get more than 10 millions/hour in minerals from recycling loot.with your proposal he would have a lot of meta 1-4 items that will recycle for less minerals and be worthless as they are over-abundant. so you would exchange 10+ millions in minerals for modules that will refine for 3-4 millions and will not sell as everyone in that area will have tons of them."
7/17/2009,"i wasnt aware that named mods recycle for less minerals then unnamed. so leave unnamed drops in there, but increase frequency of high-metalevel mod drops."
7/17/2009,"not that sure ratting needs a boost to be honest. everything needs to be looked at to fix the risk/reward between high sec lvl4 missions and anything in low or no sec.add to this that it probably needs to be tied into the probable changes to 0.0, sov and all that for it to make sense i think it might be hard to balance without tweeking just about every source of income in the game."
7/17/2009,"i have always been of the opinion that nerfing highsec missions would simply cause a cancelled subscription problem for ccp. i've always been under the impression that many people are not willing to take assets to lowsec or 0.0 for any reason, and that the solution for balancing is to increase the rewards of low/0sec while leaving highsec untouched.i do think that changing 0.0 ratting will have a big impact on the game but i think that it needs to be looked at for the sake of casual players who tend to use this resource more then anyone else."
7/17/2009,"npc'ing has a very big impact and simply nerfing l4's isnt a option ether. adjusting drop rates can a solution but i think this need to be studied by ccp. different rats drop different loot that refines/sells for different amounts. so a general solution can be difficult. the perfect solution could be adding a ""proof"" of killing a npc at a concord station vs fixed prices. im talking about adding items similar to the blue sleeper scripts that are in every sleeper wreck. a bs should drop a more valued script than a cruiser. this would make it fair vs the ratter that chains for more bs spawns and the one that kills every npc for the chance on a faction npc. or maybe bringing back the old 'logs"" that did drop a year ago random from each rat and let those be worth something at concord stations. because this happens totaly random only the looters will profit and it wont profit the macro users. i have no idea how much they should be worth. i think my last solution is better than the first 1. maybe to avoid inflation u get lp's vs the 'logs"" and a brand new concord lp store. this would make ratting vs missioning more in line and the macro's dont get any lp's.exact numbers are hard to come with, i think only ccp can figur that out with complicated loot drop formulas. for that reson i think ccp need to come with a solution were they can live with after they placed l4 mission next to npc'ing"
7/17/2009,"the integrating belt ratting and lp store rewards idea is an interesting one. i think macros would still get lp's just like anyone else but increasing the income by allowing people to accumulate points for faction ships and other stuff like that would not negatively impact any pre-existing established markets(t2 mods, minerals, isk inflation). if this came along with a faction ships buff to encourage pvpers to use them we could buff ratting income without causing any item price crashes in major markets - while at the some time invigorating the faction ships market. definitely needs more study though."
7/17/2009,"i agree that plainly nerfing mission running isn't the right way either.i just think that there are no quick and easy fixes and everything will have to be looked at since it all connects. for simplicities sake lets assume we add more module drops to ratting in 0.0, how does that in turn affect mining profitability?so just boosting ratting is in my opinion a bit to simple as it can have serious effects to either inflation (making the boost worthless) or other professions (increasing the mineral supply from module reprocessing).it is a hard balance which means it doesn't have simple sollutions."
7/17/2009,"nothing is simple, even implementing this stuff is pretty difficult. thats why i have created this propasal, to do some brain storming, comming to conclusions and realising there is a problem that effects alot of people playing this game on a daily basis. its up to the csm and ccp to really think this out. in the mean while, the best idea i have seen yet for this problem is the lp store idea in combination of collecting dropt items that can be handed over for lp's at concord stations, if anyone has more idea's pls keep posting"
7/17/2009,"ive always liked the idea of point defense guns but not on the capitals. make a t2 destroyer thats a flak ship or something dont put it on capitals, if im flying my ms and i need to get drones off me i smartbomb with officer bombs and they pop nicely if little ships are bothering me i lauch appropriate drones 20 warrior 2's make quick work of most lil ships if they are in a bubble with ya."
7/17/2009,"real life, is real life. when bismarck sunk, it was hours and hours of intence atlantic chase and a mighty sea battle untill they sunk it/it sunk it self.how ever, point is that to sink such a ship you needed a couple of ships in it's size. like hms hood (may they all rest in peace). shure maybe a few topedo bombers got in a torpedo or more. point is, bismarck went solo, and died. no mather all the pds on the ship. and honestly, the only real threat an aa battery on a wwii ship could take down was fighters, becouse the danger, aka bombing airplanes were simply flying to high. so, if we put this into eve (that is a game) perhaps a titan could fend off a couple of hobgoblin i's. no more, no less with a pds. all the other ships simply have to much range. and why would anyone try to point a titan with an interceptor, as the op stated; only hictors can accually hold titans/mm's (and that's outside 20km range. i know, i'm a hictor pilot). so if your flagship goes flying on it's own, even with a pds, that isn't overpowered, it aint going to do any difference really. a solo ""flagship"" dies, in eve and in wwii.so, no support.phooedit, minor spelling misstake."
7/17/2009,"the best defense is not being alone and doing stupid things with your super cap(that you can't get out of). which if you are flying it stupidly, you should lose the ship...sometimes the hardest lesson, is the most expensive to learn.not supported.ps - not bashing you, don't even know you..."
7/17/2009,supported. it makes no sense for a powerful ship to be threatened by small ships that do not require much of a protection. on the other hand the balance factor of the game has to considered carefully.
7/17/2009,support fleets. capitals are not supposed to be solopwnmobiles.
7/17/2009,"if your cap ship pilot is stupid enough to engage a sub cap fleet without support, they deserve to die. it is as simple as that. we do not want the times back where motherships were basically invincible in lowsec."
7/17/2009,"wow, the goons have finally gotten something right!this is a great/wonderful/amazing/incredible... idea.a concern that i do have is moving from the current system to this new system. would it be just a mad scramble to set up planetary structures? would sovereignty disappear when the new system is implemented, leaving the space vulnerable until the planetary modules are anchored?i love the idea of naturally spawning npc's that fight for you, but will they spawn in belts? if they do will they attack normal rats? if not, will they spawn in the belts and simply not attack the rats? also, can their aggression behavior be set by the alliance, and if so, what about nrds space where the alliance has no standing slots left?what kind of other structures do you have in mind and what functions do you propose they have from two different perspectives?1) what kind of actual functions will the structures serve other than sovereignty holding?2) what is to prevent an alliance from filling their space to the gills with these things so that when they are destroyed the ""confidence level"" barely goes down.an idea that i had a little while ago was mini pos's which could be anchored anywhere except asteroid belts. they could be set up by individuals within a corp instead of the corp as a whole. something like this might be an interesting addition, growing confidence and making individuals have somewhere to go that is entirely their own. of course they would need to be scaled down drastically both in terms of their defensive capability as well as their fuel cost but i think it would be great to see something like this.sorry for my scatterbrained response, but i think that more tweaking needs to be done to this idea and i wanted to cover some issues. thumbs up but keep developing."
7/17/2009,i need to think about it more but so far i like it
7/17/2009,"very interesting idea. as many have pointed out, it needs additional work but it's an excellent start."
7/17/2009,"the general idea is good, only problem is that it isn't specific enough - there's too much left for interpretation. it could be implemented in a way that would totally rock or totally suck. we should encourage ccp game designer team to flesh out this concept, but we shouldn't throw all support on whatever they come up with. we need to wait and see for the details. i'd estimate that fleshing out this concept to a good level of detail would take about 1 week, and if they commit to it, it would take like half a year to implement. so it's quite serious undertaking"
7/17/2009,"i agree. this is needed, specifically with the corporation / alliance logos and manufacturing ""stamps""."
7/17/2009,"i don't support the idea of having personalization. it seem cool, but at the end of the day...having another issue for the client/servers to figure out before going into a major engagement, jumping through gates etc etc, just seems like a larger problem than anything it could bring into the game.and i'm pretty sure there will be some ways to custimize things once amb. is fully deployed, for people to go crazy with.leave teh ships alone."
7/17/2009,"they had to make a lot of changes to slow all the ships down, i don't see any sense in going back over speed again so soon or ever to be honest."
7/17/2009,"i see a lot of people who honestly believe that speed tactics should not be part of a well designed space ship combat game. i find it hard to understand, since logically it makes perfect sense that space ship warfare would have speed and maneuverability as cornerstone of many strategies. not only it makes sense from theoretical point of view, it also makes good sense in terms of fun factor - as more fast paced combat tends to stimulate stronger emotional response - more excitement."
7/17/2009,"they overly nerfed something that wasn't nearly as broke as they made it seem. speeds were bad, but most people agreed that though change was needed, their patch was over compensating for a problem. god forbid they should have done half of what they did to start, with the other parts on the back burner to patch in fast if the first attempt wasn't enough.hell most people just wanted more counters to speed and all else could have been left alone. instead, we got speed nerfed to oblivion, counters added on top of it and the result is a disaster for any sort of close range warfare besides rr."
7/17/2009,"the nerf was needed imo but did go too far. pushing speed/agility up to more of a middle-ground would be nice although i'm not sure your changes are the ones to do it. ludicrous speed is bad, speed as a tactic is good though and is something that is missing a bit from current mechanics."
7/17/2009,"i didn't say they shouldn't be or can't still be. i do believe that it was rampant and most people couldn't compete with what some dedicated players ran with, because they could. yea it was fun to do, yes fights could be fast paced. but, to assume it needs another overhaul because ofeverything it used to be, is a bit absurd. with everything they changed, the game just got slower, though webs took a hit during this and scrams now kill mwd's.i for one wouldn't have cared if they left it alone but, it's already been done and i think there are more things that need work on, than another speed change.i don't think that's the case. there isn't anyone stopping people from running speed fit ships now. maybe not to the same effect as before, but i think that's due more to the ""counters"" than anything else. even if they left everything alone, and added only the counters, it would still take reasonably the same styles of ships it takes now to catch a speedy ship. being slower as everything is, other than the frigate buff(minus inties), it still seems the bigger issue has become the counters, they're more detrimental to these styles of gangs."
7/17/2009,"i also think speeds need rebalancing, taking care mostly of the smaller ships, first of all interceptors. interceptors meant to intercept ships, thus they really need to get there in no minute, and since they have paper thin defenses, their only mean of surviving is speed.imo interceptors need drastic changes. (i'd even consider whether give them a role-bonus that mwd ""survives"" scrambling (they are too light so cannot drift through scram range) at least for 1 of every racial interceptors instead of the prop jam cap bonus --- like ranis: it has no wd and ws range bonus, so it has to get in scram range if wants to scram, otherwise should be overpimped, and unlike ares that has wd/ws range bonus so only overpimped ships can scram it if flown properly)speed-centric cruisers (and hacs) need some small changes."
7/17/2009,"yeah, but when have you ever known ccp to do something in multiple steps? that would imply that they didn't overcompensate enough the first time. i think the fastest i've ever seen anything get fixed is the year and a half it took to even start making black ops viable. ccp simply does not revisit things and make second rounds of changes anywhere near as often as they'd have to for your suggestion to work."
7/17/2009,"why does everyone assume speed tanking had anything to do with nanoships? whether or not the people who whined noticed, a nanovaga going.. say.. 8k a second might be hard to hit... but it's also moving too fast for it's own guns to track. with the exception of the ishtar, nanoships had to slow down to deal damage, making themselves vulnerable. the thing is, they'd only do this when it was convenient; if they thought they would die, they'd just fly off, disengaging. the rapier, heavy neuts, etc.. all good counters. but only if the nano-ships chose to engage. you cannot lock a 5-6k a second ship before it flies 40km away from you, especially as it's unlikely to start 0km from you.. so, to all those who never flew nanos or knew how they worked: they could speed tank, but not while fighting. they were paper thin when caught, but good at disengaging. they did not go 20 km/second, they went about 5-6 on most good fits. just because a faction fit high grade snake vagabond with a claymore and a faction microwarpdrive, overheating, hit 20km/second does not mean it was a) common or b) practical. see also the rarity of high grade snake clones with multibillion isk ships and a command ship to provide bonuses, overheating constantly. ----- with that out of the way: i supported the nano-nerf. not because i think nano-ships were invincible, or had amazing speed tanks, or 'they go 20km/second and my drake can't hit them'. it was diversity. a gang would be reported. before ship types were even known, i would estimate it would look something like.. ""vagabond vagabond vagabond zealot zealot zealot zealot ishtar ishtar ishtar rapier falcon falcon"".. nothing but nano-hacs, rapiers, and falcons. always. every day. for months. a new gang? oh, hey, we get to fight nanoships again. it was clearly a broken mechanic due to the ease of disengaging. it was too easy. now, it's a bit too hard to skirmish. you can warp off easily enough, but floating around at long ranges while on the field has taken a significant hit. honestly, the nano patch would have been fine with just the nano/poly changes and stacking penalties. the mwd speed nerf? unnecessary. removing the booster? overkill. nerfing snakes? why? lowering base speeds? i would be in support of adding, say, 10-25% speed to most ships. (a max speed in space always seemed a bit silly to begin with.. ), but the way the game is coded, too much more would bring imbalance. to counter this, give the rapier some teeth again, maybe a 5% web strength bonus per level along with the range. --- also: i find it ironic that ccp thought it would be a good idea to nerf webs (because fighting inside web range was suicidal), only to add a module with more or less the same range that ruins you just as badly as webs used to. the warp scrambler. they might as well have just changed the names, the effect is the same. i do not support changing the ship masses/bonuses individually. nerfing the way people fly now to make a ship into a nano-ship hurts variety, rather than helps it. just give the option to have it fit either way, rather than nerfing it's damage and boosting it's speed. question for the op, though: why do you assume range and speed are mutually exclusive? it's a combination of the two. if you're faster and have range, you have the advantage. 'close range' and speed only mix if you're trying to get into range quickly, rather than maintaining range. (see: deimos as opposed to the vagabond.)"
7/17/2009,"i like current speeds just fine, in fact i haven't any complain bout them in over a year."
7/17/2009,"a ceptor once dropped that much, it's random but definitely worth it if you want to remove hacs from the market and inflate their prices"
7/17/2009,"oh, for sure it can happen. but what are the odds? this is why i ask about the average hac, not the best-case hac. the best case is a salvage that's worth more than the hull, but if you want to go sding to find out if you can get that, you'd better be prepared to enjoy your lorentz fluid and trigger units."
7/17/2009,"about the tech 3 stuff, you not only have the hull itself but all the subsystems. with all the possibilities of configurations, i don't see it being easy or even probable to come up with a proper insurance estimate."
7/17/2009,"such a proposal would mean ccp need to actively stay up to date to make sure the default payouts are below the average price. its a difficult thing to execute and would also end up raising t2 prices such that there's probably little reduction in cost in the end. t2/t3 prices are caused by greater player demand then there is supply, thats why for these items the prices are especially sensitive to ebb and flow of demand caused by patches or other trends"
7/17/2009,"i have seen it on multiple occassions now: people that are afk, harassing a ratting system by cloaking up and going afk for hrs. for u guys not in 0.0: a hostile in system means u have to be extra careful and ideally not rat/mine in the system's belts.imo this should not be possible. gameplay and other players should only be influenced by people that are actually behind the computer, or at least the game should be geared towards that.imo there is an easy fix for afk-cloaking. add a cycle to cloaks of like 10 mins, and when the cycle ends, a window pops up where u get 20 seconds to decide if u want to stay cloaked (without decloaking). that way if u go afk you will be able to be probed out after 10 minutes because ur cloak dropped. if u r actually cloaked and behind the keyboard you can just click 'yes' in the pop-up window and stay cloaked without anything happening."
7/17/2009,it looks like someone is at the wrong end of a local desensitization campaign.
7/17/2009,not supported.risk vs reward. either you risk it and get your bounties or you dock up. or you go into the neighbor system.
7/17/2009,no support. stalking a system is a valid tactic. a good cloaker wants you to think he is afk even when he is not. your proposal is easily exploited by macro.
7/17/2009,"changing the game like that for people that seem to be afk and cloaked is a waste of time in my opinion. however, i think the idea that was once mentioned(not sure if it's still an idea or being worked on), where cloaking really doesn't erase sig radius it only lowers it. if that were to be implemented, afk cloakers would start to be eaten on a daily basis until people stopped doing."
7/17/2009,"frankly, there is no difference in someone being afk cloaked and being afk in a station, unless you plan to dock and check every station in a system. frankly, you should be as vigilant as possible at all times when in an area that requires it.no support."
7/17/2009,"you are not talking about me, are you? don't worry, this problem will go away when ccp finally nerfs local chat"
7/17/2009,"lol, i am not saying it's not a valid tactic, hell it's a great tactic. nothing against cloaking whatsoever. what my problem is, is that i can log on in a hostile pocket, cloak up, and go to my girlfriend for the evening while the guys active in that system have to worry over a ghost player that is actually having different kinda fun."
7/17/2009,not supported
7/17/2009,"]""would you like to keep firing on your target?""then we'd be absolutely sure that no one was ever afk, and the events of gameplay were only influenced by a real life player."
7/17/2009,"and there i am, cloaked up in some 0.0-0.4 system doing whatever business i might have there and rl comes into play and i have to leave my keyboard for whatever reason.see what i'm getting at?"
7/17/2009,"no support. cloaking is a valid tactic. an afk cloaker is not a threat. you don't have to be extra careful to avoid an afk cloaker; they're afk. you counter your own point with that. clearly, you're not sure that they are afk. if you were 100% sure they were afk, why are you being careful? are you afraid an afk cloaker will gank you? it comes down to this: if they're afk, they're not a threat. if they're a threat, and thus not afk, then your proposal is meaningless. also, if you really do need to go afk for some reason, why should you automatically lose your ship to probers? a good solution to removing the 'afk cloaker' threat would be to remove local. then you don't have to see them! it is a bit silly that local will throw up a red flag to a cloaked ship, making it no less capable to stealthily approach you.. without intense patience. until you think they're afk. (but, again, you can't cry afk cloaker when a cloaker who has been there a while kills you. they're obviously not afk."
7/17/2009,"alter reinforcement timer engagement from 25 percent to 90 percent of control tower shield. in this scenario one could disrupt hostile control towers with a smaller fleet yet have to meet up full force when reinforcement timer ends to destroy it. this also gives attacker an advantage given that the defender does not have an alt nearby to set ""correct"" stronthium levels."
7/17/2009,proposal doesnt make sense.
7/17/2009,currently control towers enter reinforcement mode when shields get below 25 percent. make it 90 percent instead.
7/17/2009,oh now i understand. so it takes away the ability for an alliance to generate a quick response in favor of forcing them to respond for one's only chance to save a tower?one of the few good things about pos wars is that you can stront the towers so your people dont have to set their alarm clocks to 3am every day. that is just way too much stress on an already stressful aspect of the game
7/17/2009,to alter your phrase a bit; one of the few bad things about pos wars is that one can stront the towers so my people have to set their alarm clocks to 3am every day.this just shifts the usage of alarm clocks to the defender.
7/17/2009,troll.
7/17/2009,this.
7/17/2009,this.not supported.
7/17/2009,"not supported an idea like this means that timezone wars become alarmclock wars just to defend. yes i am well aware the attacker needs to alarmclock it if the defense is good in an time zone war. the other thing is when you rf pos shield stays at 25% till it comes out if you were to start at 90% when it came out the pos would still have 37.5 million shields out of 50mil instead of 12.5. also with a dread fleet this gives about 5 minutes to get to the tower and restront it to a resonable hour for the defender, which could be nearly impossible. removing the defenders ability to restront is a serious advantage to the attackers that they dont deserve"
7/17/2009,"meh, i dunno. much as i'd like to see one, i think mining income is pretty low as it is, and this would devalue mining for most people considerably"
7/17/2009,yes. macro miners and afk players need their income increased .
7/17/2009,"it would not make every other mining ship obsolete because it would only be allowed to fly in low/null-security space. in order to high-sec mine, you'd have to use a hulk.of course. this is a part of the risk. same with rorquals. rorquals probably have as much trouble, if not more, than other mining ships in that security space.well, ganking is part of the risk. same with the rorqual, same with everything else. sure, the ships will be tough. but they'll be vulnerable, just like any other capital ship. the number of drones from the configuration i suggested would give it a good defense, but it won't have fighters, which is a significant deal.well, this would be the perfect counter; this could single-handedly mine a belt in short order. as well, it would also make holding null-sec territory more valuable, which goes back to the complaints about null-sec.i disagree; doing what you're suggesting makes the rorqual obsolete. i'm only thinking straight mining ship, but on a super scale. also, ten strip miners is impossible with the current game mechanics, unless they made a mid-slot version that could only fit onto that ship."
7/17/2009,"i had orginally posted this in features and ideas to get some input from others and adoped some of their input before i brought it here. link to orginal threadbasically, a form of siege/triage mode, unique to a mothership that creates a ""safe haven"" within hostile space to re-group, re-arm-, re-fit, and etc. kind of allowing it to fulfil its actual ""mother ship"" role.if the the removal of the cloaking ability for most ships (details below), and this added feature to the mom happened at the same time, it could remove some frustration that roaming gangs have had with cloakable ratters but still make cloaks useful to them, and dramatically increase the importance to having a mother ship with you on extented infiltration operations. details:cloaked assembly area generator: (requires stront)creates a ""pocket grid"" that cloaks everything within it from everything outside it, but leaves everyone within it visable to each other, unless cloaked by a module on their ship.-can perform most actions, such as; lock each other, swap ships from mom, jump to cyno, warp to and from ""pocket grid"", and etc.-cannot pop cyno within ""pocket grid"".-pocket grid should be about the size of a med or lg pos bubble.(other ideas?)proposed changes to cloaking:only t2/t3 ships with cloaking bonus/t1 astromectric ships actually cloak when using a cloaking device.all other ships can fit a cloak, but it dramtically reduces their sig radius instead of cloaking them.-they can't target while this is in effect.-they can be seen and targeted if you are on grid with them though, but their modified sig radius should apply to locking as well.open questions:should the clone vat bay on the mom be acccesible?should the ""cloaked assembly area"" be scanable?-if scannable, you should never be able to warp to any closer than ~200-300km with even a 100% hit.-maybe have a random 500km warpin, +/- 250km on a 100% hit.-you would need to observe non-cloaked ships entering and leaving to get a good idea of where it is at, or sweep for it with inties. see linky for orginal discussion regarding this.other info:-this isn't a shield, its a pocket grid that cloaks all within it from the rest of the solar system. -an enemy could enter the ""pocket grid"" just as easily as anyone else, if it's found, even cloaked.-might want to allow the mom to be targeted while it's in this mode, but its defenses should be far greater than normal. -the pocket grid probably shouldn't be able to be created on an existing perminate grid, such as a pos, astral body, station, and etc.issues:devs have stated that the issue with making some cloaked ships scannable is that the actual model is removed from game when they are cloaked.-this could be an issue with making everyone cloaked to the outside environment, but not to each other.-could be a significant redesign of current mechanics.please visit orginal post to see other input."
7/17/2009,"no... no you didn't. your profits will drop when someone scans down your plex regardless of whether they scan it down with this 'loophole' or not. your primary argument against this tactic is that you only have 6 seconds and need to mash your directional scanner to see something coming- which is simply untrue. you stay aligned, and when you see someone landing on your grid, you hit warp.old system: you stay aligned, you see probes on scan, you warp outnew system: you stay aligned, you see ships on grid, you warp outsorry- how is that any different? in both cases, you're forced to dock or safe up until the hostiles leave, and in both cases, assuming you aren't afk, you get your ship out alive.lrn2argue plox"
7/17/2009,"alternatively, i do think it would be reasonable and make sense to be allowed to add probes to the overview- so if you were really that scared about being probed out, you could setup an overview just to scan for probes, thus, not having to scroll through the endless list of the unchecked 'use active overview settings' box."
7/17/2009,"well then you dont make sense. if you mean- you are trying to protect your ship whilst it is in a mission - then it is very easy to do, aligning, scanning, scouting, checking killboards, checking corps. you state you have never been killed in your mission despite being unexpectedly probe so you obviously have no problem with this.but if you mean- you want to protect the mission itself, then no amount of scanning will do this. even if we go back to pre patch scan times (22 seconds with max skills) you would not protect the mission, simply have more time to spot the probes and warp outeven if ccp were to give you an auto scanner, your mission would still be busted, and you would be unable to return to it to complete it - so would lose the isk and standings.lowsec is tougher then highsec, and rightly so. its about surviving, and is in fact very easy to do. its not about risk free isk - if that is what you want go to high sec."
7/17/2009,"difference between two systems.pre-apocrypha: i could still mission even with neutrals and pirates in the system as long as probes were not visible on my scanner, because there was a reasonable probability that i wasn't being scanned.post-apocrypha: probers can do their probing with directional scanner almost exclusively, only having to rely on probes for about 5 seconds. what this translates is dont mission with even one neutral in system.again, before apocrypha i could still mission even with neuts and pirates in the system as long as i was paying attention. after apocrypha i cannot take that chance anymore because the odds stack greatly against me.yes, there are other precautions i can take not to get killed, such as dropping a can at warp-in, aligning, etc. this doesn't protect my mission itself. it simply gives me chance to get out of there alive.anything else i do, even bringing in my own blob, will not allow me to bring my isk earner out (my pve ship). basically, one neutral in system = dont make isk."
7/17/2009,"i don't just want to survive in low sec. i want to make isk in low sec. i know how to survive in low sec quite well. but the reasons for me being there are dwindling. i can no longer assume that if i don't see probes on my scanner chances are i'm not being probed. <== thinking this after apocrypha is a very rash decision. by the way, i don't want a fail-proof system (100% accuracy). i just want a system that just as pre-apocrypha, gives me a fair chance at detecting probes. that is all i'm asking for. a 5-second window is ridiculous."
7/17/2009,"dude- i don't understand what part of this you don't get. if someone scans out your mission now, it's the same as if they scanned it out pre-apoc. the only difference is that you don't find out until they've almost found you. hence, you align out, and hit warp when you see a hostile on grid.please explain to me how this is at all different from the pre-patch system?you discover that a hostile player is scanning out your mission, you dock up. nothing has changed except for the time it takes to find you."
7/17/2009,"it's not the same.in one scenario i'm still able to mission as long as i'm careful and watching my onboard scanner. post-apocrypha i cannot take that risk, my scanner is unreliable. one situation i can still make isk. on another situation i can't.for example:pre-apoc: 5 neutrals in system. i can still mission up until point i see probes on scanner.post-apoc: scanner is almost completely useless. i'm better off docking.see the difference?"
7/17/2009,and remember that pre-apoc it took time placing the probes in place. at least it took more than just 5 seconds. scanner for mission runners is now crap. it doesn't help unless you're spamming it every 5 seconds.
7/17/2009,"and if you insist it's the same, then just give me the thumbs up in increasing the window in detecting probes to something much higher than 5 seconds, since after all, it's the same and won't affect anything, right?. .it's all i'm asking and as you put it, it's the same."
7/17/2009,"no it didnt. i would have bookmarks everywhere in system. literally 100 bookmarks in the mission running systems - and this was by no means a large amount for the pro scanners.i would use the d scanner, narrow down the direction, warp to a close bookmark, and drop the highest strength probe.from your posts you seem to have little clue about probing.you talk about pre apoc probes and how great the system was when in fact your looking at the revelation patch where they went from multiple probes to needing only one single probe.you also took nearly four months to realise that the probing system had changed in the apo patch. your original thread title was ""being probed down with no probes on scan"". you are flying around in low sec without even taking a cursory look at 4 month old patch notes you claim to not be concerned about being killed in a mission as you agree if you take precautions you are very unlikley to be caught, but continue to talk about ""protecting the mission"". if the mission spot has been located, whether bythree probes overlaping (pre revelation)one single 22 second probe (pre apo - (my favourite system incidentally)4 movable probes and a 5 second scan (current situation)the mission is now found. you cannot run that mission from then on. the method of finding the mission is irrelevant. the one and only difference is the timescale you have to get out of your mission. but we have agreed using some simple methods you can escape from any mission under the current systemso whats the difference? you are confusing a lot of people with your posts, they are incoherent, perhaps deliberately soskunk"
7/17/2009,"in either situation, you just stay aligned, and if you see a neutral/hostile on grid, you warp off. there's no reason to even check your scanner for probes- just be ready to warp off if they enter your mission."
7/17/2009,"so basically, you're telling me forget the broken onboard scanner, just warp off once you're found! again, having my mission deadspace found isn't good for profits! do you run missions in low sec for profit? i want a way to keep an eye on probes so i don't compromise my mission deadspace!"
7/17/2009,i think you know the onboard scanner now is no good to us. yet you insist that things are the same as pre-apoc. i've told you already:pre-apoc i would not have a need to warp off if i didn't see probes with my onboard scanner because it meant there is a reasonable chance that i wasn't being probed even with pirates in the system. i could still run mission by keeping my eye on the scanner.now my pve ship spends most of its time docked up because compromising my mission deadspace is way too easy now.
7/17/2009,i'm getting the feeling you dont care about the consequences of your proposal for other areas of gameplay.
7/17/2009,"news flash:suddenly the 99% of eve players not bothered to learn how to use the scanner catch wind of a technique thats been around...err...years.seriously.without execessive detail the ""old"" method (without system bm web):-jump in and yell ""lolraven"" on scan.-narrow down and yell ""lolraveninmission""-warp around a bit getting as close as possible to 5au probe range. yell ""lolravenwithdronesout"".-press scan button 9 billion times (so rewarding training 6 months of skills for that eh? **** no)-get hit...warp to hit-""lolravenscrambledfortwoopenransomconvohahahaha""-""lolravenlogoffskiholdfiretilallhavepointsonpod""tl;dr:op has zero clue. directional scanner gives range/estimated location of target only. probes must still be launched, analyzed, and generally shifted a bit to the right spot for a warpable hit.not supported. stop making dumb threads."

7/17/2009,'forced'?
7/17/2009,sharing an account is not a bannable offence. just notice how many of the super-capital pilots that are shared aswell as recent shared accounts inbetween ebank members.
7/17/2009,"horrible idea.even a small corp with 6 members could end up swarming their opponents 24/7 with a dozen ships, operated in shift rotation by the corp members. also, corp theft would then include the option of character theft?sharing accounts should be a bannable offence. human resources are strategic resources, too. it is just lame to swap specialized characters around for maximum efficiency. it is bad enough that is already done by some, but it should never be officially supported."
7/17/2009,"this is pretty wacky, but i think i like it. i expect ccp will probably veto it, and it's entirely possible that they will have a good reason to do so, but it's worth asking about."

7/17/2009,i'd like to see probes which could give out false signatures. (people have been asking for those for ages anyway)making probing even a bigger cat and mouse game.

7/17/2009,"i just thought i'd ask. i always see ccp doing things for nul sec and this new fiasco that is called wormholes that will eventually turn into a perk for nul sec once again. they get all the ships and rewards for game playing while we sit in the back bench to be satisfied with crumbs like marauders that only fix a problem that ccp created when they made scanning mission runners more possible. that was hardly a step forward, rather a lame attempt to keep things from getting worse.i might accept all this nonsense except what about the chance to invade nul sec and claim something for empire. this facion war is only against npc and has rather bogged down. if ccp want to force us to pvp why not make it worth the while for pve players?""have a nice day."""
7/17/2009,"they roll out new missions and exploration content fairly regularly. it's not flashy, but it is new content. i don't think that they did their usual batch with apocrypha, but from what i hear about that dev cycle, they probably had to reassign people in order to get it all out the door properly. expect another hundred or so npc encounters in the winter expansion, i'd wager. and if you consider marauders a ""crumb"", you've obviously never flown one."
7/17/2009,"the wormhole expansion was a huge pve boost. i'm sorry if you dont like it - personally i think its a million times more entertaining than the same old snoozefest level 4 missions. additionally, ccp has already said they're working on level 4 mission arcs.for a game that really does center around pvp (whether its market pvp or pew pew), they put plenty of effort into pve."
7/17/2009,"well they are hiring 2 people solely to create new missions, so i guess they will be soon"
7/17/2009,"awesome erik, thanx!"
7/17/2009,"the case i faced today was equally absurd and demonstrative.i enter an isolated low sec system and notice few ships out there. hoorey, yet another possible encounter! so i check the belts, kill some rats while still scanning the entire system trying to track those ships down. ok, i eventually meet those, get my fight, get out and now have to wait like 15 minutes without showing to gate/station guns. that's the way system have worked for ages.it might have some minor issues like 15 minutes being a too long timer or gate guns updating it silently (in case you decided to dock and wait for gcc to end in a complete safety). i'm fine with it, at least it has some logic behind it.so i hang around killing some belt rats and all of a sudden notice my gcc is suspeciously long. i hover a mouse over it and that's it: timer towards players is about to end and a global one is now 15 again. i'm getting ****ed off, but playing eve actually gets you getting used to troubles like this one. so i warp to a safe spot, set my alignment getting ready to spend another 15 minutes of pure boredom.few minutes later. oh, wait... is the gcc now 15 minutes again?!i'm getting really mad now since i have to waste even more time dealing with it. meanwhile i write a stuck petition - that's it, i got stuck cause while writing it the gcc got renewed yet again. can you imagine? once again! for god's sake, that's just inexpressible.we aren't allowed to post gm messages here, so i'll try to put the very gist of it:- i'm stuck blah-blah-blah- try docking and staying docked for 15 mintes. the gcc is being renewed while someone shoots your property in space, such as cans and wrecks.- ??? this is a game breaking bug (btw, we've had a same issue a while ago, with the only difference the bug causing a general pvp aggro timer so it happened in 0.0 as well)so i dock at this point- nah, that's an intended gameplay. - so, we now need to search for every peace of junk we might have left in the system and blow it up? don't you consider this is a bug?- yeah, that's the way it is supposed to work. that's a risk associated with low sec pvp. here the conversation ends basically.ok, i've waited patiently for 15 minutes, gave it few more just cause i know how it works and undock in a pod. timer is off. is it? nope, i'm a global criminal yet again.that's outrageous. i can't play this game by these rules and have nothing better than just logging off.35 minutes later.i log in and the first thing i notice is i'm still flagged. oh, come on...but i'm a stubborn dude. i leave the client running and go afk. i'm getting sure i had waited for 15 plus about 10 or even 15 extra minutes. undock? bingo! gcc!!it seems like i simply can not leave the area before i manually blow all the npc wrecks i had spawned.* meh, ok, let's do it.i'm now checking all the god damned belts to actually get one or two npc wrecks. i blow them up and proceed to my safe spot. few minutes later i'm enjoing a brand new gcc! wow!* - i can tell you how easily exploitable this crap is. imagine an isolated system with no stations at all. say, you have fighted someone over there in the belt/anomaly, killed a rat in the process (sometimes you just have to), then the blob came in and now you have to get out. alright, you warp out to a spot and start counting the time down while still checking for any probes etc. but those dudes in the blob can essentially 'guard' 'your' wreck (as if you really need to possess the wreck a rat had left!) and renew your gcc till you'll finaly get bored and either log off with a timer, suicidally enter the hi-sec gate or just till you're getting probed down and killed.and just the whole idea of renewing gcc via shooting the can is artificial at best, anyway. it was recognized as a bug in case of general pvp aggro, why should gcc work the other way!?"
7/17/2009,"blowing up all the crap eventually allowed me to leave the system, though as i stated gcc was reset once again after i shooted down the cans.i'm very sad cause of this issue. the low sec piracy is the only fun and casual game activity left and seeing it that bugged is simply dreadful for me.i'm sure i'm not alone and there are others out there sharing my playing style, those who enjoy flying solo and visiting isolated almost blob-free low-sec areas.i do hope csm will address this asap.i got severely offended so this thread will be bumping till the issue is fixed (or till i get a warning)"

7/18/2009,i brought this up a while back. it's been brought up a thousand times. honestly i've kinda given up on it.
7/18/2009,yes but we have a new hero if dierdra gets a meeting with ccp about this we should lay on the cheerleaders and champagne until the devs are drunk enough to give rockets a 1000% damage boost.
7/18/2009,"well, i hope you get it.i'm just jaded and half asleep.nighty"
7/18/2009,holy crap yes please fix rockets.op has it correct. they do low dps on paper and you don't even get that as a ab'ing battleship can outrun your explosion volocity.
7/18/2009,ive only ever used rockets once......... and they sucked when i did!definitely time for the devs to start fixing their creations instead of spamming new content. its getting kinda old tbcfh
7/18/2009,rockets aren't viable as is.let's get this done for the winter release.
7/18/2009,i approve of this message and or service

7/18/2009,"except you're forgetting the curse, which is amarr and gets both a range and potency bonus. also the falcon/rook had a range bonus until it was nerfed very recently. clearly, ccp did not design the game around ship bonuses being based on who you're allied with. by that logic, we should remove the arbitrator/curse/pilgrim's drone bonus because amarr are allied with caldari who are the enemy of the gallente who use drones, meaning it doesn't work to give amarr a drone ship."

7/18/2009,web effectiveness would proove usefull
7/18/2009,supported.
7/18/2009,supported.
7/18/2009,"you haven't clarified in the original post which of the current ship bonuses your proposed change will replace.are you wanting to replace the 60% bonus to stasis webifier range?if so, i don't agree with the change. what good would the increase of web strength be if an interceptor or vaga can speed out of your range before you can lock/web them?if you're wanting to replace the 7.5% bonus to target painter effectiveness per level (which is the minmatar cruiser skill bonus, therefore always giving a 37.5% bonus), then i'm fully behind it. it will mean every huginn/rapier pilot's web gets a base of 75% speed reduction and only their recon skill level dictates the range they can web. it also does away with the pointless target painter bonus that itself could either use attention currently, or just be scrapped.so which is it?"
7/18/2009,supporting this even it means losing the painter bonus.
7/18/2009,"additional bonus, scrap/reduce the loltastic painter bonus, or whatever works. this proposal is in conjunction with the web range bonus...not a replacement.you can relax and support now. i will amend op slightly to clarify this point though ."
7/18/2009,who paints anyways? >.>
7/18/2009,"imo, ditch the rof bonus if you're going to do this. recons are to do ew, not dps. plus it provides an excuse to change the huginn away from the painful split-weapons setup."
7/18/2009,sounds like a no-brainer to me. wouldn't hold my breath and expect ccp to implement the obvious though.
7/18/2009,"not supported, i agree with this guy."
7/18/2009,how's this for a pair of suggestions...if you log off and are agro'd before you disappear then you recieve the full 15 minute timer. currently it takes a highly skilled (actual skill and probe skillz) to be able to probe someone out within one minute unless they have probes out in the general area. just make a safespot and logout there tbh.you are anchored to the point where you logged out from. ie you log out on a gate. if you log back in and log out again instantly you will always warp back to that point. this stops people logging in/out of the same spot multiple times. the anchor point is 'reset' once you land on it and move/warp away.
7/18/2009,i support.but redsplat you know that ccp sucks at fixing lag in combat so i would extended to 3 log out attempts. due to desync/lag issues in battles.and also client should map if realy ctrl+q was pressed and client just didnt simple crash.
7/18/2009,"although i agree most things you say, red, the issue is pretty much fixed.people with any type of aggro won't warp off for until the timer is up. besides, red, if at least one of your guys can't tackle a jump frieghtor before it ninja logs, that's kinda sad."
7/18/2009,"not interested in stopping the original ctrl q as there is no way to know if it is legit and i don't want to punish players with prehistoric connections, so i think you are missing the point kinda.do want to stop abuse of the mechanics by multiple ctrl q's.edit: i'm not in the gatecamping buisness, but be aware that people can logged while still cloaked from the jump and that freighters arent the only shipclass prone to abusing loggofskis."
7/18/2009,yes this and supported.
7/18/2009,i love how something pretty useful gets overlooked on the forums while posts about being able to paint our ships pink get replies out the arse =(
7/18/2009,"idea:let tractor beams tractor any wreck.if a second tractor locks on from another person, make it deactivate both tractors.flame away."
7/18/2009,"why no vector addition? as for the topic, i'd say it makes sense, though i can just imagine the howls of outrage from the missioners. maybe if it turned them red, to prevent excessive griefing? but yeah, it's annoying to have a buddy i'm doing missions with, and have tractorability depend on who got the last shot in. in any case, tentative support."
7/18/2009,i approve.would be willing to allow aggro.
7/18/2009,"yes, but only if it caused aggro and if multiple tractor beams would mix vector and strength.otherwise i would have it far too easy with my tanked orca."
7/18/2009,"if tractoring someone else's wreck flags me as a thief (in cases where taking loot would), if there's vector addition and if i can use multiple tractor beams on the same object. yes. do it for cans too."
7/18/2009,about damn time.
7/18/2009,"this is wrong. all gang members can tractor beam it. furthermore i think all mission wrecks are owned by the person who accepted the mission, no matter who got the final blow."
7/18/2009,supported
7/18/2009,"i know it's all fine if you do missions with corpmates, but i recall having trouble when you do them with people who aren't in corp. been a while since i've done that, so my memories might be off."
7/18/2009,very sensible idea. how exactly does a tractor beam tell a hunk of debris you shot up from one that someone else shot up?
7/18/2009,just fleet member is enough. doesnt have to be corpmate. also setting out of corp friends +10 helps. avoids the accidental kill from corpmates because your friend is flashy from looting wrecks in different systems *whistles*anyway. to the op. i think the balance is fine. it gives the owner a slight advantage over the loot thief. that said i cant support it.
7/18/2009,"if you are in the same gang or corporation the tractor work flawlessly.if you are not, the wreck belong to the person that accepted the mission. you think mission runners will be the only people protesting? think about people tractoring jetcan away from miners, locking and moving jetcans before you can anchor them, stealing mission critical loot from range and a thousand other small and large way to annoy the other players. bad idea."
7/18/2009,boost e-peen growth!

7/18/2009,"lovin the gms that, when a dev is quoted calling something an exploit, says the dev is mistaken. then closes the petition when you ask for proof of the dev recalling what he said previously.still out a kronos. ****ers."
7/18/2009,"i suggest that the system be altered so that many of the faction ships and modules be available on the market much the way that faction ammo is available.the best part is that if you really want to sell it by contact, you can do that, too (the way you can with any item). so overall it will give more flexibility to both the buyers and the sellers.tl;dr:the contract system is slow, awkward, has no way to browse. either allow some faction items to be sold on market or make contracts browsable and not such a slow, crappy system. note: you will still be able to make a contract for anything you want, just like before."
7/18/2009,"i totaly disagree, it would destroy a hugh trade market"
7/18/2009,care to explain how putting items on the market actually destroys them?
7/18/2009,"you can search contracts for the whole universe, the market only the current region. you'd also eliminate several classes of scams. lame ones, for the most part, but still a notable part of the game."
7/18/2009,"you can make a contract for anything, from one round of small antimatter to a vargur. your point it moot. scammers will adapt, i wouldn't worry about them. but for the most part, 90% of all the faction contracts are in jita 4/4 anyway. might as well drop them into the market tab for quicker browsing."
7/18/2009,not supportedwhy would you want to be unable to search the entire universe for the best deal on a faction item? if anything your proposal gives less flexibility not more.
7/18/2009,"so, using your logic, everything should be sold via contracts for more flexibility?"
7/18/2009,"i agree with this, also it would make it possible for people to test faction ships and items on the test server."
7/18/2009,"nope. faction items should be kept seperate from the market and the hoy poloy and the plebians. if one wants a ming vase or some fine caviar one does not go to one's supermarket, one instead looks up classified ads, approaches dealers and such like.on a more serious note, it will destroy a lot of visibility certain rarer items have if the person selling it just throws it on the market."
7/18/2009,"yea keep in mind you can search contracts across all regions. it would be pretty difficult to find a lot of rare items if you had to track down which region had them on the market, or just hope it's jita (then lose it on the undock)"
7/18/2009,"i'm entirely in support of this. it'd allow for far better data analysis(average prices, say), and a much easier time searching for items. exchange contracts should only be necessary for researched/copied blueprints and rigged ships. they have use in other places, but they shouldn't be so necessary for such broad swathes of the market."
7/18/2009,some people are commenting on being able to view across all regions. what youre forgetting (unless theres a skill i dont know about that extends it) you can only accept contracts in your current region. thus the only convience of the current contracting over all is just to be able to cross reference the average price of an item anywhere at once.im torn on whether to support or not
7/18/2009,"no, there is no such skill. and remember also that showing prices across all regions helps for common faction goods(cn launchers and stuff), but for the rarer stuff, it's often less useful than a market would be. if there's zero for sale, you get absolutely nothing under the current system, whereas with a market you could at least head to forge and see what the last one sold for."
7/18/2009,why it not done yet? - would save me hours! - got to be easy to implement surely???
7/18/2009,"some people have said eve is more of a sci-fi simulator, and in most sci-fi simulation games, that inculdes captain your ship, going planet side on occasion, and walking about in the stations. meaning wis is a huge milestone for the simulation side of the game, so i have two words for you:not supported"
7/18/2009,"going further, walking in stations will be mostly created by a ccp group who are working on a totally different game.they are pretty much going to copy/paste what that team did for walking in stat."
7/18/2009,"not supported, the day ccp concentrates too much on fixing the bugs instead of adding new content is the day eve will die.bolded the only edit required to turn your op into the generic post that appears before every expansion."
7/18/2009,"not supported. quantum rise was mostly game changes, bugfixes, and no new content save for the orca. quantum rise was also my least favorite expansion due to this. it's important to realize that the art team of eve doesn't write the code, the people fixing bugs are not the same people who are designing ambulation.. of course, if you'd like to have the art managers, writers, and other creative groups go in to rewrite the code and fix bugs, i'm sure things will turn out just fine.. i would like to see eve expand beyond 'internet spaceships', into a thriving sci-fi setting. with more than spaceships. don't play the game like it's a job and rage over the little things. adding depth and character to the game are more important than fixing some minor bug somewhere in the game that cost you a killmail one time. and, of course, theres the fact that the people doing bugfixes are not going to stop because a new aspect is being added to the game... --- if all these people had their way, eve would be a flawless game with no backstory that ran in ascii. a text based adventure. ""why yes, i'd like to fly my ship up."" graphics? fluff, fix the bugs! background? fix the bugs! new ships to fly? no new content, only bug fixes! new tactics, modules, areas, professions, etc...? every game has bugs. if you try to stop all new content until every bug is fixed, the players will get bored, and the game will die. remember you're still in an rpg here; internet spaceships are not, in fact, serious business. i'm in support of anything that makes the game more fun for me to play, whether or not i have to (oh dear god why) tap tab twice to fix my overview once every few days."
7/18/2009,"as was said earlier, why would an insurance company insure a ship in eve period? most of the ships in eve are lost in deliberate pvp or pve engagements, any insurance company in their right mind would never insure a ship used for combat. especially if it they only charge a fraction of what they pay out. if you want to make that argument at the least be consistent and say no insurance in wars, missions, or for any explicitly combat capable ship.also to a different comment, almost every one of my friends, myself included, has suicide ganked people in high sec on multiple occasions, yet none of them have done it explicitly for profit. often they didn't even bother picking up the modules. considering how many pirate and generally naughty corps i've been in, it sounds to me (in a very anecdotal way) to be awfully like its an uncommon occurrence to gank for profit. so... i really don't see what this is aimed at other than simply not liking the lulz aspect (which is perfectly legitimate honestly, but at least you could say that outright)."
7/18/2009,"insurance is still a game mechanic, and not a company. removing insurance for self destructing a ship would just be annoying; if you've paid the insurance, it's more profitable to destruct an unrigged ship than to sell it. if insurance doesn't cover self destructs, it just means you accept a mission and fly it naked into the mission and let it die that way. or belt rats, have a corp mate shoot it, etc. the change is nice from a 'insurance is a real business' rp angle, but does nothing for the game. also, please remember that concord is not the insurance company, and does not rule the galaxy. they're just a police force for capsuleers, not the government. in other words, if concord says you're a criminal, the insurance company doesn't necessarily agree. again: if insurance needs to be realistic, why shouldn't concord be realistic? why should they have a 100% success rate and respond in seconds? if the answer is 'because it's a game mechanic', then the same applies to insurance, and no change is needed. if insurance is illogical and needs to be removed, then concord in it's current state is just as illogical and just as in need of a change."
7/18/2009,no insurance provider in any realm of reality or unreality will ever disagree with being told not to pay.
7/18/2009,"i'm totally against this change, but i absolutely love this point honestly, don't know why i read this thread since most of the people posting in it clearly didn't and made the same 3 or 4 points over and over again.but! here i am. i agree with the point that was made (or at least implied) earlier on in the thread, the bigger picture point that high sec is a pretty safe and sterile place to be, and making it even safer is both unnecessary and bad for the game as a whole. i find this pointless dancing back and forth across the line between arguments from mechanics and arguments from story/world consistency, well, i said it already, pointless.i like that hi-sec is relatively safe, because sometimes i just want to chill out whilst playing around in my internet spaceships. but, it doesn't need to be safer.and yes, this mechanic would make it safer, by making suicide-ganking less common. whether or not that is the 'intention' of the shift is completely irrelevant. drastically increasing the barrier to entry of the activity while decreasing its profitability will cause it to happen less often. duh.i think suicide ganking just to grief people is pretty dumb to be honest, and would be unlikely to engage in the activity myself (i'm not counting anything out completely though ). but i believe that the general trend in this game towards making eve a safer, more boring place to live is a bad one.there are a lot of things about this game that i don't like or agree with, but i understand and respect that most of those things in one way or another contribute to the core design principles that make eve as a whole a game i really enjoy. hi-sec suicide gankers are poopyface meanyheads. but i respect their right to be poopyface meanyheads, and see no reason to further abridge that right.finally i feel it is worth reinforcing the point that eve is anarcho-capitalistic bat-**** crazy land where sure why the hell wouldn't the cops pay out insurance and blow people up. in fact, if insurance were realistic in this game in that it were profitable, they'd be thrilled to do it to sell more insurance. meaning that the problem is with insurance in the game in general not making sense, not in this particular type of situation.well, that was a rambling, meandering post for which i now profusely apologize"
7/18/2009,but they would object to no one buying their insurance because they void the payment any time some corporation says 'don't pay'. realize the insurance company operates in lowsec/0.0 as well. don't see a lot of concord there. concord is only the 'most important' corporation to highsec carebears who think concord rules the galaxy.
7/18/2009,"i think insurance should be brought in line with how real insurance operates, as it is they always pay out more than they collect. insurance should be expensive and tied to the ""driving record"" of the pilot, you lose a ship every day it should be astronomical, you are a successful pilot, don't lose ships constantly it should be cheaper but not cheap. every time you lose a ship it should really hurt, not be something to laugh off."
7/18/2009,not supported
7/18/2009,"i disagree.most zero sec dwellers are bigger carebears then their high sec counterparts. zero sec is just a big money making machine. now if local was removed from zero sec, i could imagine up'ing profits, but as it stands, most people just log when hostiles enter local."

7/18/2009,"lol u are deffinaly never been in 0.0, u make more isk per hour by grinding l4's than ratting or plexing in 0.0. the plexes arent even worth the effort cause u always need to split the rewards becasue u cant solo them. that brings back the issue of security, less isk more risk in 0.0...."
7/18/2009,"that, at least partially, is a problem born at alliance/corp level. if you look ratting vs level 4 missions (even if ratting in good 0.0 is different from ratting in bad 0.0 and doing level 4 missions for caldari corps is different from doing them for gallente corps) 0.0 is not convenient against level 4 missions. but you are forgetting the corp/alliance level returns. most of the 0.0 cost are on the shoulders of the corp members while the best return are used by the corp. the good corps share tat at all levels, the bad hoard them only for the top echelons. there is not a real ""corp level"" gain from running level 4 missions, while there is a decent to extremely large ""corp level"" gain from controlling 0.0 space. only part of the ""corp level"" gains are used for the 0.0 security. if you pretend to get both way better player level and corp level returns from 0.0 you are asking for a very skewered balance."
7/18/2009,"just raising bounties is a pretty ham-handed fix, but yes 0.0 life is full of risk, yet the average pilot is not really rewarded for this risk. the only people really benefitting are large alliance directors (like me!) who swim in vaults filled with dysprosium like scrooge mcduck and attempt to confer benefits on their alliance membership through dread reimbursements etc. i want to see 0.0 more worhtwhile for the average alliance member and thus hopefully convince more empire-dwellers to come play. as long as missions are worth as much as 0.0 isk-making this will never happen"
7/18/2009,confirming we have a rp'er.
7/18/2009,"this makes a lot of sense in a game where your body is nothing but a convenient vessel. oh, science, we can transplant a pod pilots mind into as many bodies as we want, but creating a clone that looks different? heresy!"
7/18/2009,"rather than walking round stations which is boring imo allow corp mates to man the guns in ur battleships using skills to train similar to pos gunner skills. imo bs and bigger would have this, however you could have the large mining ships allow a few corp mates inside as well so they could man the mining lasors or whatever you carebears do. the skills could give u a 1% bonus to rof per level etcin regards to traveling in a corp mates ship, a new transport ship could be introduced with a skill that allows extra passengers per skill, entrepenaurs could charge passengers. they could any carry pods obviously"

7/18/2009,ok ive changed it so can we now get back to the original post please :)
7/18/2009,"ok...a corpmate docks with my ship and i'm too lazy to press f1-f8 to activate my guns, so this allows him to do it for me? and he has to train a new skillbook to allow this? i'm not really sure what this achieves or how it makes the game any better. ccp have had all sorts of headaches with allowing players to interact with each other's ships like that (see the forever-broken clone vat bays) and it really doesn't seem to add anything to justify the coding effort."
7/18/2009,"1) have a corp mate man the guns because you're too lazy to actually play the game and want to get kills for being logged on. 2) fly your own ship, have your corp mate fly his ship, and then have two ships instead of one. gee, i can't decide."
7/18/2009,..but...omg!!! who will get the killmail?????tl:dr = no
7/18/2009,i cannot imagine any reason why this would be a good idea.

7/18/2009,i believe the attacker should have the advantange and moment of surprise. the defender already have an advantage that they live in the area and have tons of more control towers the attacker must chew down.
7/18/2009,"somehow i like this proposal, cause its favoring attackers. and real men endorse alarm clock ops."
7/18/2009,"this change would make every single cpu-using pos mod completely worthless. also you could run around with a big fleet and reinforce an entire system/constellation in short order and make any sov holding alliance hate life even more than they already do. holding sov already is more work than reward and this would further skew that continuumthis is an awful idea, it really has absolutely no redeeming qualities"
7/18/2009,"ehh.how is this any different then current situation? only difference is that the defender might/might not make it in time to adjust ""correct"" stronthium level.then why do every alliance insist on having sovereignity and pos in each and every system they ""own""? this proposal will actually make alliances more alert and be more selective of where they chose to live. i am sure that an 1000 man alliance in an constellation could easily deal with incoming invaders, however, the same alliance spanning 4 regions might not."
7/18/2009,"interesting, but i can't say i'm really a fan. the proper role of a fleet ship is leading a fleet in battle. anything else makes them like titans used to be, unkillable and stupid. moms need a bonus that puts them into fleet fights, not into safe spots."
7/18/2009,"no offense, but i don't really agree with your judgement that the mom should be ""leading the charge"". not directly anyways.but i also don't think that they should just be a carrier on steroids either.better tank, or better gank is not the answer for these ships. it needs to be something other than that.what i suggest is just one of those options.what i suggest could have a very powerful affect on the battlefield, especially if used during black ops operations. nothing like having a base of operations right next to your targets, complete with spare ships and etc. if it is scanable is still an open question for me though, but many felt strongly about it in the linked thread, so i'm leaving that option open for now."
7/18/2009,"you gave us the rorqual and as far as im concerned was a step forward in game mechanics.sadly you limited it to low sec and at the time was probably the right move. but now with more ore avaiable in game it would make sense to have ore compression in both empire and low sec, with the added ability to compress ores in worm holes.it was a great idea, and now would make more sense to boost it up a bit rather than the need for bigger cargo holds, more cargo bearing ships.use something you already have established in game but bring it too all of us .br argolighthand"
7/18/2009,"not really needed. you're always within a jump of a station in highsec, and you can move stuff around by just aping ships full of ore if need be. the rorq is designed mostly for deep 0.0, and you shouldn't really need it anywhere else. i'm kind of sympathetic to the w-space argument, but i don't think that adding a new ship with this capability is the right way to address that problem. not supported."

7/19/2009,"now only if each rocket slowed the target down by say 2-5% per hit for a few seconds or something. that would make them useful. also increase thier flight time a lot so you don't have to be in thier face to hit the target. i don't know, something unique like slowing the target down would be cool as a side affect from being hit by rockets.but yes, something needs to be done."

7/19/2009,"just imagine all the rp/game backstory chronicles that could grow around this ""terrorist action"" it would be great"
7/19/2009,"come on, just think of all those poor carebears who've never gotten to see a doomsday. you wouldn't want them to miss out on the shiny graphics effects, would you?"
7/19/2009,i do from time to time. with whatever the advanced damp skill is trained it buys you approx +48% sig radius hit to the target. if you have missile spammers with you it can help them out a bit. it also lets you ***** km's from silly ranges and with lr ammo loaded into your lolartillery you might actually hit something. anyway..hugely situational and usually pointless hence easy willingness to reduce it and add the difference to web strength (making the painter actually more useful oddly enough).....or something along those lines .
7/19/2009,"toss the pointless painter bonus. even when attacking an inty with artilleries 2x painters and 2x webs won't even scratch it's paint... it'll just warp away.a rapier/huginn is committing suicide trying to tackle a vagabond inside warp disruptor range (vaga w/ barrage reaches 30km easily for full damage where an overheated t2 disruptor is max 28km), and the vaga will still have plenty of closing speed.and that's just when looking at a vagabond... there are plenty of other ships that can do the same easily.remove the target painter bonus for a web effectiveness bonus makes the min recons (and the hyena) viable fleet ships again. they're not, nor ever were, particularly viable solo ships except against patently inferior ships like... perhaps a wet paper sack though i suspect even that can tank a rapier's dps."
7/19/2009,"in my opinion web bonus is still pretty powerful just not win win button. if bonus would be tweaked range bonus should be dropped or switched to strenght bonus. i am strongly against giving minmatar recons ability to stop ships moving completely while orbiting outside disruptor range again.60% web still cuts down speed a lot just not one web is enough to make target stationary, which is good."
7/19/2009,"i'll agree witht he above post when the falcon can't stop several ships from doing anything at all, from triple the range of a warp disruptor. incidentally, i think ewar should be useful, and the ability to slow one ship down is simply not enough. perhaps a stronger stacking nerf on webs, but stronger individual webs, to allow the rapier to hold several ships down. suggesting a drop to the range bonus? then what role would the rapier have? ""i can do my primary form of ewar just as well as a tech1 frigate!"""
7/19/2009,"i like and support this idea.i'm probably one of the few people that do actually use the tp bonus that these ships get, and whilst it does occasionally come in useful i believe the re-jig of web bonus' would be worth the loss of it.i agree with the concerns people have around not wanting to see way overpowered webs, so potentially if we did have a web strength bonus on the rapier/huginn/hyena maybe ccp may look at increasing the stacking nerf slightly so 4 x webs on these ships doesn't make it crazy strong but dual webs are viable."
7/19/2009,"rapier/huggin do need a bit of a buff, perhaps dropping one of damage bonus' for a web strength bonus. i'll look to bring it up at a future meeting."
7/19/2009,ta. and don't forget the lolhyena.
7/19/2009,"i propose to reverse your proposal. sized rigs will be fine, but i want to see sized modules for every ship type! no more heatsink ii's for your bs's, you'll need xl heatsink ii's that cost 20 mil a piece! xl 1600mm plates for 50 mil a piece!your reasoning isn't very sound. people fit rigs to smaller ships right now, the only thing this is going to change is people with less isk will be able to rig their ships to compete with those who already rig their ships. i see no negative effects coming from this, other than me having to redo a lot of eft setups to account for rig bonuses on my t1 ships."
7/19/2009,here's a new thread...[issue] sound engine & sound bugsit pertains to the user interface.thank you for maintaining this index.
7/19/2009,"yeah, i'd much rather like a more complex implementation that makes better use of both pilot and player skills."
7/19/2009,"bad idea, would be used like the freeform contracts were - that is, the addition would only serve to scam, steal, gank and be a general ass. not supported."
7/19/2009,"like i said, the problems with gang missions are dredged up from memories a couple years old. i guess they're wrong/obsolete. whatever. as for the griefing, all the same things could be done by just stealing. if this has the same implications of letting them shoot you that stealing does, how is this any worse?"
7/19/2009,supported and stuff. why this isn't feature already.
7/19/2009,"yes! but only if...like metioned before, you can reverse engineer the implants out, lets say if they had a +5% to repair amount, you could salvage out a +3% or something.but what i think is most important, get rid of having to keep an updated clone. this game mechanic is too devistating to have in a game. you can lose everything else in the game but to lose training time, its just too harsh. i know some people like the idea of having to keep an updated clone, adds risk to the game but honestly its just not necessary to have in the game."
7/19/2009,contracts are there for a reason. scammers need to earn their livinng somehow too... 100% safe market is not supposed to be there.
7/19/2009,"in that case, add a contrqact hostory or something. being able to stay out in 0.0 or wherever you are, 100 jumps from jita or whatever, and still be able to see how much an item is worth is very useful. contracts also give a completely different trading style, where advertisment and how well you can market a deal decvides how long it take to sell. you can say that you can still use contracts even if the normal market can be used for it, but come on, be realistic...people are lazy, if it's avaiulable on the market, noone will check contracts.improve the contract system, don't make it obsolete."
7/19/2009,"not supported.searching for rare faction items would become much more difficult under this proposal.evaluating a fair price to pay or ask would also become harder.it would likely lead to a polarisation of sale of these items in jita.yes currently i still have to travel to ""buy"" the item, but of course i can send money to an alt or trusted corp friend to get around this."
7/19/2009,"seeing as to search in contract you need the correct name of the item, while you can search the market under the right general heading and find the kind of item you want, i think adding faction to the market is a good idea. a typical example are the faction drones. when you are searching them to see if there is a interesting deal, you are happy to search augmented acolyte, then augmented hobgoblin, then augmented warrior, then augmented hornet, then move to improved acolyte, then improved hobgoblin, then improved warrior and end with improved hornet to move then to medium and heavy drones? or you would prefer to look regional market see what is available with 3 clicks and without typing 24 different names? then, if you don't like the regional offers you can move to contracts all around eve. supported (unless adding all the faction items is a excessive burden to the database)."
7/19/2009,"i would be bothered to not be able to see faction items for other regions. i think, a better approach to this would be to make contracts better browsable, not to make rare items disappear on jita<U+FFFD>s local market.not supported."
7/19/2009,"if they made contracts have similar functionality to markets in terms of price histories, searchability, etc., then i would also be perfectly happy with that."
7/19/2009,no.i don't want to 0.01 isk war on my faction loot.
7/19/2009,there are more benefits to having the rare modules on contracts than on the market as stated by previous comments.however i do would like to see some kind of price history and other tools to make contracts easier and faster.
7/19/2009,"i don't support this. but...that is because there is an existing game mechanic called ""black market"" (which you will see in data dumps and if you look at station services on eve-hq's map tool etc.). this ""black market"", it was implied was for things that weren't available in normal markets. i.e. faction stuff, contraband, etc.; it's only available in certain stations, etc.just get ccp to activate this feature."

7/19/2009,anti-support post
7/19/2009,no interest in wos here
7/19/2009,"if you're actually hurt by a video game loss, i think the game takes it a bit too far. losing anywhere from fifty to a couple hundred million is risky enough. theres no need to expect it to be an emotionally scarring experience to lose your internet spaceship. if anything we should be encouraging more pvp, rather than less pvp. and heres a hint: take away t1 insurance, and a lot of new players will refuse to pvp altogether. that would make eve much more fun. i'd totally rather have less pvp, but the added joy of realistic insurance beaurocracy; beats out good fights with reasonable losses that vastly exceed any other game any day. while we're at it, we can force players to realistically register their spaceships with the dmv, waiting in line for hours to do so. and to spend an hour a week getting their warp drive inspected. woo, reality is more fun than a game ever was!"
7/19/2009,"i didn't mean emotionally hurt,what i mean is make the outcome of combat mean something.if you want more people to pvp give pvp a context, a meaning,as it stands you rally forces hunt down your arch enemy, destroy him and....maybe inconvenience him for a couple of minutes, how very epic. i want to see battles of attrition, cunning plans to deprive our enemy of resources and strangle them,not games of freeze tag and dodgeball that change nothing. insurence as it is keeps pvp as meaningless as a match of counterstrike."
7/19/2009,"the insurance providers would easily find some ""nice"" politician that will make ship insurance against unespected lossec mandatory in high sec."

7/19/2009,"true, that."
7/19/2009,"this is an idea that looks as though it makes obvious sense when it is a tabloid headline. however i am not sure it does if we look at game balance. the already outlined problems of high sec invunerability and npc corps come to mind. now insurance in general... there is an argument for scrapping the whole thing, which i would like to see discussed.what about dropping the insured amount by 10% and monitoring the effects on in-game economics? [i am not sure i would support such a proposal, but discussion would be good.]"
7/19/2009,i support it. hi sec suicide ganking is too much risk free.at least nerf insurance payout.
7/19/2009,"insurance, nerf it, nerf it again and after nerfing it, nerf it some more."
7/19/2009,quick question because i genuinely don't know the answer...does any other mmo limit people to one account per ip?
7/19/2009,hey guys lets abolish cyno alts thereby making eve completely unplayable for capital ship pilots woohoo(no)
7/19/2009,"look, even if people are using alts and mains at the same time, what difference does that make to you? fact is, they pay for them, they have a right to use them. if you don't have an alt that's your issue, get one if you want one, but don't complain that i have a few. end of day its not even about who has more rl money getting an advantage, i pay for 3 accounts with isk only, so if i can do it, so can you.past that, lets pretend that you get your way, only one logon per ip, now what happens.it so happens that i play eve, so does my wife, so, which of us are allowed to run eve? me or her, and why should she pay for an account but not be allowed to use it because i'm using mine?are you going to pay for my 2nd internet connection so i can have 2 ip addresses? past that, what about collage's, i know there are tons of people from the same schools on there school internet connection playing eve, i guess they are out too. how much rl money do you think ccp will let go, so you feel like its fair for you?lets go one step further, say ccp pull a dumb dumb and do this, one account per ip, do you have any clue how many proxy servers there are in the world that can be used to redirect the connection to ccp, so it comes from a different ip address, thus allowing one person that is smart and knows what they are doing an advantage that no one else can use. i mean lets face it, you can get an alt, of your own, hell the first 51 days are free if you start a 21 day trial with the buddy program from your main, then pay for the 30 days on that trial, your main gets his 30 days too. you see, allowing everyone to have multiple accounts log on from one location is fair, not allowing it, and people in the know taking advantage of there it degree's is not fair, and will **** you off even more then allowing everyone to do it. at the end of day, no one, not even ccp could stop multi boxing.have a nice day, and please try to think before you post."
7/19/2009,"the real question is why you guys are all still bumping this idiotic thread. it's old, it's been mocked more than enough already, and it's never going to happen. let it fall off the front page.edit: when i posted to this thread, it was already the top one on the page. then i buried it under the other 10 threads i replied to. that's not a bump."
7/19/2009,"as a fairly ""young"" player in eve i primarily play in high sec. being young meaning my skills are nowhere near that of most in lowsec/0.0. so i bid my time training, honing my skills, making the isk to afford what i can lose the days that i venture into the open lawless spaces to basically get my bumm handed to me. so if this constitutes being a ""carebear"" so be it. with that being said. the salvaging rights have a problem. i've tried to salvage while doing missions. personally i have better uses for those high slots as in not taking hours to kill one ship. low skills low dps gotta make up for it somehow. (minnie takes forever)i've done the burn through come back in a salvage ship. it's either there or it's not. more often... nothow about paying attention to your ship so you don't get to be a pod and someone warps in waits for a wreck and snags the wreck as you go along cause the npc is shooting you for 50k away.and my most favorite suggestion. bring a friend along... done that. have had 4 ninja salvagers come in and start taking wrecks while they being tractored by the friend. (same mission different intervals)now before some of you go on rants that i'm just crying about not being able to salvage my missions. it's not solely that. i've spent time training to be able to make rigs and ie need supplies for that. ergo i go make wrecks to salvage verses paying market value lower cost more profit. and last time i checked a wreck it has my corp tag on it. so do the cans. my ships. doesn't this denote ownership?back onto subject. scanning down wrecks and warp to them is not a bad idea. however it should work in conjunction with something. perhaps locking mission gates to fleet/corp allowing someone as me trying to be enterprising some ownership of wrecks. if i, (being someone who just blitzes), turns in a mission the wrecks are now accessible to everyone with a scanning probe. thus allowing salvaging. also making salvaging a non trial learning skill would reduce it some as well.i support the topic of a needed change just not the initial idea alone"
7/19/2009,"not supported. market value is dictated by the players and very prone to fluctuation. if insurance values are set low and the price of t2 ships spikes then it's still next to useless. if the insurance prices are set high and then there is some event which should lower the cost of t2 ships then the prices will remain artificially high as people buy, insure and self destruct their t2 vessels.t2 is a luxury. if i purchased a run of the mill car and added a big bore exhaust, new engine, new paintjob, new sound system i doubt very much my insurance company would pay out the value of the extra parts if i smashed it up."
7/19/2009,"so let me get this right:a 0.0 ""defender"" - likely of the jan brady patrol or killmail addicts who kill everybody that goes into ""their"" system - and will say ""hey, i am just defending my patch"" but could not explain the small frigs, haulers they killed, etc...is now angry that someone - how dare they? - gets into their system and cannot be instantly scanned down and instaganked?oh and the ""lulz"" - until someone puts them to explain it and they tuck their shirts back in and it's ""uh..... hey man we are just defending are system.. yeah, that's it"".just by knowing that a killmail addict is squirming, unable to act out their emorageganker tendencies, at the prospect of someone cloaked in their system makes me want to go cloak a cheapie boat in their system and leave it there for hours. oh the tears, just by being there and not having to fire a shot. let's one up it: remove local from 0.0 and make it delayed local like in wh space."
7/19/2009,"you forgot the best ones...which would get my complete and utter support:[12:14:33] ""would you like to remain docked?""and[12:14:34] ""would you like to remain in your pos shields?""giggity giggity yeah"
7/19/2009,"come on, just think of how much lag you could save by creating a popup to ask people if they're sure that they want to remain logged in."
7/19/2009,"indeed, i think i'm gonna go visit me the systems of wildly inappropriate with an alt and log it in while i'm at work. just fur lulz!"
7/19/2009,i corrected post
7/19/2009,"no, you didn't."
7/19/2009,"seeing as neuts and ecm with out a doubt can make or break engagements i think the use of pill designed to counter these modules is a good idea. i understand that i can fit eccm to my ship and i also understand i could fly a passively tanked ship against neuting ships. but realistically engagements don't ""wait"" for you to fit another ship just to come out and engage for that particular gang structure. if i'm 20 jumps from home there's no way for me to buy other mods/ships ect... i always carry a blue pill (which is increases my shield boost amount by a percentage) in case i get into a harry situation. but lets face it - any pvp ship that uses a cap intensive set up (and most do) its game over when that nuet domi show up. lets face it your having a great engagment with your worst enemy's and that falcon de-cloaks and jams everyone - its game over!i think pills designed to increase sensor strength or decrease chance to get jammed (however you want to word it) and a pill to decrease the chance or amount that is nuet'd / nos'd from you would be a cool idea and another money maker for drug makers.flame on!"
7/19/2009,pills?! wtf?
7/19/2009,grabbin peelscan't really support this. boosters in my mind are there to give you an edge in combat in general not against specific threats. you could potentially load up on pillz and you have uppers and downers for every occassion.ever tried mindflood btw?
7/19/2009,this idea makes me think you've already taken too many pills.
7/19/2009,"so you want to be able to lug around fittings (in the form of pills) with you so that you are effective in any combat situation, without having to have logistics to change your setup if the situation changes? not supported."
7/19/2009,this would be very much appreciated.
7/19/2009,"i would agree with you, but if you have spies in your fleet, and its that big an issue, they can warp to you. i mean you are in fleet. lets not be dense here. supported. if anything only cloaked ships can see other cloaked ships in the same fleet."
7/19/2009,the problem u r pointing at is quitinteresting... support ship is involved in fight so u shoud be able to shoo it down without being killed by concord...
7/19/2009,"i'm guessing you also want all of the modules to be onlined the moment it comes out of reinforcement, as opposed to the 50% shields it currently requires?"
7/19/2009,"pos warfare is horrible at the moment and yes i agree changes are required, however this idea does not offer a reasonable solution.cpu mods become useless after rf mode unless shields are repped, you make no suggestion on how to deal with that.at what shield level do you suggest the tower exits rf? a 90% shield limit for entering rf leaves a very small margin for repping out of rf when it exits. arguably a tower could be repped out of rf in a very short time with sufficient carriers on field making the effort to rf it pointles.you could of course and likely would rf a lot of towers in the hope that some at least would not be saved. however i expect what would happen is a benny hill style chase involving the attacking fleet, defenders titan bridging defense fleets, and carriers jumping around like crickets.... every day, day in, day out.definitely not supported."
7/19/2009,"iceblock, you really should stop posting. your suggestions are terrible.unless you are assaulting a d2 special if you haven't rf'd a pos in 1-2 cycles (generally not enough time for an alt to get there and set the stront timers) then you're doing it wrong anyway.so then what happens? what level will the tower come out at when it exits rf? what level will the shields need to be at for you to restront the tower? do modules requiring cpu go offline etc etc?"
7/19/2009,actually i work for the military. a ships radar cant tell the difference between an aircraft and a missile. if the radar operator isn't paying attention then the ship is f***ed.sorry but i vote no on this one.
7/19/2009,"even if it would be implemented, what would it be good for? mining barges are not famous for their tanking abilities. when the alarm goes off, you are alredy scrambled, webbed and what not, leaving only seconds to wake up and see your ship die anyway.local and directional scanner work much better, they just require to actually play the game while playing the game. not supported."
7/19/2009,"i am curious if this has ever been mentioned or not and what kind of affect this would have on the game for log-offskies and such things.what if when you use a gate and when you are agress a rat/get agressed by one, you have something like an agression timer for 15 minutes like when you do that with an actual player?pros and cons?"
7/19/2009,"i'm looking for a critique.i also had an interesting extension to this idea; give it the ability to enter a mode similar to dreadnoughts and carriers, at which point it acts like a pos with enough power to field a small number of defensive pos modules. this way, it would be hard to kill while deployed, yet extremely vulnerable while mobile."
7/19/2009,"you want a ship with 8 strips, carrier-scale (non-fighter) drone capability...and pos guns? why not just say that anyone who flies one gets to host a weekly kegger at ccp's expense? this is so far outside the bounds of what is reasonable that i have no idea how to respond to it. meaning no offense, but you have got to step back from ""i want"" and ""wouldn't it be cool if..."" and think about the broader scope of game design. you can't just give yourself an omgwtfbbq pwnmobile for your profession just because you want it. you have to make things that are on a reasonable level with everything else out there and that give the game room for future expansion. you basically want to peg the scale right now, which means basically that ccp can never again produce a new mining ship. and then people will expect the same thing for every other profession out there in the next expansion. how is that in any way interesting or fun?"
7/19/2009,"i think it should go another way, must ""set up"" and be immobile like a movable derrick, no defenses at all but able to rip into roids like there is no tomorrowand require fuel while in that mode. make setting up so risky that you need a security detail or some psychosis to go into mining configuration ."
7/19/2009,"currently if i want to look for ammo under the contract system (t2 bps, t1 ammo bps or bundles, ect) i have to sort first by crystals, then advanced crystals, then projectile, then advanced projectile... it's annoying as heck, to say the least. the same goes for ships or modules.please make contracts sortable by entire subgroups rather than individual types!i.e. ammo, ships, electronic warfare... ect, ect. that will let us see all contracts for particular ranges of items as well as the specific item type (electronic warfare, or stasis webs, ect)."
7/19/2009,set item category to charge?
7/19/2009,"i agree that cloaks on non-bonused ships need a definate looking into, i don't believe any capital should have the ability to cloak itself, much less its entire fleet.your proposals for limiting cloaks is good, but not good enough.for all non covert-ops cloaks:all passive regeneration halts (capacitor and shield). local scanner ceases to function.obviously some of these would be offset slightly by higher meta-level cloaks and t2 prototypes (i.e. a prototype ii would allow 30% capacitor/shield regen rates, short range local scanner functionality).non covert-ops cloaks should only reduce a ship's sig, it should never make them 'invisable' (bear in mind that a 'visible' raven at 50km, in space, is visible only as a dot at best). have the hull lights deactivated while a cloak is on.this makes having a cloak a viable defense tactic, but not a sure bet like it is now.ass with so many other flawed mechanics in the game, such as rockets, this proposal has been put forward for years and ccp just laughs it off."

7/19/2009,"who said pve has to be a solo activity. sorry but this is a massive multiplayer game, not single player - content doesnt always have to be soloable."
7/19/2009,"pve is not of necessity a solo activity and it always crosses the line into a type of pvp considering how you define the term since there is only ""one"" pot(as it were.) if i had the confidence that ccp would really keep wormholes as a primarily pve experience that would not be subject to territorial issues as is 0.0, then whatever pvp occurs there would be understandable. but i have seen in other posts and people have acknowledged that a type of ""effective"" soverigenity already exists in some w-space where effectively corps are ""farming"" w-space systems. this was not the intent or promise of ccp. neither i nor anyone else should be able to establish a pos or other structure permanently in w-space. if they exist, there should be a game mechanic that says they will eventually be destroyed thereby keeping that space open to all. but i do not have such confidence in ccp doing this hence i wish to see pve expanded. it they held to their promises then whatever pvp occurs in w-space would be more a one on one that has been all by eliminated from the game by ccp's current course of actions and their propping up of large corps."
7/19/2009,"fix rocketsthis is an excellent example of a ""mended"" feature that did not work out and thus should not go back in the queue of issues that need to be fixed, but straight to the top of it. ccp mentioned that they would go over the way they prioritize broken issues when the former csm went to iceland, but i don't think we have heard anything about it since then."
7/19/2009,"experienced similar bug not a long time ago.was in ani constelation (caldari cosmos), and got a thief stealing loot from 'my' (npc killied by me) wreck.well, i get targeted him of course and start shooting. bustard flee (since i hadnt warpdis fitted), but that another story.our story is, i've got 15m aggro timer for shooting him. saw him later docked, and so simply leave him for good.well, i've got a surprise after 2 (two, not one, not more) jumps. my aggro timer was renewed from 11 minutes to 15 again.at first glance surprise was even possitive. i've fited warpdis, returned to station, and waited for my pety thief.after original 15 minutes (but with renewd aggro timer it still showed 4 minutes for me) he undocked. and no... he wasnt flagged for me anymore((so i gues i was somehow still flagged for him...nah, he didnt tried anything, so cant say for sure was i flagged for him or not. but the fact is fact, game-client showed me renewed aggro timer after firts 4 minutes. and i didnt do anything in those 4 minites other then warped after thief, and warped/jumped back to my bussines (my own carebearing tbh). no shooting anything, no even targeting anyone or anything..."

7/20/2009,"does your corporation even have any carriers? it isn't anything like a jump bridge anyway because you have to put the carrier in danger to do it in the first place, unlike a titan who can stay in a different system. also i would of thought you of all people would support this but evidently little nameless corps like the idea of titans online even when they will never own any or if they are really lucky one."

7/20/2009,"and what kind of web-range decrease to you propose to compensate?since qr, all speeds have gone down while maintaining the relative speed between ships.the 60% web is extremely powerful except against mwd ships which require twin-webs, even with just one the signature/speed ratio of a mwd webbed ship is enough to allow full damage from all weapons.i say no unless range is decreased, otherwise they become godly solo-mobiles and we will drown in rapiers again."
7/20/2009,both hands up!
7/20/2009,"no web range decrease.60% web is not extremely powerful..and considering that most standard combat fits do include an mwd the now silly-slow rapier/huginn is at a disadvantage compared to other recons capable of truely nuking multiple ships in terms of ewar.again: force recon intended role=force multiplier. you can have the gun bonus back.also lol ""godly solo-mobiles"". perhaps somewhat pre-damp balance but since that time? come on now. and as a recent example yesterday i hung a pair of overloaded webs on a sacrilege from 50km to assist a wingman and that sucker was still able to close range forcing me to warp out. fair dues to the pilot who was speed fit (unexpectedly) and with a booster a sac can run an mwd all day long where the rapier has-at best-around 2 minutes mwd time to maintain range. thats not exactly ""dictating engagement range"" is it?and if you consider the fail that is the hyena one is basically paying out around 40 mill isk to hang a web or two for roughly 20 seconds before going pop to anything looking harshly at it ."
7/20/2009,"not supported.don't be alarmed, tl;dr @ teh bottomwhoever thinks the rigs will become standard on all ships obviously has no sense of innovation in terms of ship fitting and pvp. there never has been a stadard fit for any ship. there have always been tried and true fits, those which weather battles and tank missions with relative ease, but there are always ways to break the mold, and this change is going to serve as a catalyst to open up that creativity.lets take a few ships into account for the expected change in fitting.thorax, possible rigs, almost any hybrid rigs, the armor rigs, and the speed/cap astrometric rigs. use it in a mission? add some resists and a few cccs. a new player with a rigged thorax is going to be much better off in missions when given a shot at rigging. who cares? so what is the price they pay to do a mission is affected, i don't see them blowing anything up any time soon. on to a pvp rax, we have a common plate rax, load that up with some trimarks and you have a great bait ship. lets say you are in a tackle rax. load up some astrometrics to help with the cap or maybe overall speed. be realistic, there are so many ways to fit a combat oriented t1 cruiser. i see way more lolfits and innovation on the horizon, and both of which are things i look forward to seeing on a regular basis. makes the game more fun to think of different ways to play.i'll bring up frigates in general, which can be insanely versatile in the right hands. a frig rarely has the ability to run half their mods for a full minute before they cap out. tack on some rigs, whatever you want, who knows what you can really do, speed, armor, tracking, range, shields, extra dps, whoever said it will make standardized fits a norm has obviously been stuck in industrial ships for a bit too long.a third and final point is the rigging of t2 ships. who has ever had a ship get nerfed, or changed their mind on a flying style of any particular ship? nano ishtars, nano curses, for whatever reason a trimarked anything, and decided, maybe now i need to swap up the setup a little, but those rigs are going to be a bihotch to replace. now, you have the option to rerig a ship for a decent price. i know rigs are permanent for a reason, but when each one costs 5 mil it's still going to be a dent in your wallet when considering the overall price of the ship.tl;dr: what makes you want to force everyone to pay a premium for something that doesn't fiscally make sense at the moment? so what if you do, this makes it so other people can enjoy that luxury. standardization is not going to be a problem. it really seems like a whine from a bunch of rig builders and people who forgot this is a game and should be enjoyed by everyone, not just people who voluntarily forfeit hour upon hour grinding missions just to get ahead of everyone else, that's what faction and deadspace mods are for. share the rig love, and stop being so greedy."
7/20/2009,"virtually every bit of what you said is exactly my point. rigs complement setups, they do not change them. your ceptors are just going to be more cap stable. your cruisers are just going to do a bit more damage.it's not like some git is going to mix a plated thorax with ccc rigs or polycarbs or eccm rigs or anything else that wouldn't make sense. the point of rigs has always been a choice between do or dont use them. if you risk the cash, you reap the reward.i mean i just don't get people's logic here. what next, do you want the cost of the navy vexor to drop to the same as the vexor because then maybe you''ll have more options on what ships to fly and how to load out your setup? no! navy vexor is better because you choose to pay more for it's performance with both mission time and lp cost.is it the dev's fault that the navy vexor takes way more time to get and therefore isn't conducive to 1 hr a day players who want to pvp in it? is it the rich guys fault? it's a game, just like all games. you arent intended to do everything there ever was in this game, you make a choice. i make the decision to log out and go play soccer or bike for 2 hrs a day, is that they nerd's fault who would rather sit at his desk for 2 hrs or is it my own?i'm so sick of this equality bull**** because guess what, you aren't. all the rig patch does is dumb down the game for the masses."
7/20/2009,"aside from the relatively pointless comparison to navy vexors, seeing as rigs are not faction fittings. they are t1 and t2 gear.anyway, its about fun, for everyone, not only the people who can passivly make isk with all the isk they have already. ffs we are talking about sub 10 mil hulls here, and you are whining about people actually using things that are there for people to use. sure there is a sense of risk vs reward. all the mods you put on your ship are a risk, be it 50k or 11 mil, your choice. but ffs, you are rigging a 200k ship with rigs that cost a couple mil, you are still putting forth a risk, but it's not a battleship risk. scaled investment is scaled reward. what if every ship in game cost as much to kit out as a battleship? do you really think people are going to use them on a regular basis? it closes off the accessibility to players who play this as a game not as a job. you are putting so much of your argument into isk value, as if it outweighs the players skill. let people explore another part of the game, and realize every single thing you add to a ship is risk, including rigs, no matter how expensive they are."
7/20/2009,"you don't seem to get logic, period. this patch will increase options, not remove them. it will make ships more diverse, not less. this is not faction gear, it is produced. you might as well complain about modules for low-slots."
7/20/2009,i support this as i've read many posts as to how people have worked realy hard to obtain skills and t2 bpo's for specialised profession only for ccp to along once again to basically destroy it.

7/20/2009,"now, this makes sense. doesn't penalise those with genuine connection problems and means that if you do pull a deliberate logoffski then it doesn't matter how many times you hit ctrl+q to move your emergency warp point, the return warp will always land you at the point where you entered the original emergency warp."

7/20/2009,"please include this as an alternative solution.although it does not fix the problem 100% like your own solution, it should be simplier to implement and won't cause balance issues on injecting combat setups or act as a 20% cargo boost for all ships whether or not they are likelly to use cans.this may be more palatable to the devs."
7/20/2009,"a simplier solution.although i support the aim of this post , i find the proposed solution to be overcomplicated.issues that arise arewhat happens with ships that can have cargo holds less than 3k or more than 3k depending upon expanders / rigs fitted.20-30% buff for carrying items that can't currently be carried in cans.20-30% buff for cap injecting ship setups, cargo hold space is a premium here."
7/20/2009,"what?last time i checked , the only assembled containers that could be put in a freighter class ship were general freight containers."
7/20/2009,"i agree. i think that containers should not be able to contain more space than they take up. a container that takes up 3,000m3 should be able to hold no more than 3,000m3.edit to show support. i re-read the extremely poorly worded op and realized that he was advocating the opposite of what i had originally thought."
7/20/2009,"i've wrote a massive post in the other forum, i guess i'll just quote it as that's pretty much the second side of the same coin.here we go.the case i faced today was equally absurd and demonstrative.i enter an isolated low sec system and notice few ships out there. hoorey, yet another possible encounter! so i check the belts, kill some rats while still scanning the entire system trying to track those ships down. ok, i eventually meet those, get my fight, get out and now have to wait like 15 minutes without showing to gate/station guns.that's the way system have worked for ages.it might have some minor issues like 15 minutes being a too long timer or gate guns updating it silently (in case you decided to dock and wait for gcc to end in a complete safety). i'm fine with it, at least it has some logic behind it.so i hang around killing some belt rats and all of a sudden notice my gcc is suspeciously long. i hover a mouse over it and that's it: timer towards players is about to end and a global one is now 15 again. i'm getting ****ed off, but playing eve actually gets you getting used to troubles like this one. so i warp to a safe spot, set my alignment getting ready to spend another 15 minutes of pure boredom.few minutes later. oh, wait... is the gcc now 15 minutes again?!i'm getting really mad now since i have to waste even more time dealing with it. meanwhile i write a stuck petition - that's it, i got stuck cause while writing it the gcc got renewed yet again. can you imagine? once again! for god's sake, that's just inexpressible.we aren't allowed to post gm messages here, so i'll try to put the very gist of it:- i'm stuck blah-blah-blah- try docking and staying docked for 15 mintes. the gcc is being renewed while someone shoots your property in space, such as cans and wrecks.- ??? this is a game breaking bug (btw, we've had a same issue a while ago, with the only difference the bug causing a general pvp aggro timer so it happened in 0.0 as well)so i dock at this point- nah, that's an intended gameplay.- so, we now need to search for every peace of junk we might have left in the system and blow it up? don't you consider this is a bug?- yeah, that's the way it is supposed to work. that's a risk associated with low sec pvp.here the conversation ends basically.ok, i've waited patiently for 15 minutes, gave it few more just cause i know how it works and undock in a pod. timer is off. is it? nope, i'm a global criminal yet again.that's outrageous. i can't play this game by these rules and have nothing better than just logging off.35 minutes later.i log in and the first thing i notice is i'm still flagged. oh, come on...but i'm a stubborn dude. i leave the client running and go afk. i'm getting sure i had waited for 15 plus about 10 or even 15 extra minutes. undock? bingo! gcc!!it seems like i simply can not leave the area before i manually blow all the npc wrecks i had spawned.* meh, ok, let's do it.i'm now checking all the god damned belts to actually get one or two npc wrecks. i blow them up and proceed to my safe spot. few minutes later i'm enjoing a brand new gcc! wow!* - i can tell you how easily exploitable this crap is. imagine an isolated system with no stations at all. say, you have fighted someone over there in the belt/anomaly, killed a rat in the process (sometimes you just have to), then the blob came in and now you have to get out. alright, you warp out to a spot and start counting the time down while still checking for any probes etc. but those dudes in the blob can essentially 'guard' 'your' wreck (as if you really need to possess the wreck a rat had left!) and renew your gcc till you'll finaly get bored and either log off with a timer, suicidally enter the hi-sec gate or just till you're getting probed down and killed."
7/20/2009,"and just the whole idea of renewing gcc via shooting the can is artificial at best, anyway. it was recognized as a bug in case of general pvp aggro, why should gcc work the other way!?"

7/20/2009,"there's a lot of history of ccp making huge changes to features in game where rather than rebalance it, they completely change the dynamics and then let it sit til people gripe for long enough to completely overhaul it again.the best example of this is eccm and it's changes over the years.originally, eccm was a point based system. if i had more points of eccm strength than your ship had to counter it, you were jammed. this system, which had no real flaws was tweaked. why? well apparently it was bad when a dominix could dedicate it's 5 mid slots to eccm and perma jam a target. it just wasn't kosher that something like reliquishing 5 slots to jam another ship w/o an additional back arrays could happen. even worse, you could cycle jam and dampen... terrible i know.so we changed to the % chance system, a complete overhaul rather than a small tweak to the current good system. originally, there was very little difference between a domi's ability to jam with 1 mod and a scorps. most differences came with range. so now a domi could spend 1 slot to get a jam off, add in a dampener to delay the relock, and just wait til he got lucky enough for the jam to hit. dev's had a omgwtf moment where they realized that this didn't really give an advantage to eccm ships either because everyone was doing it. so then another overhaul came in. now we had the problem of massive range for eccm on eccm boats, mixed with the problem of % based jamming which ment more targets could be jammed by an eccm ship w/o the added heat and complexity of the old cycle jamming system. well guess what, we went from everyone carrying eccm to 3-4 ships jamming 10-20 near permanently from 150-200km away.well damn, that doesn't work either. so now rather than that, we've rebalanced it to where only eccm ships really can jam, but with the exception of 1, they can only really jam well from very close range, have to rely on chance, and now what's supposedly tank... and to compensate for it, a ship and class that should never have drones has a drone bay to help add to lag already generated by drones (recons). other things that share similar stories:implementation of sov mechanics all at oncespeed buffsspeed nerfsrecon overhauls in generalall forms of ew gearmajor ship implementations where a patch offered more than 30 new ships at one time rather than a bit more staggered.super capscapsblack opsetc every time ccp makes changes, they're drastic and game changing. why can't we just return to smaller patches with tweaks to a system to see if it can be corrected rather than overhauled? it might help avoid 5 year adventures where every step has been further away from the original good idea."
7/20/2009,"i fear that, regardless of support you might get for this, ccp will not listen if it is escalated by the csm. they much prefer long development cycles, plus it could be argued that occasional major upsets are better for longevity as it forces players to re-evaluate the mechanics, keeping interest."

7/20/2009,"it has become extremely easy to probe players down in low sec. combat probes only need to remain in space for as little as 5 seconds before being scooped up with a 100% warpable hit. in turn, it gives an alert mission runner seeking to protect his mission site that much time in opportunity to detect the combat probes. having a reasonable chance in detecting combat probes is the only opportunity a player running a mission has before having his mission site compromised.note that i am not asking for 100% safety. i am asking for a reasonable chance at being able to detect combat probes in space. i also expect a lot of opposition from pirates benefitting from being able to bust missions in complete in stealth even from alert mission runners.so, in to summarize, spamming a button every 5 seconds is not fun! please fix!"

7/20/2009,"once upon a time, someone under the employ of ccp crafted a number of ship models and assigned a job for each. they made a number of tech i frigates which were designed for ew, and another for exploration. then they subtly altered the models for the tech ii frigates, with stronger bonuses for those roles.but one day, they discovered that the t1 and t2 models for a particular ship didn't match. they'd accidently made the t1 ship ugly as sin, and the t2 ship was reasonably acceptable. in order to cover their ass, they swapped the models and hoped no one would notice. but unfortunately... they were wrong.the imicus/new helios looks like a dog lifting its leg on a fire hydrant.the maulus/old helios looks like an xmas ornament.no one could say, straight faced and sober, that gallente craftsmanship is pretty to behold. but at least the options used to be better than they are at the moment.so here's my proposal. swap the helios models back. in fact, swap the imicus and maulus models as well. that way, the ew frigs (which are useless in any situation) will still match. and those of us who were born and raised gallente, and yet had to crosstrain amarr to get a decent looking covops, can get back out there with the right brand name on the hood."
7/20/2009,and +1
7/20/2009,^^^this. praise and amen.
7/20/2009,i really didn't like have to cross train to pilgrim to get a useful ship for recon/plex/ scanning machine.
7/20/2009,"meh.... it's a ship. it don't matter what it looks like. this isn't warcrack. it's all about what can be fit to it. (if i wanted to look pretty, i wouldn't be playing eve... don't get me wrong, the graphics update was nice, but it's no gears of war or bioshock. i'd be happy flying in a white sphere rods sticking out for guns.) if ship models need/should be changed, the base model should be changed, too. in my opinion, it's better to keep the things as they are now. it makes a bit more sense in progression than previously for newer players and those of us that suffer from crs. (a t1 ewar frig changed into a t2 astro frig for a couple races, but not for others?)sorry for the small rant, but the changes are done. the complaints can continue, but i don't think things are going to get changed. maybe if there was a significant performance impact (scan probe bubbles or interface in general, warp tunnel effect) or causing other problems, i'd argue for changing it."
7/20/2009,"used to fly it all the time, can't bring myself to look at the ugly hull after it being such a nice lookin ship."
7/20/2009,"1) if you don't care what it looks like, then maybe you should go play a pen and paper game or something? maybe read a book perhaps.but for those of us to do enjoy using our graphics card for something other than porn, we'd like ships that don't suck.2) if ccp can toss out a simple patch and switch models, they can do it again. obviously it wasn't hard the first time. they just need to get it right, by way of switching the proper models. little kickstand boy (imicus) is an ugly model. while the maulus is much better by comparison, and wasted on frig ew which no one uses."
7/20/2009,imicus and probe > maulus and vigil tbh.
7/20/2009,"what is it with people and this idiotic issue? it's a damned ship model. it looks a bit silly, but it's really not an issue. insofar as it matters at all, it was a buff - you see how ugly the ship is, and it reminds you that the cloak is off. if you want to train ships based on how pretty they look, it's your own fault, and you can waste your time on anything you please. me, i don't care what my invisible ship looks like, and i won't support anyone trying to get a dev to waste even a coffee break ""fixing"" it now that it's correct and implemented."
7/20/2009,"part of the reason of the change was to make afterburners viable in pvp instead of mwd not only being the only thing useful, but required."
7/20/2009,"afterburner on interceptor was relatively effective for close range tackling - i used it many times successfullywhat they did was make mwd and afterburners equally worthless, as the entire speed tactic is no longer a force worth fearingif they really cared about making afterburners more viable, they would have introduced something like 50% web resistance on afterburner.no, what they did was eliminate speed as a threat"
7/20/2009,now this truelly is a nerf. just slow everyone else down and we will be happy.it seems they aren't the only ones going overboard.
7/20/2009,how did this work on other ships? interceptors aren't the only frigates.
7/20/2009,"i am certain, from my experience, that 50% web resistance on afterburner would have made it a popular module for close range pvp.anyway, it's pointless to talk about it now. ccp destroyed speed tactics."

7/20/2009,"hi, it seems the corporations could get a little more realistic, let me explain :- % on sales (not just missions isk) that could be of diffenrent value from the main %.- creating groups in the corps so we could give different % to each of them (a discounts kind of thing).- votes : so members could decide if the money in the corp should be used for this or that (51% minimum for the vote to pass)feel free to reply =)"
7/20/2009,"#3 already exists - you can make freeform votes. #1 and #2 seems like they could cause horrible abuses on the part of unscrupulous ceos. they'd make my life easier - it's way easier to recruit when you get to include ""we won't **** you like those other guys do"" in the ad - but they'd probably be bad ideas overall."
7/20/2009,"currently more then half the stuff you can get in hacking sites is nearly worthlessencryption skillbooks - everyone only needs 1 in a lifetimeinterfaces and their parts - same, 1 per job and don't ever need moredatacores - research agents provide those in much greater quantities and since you don't need to be even subscribed to get them the prices are lowdecryptors - mostly okbooster reactions - same as interfaces, everyone has one and doesn't want moremy proposal is to have interfaces and reactions wear out in time and require replacementalso, other sciences skillbooks should drop in hacking sites, not only encryption methods."
7/20/2009,"i support this as well.data cores are so worthless that, if i don't have enough space in my cargo hold, i really don't care if i leave them behind. the fact that people can collect these on an alt, log in once a year, and dump them on the market for cash is pretty stupid. interface prices have been dropping, too. not much you can do about the skillbook prices, it's a skill. personally, i don't care if the t2 stuff ends up being a little more expensive."
7/20/2009,"1. lots of new player/alts join the game and need the skills.2. datacores, while agents provide much higher quantity, are still worth it. i mean we got some datacores at 600-700k now. and the demand is growing.3. interfaces/reactions, labs get blown up, corps start so there is a demand.if you ask me the balance is ok, compared to the isk you can get from equally hard combat sites.not supported."

7/20/2009,"kinda curious how many times ccp has to say salvage is never going to be restricted before people get the hint.no, i'm not a ninja, yes i am a mission runner, i see no problem with ninja salvagers, don't act like a victim and you wont be one."
7/20/2009,"csm forums to bring an issue up to ccp via the csm's in order to have it address. kinda like your government. unless of course you live in a dictatorship...how many people said drunk driving was bad repeatidly before they made laws against it. how many times did the government say ohh it's no harm no foul.if you were to play a real world scenario of say international water salvaging. you can protect the salvage that you find. how extreme you protect it of course is up the the person/s but you can do something about it. if eve is based off simular ideals. what can you do to protect salvage? cause when you are tractoring a wreck and another person can still salvage that wreck there is still no claim of possession? that's like you dropping monies on the ground and i scoop it up. nevermind the fact that your fingers were on the paper, but hey it hit the ground and there is nothing you can do about it."
7/20/2009,"the proposal in the first post is not about restricting salvage, it's about making it possible to find it when it floats in space without anybody around. i'd like that."
7/20/2009,"it's easy, soon as a ninja salvager appears you have 2 easy solutions, 1. they can't tractor the wrecks so as soon as the get within range of a wreck, destroy it. 2 destroy all wrecks and warp off. ninja salvagers want either easy isk or pvp, give them neither and they will move on."
7/20/2009,"we'll leave for the ~2 minutes it takes us to get the popcorn. then we come back and watch you blow up all your wrecks anyway, the idea in the op is not a ninjanerf at all. i wouldn't use it in hisec at all; i'd use it to cruise fw areas and salvage delicious t2 wrecks. this thread deserves moar bump."
7/20/2009,t2 is no way luxury its pretty much standard. the insurance system needs overhaul.
7/20/2009,"nice to see someone still cares, but as another tip, serenity's list is dead. i spent a while updating it daily with a new post to categorize the stuff(a gm deleted it all to make space for serenity's posts, but you can see all my stuff here), but after the first few serenity quit updating it, and i eventually decided to stop with my updates. now all the people who have been kicking around the assembly hall too long just tell you if it's redundant."
7/20/2009,"since this keeps happening, it might be worthwhile to point out that these threads are simply for the csm's to nominate what issues they are bringing to the meeting, not for the general playerbase to nominate what they want to discuss at that meeting."
7/20/2009,"we're in space where no direction is special and orientation is whatever works. i was thinking about how i wanted direct navigation in some of the missions i was doing (notably one where i had to find a hole in a hollow asteroid), but representing this would be difficult. first, the player would have to establish a coordinate system, then fly relative to that. (i recently read the excellent how apollo flew to the moon and it really makes it clear how complex this was with all their calibration of the guidance platform and the various orientation matrices.)i guess i can see direct navigation in combination with a ccokpit view since that gives you an implicit frame of reference (the ships's orientation) from which to navigate. however, i suspect this would be harder to use in practice. do the ships have steerable main engines and/or or attitude thrusters? could you ""strafe"" perpendicular to the natural ship attitude using guidance thrusters?from a ccokpit view, i guess you could use an extended wasd control with the length of time for which you held down each key corresponding to the acceleration applied in that axis. it would be interesting to see how this worked out in practice, but i suspect it would be pretty hard to use."
7/20/2009,"maby because while combersome evemail is functional?if you would bother to read any of the information out there about wis you would know it is being worked on alongside other projects. this is why they can still put out patches like the upcoming fw/rigs/fuel bays patch next month.mmo's also have a tendency to live and die by content. not enough content and people leave. not enough fresh content and people leave.wis might not be the content evebody wants, but it is something many of the players do want. it will also add depth to the game with is something very few mmo's have acomplished.personally i am looking forward to wis and would rather they spend the time now to work out the kinks so that we dont have to deal with them later.-vic"
7/20/2009,"no, the issue is real. re-post it in the right forum(assembly hall or features and ideas), and you might get the sort of response you want. the devs don't read jpsc from what i know of, and the csm is only constitutionally allowed to raise threads from the assembly hall. repost this in ah, or self-report and ask for a move(but given this chatter, i'd just cut and paste), and i'll gladly support you there."

7/21/2009,"ridiculous.you may have blown up a ship, but the modules inside the wreck are still not yours. if your loot alt isn't fast enough to scoop it up, that's your own fault.and your reward is winning the battle. how about this instead, loot inside a ship's wreck is untouchable for 20 minutes after a battle, thus giving the loser 15mins to drop aggression and 5 minutes to pick up what crap survived."

7/21/2009,"fully support! of all the game ideas suggested, this has to be one of the most useful and fun ideas i've seen posted.not only that, but with all the ideas put forth about how it could be implemented, the reality of it seems quite plausible.now while this idea should be spread among the player base to get some ideas for implementation, rules, and restrictions, i think this could potentially add to the dynamics of fleet warfare in a very positive way.count me in!"
7/21/2009,"i don't see a problem with that. a carrier, capital ship, should be able to hold a support fleet inside it. making a carrier/ms/titan able to move the support around with them doesn't make them solo pwnmobiles or anything, you still need that support fleet, it's just a bit easier to move them around. someone will probably say that makes the titan jump bridge obsolete, but that's far from true, a titan has a limited sma, while an unlimited amount of ships can pass the bridge, and using a bridge doesn't require you to put the titan on the battlefield. 100% supported, the linked thread discuss several ways to achieve this effect and the illusion of this happening, while avoiding the player inside player and ownership problems ccp has said preventing them from implementing this in the first place."

7/21/2009,indeed all are good points the point to this in specific is to not stop theft but to make it possible for a ceo or director to find out something was stolen without having to contact ccp for an item trace.though the current trend of theft does concern me i dont see a way to make it safer without completely changing the mechanics of the corp hangar. one thought on a side note was allow things other than bpo's to be locked down so that they cant be moved without a corp vote. back to topic tho. aside from helping with theft identification it would also greatly increase the ceo's directors abilities to search track and find corp assets after a relocation or invasion. one director lends something out another director looks notices its missing but cant tell where it went cause the other directors offline. so he gets concerned. i mean this is avoidable and in rl its as easy as an audit log or a sign in/out sheet. you could simple add a third tab in role take/query/audit. then in the corp hangar you could set it to every time somethings taken out of a hangar that has secure enabled the remover has to right a note and is then recorded taking the item with time and date. also this would allow ccp to enable the security officer to use corp audits to sieze items. say an item marked corp is transered out of hangar well if its property of the corp then the security officer has the ability to search your hangar ( as he does now) and remove assets that originated in the corp hangar.least i think those are some more good ideas and explainations of the intent

7/21/2009,"to pull a can you need at least tractor power +1 vs any other ship attempting tractoring - or else nothing moves.add t2 tractor beams, with +2 tractor power (needing, say, graviton physics l4 and having a 24km range with 600 m/s dragging speed).give +5 tractor power to the capital tractor beam i, and introduce a capital tractor beam ii with +20% everything (+6 tractor beam power, 20% more range, 20%more tractoring speed, needs graviton physics l5).introduce 3 tractor beam rigs for tractor beam strength, range and tractor speed.multiple tractor beams from the same ship should be usable on the same wreck/can, tractoring speed will be that of the lowest speed tractor being used from the ""tractor pull win"" ship regardless of ""tractor strength"" advantage."

7/21/2009,yeah any sales that have gone though before rule change are allowed to since they were agreed upon before such rules were introduced.
7/21/2009,i would ammend this with the provisio that they can only sell the slots to a reserve alliance and must then become a reserve themselves. that way noone has to do the corp shuffle and the winner of the auction can simply step into the arena and pew pew.

7/21/2009,"i put a edit in the first post, at best i would like to see anynew auction for spots from when ever the rules set is in place to be against the rules. likly hood of it making it into the rules of the next tourney would be acceptable. not making it in to the rules at all, well that is a dark path, since this has been put into the public veiw there will be more people wanting to do this which obviously put less pvp on the field until candidates have purchased a slot. i know some of you are compairing it to normal expenses of buying items and such but this isnt a item this is a tournament."
7/21/2009,"the logical rule that should be added to the next tournament (and following ones) is...""pilots eligible to participate in the alliance tournament must have been part of the alliance since the moment the application was submitted up until the tournament.""clarification : * this would automatically disqualify character sales too, since you have to drop to a npc corp as per current character transfer rules* it would also disqualify alliance-jumpers trying to get into as many alliances as possible to become eligible* and it would automatically make selling spots in the tournament impossible as a result___a.c - i strongly suggest you rephrase your op to make the above clear"

7/21/2009,"selling an alliance tournament slot is, in my mind, no different than selling a betting slip at a horse race. it is a valuable asset, and it is yours to do with as you please. if ccp doesn't want this happening, they can go back to giving out prizes evenly spread across alliance members. i do not, under any circumstances, support a change to game rules telling people who they can and cannot accept into their alliances - and make no mistake, that is exactly what you're asking for. not supported."
7/21/2009,if this is allowed come next alliance tournament then expect to see a ton of place holder alliances bidding for slots for resale. expect to see me there with 10+ myself.
7/21/2009,definitely agreed.nobody should be able to buy their way in.
7/21/2009,"agree, the ally touranment should be hold in respect. and also larkonis trassler of neo spartans laconian syndicate should clearly be removed from csm for his actions."
7/21/2009,just because he thought of it first imo. i see no problem here.
7/21/2009,"^^the above sums up my thoughts on this aswell^^besides who cares, the allaince tourneys have been a sad sad shadow of their former glory ever since 2007."
7/21/2009,"imo, laconian syndicate should be kicked out of the tourney and replaced with one of the backups. if they already sold their spot, the money should be refunded. no further action needed beyond ccp making it clear that the spots cannot be traded."
7/21/2009,"you mean back when bob was owning all tournaments because they had the most isk to invest in it and everyone knew who was gonna win ?your a freaking idiot man.the accusations of lack of e-morality, the e-drama, the tears - of tri, ... all make it seem like this tournament is gonna be a hell of a lot of fun. :)not supporting this."
7/21/2009,let them be sold slot in motor sports have been sold in the past why not let that come into the game
7/21/2009,"seeing that what is sold is a place in a alliance for some corp wanting to participate into the alliance tournament i see nothing making that unacceptable per se. i find a bit disturbing a csm delegate doing that as they should keep a higher standard of conduct than the average player (i know, big dream, like the politicians had a higher standard of conduct than the average citizen).so while i find the whole thing not a shining example of flawless morality, it is fully acceptable within the game rules and moral standard. i must admit i would find fun if after the tourney end, in a very eve scam stile, the alliance would keep the prizes (whatever they are this year) and the paid isk while kicking the corp out."
7/21/2009,"silly. this is totally in the spirit of eve and should be encouraged.if the system is not changed, i predict a great market for tournament slots next year. more capitalism!"
7/21/2009,"i was being silly (and wrong), sorry.make it count for next tournament."
7/21/2009,"oh, please. bar the one team that flew the imperial ship(who lost), any self-respecting alliance can afford a run at he alliance tournament. i could self-fund it if i wanted to, and i'm not an especially rich player. unless the rules back then allowed for officer gear or something, money is not an issue for any serious alliance. that said, i agree with you - this at is going to be fun to watch. the drama only makes it funnier."
7/21/2009,"not supported, this is hilarious."
7/21/2009,"this.also, this:followed by: with the minor wording difference that the eligible pilots have to be part of the alliance since at least a day before the lottery for tournament spots took place and allowing maybe 2-3 pilots that aren't eligible by this rule per team (or some kind of ratio depending on the amount of pilots per team, rounded down, for example 33% in a team of 8 would mean 2 non-eligible pilots allowed).i also hope (and expect) that lark scams the pilots of the auction's winning team out of any rewards they would possibly win. the rewards do get to the alliance executor corp or its ceo, i assume?"
7/21/2009,this stuff is why i voted for lark in the csm election. go neos
7/21/2009,should def be stoped and the teams that do get pulled out and the spots given to the people who lost out on the draw.
7/21/2009,"pretty sure this was considered by the devs before they decided on the format.so you ban alliances from doing what i'm doing, how many others are going to do it on the quiet? how are you going to enforce this?no alliance may recruit new corps or members after the listings have been published? that's going to put a downer on things. i'm not the first person to do this and i won't be the last."
7/21/2009,"participating at an alliance tournament is a sport. jumping on the opportunity and making a business based on the weak ruleset is just wrong. those who are saying that this is very eveish are right, eve is a harsh world, people are scamming each other around all day but that does not mean that the alliance tournament should be like that as well. it is not pointing into the right direction. you do not honestly believe that the at7 team at ccp sat down to a table and agreed that ""cool we are going to do a lottery, so that those who win can sell their places for good"". it is quite obvious that there isn't much ccp can do right now to stop this from happening at at7, as the rules are fixed and changing them now would cause a lot more trouble than good. however, here is an opportunity to learn from for at8 so this does not happen again. they should either drop the lottery and find some other solution, or make some new rules that counter this tournament position selling. like someone already suggested, only allow pilots to the fights who were members of the tournament before the alliance applied. tbh, i can live with the feeling that new members in my alliance cannot fight at the tournament if this rule makes the tournament cleaner. why would i send my newest recruits to the alliance tourney anyways, this is not a playground. those who send pilots who just joined the alliance are most probably either selling the position or an alt alliance, so it's not a big loss anyways. i support that the csm discusses this problem internally and if they find that this is a problem, escalate it to ccp."
7/21/2009,man it's full of cry babies here............. get a live or friggin bid to get neo spartans out of a pure alliance tournament!!!!
7/21/2009,"limit tournament to sov holding alliances. there, i said it :p"
7/21/2009,this.
7/21/2009,i am sure laconians are just disappointed they cant hotdrop with carriers and pulled out. they shouldnt earn money from it.
7/21/2009,"for those of you who don't live in 0.0 let me give you some background:most 0.0 outposts don't have a lot of office space. when you're trying to have an alliance of several corps live in one of these outposts, each office slot is valuable. when you don't have any hangar publically accessible for, say, capital ship pilots to access corp jump fuel, it becomes a huge hassle on a corp level. pos corp hangar arrays are not a suitable alternative because they go offline when the pos is reinforced, meaning you can't access anything inside. on an individual level, pilots can't set their clones to the outpost remotely without an office, adding one more thing that just makes life in 0.0 a pain in the ass. as it stands now, corporations that own a 0.0 outpost control who is allowed to rent new offices and how much these offices cost. if they sieze an outpost from a hostile alliance, generally the hostile alliance will rent all the office space on the way out to ""salt the earth"". the conquering force can, at best, uncheck the ""publically available"" option and wait for the hostile offices to expire, but herein lies the problem: in addition to the month of rent they just paid for, the office owner can also renew for the next month, even if the station owner has made that office slot unavailable. the result is that the office slot is unavailable for up to two months. two months. alliances are born and die in this hilariously long time period. you can have sov3, jump bridges and cyno jammers, and still be weeks away from hostile offices expiring. so, allow station owners unrent offices at will. the effect of this is the unrented offices' corp hangar assets get put into ""impound"" so if the station switches hands again, the owner just unimpounds it, whoopty doo, but it lets the conquering station owner actually be able to properly function and live in his new piece of 0.0 real estate."
7/21/2009,makes sense to me
7/21/2009,this should have been done years ago.
7/21/2009,:supports:
7/21/2009,yeh...absolutly agree
7/21/2009,lets do it.
7/21/2009,"why are you trying to change the status quo? just leave it as it is so ccp can focus on more important changes, like their upcoming cosmos social spaceship networking website."

7/21/2009,"common sense, why i never!"
7/21/2009,i fully support this long overdue change.
7/21/2009,"while i support this, it makes logical sense, and will thus never be implemented."
7/21/2009,sounds good to me.
7/21/2009,zastrow told me to post here!(and its a good suggestion anyway)
7/21/2009,"this needs to happen. not having enough offices for not just your allies, or alliance members but a single one of your corps when you take a station is beyond ******ed."
7/21/2009,yes.
7/21/2009,"not supportedthe current mechanic is perfectly within the griefing/pvping spirt of eve. if it was infinite maybe i would say it should be changed, but 2 months sounds like an sufficent ammount of time to allow the losers get just a tad of revenge on the new station owners."
7/21/2009,"i can see some hardcore griefing happening if offices can be arbitrarily placed into impound - forcing a fire sale is one thing, but making it not even saleable? i'd prefer that this be implemented with a bit of a delay on it - say, a week to let people at least fire-sale their stuff, or contract it into personal hangars. this won't be such a big deal in cases of conquest(since you know it's coming with time to spare), but in cases of alliance drama and such, it'd be a reasonable defense mechanism. that said, the broad strokes i support."
7/21/2009,you should be able to deny them renewal. and any forced unrent should have a grace period of 2-4 weeks.supported.
7/21/2009,"personally, i want wis. the lack of it to this point is the main reason i haven't played eve until only a few weeks ago. i've played many other mmos over the past 20 years (yeah, i consider some of the old muds as mmos ) and am looking forward to a few others such as star trek online (gawd i hope they improve the character graphics before launch!) and fallen earth, but even though eve has intrigued me, the lack of ingame characters has kept me from taking the plunge. it was only after a visit from my brother who plays eve and his revelation that wis was getting near that i decided to open two accounts and get started.the game as-it-is is quite awesome, but the lack of a 'real' ingame character is a turn-off to me as i'm sure it is to many, many other mmo players. ambulation will give eve the much-needed personification that is needed to actually pull a player into the game universe and will probably lead to other interesting features as well.so...not supported."
7/21/2009,not supported
7/21/2009,i support removing insurance for both concord destructions and self destructions.
7/21/2009,"this, but it also only makes sense if players are not allowed to stay in ""invincible"" corporations. if they want to talk about adding more ""risk"" to hi-sec griefers, why not add more ""risk"" to carebears who sit in state war acadamy and are unkillable via any other means than a gank?why should npc corporation members be allowed more safety from gankers if they don't have to give up anything?i'll support this, if you add on ""boot players from npc corps after 14-21 days (trial period)""if we're talking about ""risk vs. reward"" why are npc corps immune to wardecs? i say once a player is passed their ""noob"" time they gain the full benefits of becoming an eve player (wardecs and all).you have to look at the reason some people gank in hi-sec. it's either profit, grief, or because someone is un-wardec'able.for profit, i agree, remove insurance from concorddoken.for grief, i agree, remove insurance from concorddoken.for un-wardec'able, give players another option to kill them.some of you people are talking always about ""risk vs. reward"" where is the risk in an npc corp where you cannot be wardecced and killed via normal means?"
7/21/2009,remove all insurance. that's totally fair.
7/21/2009,"exactly the point. if you do it for lulz you should pay (in game) for the right to get your lulz and killmails.in low sec/0.0 you pay with the risk of being the target of a preventive attack, in high sec where the target can't do a preventive attack you should pay losing the isk you invested in the ship.leave it for rookie players in the first few months and maybe non combat ships in high sec. the problem is what that will do to the mineral market."
7/21/2009,had wondered what happened to this. agree with self destruct as well!supported...
7/21/2009,i cant help but laugh.... all those folk who are ranting raving about this being an idea... when it really gets right down to it... they are just whining like a bunch of carebears.... they being the gankers and pirates who like to exploit insurance only to get concord'dconcord governs the laws... the insurance is handed out by a corporation of the concord assembly.in all reality... all this crap about the insurance company not answer to the law... is a load of bull.supported.if you get concorded... or you self destruct... you should not get any insurance back.this has nothing to do with why... or how... or war-dec's.it's just that simple.you really think my insurance company would really be thrilled to find out i drove my car into a wall for the expressed purposes of getting a new car?yeah right.too long you people have had it made in the shade.... for consequences there should be penalties.this doesn't take away your right to suicide gank or greif... just makes it a little more... costly.
7/21/2009,not supported.you are in low sec. it's not supposed to be safe
7/21/2009,absolutely not.
7/21/2009,"proposal: ban whiny carebears who create thread after thread asking for the same thing in different terms.^ supporting dis.ex- quit whining and spamming the csm forum. this is what, your fourth thread?"
7/21/2009,no. and why the **** isn't there a 'no support' option?
7/21/2009,"to be perfectly honest, and i say this as a pvper who likes to kill people missioning in low-sec, it is far too easy to scan people out in a mission now.i used to mission in a nice little 0.1 system called annancale. the lp was enormous, and it was nice and quiet. this was of course way back before even the first round of scanning changes, when it still took a lot of skill and a ton of luck to probe a missioner out, but that risk was always there, and it made it a little bit more fun.now that risk is a near certainty, which seems to me to be a little absurd. low sec died big time when it became a virtual certainty that missioning there would get you scanned out. some kind of rebalancing is needed, probably a little bit with the scanning system and a little bit with mission mechanics related to scanprobes."
7/21/2009,"next patch will introduce new implant sets that can make you 100% unprobable, now your getting more than your asking for, 100% safety, isnt that enought? imho if you still think that combat probes needs increased time after that then i think your just after to grief pvp players.not supported."
7/21/2009,"for the love of god, stop coming up with this pathetic elitist excuse for everything that is unbalanced in low-sec! it's first and foremost a game, and a game is meant to be fun. when only one party has the advantage and can pretty much ""own"" the other, it's not fun, it's unbalanced and should be tweaked accordingly.no, low-sec is not ""supposed"" to be safe, and it's not. anyone can attack anyone there without concord interfering, and that's what not-safe means. not that you can also get ganked in deadspace by anyone without warning or any way to detect it.i'm not the most experienced prober out here (far from it) but i've written a guide on advanced use of the directional scanner to probe ships faster, which pretty much confirms what the op is referring to. i won't say it's ""generally easy"" to probe ships, but i'll say it's easy to probe ships without them knowing about it when you know how to do it. too easy.eve online might be a mmorpg and not a solo rpg game, but you can't always fly around with a fleet of friends with big guns. a lot of players are more casual, or are in newer corporations where there's not a lot of experienced pvp players. upper low-sec systems such as 0.4 should be a viable option to run missions in without being ganked so easily.and by the way, there's a big difference between not wanting to be ganked 5:1 by elite players in a 0.4 system without any warning, and not wanting to do any pvp at all. stop calling everyone a carebear just because they want some aspect of pvp combat tweaked.i support the proposition in general in the sense something needs to be tweaked so that victims being probed down can have a better chance at detecting incoming probes. one thing they could do though, is to have a sort of ""deactivation"" delay when recalling probes, where the probes would stay at their deployed location for a few seconds before flying back."
7/21/2009,"thanks for keeping it honest, lucas. i know this isnt going to be a popular thread among low sec pirates who insist in having it easy. i expect the flames. and i also dont expect a whole lot of support on the matter because i know i am one of the very few dedicated mission runners in low sec. the little bit of mission runners that ran in low sec have packed up and moved back to high sec or 0.0 rather than attempt to correct the situation. and with all these easy-kill-pirates on these forums ensuring their play-styles stay easy i dont blame them. ive moved around a whole lot in low sec and have noticed there arent many around like me anymore. its mostly players that occasionally run missions but dedicate their times in other things, mostly pirating themselves. i hope ccp can remedy the situation soon rather than later."
7/21/2009,"oh my, you seem to be a exceptional narrow minded person, combat probes are not only a tool for mission busting pirates they are also used for fleet combat, and in a real combat scenarios ships are not sitting still in a mission spot.they very much need the fast scanning time to be able to track ships moving around in systems.in fleet combat you rarly (if ever) got the luxury of having time to exact pinpoint someone whit directional scan, moving out scan range and launch probes/arange them for 100% hits.if you want to be safe, wait for the new implants, and stop comming whit stupied ideas that you have no idea what kind of impact they will have."
7/21/2009,"no, unless you are equipped with an extra chromosone and safespot 1000k from a gate or planet it generally takes two passes and at least 30 seconds to track down a ship that is safed or in a mission."
7/21/2009,"quite wrong. it may take more than 30 seconds in total before you can warp to someone, but it only takes 5-10 seconds to do the probe scan and get a 100% hit on the target if you're using the directional scanner first to find his location and range. so in the end, the target can only see probes on his scanner for that much time, and if by any badluck he wasn't refreshing the scanner at that precise moment, he won't see them at all and get caught.see the guide linked in my signature for more details."
7/21/2009,then all they would have to do is only make it slower to scan targets that are in mission deadspace locations.
7/21/2009,"i wouldn't mind a change like this at all, since it allows both scenarios to co-exist. but i suspect avariel's concern is more of an excuse and not the real reason for not supporting a change to combat probes. but honestly, i can't see any easy-kill-seeking pirate agreeing with this change, ever."
7/21/2009,the imicus grows on you. give it some time.
7/21/2009,"as the word about cosmos is now out officially, i suggest the csm takes some time with ccp to go through the cosmos plans to provide some early feedback. why wait till the release in winter and the saucer eventually hitting the fan. ;)the csm with its unique combination of people knowing big alliances, small corporations, pvp, carebear, security features, community design, and being tied to the player base can seriously aid in prioritization and provide opinions on how enhanced game experience would have to look like.on top of that, we might be able to pull some additional info out of ccp's noses. :)"
7/21/2009,"really?really?the csm has no place to ask to ask to see new things. the csm can be shown things, if ccp trust the csm. there's legal implications with doing so, as per your nda. having a csm saying ""hey, we want to see this thing and know things that others don't"" just makes the csm seem like a group of elitist players who wants to see things in advance of everybody else.ccp has shown the csm things in the past. but that has been something solely left to ccp to decide what. if ccp thinks that it's important enough, they will contact you and arrange a meeting to discuss it. or even show you in iceland. but requesting to discuss something which you have no reason but ""oh, we just want to discuss it and get all the neat details"", just puts the csm in bad light, imo"
7/21/2009,"where in the op did you read an intent to breach the nda, lavista ?the csm has been established to improve the ccp-player-communication and have an additonal feedback channel. very well then, the dev blog clearly shows that ccp is willing to ventilate the topic to some extent.my proposal shall indicate that the csm is willing to discuss with ccp on that matter. on as much as ccp are willing to reveal."
7/21/2009,"nowhere did i state that anybody is going to breach the nda. however when ccp discusses upcoming features with the csm, it's nda covered. it's that simple."
7/21/2009,"sure, the csm can see the shiny new stuff if they like. not sure why you think you need a forum thread for this, though - it's a request, not a resolution."
7/21/2009,"currently, because of the way the keyboard shortcuts are treated by the game, you always have to use key modifiers (shift, ctrl, alt), or otherwise the game would become confused when you want to chat or type text in any input box. there are also several keys that you can't bind for some unknown reasons.most mmorpg's have remedied this by having a ""text input mode"" system, where, when you press a certain key (usually enter or /) or when the focus is switched to any text input box, all single-key bindings that can also be used for typing text are disabled until you exit the mode (by clicking/tabbing outside the field or by pressing esc).i think i'm not the only one that would like to be able to bind any function to a single key (a-z, 0-1, numpad keys, etc...) instead of having to press multiple keys for everything but module slots and ui functions (using the f keys).furthermore, there shouldn't be any keys you cannot bind unless they are used for core ui functions (such as alt-f4, tab, enter and esc, etc...), and also, the system should be able to detect any key automatically (including peripherals such as joystick and game controller buttons).the process of binding a key using key modifiers should also be transparent. no more shift, ctrl and alt checkboxes. you should just have to double-click on the function name in the shortcuts window and then press whatever key or key-combo you want to bind that function to (which is pretty much a standard for most games out there).in short, mapping a key should work like this:1. open the shortcuts option2. double-click on the function you want to change the key binding for.3. the game enters key binding mode. while in this mode, all other keyboard shortcuts are disabled so you can use any.4. you press the key or key combo you want to bind5. the game automatically detects the key and binds it to the function. if the key is conflicting with another function binding, a prompt pops up to tell you so and asks you to confirm if you want to unbind the conflicted function or not.6. you click a ""save"" button to save all bindings. doing so would save the bindings into a local file. (whether it's in readable and editable plain text or that it's binary is up to ccp but being able to directly edit key bindings in a file would be nice).i'm aware this would require a lot of rewrites, but i think it's very much needed and is worth mentioning to ccp.edit: changed thread title to something more to the point"

7/21/2009,"or a module to reduce ship speed?barring rockets, missiles are fine. they have their strengths and their weaknesses."
7/21/2009,"choosing damage types becomes a moot point in pvp (screw pve) where everybody (as in everybody that isn't comedy fit and/or ratting/plexing) omnitanks in the first place and most missile bonuses except a select few (namely the raven, rook and widow, lachesis, huginn and typhoon (with lolsplitweapons) with rof bonus, the golem with a general missile damage bonus, a few of the amarr missile boats with a general bonus for short range missiles) have bonuses applied to their racial damage type (with a few ships that at least have a rof bonus on top like the nighthawk and cerb or have a minor damage bonus for other damage types like kestrel, breacher and inquisitor).going by caldari ships kin bonus:according to my calculations using the relevant ship skill at a reasonable level 4 (-> 20% kinetic damage bonus, on l5 the damage bonus becomes only more significant meaning less increase after switching ammo), switching ammo away from the kinetic bonuses usually only brings a very minor damage increase thanks to that or even a slight damage decrease, unless your target didn't plug his biggest resistance hole at all.rough, quick and dirty calculation examples (assuming 100 as missile base damage) and listing values for bonused missiles (golem, sacrilege, etc.) and l5 skill damage for comparison:drake with t2 invul and em hardener has 58% thermal, 68.5% kinetic and 75% em resists. going with drake as a typical shield tanking example since t1 armor tanks already have kin as their default second weakest resist and it's a decent damagetype to use against to begin with.em missiles: higher resists than kinetic, pass.therm missiles (100*1-0.58): 42bonused therm missiles (120*1-0.58): 50.4kinetic missiles (120*1-0.685): 37.8kinetic missiles l5 ship skill (125*1-0.685): 39.375so depending on your relevant ship skill you'll do around 10% more damage than just sticking with your bonused damage. not stellar, but an ok increase. otoh, if you had a bonus on those therm missiles you'd get over 30% increase in damage instead.adding another invul further compresses the spread of resists with therm at 69% and kin at 76% leaves you with following damage after resists:em missiles, higher than kin resists. do not want.therm missiles (100*1-0.69): 31bonused therm missiles (120*1-0.69): 37.2kin missiles (120*1-0.767): 27.96kin missiles l5 skill (125-0.767): 29.125as expected pretty much the same as the added invul doesn't change the resists in relation to each other. an approximate 10% increase assuming you hit the right damage hole against ~30% with a general damage bonus.now let's check it with shield rigs (2xem 1xtherm shield rigs + 2x invul) since those are cheap enough for sticking on your average pewpew ship and will probably become more widespread with the addition of rig sizes. you'd end up with 70.6% em, 74.3% therm and 76.7% kin resists.em missiles (100*1-0.706): 29.4bonused em missiles (120*1-0.706): 35.28therm missiles (100*1-0.743): 25.7bonused therm missies (120-0.743): 30.84kin missiles (120*1-0.767): 27.96kin missiles l5 skill (125*1-0.767): 29.125switching damage type now boils down to a meh damage increase of < 5% for em and a decrease of ~10% for therm missiles. with general bonus, you'd get a 26% and 10% damage increase respectively instead.best case scenario, tank with 2x invul, leaving you with 61.2% em and 76.6% kin:em missiles (100*1-0.612): 38.8bonused em missiles (120*1-0.612): 46.56kin missiles (120*1-0.767): 27.96kin missiles l5 skill (125-1*0.767): 29.125now you hit the paydirt where switching damage type is completely and undeniably worth it with ~30% increase in damage even over l5 ship skill and a buttraeping 65% increase in damage using damage bonused em missiles.[continuation follows]"
7/21/2009,"sadly those shield tanks that come completely without em and/or therm resistance plugging are according to my experience and a quick glance at a few recent and randomly selected drake and raven killmails at eve-kill.net mostly comedy fits that pose no threat to you either way and are going to die in a terrible fire whatever damage type you use, just a little bit slower or ratting fits where you'll obviously be prepared to hit the damage hole if they're tanking against kin rats.additionally, you'll have to find out which category of tank you're dealing with first, because you're potentially worse off with em or therm depending on the fit. to do so, you'll have to load rainbow damage first check the damage log for the best hit and spend what feels like an eternity reloading (wtb> 1sec laser reload times) before you do your max damage. that's 10 seconds doing no damage (except for the launcher(s) that already had the correct missile) potentially negating any damage increase you might get out of it, depending on the duration of the fight, unless for example the dps increase is absolutely needed to break a passive shield tank's peak regen.ymmv with armor tanks, but the general problem is the same. while kin is decent by default after plugging the exp hole with a hardener, there's nothing seriously left to shoot at (except against t2 gallente ships with their high base kinetic resist, where you're probably better off with *anything* but kin missiles by default where the lack of a general damage bonus on everything sucks pretty much, too) and when the kin hole is properly plugged as well you might start to consider therm missiles.in general i wouldn't bother to switch missiles on a single flavor bonused boat unless it can reasonably assumed that there's a gaping hole in the resists (ratters that are tanking against specific npc damage types and especially if they tank against kin damage rats), you're going against a gallente t2 ship or you know the fit your target is usually using after seeing previous losses using that shiptype on a killboard.tl;dr:on a ship with a bonus towards a specific missile damage flavour, your increases in damage on a proper omnitank (hole plugged) are on average relatively meh (unless you hit the untanked resistance hole) and if you're unlucky while you run in with the damage type for the expected weakest resist loaded can do quite a bit less damage than your bonused damage type even if the resist is actually lower than the one you're bonused against.edit/ps: please correct me should i have any misconceptions about how resistances get applied and/or errors in my calculations."

7/21/2009,a pair ? i think he has a pair just to do this kind of post already. lol. he's just asking for trouble. he just didn't look at the problem at all angles.
7/21/2009,the only change ill support is if alts where removed but additional accounts where permitted.simply because the alt thing is getting out of hand... but that might be an entirely different problem in itself.but in all things the point remains... if they want to lay down some money... who is ccp to deny the privilege?then you run into the rich man poor man argument..but that's a different story.not supported.
7/21/2009,i hate multi-boxing kinda takes the multi-player outta the mmo.
7/21/2009,"ok gents, i've been giving this some thought, hear me out here.now, i'm no industrialist by any stretch of the imagination. i do not trade, i do not mine, i do not research etc etc.however i do haul stuff, and ships.right now, my biggest gripe is that the only way for one to move a rigged bs is via carrier jump. sometimes, that's not an option, sometimes, that's expensive. as someone who has a corp solely made up of outlaws, selling that rigged bs which just ejected can prove quite hard. the orca is great don't get me wrong, yeah, the skill plan may be a little bit out of whack, but that's the price you pay for what is such an amazingly versatile little ship.anyway, i digress.add one rig slot to regular freighters, give them each 1 caliberation. with the introduction of the new sized rigs it shouldn't require much extra effort to code 'capital' or 'freighter' rigs. anyway, the only rig allowed is this one:cargo bay conversion rig (armor)caliberation cost: 1converts the entire cargo bay of a freighter to a freighter ship maintainance array.armour rig so it slows the ship as it's afking it's way through the world (power from engines must be diverted to structural integrity). ships can be put into the fsma fully stocked and ready for war but the fsma cannot be accessed in space nor can it be used for players to switch out modules.cost i imagine would be around 50-100 mil so it becomes prohibitive for a casual user to switch out on a regular basis, more useful for corporations who move rigged ships and the like or as a one time shot for an empire player bulk moving his ships across the cosmos."
7/21/2009,supporting my topic yo
7/21/2009,the freighter has no rig slots...or any slots for that matter.this means you'd be opening a can of worms for demands to adding a mass of things that aren't necessary.the solution to this problem is allow rigged ships to be stored in the freighter in there full size... or allow rigged ships to be packed at penalty of extra space.this keeps the freighter mechanic as-is.i recently have discovered how painful it is not to be able to pick or drop off cans.but i also know that such a thing would.... be widly abused... if allowed.gotta be careful how far we take this.
7/21/2009,this was suggested by csm1 too.it's not a bad idea. but i'm not sure if it's the most elegant solution either.
7/21/2009,the better solution is just to let unpacked ships go into cargo. the conversion rig is just clunky and unnecessary.
7/21/2009,this is already considered by chronotis. no need for the csm.
7/21/2009,"that already works up to 120,000 m<U+FFFD>. you just need to make a courier contract."
7/21/2009,"yes, so they just need to make it work without jumping through hoops like couriers, and to take off the stupid 120km3 limit on them."
7/21/2009,"i like the idea, but a better way to implement it might be to give freighters subsystems. all existing freighters would get the ""normal cargo"" subsystem for free and installed so people can keep using them in the same way they do now, but you could also choose to build/buy a sma subsystem and swap them out in any station. however, even with the sma sub/rig, it should still keep a small normal cargo bay (l0k m3 like a carriers corp hangar?) for modules and stuff like that for the ships. it could also hold the other subsystem so it can be reconfigured for moving cargo when needed."
7/21/2009,"tech 3 ""strategic"" freighter - price tag 2 billion isk (cheaper than a jump freighter but more costly than a freighter)"
7/21/2009,in all honesty there are a lot of other things that could be done in corp management... but these aren't those things.not support... although creative.
7/21/2009,"mission guys lose x% of their earning to the corp while the manufacturers, miners and traders don't lose anything."
7/21/2009,"so i know that ccp is talking about balancing sov and many people may not agree with me on this, but what adding another level of sov, sov 5.the requirement:sov 4 in (2/3) 66% of the constellations in the region.the bonus:.75 time multiplier on cap, not super-cap, production in your const with sov 5.how it would work:the capital of one your sov 4 systems would become a sov 5 system and the surrounding systems in the constellation would become sov 4 systems. 60 days to go from a sov 4 system to sov 5 once all requirements for sov 5 are met.this is just an idea being tossed around in my head, knock it if you want, doenst matter to me. i just think it would be an interesting change to sov that would make for some good fun."
7/21/2009,"unfornatually i disagree with your proposal, sov at the moment is already hard enough to brake for alliance that dont even want to bother trying to defence there space, also make residence who have lived there a while shell them selves up even more which is not what sov needs right now. also there are to many super caps in game and so increasing the speed to make them faster it detremental to the cause.i believe what sov needs is something a bit easier to brake but not to easy to invaders just walk in, just something that makes the space more dynamic just so that powerblocks really have to be on the ball to maintain such a large amount of space."
7/21/2009,"i agree with you on supercaps, that needs to be switched to caps and i do understand where you are coming from. i knew that would be an argument against this idea, and honestly, i have nothing to counteract that argument"
7/21/2009,sov 4 is more than powerful enough - i see no need to make high-end sov even better. not supported.
7/21/2009,"what if it was reworked to where the surrounding systems do not become sov 4, but instead all moons in your sov 5 constellation, or even region, have double moon production?i would like to go with region because this would be regional sov so i feel there should be at least one bonus that would affect the whole region."
7/21/2009,the problem with it it that sov need to be more fluid pos shoots are boring and to a dying alliance taking down the new sov 5 would just be a chore. it already a bore fest at sov 4. it need to be more fluid as i have stated earlier. a active sov where that you need a bulk of members in the area. sov 4 is aduqute
7/21/2009,i don't see the sov system needing any additions.i see it needing to be reworked from the ground up on a number of areas.not supported at this time.
7/21/2009,"i demand that ccp adds a module to the game that doe the following:1. make all ravens , drakes , ships with mining lasers and ships with cargohold extenders invunreable to damage , ewar and or bumping.2. will kill all ships attacking the raven , drake or ship with mining laser/cargohold extender.3. makes you unprobable.4. makes it impossible for other people to loot 'your' wrecks.eve really needs this because the risk and reward between money making and pvping is imbalanced. pvp is overpowered."
7/21/2009,"i'm not sure which bothers me more:the proposal itself, or the (once again) random support these kinds of proposals seem to gain from certain members of the csm."
7/21/2009,"locked.no content in op. well, no content that any game designer would ever consider."
7/21/2009,yo add this to the agenda: let station owners unrenting offices
7/21/2009,"i'm building a game that does the things jarslow mentions. with a newtonian physics model. it's playable, but i don't think it's playable in a way the vast majority of gamers would enjoy. hence i had to program a flight-assist that helps the player go into the direction he wants to (which of course can be overridden at any time), which makes it a lot easier to control but it's still several orders of magnitude more complex than freespace or even descent. 14 keys just for basic movement...working on the ui now as like jarslow sais, you can't get your bearings and speed in empty space thus there must be something to assist the player with that as well...op, be careful what you wish for."
7/21/2009,"i am of the opinion that there needs to be a gigantic ""raw skill points don't matter in eve"" with a following explanation of how a 1.5-10 mil sp ""noob"" can kill a 6 year old veteran in eve if he's having a bad day. (i.e. 50 mil sp industrial char gets killed easy by a 10 mil pure pvp pilot, or something like that)honestly if there was some gigantic pop up the first time you signed into the game. with a ""click here after you read this"" and then a ""are you sure you read this? it actually matters!"" in gigantic bold letters. just to make sure they did indeed read it (obviously people rolling alts won't have to see it).this alone would probably stop some of the whining. (you can never stop it all)"

7/22/2009,"at the moment you only need sentry drone interfacing 5 to use all races t2 sentry drones. this is not in line with the other combat t2 drones.so i propose that the racial drone specialization skills should be needed as well, in the same way as for t2 heavy drones.so to use garde ii you should need sentry drone interfacing 5 as well as gallente drone specialization 4.sure it will require a few more days of skilling but the benefit is that you get the damage bonus from the specialization skill applied to them."
7/22/2009,yup. get rid of the -10% dps drawback sentries have at present.

7/22/2009,this is what i expected to see when i heard about pos as a newbie... i was vastly disappointed when i saw what we have
7/22/2009,"i, too, think this is a very good idea. it just makes more sense - if my ship can fit in a carrier, why can't i?"
7/22/2009,"so? i fail to see your point. no really, i don't see any point at all.supported!"
7/22/2009,"tbh: remove damn jump/titan bridges and make it so ms>titans>carriers can move docked ships around. ms should have an stupid large bay for docked ships, followed by titans, and then carriers (not more than a couple of bs sounds fine, maybe only 1?)."
7/22/2009,yes it would be fun but it has been stated times before that this is not possible due to certain session changes (player logging off in ship etc.) and it screws up the code. hence this is why it is and probably will never be integrated.asking for this again will not help.

7/22/2009,supported.
7/22/2009,"bumped because i love my wyvern and she doesnt feel the love!i dont disagree carriers are logistics tools as much as support for dreads if and when regular fleets come rolling in. but since ms's cant dock they suffer greatly as a tool to haul ships around with seeing as you have to have pilots on both sides to load and unload. where with a carrier you can just dump em into your hangar and contract or trade them back ( or deliver if you have an office and they are corpmates). also the mother ship has no more bonus to repping than carriers, so its no more effective to rep with one. as well they also limited by the fact that they melt like butter on a stove when they get into a cap fight so why bring one at all. i guess what im getting at is they have very little purpose and use in the game as it stands unless you wanna lose it. this is cause their survivability is soo low that its sad. all we are asking is to give ms's a purpose that is different than a carrier something they excel at other than drones. finally for titans i would love to see battle titans with guns fitted and a siege mod warping in with the carriers and dreads and motherships to cap fights like a mixed fleet of caps. instead of look a fleet of dreads spotted with carriers, who are really just dread pilots who are in training."
7/22/2009,"still no rewrite from vuk though, maybe he is waiting until the meeting at fanfest? or maybe with the upcoming winter expansion changing sovereignty there is a little sentiment that ccp have made up their minds internally already and trying to push any changes by players is a waste of energy?"
7/22/2009,"agree 100 percent.mother ships are in dire need of some enhancements. they aren't even close to being worth the cost in their present form, especially considering all the shortcomings that ccp has saddled them with. at a minimum, they need tech ii fighters and enhanced survivability. otherwise, why bother at all?"
7/22/2009,"you quote an item on titans to emphasise support for mothership changes?odd i like the t2 fighters part however, though i would not like even more complexity and little crafting steps. simple more specialised fighter versions would be nice. heavy fighters, interdiction fighters, along those lines.i also liked the idea that got floated around elsewhere on using the remote ecm burst with scripts, to punch dreads out of siege and such."

7/22/2009,oh yes
7/22/2009,only if its called 'oops i ddd again'not stolen from smirkney smears
7/22/2009,in need of an urgent update.
7/22/2009,these ships have been neglected for ages and need to be brought up again. they need some rebalancing for sure and even maybe a look at the drop rates of the bpc's.i for one would also like to see them all have unique looks other than just a new skin. the only pirate factions which now have unique ships are the sansha's and the angels (with some stock ships). this is ofcourse eyecandy but would make faction ships stand out more (and not just a select few).full support.
7/22/2009,with the introduction of the new improved navy cruisers the pirate faction cruisers are looking more terrible than ever. i'll flag this up at the next meeting.edit: page 2 sniper
7/22/2009,"absolutely, totally supported and thanks for taking up the banner and running with it larkonis. the faction ships are way too cool an idea to let languish like this."
7/22/2009,basically at the moment it's only the pirate faction ships that need looking at. the navy varients are all pretty solid. but sub bs size all the pirate ships (apart from sanshas) have anaemic fitting and **** slot layouts. i'll be pushing for these to be looked at.
7/22/2009,"i got the impression that ccp are already aware of this problem. the only faction ship that is clearly superior to everything else is the nightmare - which was actually modified a long time ago from its original crappy version.the main problem i see is that ccp have a mental block again boosting stuff simply for the sake of improving things. they need to feel like they are nerfing something to act. one of the devs said something along these lines: that every nerf is a boost to something else and every boost is a nerf to something else. we need to help them by phrasing our ideas in a way that make it clear what they will be nerfing. once devs get a good sense of how boosting faction ships is a worthy sacrifice to achieve some terrible nerfs in other parts of the game, they will be moved into action"
7/22/2009,"mmmmm... delicious eom blue battleships.also, there are no caldari/minmatar and gallente/amarr hybrid ships. id think the caldari/minmatar ones would be focused on shield tanking, while gallente/amarr would have armor tanking bonii. just a thought..."
7/22/2009,this always annoyed that i can't tractor my alliance-mates abandoned rat wrecks because they aren't in my corp. seems pretty arbitrary.
7/22/2009,"supporting this. if necessary, have it flag to the ""owner"" of the wrecks"
7/22/2009,"if you added vectors into the mix, i think you should make t2 and overloading a part of the beam function :-p, but srsly, supported, for what that's worth"
7/22/2009,supported.how about have a warning box for destroy active probes too?
7/22/2009,\o/
7/22/2009,"there really shouldn't be any limits, it's up to the person accepting the contract to determine if they can move the stuff.the reason for the limits is so that players can't make a courier contract thats impossible to finish, what they should do is automatically split the courier mission into 120,000 m3 chunks. that way i can make a single big paying contract to move say, 1000 cruisers, rather than making tons and tons of contracts, which is just annoying."
7/22/2009,"not supported!!make the max limit 600k m3 or whatever, but not unlimited. it is bad enough with current contract scammers not to mention the contract mess that will happen if unlimited is ever implemented."
7/22/2009,exactly.
7/22/2009,up the item count in them as well. 100 items would not be sufficient for some super cluttered 0.0 hangers where cans just aren't realistically accessible.

7/22/2009,i am sure you mean someone else. sorry to disappoint you.
7/22/2009,make proposal for this and ill agree.
7/22/2009,what's funny about this is silver 0xd was the first (or one of the first?) to bid on the very spot larkonis is selling (a bid of 2 bil i believe).
7/22/2009,"my thoughts exactly. there's really nothing that would prevent a private sale of the slot.banning the sale of alliance tournament slots is unenforceable. the real problem here is that they're a finite resource; perhaps a better solution would be that _any_ alliance can put together a team and play some qualifying rounds.that's a much fairer solution than first come/first serve and it avoids the sale of slots entirely (your team + alternates is defined _before_ you qualify).overhead is increased (they have to run qualifying matches with tons of people), but if you really want to fix the problem..."
7/22/2009,why do you think that only allowing pilots to participate who joined the alliance prior to the tourney application would not solve this problem?
7/22/2009,"flash to bang time from applications opening to the first match is what? 8 weeks? 9 weeks?some alliances are born and killed in that time. people come and go, smaller entities may find they don't have the skill base for what was planned or the prostpect of fighting in the tournament may draw fresh blood into an alliance.placing artificial restrictions are daft imho."
7/22/2009,"all of this debate is completely pointless and y'all know it.next tournament everybody is going to use alternate identies to try and get a slot, regardless of whether they will openly or discretely swap slots between the various alternate identities. no matter how hard people shout here that they are opposed to it. from there on the alliance tournament will be known as the x64 tournament"
7/22/2009,"to be honest, i doubt it. they've had the option to do this all along, and it hasn't really happened - the only one i can think of was chribba putting <othep> into the last tourney with a bunch of immigrants as the 100m+ team. most big alliances do it for fun and to put their alliance names high on the scoreboard, not because they need a huge number of alts to try to win it all. it's only serious business if you make it serious business."
7/22/2009,"do not supportthis is eveedit: and after reading lark's posts, i will be voting for him next time around"
7/22/2009,"it has been done already, just on a relatively decent scale. othep was a good example of commercial thinking, [5] another but more on a level of failsafe, and on the odd opportunity bigger boys went to smaller boys with offers they couldn't refuse. isk makes stuff go round, with 64 slots people will make effort to get in if they are serious, and when people get serious they are not fond of leaving stuff to chance."
7/22/2009,"this kind of tournament sell out is a total disgrace. unlike general eve game play, tournaments have rules, there is honor involved. that's the whole pointbut when you put it up for sale, you destroy all honorwhat's next, a bid to buy out judges?who's gonna reside over this tourny, do the judges want to put their vote up for sale? start your auctions!"
7/22/2009,have em fight in the arena for profit or have em waste their invested billion just like the others who they f*cked with their selfishness.
7/22/2009,might as well drop this thread as ccp is allowing it.so get your bids ready for next year.
7/22/2009,^^this^^
7/22/2009,can't change the rules in the midst of the process. applying the criteria the op suggest would possibly rule out others who never intended to profit from it. some people complained about there being kenny and 5 in the list. but unlike lark they wanted to be in and fight really instead of selling their slot. similar problem applies to fw corps in general as they cannot be in an alliance while doing their usual business. just run it and everyone get over it. don't make the same mistakes next time again.
7/22/2009,asolutely.

7/22/2009,"but it prevents the attackers from benefiting from the ""griefing/pvping"" of conquering a station. also, it's a dumb and certainly unintentional mechanic that ties up a bunch of manhours trying to figure out who owns which office."
7/22/2009,"the eviction notice was when the station was getting shot for the purpose of taking it.honestly, station owners should just be able to take everything except the ship a pod is sitting in. give the owner a list of all player hangers, impounded corp stuff, and corp offices about to be closed, and let them take it all during the first day after they take the station and have system sovereignty.0.0 is supposed to be rough, and something like this would undoubtedly clean up a bunch of hangers that haven't been accessed in years."
7/22/2009,"why.been like the way it is for years. countless of people, corporations and alliances have petitioned to change the system. having seen the ""issue"" a bunch of times from both ends all i can say is that it fits with the system. it's like collateral damage, or infrastructural damage in a war, it is not supposed to end that easily. there is such a thing as an aftermath.besides, you can always use the interface to both mess with the fees and prevent the continuation of office renting.once upon a time i had a little spy alt in a corp which had its outpost captured by goonswarm, i fondly remember the whining of the ceo for getting his stuff locked up, but i also fondly remember the whining of the members as goons teased them around in local with it. at the same time on the other alt there was minor *****ing by fellow goonies about not being unable to unrent the hostile offices.once upon another time and on yet another goonie alt we had a bit of fun with messing around over an office in an outpost we (as goons) had lost. preventing the bad peeps to rent an office to continue their campaign and all that. how fun it was to get told how the bad peeps would not see use of the station for another month and a half. this obviously after right before losing the outpost making sure all the slots were rented by friendlies.so, the proposal really confuses me a bit. since pretty much everyone has two faces in eve, is this just a matter of changing faces as the circumstances warrant?if so, this is starting to remind me a bit of the whole supercapital issue drama, where all that matters is to whine about them when you face them, and to declare them ueber fun when you use them.but, back on topic. offices in 0.0 outposts are a part of warfare. risk, reward, consequences, time delays, infrastructural damage, we all know the drill. i fail to see the reason to change it now that we all have dealt with this for years on end, and as we all have used the current system from all sides of the coin."
7/22/2009,"so essentially they can sabotage the station so that you can't use all its feature immediately as you seize it?unbelievable, no one in rl would do that! standard tactic in rl and in most games when you conquer something you need to repair it or rebuild part of the structure. 2 months can be long, but i don't see any reason why you should have access to all the base functions immediately. much more reasonable than the op."
7/22/2009,"rough to rough, the leaving owner should have the option to detonate all the ammo and stuff on leaving, doing an high level of damage and requiring extensive repair from the new owner."
7/22/2009,this.
7/22/2009,2 months is an unreasonably long length of time
7/22/2009,"deal with it. everybody deals with it, everybody uses it, everybody abuses it.goonswarm has conquered outposts, and had fun messing up office fees for the odd idiot still paying them as well as simply using the management interface to lock them out. the timers complicated things, but people worked around it. that is planning and teamwork.goonswarm has lost outposts, and had fun messing up people's campaign plannings by locking down all the offices for as long as possible. the timers worked to the advantage, for planning and teamwork.everyone active on the playing field of 0.0 has dealt with both sides of the coin over time.you're a csm member zastrow, it is not too much to ask to provide a rationale here, a proper one yes two months is a long time, but no it is not game breaking, and everyone deals with this the same way. it is a factor in campaign planning, which everybody uses for both sides of the coin. two months is a neglegible timeframe in the ebb and tide of 0.0 warfare.so again, why change this? all the argumentation provided simply says ""it is too long"". that's not good enough, if not for the part of risk/reward/consequences then on a simple game mechanic level: billing & renewal."
7/22/2009,"and how is that a good reason, to just deal with it. it's obviously a broken mechanic.you put time and effort into conquering a station/outpost only to have some corp who used to live there grief your newly acquired station. in my opinion you should have full control over the station as you own it. you put time, effort and isk into it to gain control over the station to claim it as your own and you can still get messed around with in your own station. your half-baked reasoning of how much teamwork it is doesn't stand. how is it teamwork to just prolong all your rent times to 2 months just before you station gets conquered? the only thing i see is a broken mechanic being abused to the end.more control to the actual owners of the station so definitely a support."
7/22/2009,"what makes it ""obviously"". it's always been the case, and everyone has both suffered and used the timeframe that results from this mechanism. the griefing as you call it, is part of eve's gameplay. granted the past year and a half, maybe two, have seen the game get a bit softer, but especially in ""endgame content"" where the stakes are so high i can't see anything wrong with it.quite frankly, if this is griefing, one could even call kiting pos shields griefing. or shooting station services, perhaps once a station is captured repairing the services you shot should suddenly be repaired by a single quick click of a button on the management interface ... i do agree that whoever conquers an outpost should get full control over it. that is already the case. but as with everything in warfare nothing (well, almost nothing, you can always disband someone's alliance ) is instanteneous. everything takes at minimum time and effort.now given that everyone who plays the 0.0 game both suffers and uses this mechanism i get confused on why a change would be needed. taking into account the level of gameplay and how people play it to the best of their abilities it has never stopped anyone from waging war, on the contrary, in many cases it has been used as a strategic tool.it's not half baked reasoning i'm simply trying to get zastrow to clarify his reasoning, after all this is something which he, and everyone who plays on that level in 0.0 has stumbled into, and both endured and put to use. the rent times are not ""prolonged"" to 2 months btw, the timer comes from the billing & renewal mechanism. the abuse, as you call it, depends completely on where someone stands over time. in the case of goonswarm for example it has been both something to work around, as something which has been used to hamper the progress or operations of opponents. it just strikes me as odd, to suddenly put this on the table, where the mechanism has been both endured and put to use. hence the question to clarify beyond the point of ""too long"" it isn't a broken mechanism as it works as intended, it is not even a case of dodgy intended use. the ""abuse"" element derives from player behaviour. but perhaps it is simply a case of people changing their views depending on their position in game, that i could understand."
7/22/2009,"he's not dictating policy, you fuckwit, he's asking.and i support it, wis will be an abysmal failure, and the time/money spent on it would be better spent elsewhere."
7/22/2009,not supported. i want wis.
7/22/2009,don't need walking in stations.. can still have all the other cool features like players stores.
7/22/2009,"insurance does not cover the whole ship. you get what you pay for. if you don't want risk, why are you playing a multiplayer game?"
7/22/2009,i don't mind risk. i do mind people not receiving the full consequences of their choices - good and bad.
7/22/2009,"for the infinitely and repeatedly unanswered question (as usual, most arguments are ignored, with a straw man focused on something foolish someone said.): for everyone who is whining about how insurance doesn't operate like a real insurance company, why aren't you whining about how concord doesn't operate like a real police force? show me a police force that responds in a matter of seconds and never fails, and then get back to me on why insurance has to be realistic, as opposed to a game mechanic."
7/22/2009,why are people who fly warships into warzones still receiving insurance payouts?
7/22/2009,you mean like choosing to make isk while afk for 5-10 minutes at a time? what consequence should this choice have?
7/22/2009,"it already has the consequence of being far more susceptible to being suicide ganked. if i lose my ship because i'm not paying attention, that's my fault, now isn't it?"
7/22/2009,"it is as realistic as your character immortality and the capacitor tecnology that produce energy from nothing. come on.if you could open a in-eve insurance company, you will really pay insurance to ganker and to character that loose ships in nullsec wars?? how could you make money from that???i want to build a insurance corporation, but i cannot do that because the actual insurance mechanics are so unbalanced that i cannot compete. anctual npc insurance corp cannot loose money, they always win!! what about that?so i support that."
7/22/2009,"only time insurance should be paid out is if a killright is granted.no insurance payouts to concord deaths, war deaths, npc deaths, or any thing where you were blinky red on anyone elses screen (can flipping or looting)."
7/22/2009,"this times infinityyou guys beg for realism? what if you get it? concord is not by any means going to be able to save the day anymore, think about those ships, their cost and what it would take to put them in every high sec system. and say goodbye to sentry guns up the wazoo. i mean seriously, the way the ships themselves is rather far fetched in terms of no upkeep over time, and no fuel costs. you want this to be more realistic? it's going to be even worse for you"
7/22/2009,"actually, i have often argued for fuel costs, maintenance fees, and jump/docking costs to be added to the game.but apparently, people find those ideas offensive."
7/22/2009,please show me where i said anything about carebears? you have high sec lvl 4 missions. why don't you go there? that's like whining about not being able to safely mine in lowsec. high sec is there for a reason. quit trying to change the game for your own selfish reasons. can i not support a second time?
7/22/2009,"i think perhaps with the current probing issues, i dont really want ccp to do anything to probing except fix it, though i agree that this is an issue i am not supporting based on that.a better fix i think would be to change the spawning mechanic for mission sites so that they spawn far enough away from system bodies that they wont show up on a 360 degree scan from any of them. sure, this means eventually most pirates will have bookmarks where they can cover more area, but hey, they'd have earned the quick scan/gank by doing it the ""slow"" way at least once or being really lucky."
7/22/2009,"high sec agents will sometimes send you in lowsec for some missions, and declining them severely affect your standing with that agent. sooner or later you're bound to have to go in lowsec to complete a mission, even if it's only 0.4 systems. it's also much longer to grind an agent in highsec and you know it. the risk v/s reward of lowsec missioning right now is just out of wack due to how easy it is to be probed down by pirates.as for being selfish, i could say the same thing to you: stop trying to own lowsec and make it your personal pirating playground as if only your kind was supposed to be in it. a lot of pirates have admitted that it's getting really easy to pinpoint someone in missions now, why are you still denying it?"
7/22/2009,"absolutely not, there are plenty of ways for a missioner to avoid getting probed./not supported"
7/22/2009,"honestly, i don't even use combat probes on a regular basis. furthermore, there is a handy button that says delay, should you be within the decline time limit, you can always postpone that terrifying low sec mission, and then refuse it later. on top of that, feel free to work up standings with other agents in the area. or, here is a novel idea, join a corp that operates in lowsec, or better yet, form your own corp and then establish standings in a low sec system of your choosing. every time there is a little inconvenience for someone everyone begs for a nerf, boring. there are so many ways around this problem, you are just trying to find an easy way of getting around it. i find it funny that you criticize everyone who doesn't support you, acting like they are some sort of idiot. you need to step down off your high horse and welcome peoples opinions, especially when you start a topic. welcome to eve, expect to get boned, hard."
7/22/2009,"my god you are something... first of all, i did not even start this topic. we're not asking to be invulnerable in lowsec while we do missions, we're only asking for a little tweak that would make lowsec missioning a little less of a ""gang-bang haven"". but anyway, no matter what we say, you won't understand and you'll always be against it because you will always want to own everybody else as easily as possible, so this is pointless."
7/22/2009,"just like the rest of the gallente ships, which all resemble cancerous growths..."
7/22/2009,a good thing about an ugly covert ops frig model is that nobody else should see you flying in one.

7/22/2009,supported.
7/22/2009,"supported.the entire drone bay interface needs an overhaul. you cant even info drones for their stats after they are in your drone bay to see how your skills and ship bonuses are affecting them. furthermore, you cant see what health they are while in the bay either."
7/22/2009,"hello all, the greatest damage caused by the speed nerf is to the small poor frigates clases which now have no chances to evade drones. drones now are the hell of frigates which can't do almost nothing against them. i can understand the speed nerf ok but drones need a speed nerf too or...ccp make some good stuff to protect over 50millions frigates against 4 millions ista pop drones... ( no sense )here some ideas:smarbombs are almost useless against well trained drones but the smartbomb tecnology is only offensive here some other ways to be smarterbombs.the first one is an ecm smarbomb which only affect drones,or a concussion smartbomb that stun drones like an electical shock smartbomb,or a repelling smartbomb that makes a a mass effect to them throwing those small b&/(""/%!ds 30 km away from your ships....all those smartbombs cause no damage to them, those are just a defensive system against them.or a new hi slot fitting item which reduce the drone range control of a ship by the 50-80% like a radar turret interferencer. ( i repeat hi slot! ) or another hi slot item which interference with the drone control, effective inside a certain area around the ship ( 4-5 km max ) which make lose the control over drones setting them in a non aggresive status, returning in the drone bay or just swich target.or a bloody hell damned virus system which preveal over enemy bandwith drones making them working for you ( only limited by bandwith of ship and player skills )or a stupid tractor beam which put directly enemy drones inside cargohold ( lol ) or a new kind of ammunition with the 100% of damage against drones but with also a -100% against shipsor make ecm brust effective against drones and reduce also the radar strength of dronesor just a new skil book which give a 10% smartbombs damage per level (still useless in my experience) frigate classes need the respect losed with the speed nerf!!!!and something must be done!i finished. ( sorry for my english )please support!!!!!!"
7/22/2009,i support myself! yeah i think those ideas are cool
7/22/2009,"""review""... might be an idea to edit the post subject"
7/22/2009,support me! :d
7/22/2009,"frigates can fight drones just fine. web them, shoot them. that battleship will run out fairly quickly(unless it's a domi or specifically fit to fight frigs, but they're supposed to be good against small fry)"
7/22/2009,"yeah i can target them fire at them hit them and kill them... but 5 against one i have only the time to shoot one down the other take me down, i presume you are a drake or a raven lover, try your hawk against 5 good trained hobgoblin ii and reply at this again.you can't no more mwd away from them, they always hit you and they will kill you faster than you can blow them up all.i know i'm lonlie at this because you love your drones and you never want a system which can make them weaker but that's simply necessary, maybe not for cruisers, battlecruisers or battleship but for smaller ships means escape from certain death.and please don't reply here if you are not supporting those cool ideas, i just want to put something good over the plate. and there are many other ships with drones not only battleships which are slow and fatty and can be easily avoied, i mean cruisers like deimios, arbitrators, iskhurs, curses and all the ships which can carry drones. i know drones are the primary damage dealers of many ships but i can't undertand why there are countermeasures for almost anything but not from drones. i think drones are cool but they shouldent be that scary. i'm not proposing a weapon which can wipe them out... just something that makes them less effective... think different!"
7/22/2009,"i dislike this proposal for two reasons:1) non-frigates will start fitting these frigate modules which could make the entire battlefield screwy2) drones are gimped enough as-is with respect to other weapon systems because they can be blown up and dont have any way to be replenished except in a station. frigates shouldnt have free reign.i did think that for a while defender missiles should target drones as well as missiles, but that could become horribly unbalanced because defenders are a no-target option. this, however, is rendered moot because your tiny frigate could just fit fof rockets or standard missiles and solve the issue as well.edit: graduate to cruisers yourself or fly an assault frigate."
7/22/2009,great idea... and then any t1 frigate can solo kill any passive tanked bs... really balancing proposalno support

7/22/2009,"as much as i would like it, and it would be pretty cool, i can think of 2 reasons this would be a problem.1.) t1/t2/faction ships. how are you going to tell them apart? i can imagine clicking on tem and being able to see the mini portrait as original colors would work to an extent, but it would add to a lot of confusion.2.) sever load? i really don't know if this would be an issue or not, but preloaded and cached ship models probably boost overall speed a bit, and this seems like it might add a little work when you consider people are in ships a fair bit of their in game time."
7/22/2009,"i like the idea of ""opt in"" so if i want my spaceship game to have everyone in the same ship look the same i can.what i would rather not see (but what some people want) is ship + mspaint = penz0rwessletemplates is a good idea, colours should be rather subdued though. i fear some people may parade around the galaxy in hot pink cruisers that make eyes bleed just to make points."
7/22/2009,"i like the idea. maybe not full customisation immediately, but certainly extra skins for the ships would be very nice."
7/22/2009,"ok, ewar drones would be a blast, if they were useful. i don't see why few ewar types get 3 drone sizes. on top of that, let's get some drones that can perform their tasks to a decent degree of competence. sd drones? zerk webbers? think about it. oh, right, warp scram drones. cmonnnnnnnn, you know it's gonna be fun"

7/22/2009,"from f&i discussion thread... proposal written here. basically, a revamp of the way scanning and intel information is handled/shared in game. a more significant change than most raised here, but, imo, an important one. i would love to get csm consideration for this."
7/22/2009,"i'm not sure i like this. it just seems too complicated for a game such as eve online, which is already quite complex to begin with. it all sounds cool when you first read it, but when you think about how much it would change the game and all the added micro-management you would have to do, it's a whole different thing.also the idea of cloaked ships being pinpointable within a grid is absurd. what is a cloak good for if everybody can still know where you are? even if they can't visually see you, they will be able to fly next to you and uncloak you.there's also the huge problem of server load. just enlarging the size of grids would have a huge impact in populated systems.sorry mate, but i don't support this proposal.there might be a way to do something similar but less extreme and less complicated to make the current system better, but this is not the way. i'm also afraid this would favor pirates a little too much, as if they didn't already have enough advantages with the scanning system we have now. it would also penalize anyone who doesn't play in a huge corp where they can constantly be in fleets as they fly around. i don't believe this would be a good thing for the casual player base."
7/22/2009,"an interesting proposal.i however feel that it takes the speed out of the game especially with small fast fleets as you need to position your scout and let him probe or scan before you can find any potential targets, depending on how long this takes this can and will make your gang slower and more easily reported by the intel networks if anyone is watching (with a pos or probe network).one of my main concerns is how will stations take place into this scenario. as it stands its no easy to get your covert ops out of a station through an enemy gang and into the open space (maybe passing a bubble) without getting killed. also if covert ops become detectable on grid it will become near to impossible.one thing to also keep in mind is the potential of removing fun out of the game, it's not fun having to do scout duty to protect people, it's not fun having to scan every damn system to find targets and it's not fun to setup a tower in every system just to get a view of it (think of the fuel cost an maintenance hours). to keep a good intel network you will probably have to do that.although i am primarily a 0.0 pvper i'm not too bothered with the current local system as knowing who is where is extremely important with 0.0 warfare/pvp. the current system provides you the pilot but not his location, his ship, his abilities or his intention. you need to use the directional scanner and some knowledge of the system to find out what he is in and what he is after.on a second note for some who keep popping this up as well; it's not hard to actually kill the carebears. as long as the player is aware and paying attention he will not get killed however if he doses of our loses attention because they take local protection for granted they become easy targets. but keep in mind losses in eve aren't by far cheap for most players.i think the proposal is interesting and creative but has a few too many drawbacks in it's current form so no support, however i'm open towards changes which will give some form of strategic benefit to the roaming gangs."
7/22/2009,"i can agree to that it would reduce the speed of the game, that not necessarily being a bad thing - then again, it also introduces alot of ingenuity, room for error and most importantly, strategy and brains to the game.it's also a matter of making this work, and i'm sure things like that will be thoroughly polished :) personally, i will be happy to let go of the ""<name> x-fe4g no eyes""the more you think about this, now anyone who rats or mines or roams in 0.0 will be fleeted togetherfor maximum efficiency at seeing what comes and goes, just by passively linking sensors and collaborating for intelligence (true?)it could be integrated into the game and be yet another awesome feature, or it could be a missbut so far, ccp hasn't really let me down when it comes to these thingssure eve has a few small things that bother, it's still the best mmo yet"
7/22/2009,"i was under the assumption this system was more or less intended for 0.0 only.maybe i was wrong, but as you say larger grid size in high sec = badi hope this won't be taken the wrong way but i was thinking more 1.0-0.1 stays the same as alwaysand 0.0 gets the new system... i can't tell you why, but the current system is a little.. simplistic and too predictablewell either way, it's good to see someone having real ideas"
7/22/2009,"i'm afraid the op intends this to be an overall change for the whole galaxy, and not just nullsec, which is why i think it's not such a good idea. this system would be fine for advanced nullsec players that have been playing in large alliances and heavy fleets for years, but not for the casual high-sec/low-sec corp player who only fleet-up for major ops.there's also the whole change to to the usage of cloaks that i just can't get around. being able to know where a cloaked ship is within a grid renders the cloak useless to say the least."
7/22/2009,"i'll treat this the same way i treat proposals for new sovereignty systems. this is not a complete proposal, and it is not ready for implementation. however, with an issue this long-standing and complex, i don't expect it to be - if ccp has spent years not coming up with a solution, i'm not going to expect that a player will. it's a good idea, and i'd like to see it taken to ccp in hopes of them taking it and adapting it into something workable. on that basis, i'll support it."
7/22/2009,"some replys:in regards to the grid size increase, how do you think it will increase server lag? even if lag is a function of people on grid, which i believe is an incomplete analysis, increasing the size of the grid will still not necessarily add any more people to it... compare it to today, where everyone is already packed into a few separate grids (each gate, each station, and each pos location). this change alone will not change that, and because it offers the opportunity to effectively occupy any space in the system, it might actually spread people off those few specific grids, which in essence would lighten grid specific load.regarding cloak detection, getting a hit down to a grid (keep in mind, this would still be very difficult to do, meaning lots of individuals in just the right locations) does not mean decloaking. especially considering the larger grid sizes. this will add a slight feel of apprehension and fear when sneaking around a crowded enemy system, because there will be a chance, however slight, of being detected. fear does equal fun in this case.as to the concerns about this requiring micro-management, i think the levels of action required are misunderstood here. there is no actual requirement to use probes, or pos's.. ships sensors would still be nearly as effective as they are today. currently, you know exactly when you enter a system, who is there.. but you don't know anything about them, other than a name. a simple directional scan might reveal what they are in, but only if they are already relatively close to you. this will not necessarily change. what will change is that you don't necessarily have to use the directional scanner interface to ascertain this information. it will also give an informational edge to smaller craft, as they will be harder to classify and locate. basically, this moves a lot of the 'scanning' tasks into an automated system, that simply gives you the results, and actually takes care of the sharing of that information, in effect lessening the management required. a basic scouting job would in essence, just require being there in the properly equipped ship.obviously there are conflicts of interest, and of course, no single proposal is ever entirely sufficient in its early stages, however, i feel this would actually make finding and partaking in combat/espionage a more natural, organic process, and actually less menial."
7/22/2009,"why?because when i fit 3 w-links and guns on every fleet cs except claymore there is 1 unused hardpoint remaining, or with all guns fitted, only 2 links remaining. both variants are suck and that is one of a reasons to train alts for boosting.of course, this ships are not damagers, but give them enough highslots for their full potential!"
7/22/2009,"obviously, here is my support."
7/22/2009,"how about we give them all +5 high slots? after all, they can all fit at least 4 command processors in the mids, so you wouldn't want to deny them their ability to fit 7 gang links plus a full set of weapons, would you? not supported. just because you have to make choices when fitting does not mean that the ship needs a buff."

7/22/2009,"missiles don't instant hit, but if the dps is roughly the same as the same weapon class of turret there's no problem.what it seems like from this thread, they're not roughly the same (or if the nerf did make them roughly the same people want imba-missiles again) so they should be ""fixed."" what we could use here is some eft-warriors posting theoretical numbers (if there are already some, i apologize), that at least should give people a reasonable idea of how unbalanced things are.eft-warriors: don't use all level 5 for one set and 0 skills for another. imho the base damage (all l0) and high end damage (all l5) should be compared without fitting modules other than launchers/blasters/rails/lasters etc."
7/22/2009,"honestly, for all the people demanding more realistic changes to the game, i.e. insurance payouts, faster concord response time, etc.why not make sentries realistic, as in they don't respawn in mere minutes, and they are more destructible. for something that puts out that much dps and tanks that well, it cant fiscally be replaceable in that kind of time frame. so if you re going to change the insurance to make it more realistic, why not this. and i don't want carebear whines"
7/22/2009,"sure, make sentries destructible. then make npc fleets drop on anyone who tries to do it. i bet the factions see a bit of a difference between murder and an outright assault on their police forces."
7/22/2009,"can i have some balogna? i heard i could find it here/me pauses for laughterbut seriously, i would stop paying for my alts, and so would a good portion of the eve community i believe. this is a fun game for people to play, not a fricking job. so many people on these forums seem to forget this is for fun, not so you can vicariously live a successful life or some crap like that. deal with it.bump, so people know who to pod next time they log on. i hope they bring alts for the irony"
7/22/2009,"free bump for op because this is silly and everyone should see how silly it is.to my quoted friend: guild wars can be run in multiple instances on the same computer, there's a regedit method and there's a program method. regedit is technically safer for your account, but i use gwx2 and works fine for me. (gw is also technically a corpg, but whatever)and then to the op 3 accounts means 45$ a month (because i blow all my isk on spaceships and have a general disability which allows me from saving up enough money to purchase gtc's).basically ""boo-hoo"" only one guy cared, and that's because he can't afford a second account yet."
7/22/2009,"i for one welcome the idea of jumping in to corp mates marauder / faction bs and taking pot shots at any passers by in high sec, letting him deal with concord."
7/22/2009,"won't happen... everbackground on capsuleer pilots relationship to ships gunsif you bothered to read about the game (wow what a concept) you'd realize that it would be breaking the game's ""canon"" if you will.this idea is good... but it would not be eve online.ships are not pos's... and your complicating the game many times over."
7/22/2009,"i have played this very cool game for a long time since it started and i want to help make it more fun for crops, they should have corp missions big fights with npcs and story line lots of fun for many.... with carriers, drednuts, battleships, t2,t3, ships a battle that this game can only offer if companies would have to go to war. not just a faction battle. a mission to take a station with a huge fleet two avery type of ship are a mix of biggest to littlest. that would be awsome......"
7/22/2009,and they could call it a level 5 mission!

7/22/2009,i wouldv thought of the eve community in a much different way had i not spent a pretty good amount of time around the darkfall online forums. people here tend to make forumfall people (darkfall community) look like saints. interesting link below this where some guy trys to describe forumfall... but kinda had a fail after the 2nd paragraph.

7/23/2009,yes !
7/23/2009,all the hawk really needs is a rof bonus...i actually agree with the clip size issue but i think that should be left alone for balance. with 4 t2 standard missile launchers a t2 bcu you can melt most t1 frigs and destroyers without having to reload.why anyone would want to split weapons or give a bonus to td makes no sense to me!(edit: i use as a long/med range damage while someone tackles.)
7/23/2009,"thank you for demonstrating my point so well.an af that requires someone else to tackle for it and does 126dps even with max skills, 2 bcu's and a 75mm rail in the utility slot...oh wait...you can't fit all that so you'll be down to about 100dps but only when the railgun gets into range. i can do similar dps in a crow and be considerably more useful to my gang. as someone who uses the light missile setup what do you do with the last high slot and how the hell do you cram a mwd and active tank on there?arguably 88 missile dps is ok given that it hits out to 60km with cn bloodclaw and rockets are a whole separate quagmire so if we ignore the dps and say that the hawk is meant to be a nuggets tough active tank to tackle with...the fitting process goes something like this:mwd...checkscram...checkdamage control....checkem resist rigs....checksmall shield booster....checkhmm, cap only lasts 35 secondsnos....checkhmm, up to 55 seconds cap so at most 30 seconds of cap to shield boost with after burning the mwd to get into range.small cap booster....checkso that's all four mids gone and we've got 6,292 ehp with a sustained defense of 81, surely this is better than the faster, gankier jaguar?nope. my dual mse jag with scram and mwd has 10,853ehp so it would take the hawk 56.3 seconds to make up the ehp difference and way longer if we factor in the 52 sustained defense of the jag, certainly more time than it would take the jag to kill the hawk.then there's the ishkur with 73 sustained defense and 235 dps. the hawk can offer gallente pilots 8 more sustained dps if they're willing to live with less than half the dps if we now bring rockets into the equation i need a web on my hawk too so there goes the cap booster and you can forget about ever pulsing your mwd during a fight or getting into tackle range of a neut cruiser or generally being useful in any way.please move one slot to a mid and fix rockets. the hawk will still be sub par but would at least be useable."
7/23/2009,"we're using two completly diferent fitting philosophies for the same ship, you seem to be going for a close in heavy tackler while i am just sitting at range and using volley damage. i fit a ab to mine and run it in a small gang. just seemed to be the way it was disigned to me, to do what your doing i would just fly a jag or a wolf.i'll try your fitting later and see how it goes."
7/23/2009,"myself and everyone else who has asked for changes to the hawk are idiots because we missed something that should be blindingly obvious - the hawk is missing a slot vengance (4 highs) 43pg / 160cpu (tackle)retribution (5 highs) 56pg / 125cpu (dps)ishkur (4 highs) 42pg / 155cpu (tackle + dps)enyo (5 highs) 50pg / 145cpu (dps)jaguar (4 highs) 43pg / 160cpu (tackle)wolf (5 highs) 48pg / 125cpu (dps)hawk (5 highs) 42pg / 180cpu (tackle)harpy (5 highs) 50pg / 175cpu (dps)all the tackle af's have 4 high slots with 3 primary weapon hardpoints and a utility high except for the two rocket ships - hawk and vengeance. i assume this is because rockets do so little dps that you need 4 of them to get anywhere close to the dps of 3 close range turrets.the result is that the hawk has one less mid / low slot than the other tackle af's because it's been moved to a high slot but the extra high is only compensating for low rocket dps.the vengeance has been robbed of a bonus instead of a mid slot. it is the only tackle af with 4 hardpoints for its primary weapons system and therefore has no utility high, this has been compensated for by giving it a cap bonus equivalent to running a nos.here's a crazy idea - if rocket ships need 4 launchers to do the same job as 3 turrets then give them an extra slot."
7/23/2009,i'll warn you now that my rocket fitting sucks which is kinda the point i'm trying to make

7/23/2009,"i agree with the ""market view"" approach highlighted earlier as a lot of the code should be in place.all it would need is the following.take the assets list and use that instead of the market data.allow players to select station, system, region or all as the range.replace the market list right click context menu with the standard item r/c menu. if the item is outside the current station then you would not be able to ""fit to active ship"", but all the other options (sell, repackage, reprocess etc.) should be available if the player has the relevant skills to do this remotely.it would enable you to search your items and they would be organised in a standard layout that we are already used to with the market view.they could be colour coded to show if they are in the players location (i.e. you need to fit a module and want to see all you have, thereby helping you decide if you need to fly a few jumps for the slightly better one you have tucked away somewhere.all items, ships and suchlike will be under one consolidated list and this could also be then applied to the corporate assets, showing which station the items are within and helping manage larger organisations.even with a 10 player corp, we have so much stuff all over the place it is a large overhead to sort it all out. possibly have the options to create contracts if you need large amounts of ore picking up and consolidating etc...sm."

7/23/2009,"exactlythe light and the heavy interdictor paths also deviate quite a bit, and i'm sure a few more such examples can be found if someone gave it a second thoughti dont like that i have to train industrials if i want to move something... why dont they make a transport battleship with say 10.000m3 cargo... so i dont have to train industrials"
7/23/2009,"supported! why? because 1 bil is a hell of a lot of isk for the vast majority of people who've been playing for less than a year. in terms of hauling, we have a bicycle with basket (industrial ship), a semi-truck (freighter), and a limo with a bunch of fancy-shmansy gadgets that takes 3 months of skills to get to(orca). why not just make a suv? suggested mini freighter:-200-250k cargo-very minimal amount of slots (if any) -very minimal bonuses-cost~175min summary we need a solid, purely hauling ship that players who are a few months old can afford and use."
7/23/2009,"here's what i see:i see a thread of a bunch of people who want the following: don't want to train adv spaceship command don't want to train for orca want a bigger cargo bay that is cheaper than an orca want something fast and easygot news for you guys: if you can fly an iteron 5, you are like, 2 skills away from a freighter. don't want an obelisk? then you get to choose to train something else.i think the idea of different sized ships is great, but when it comes to hauling, you have five friggin options:1: tech 1 hauler2: tech 2 transport3: orca4: tech 1 freighter5: tech 2 jump freighterthe jump freighter has a smaller cargo bay and it is able to jump places. so if you want something with a smaller cargo bay, there you go.the iteron 5 can carry 50km3 or something very close to it. if you want to carry 100km3, buy an orca.seriously, you've got the following progression:tech 1 hauler: 50km3tech 2 transport: 30km3 + warp strength or 10km3 + covops cloakorca: 100km3 + corp hangar (40km3) [note: a carrier gets 10km3]tech 1 freighter: nearly 1 million m3tech 2 jump freighter: 350km3why are you all still whining about this >:|"

7/23/2009,"supporting, tech2 indies are to small, no way i want to train up a load of pointless mining skills to use an orca, i'll probably have to buy a freighter for my alt which is massive overkill.+1 for a middle ground hauler."
7/23/2009,"this is next to ridiculous. if an industrial isn't good enough and you don't want to go the full path and get a freighter, training a different line of skills is but the price you pay.oh, someone said you can't haul a battleship in an orca, fitted or repackaged? this is false. you can fit a packaged bs in the cargo bay. want to move a fitted and rigged bs? quit crying, right click it, make active and fly it there."
7/23/2009,"unfortunately, i do not support this idea as the rapier has a range bonus just like the gallente variant.the other two races get effective bonuses, instead of the range - making them, in my opinion, just as effective at their particular task."
7/23/2009,"not supported,complaining that a rapier/hugiin cant hold down the fastest ship in eve is kinda meh.seems balanced to me if they can effectivelly web most ships but struggle with the fastest one."

7/23/2009,"it'll need an aggro flag and shouldn't change ownership. after all - picking something up shouldn't make it 'yours' (honestly this needs to be fixed for can flipping too because it's dumb that the original owner can become a 'thief' to a thief - that's just silly).that said, you should be able to tractor beam anything. a tractor beam is a piece of tech and doesn't care what it grabs nor should it.so, with appropriate code to prevent griefing - absolutely!"
7/23/2009,"oh, and i forgot to add that the same vector needs to be applied to the tractoring vessle in th opposite direction...and yes, tractoring an object owned by another should be counted as aggression.. tractoring another ship should be counted as hostile (concord)"

7/23/2009,i believe that eve is missing a hauler dedicated to the transport of assembled/rigged ships.i would like one to be introduced.
7/23/2009,i naturally support my own proposal.
7/23/2009,would be useful - currently the only option for moving ships around highsec seems to be the orca ...
7/23/2009,maby a t2 freighter with a ship maintenance bay and no cargo hold.
7/23/2009,im sure there is some other thread somewhere but nvm it's missing ingameand if it's t2 it should not go over the 2b range
7/23/2009,removing the 120k m3 restriction on courier contracts would allow freighters to fill this role.
7/23/2009,perhaps a t2 orca?
7/23/2009,"for the bloody love of god no. the orca is an mining command ship no matter what stupid classification ccp has thought it should fill.we need small/light freighters that fill the 75k-200k range of cargo. we also need a small and large ship that can move fitted vessels. it should not need any more skills to fly than the normal freighters.why does there seem to be a need from the player base to add extra requirements for a ship that really should already be in the bloody game.we need less ""oooo shiney"" design and actually get a complete system developed that is not missing gaping holes."

7/23/2009,this should be the province of freighters and orcas. i expect it'll be easier to make ccp let us haul ships in the right hulls(through one of the many proposals to haul rigged ships) than it will be to get them to bring in a new hull for the purpose.
7/23/2009,as long as it's a t2 orca which doesn't need mining skills ...i'm proposing a ship dedicated to hauling rigged ships - it doesn't even need to have a cargo bay and certainly doesn't need mining bonuses. :)edit:what kind of skill requirements would be reasonable?industrial vspaceship command vadvanced spaceship command <something><new skill>?
7/23/2009,"ok what is the fascination with the orca?it is a misguided vessel that has bastard requirements if it meant to be a transport/freight ship.it is a mining command ship, it is meant to haul ore and act as a central point to mining operations. hell, any solution to the hauling of fitted ships should only really require industrials v. ****************************************************on a seperate note if we are going to be thorough we need a reworking of the entire transport ship skill system.there is no reason for there to be racial industrial/transport/freighter skill progressions. all cargo ships should be like the ore ships, a separate system unto themselves.tier 1: industrial 1-5, freighters (large cargo), shippers (move 1 or many fitted ships)tier 2 - transports, jump freighters, ?jump shippers another section that is missing would be the heavily armored freighters and shippers. you know like the transports that have armor and a few levels of warp stability.it just seems clunky to have some many racial skills splitting out this tree for no real good reason. it is definitely an area that could use consolidation and refocus."

7/23/2009,ok ...this thread has little - if anything - to do with the orca.this is a proposal for a *dedicated rigged ship transport*.this has nothing to do with mining or the orca's training path.(use of the orca's hull because it's pretty and easier than making a new model may be a point though. >.> )
7/23/2009,"ugh, no. the current system is just fine."
7/23/2009,yep would love to see this.as a side note does anyone else think the orca looks like a memory stick?
7/23/2009,"absolutely. a few things that might want to be looked at are (but not limited to):- the open jump bridge and jump to buttons on a titan in the drop down menu [there was a great mistake made by olex, huzzah's titan pilot. he accidentally jumped to a cyno on a low-sec gate in his avatar because of this]- the trash and make active buttons [midian kell trashed all of his active pvp ships in station because of this]"
7/23/2009,please.entire scanning ui needs work.
7/23/2009,too true.
7/23/2009,"i think unlimited is fine (or some obscene number like 100.000.000.000)why wouldn't a corp with 15 freighters accept a 1bil m3 contracti don't see how can scammers use this to they'r advantage?so i support until someone explains why not... also i think the 100 item limit is there to prevent excess database load, so maybe that should stay"
7/23/2009,good idea.
7/23/2009,"you can't split a package. if you could, sure. but you can't haul 50km3 in a hauler, even if you take two trips. thus, 981250 has to be the upper limit."
7/23/2009,^^ what they said
7/23/2009,the only reason i can see why this isn't implemented would be due to database load.would love to have it.
7/23/2009,"yes, please. how about some sort of search-tag for that handy filterbox? reduces serverload in comparison to additional column, i think."
7/23/2009,"very good idea.also, an easier way to drag items from my hanger into a container in my hanger. i'm sure there's a way to do it, but it's not intuitive at all."
7/23/2009,"sure they can. eve is a harsh world where scamming is easy and encouraged, remember?ccp already showed a willingness to sell out. it would be perfectly within the style of the game for ccp to take the money and run, proudly proclaiming that they have successfully scammed a bunch of suckers for billions of isk. all within the game.any notion of rules and honor was gone when it went up for sale."
7/23/2009,just because i'm making a public sale doesn't mean this is the first time this has happened.
7/23/2009,"supported, because now the floodgate has been opened, the applications for the next alliance tournament is going to be a total farce."
7/23/2009,and that is what this is for.
7/23/2009,"yeah also did you see how quick ccp were to lock down discussion about this? not just on the sell order which is reasonable, but in general discussion aswell. just because it's a csm i bet... i don't know what i'm complaining about though, i see so much moderator bias on the forums it's unreal."
7/23/2009,"ahahahaha. maybe the threads were locked down because they were full of hormonal, pubescent nerds whining about fairness in this bleak and deadly internets spaceships game.fyi being on the csm doesn't entitle one to any special treatment. i'm playing by the rules here sonny."

7/23/2009,"if entry to the at continues to be random draw, then supported for this reason.however, i'd prefer all alliances that want in getting in, and then having a series of early qualifier rounds to knock down the numbers to 64."
7/23/2009,i don't support the reselling of at slots.
7/23/2009,then don't buy them?
7/23/2009,"i voted for larkonis, and i fully support his efforts as a csm. as a csm he represents my veiws and the veiws of many pirates. many of you have missed the point that isk makes the universe go around. this is the very nature of the game we play, people will doing anything to make a quick bill. i don't see how many of you wouldn't do the same. you talk about honour, responsibility, sportsmanship. in a game where scamming is rampant, ganging up to outnumber your foe is almost encouraged, most people are looking to shaft the other guy to make some isk."
7/23/2009,"what about next year and the year after, when more and more non pvp entities enter the tournament to sell off the positions. alliances will grow bored and so will audiences since the people signing up are not there to fight. are you so narrow sighted to see where this is going and what it could ruin. yes eve is about scamming and isk but id rather we have a tourney of fighters as that is what it is there for. this is the only place for honourable fights to the death, where eve stands still and doesn't become her self. for those that want to save the tourney and can see further that 3 inches in front of them support this notion"
7/23/2009,"so, stealing a tower that has just been unanchored doesnt even flag as a theft? how ridiculous is that? steal a 4 isk piece of tritanium and you can be shot... steal a tower worth hundreds of millions, but thats fine, no criminal flag, no shooting allowed...that, really is bloody stupid..."
7/23/2009,"asides from the obvious ""well do it better"" crap...the pos is not a can.... its more like a wreck in a sense... with no items inside.so i suppose from the programming standpoint i can get why they did what they did.but you'd think it would at least flag the thief."
7/23/2009,deploy your pos in lowsec/0.0... shoot anyone who attempts to steal it.???profit!
7/23/2009,"actually, pos towers are just like every other anchorable item in the game - you can steal any of them if they aren't anchored, and none of them flag the thief. in fact, if you dump out a gsc with items in it, and don't anchor it, someone else can come along, scoop it to their cargo hold, and it's now (if i understand the mecahnics) their can, and they can remove the items at will."
7/23/2009,if this is your argument then you might as well disband the csm and close the feedback forums. the length of time a bad mechanic has been implemented is not a good justification for the preservation of the status quo. i've stated my position in clear terms: 2 months is an unreasonable time to make a victorious corporation wait for an office slot to open up in a station they now own.
7/23/2009,"as csm you should do better then one item forum quotes if that is the standard they might as well disband the csm and close the feedback forums.the two month timeframe is not a problem. if the timer is to be changed, cool, but it'll have to be for a different and more solid reason then just ""we don't like it cause right now for our current and near future in game situation it does not work for us"" aside of disbanding alliances or people throwing in the towel (cases in which unrenting is rather easily assisted or arranged anyhow), two months is never an unreasonable timeframe for developments to take their course really, warfare goes back and forward after all. we have seen this all over the map over the years.since wars always have timeframes attached which are undeterminable and where planning always requires day to day management (and often crisis management in the face of challenges) - and heck, you've used this mechanic to your advantage and had to work around it - why should offices and their renting mechanics be different from any other sort of war processes (or even post war cleanup processes) all of a sudden?"
7/23/2009,"i would say refund any bills for outstanding rents that have been paid so that the clock runs out on the current rent. that way instead of waiting a maximum of two months you're waiting anywhere between 1 minute and 1 month after taking the station depending on the remaining rent on the office.2 months is a bit harsh but equally gaining instant control seems equally harsh. i see no problem with people salting the earth behind them.i'm sure everyone is guilty of this tactic at one point or another, just because you happen to be a victim of it now doesn't mean that a change should be implemented."
7/23/2009,"if your insinuation is that i am only bringing this topic up because of something happening to me in game currently, then you're incorrect. goonfleet has an office in all of our recently acquired outposts, including jlo- which we acquired a couple days ago. however, it is true that this was the event that brought it to the forefront of my mind, as i've had the same thoughts every time we've won or lost a station in the past couple years. i've used it myself before too. when goonswarm abandoned the south to move to delve, i personally made sure every last office slot in every outpost we abandoned had all of their office space rented out. i could sit here and tell stories all day but the bottom line is that it's a bad mechanic. the only recourse to a conquering force in the current mechanics is to wait 2 months, renew your eve subscription twice, before you're guaranteed an office. under my proposal, the recourse for the aggrieved party would be to take their station back, something which could be done in a much shorter timeframe and encourages attacks and space fighting. which is the better policy?"

7/23/2009,"youve totally missed the point of this thread. you may run missions in low sec but im willing to bet you dont do it as a main profession. when you do it enough as i do and your missions start getting busted left and right the problem isnt just surviving low sec, its trying to make a profit in low sec. i dont expect you to understand, as i said, you dont run missions as a profession. in fact, i dont expect many players to understand my problem because quite frankly i know there arent many professional mission runners in low sec anymore. theyve all left to high sec or 0.0 . anyway, what i do expect is to get flamed by ignorant people (i dont mean this as an insult) who do not understand whats going on but still have an urge to insult. so shoot away! :) im bringing this to the attention of whoever is willing to listen and understand. this is how it is. whether you understand it or dont like it is irrelevant."

7/23/2009,"considered asking for this before, but after thinking more about it i realized i can't actually support it. people would just pile up fake jobs on npc lines to let themselves get instant me lines for anything they wanted. you'd wind up with crazy tactics to fake-clog lines, leading to even messier npc lines, and harder access for smaller players. i get that it's annoying, but it's less annoying than losing your materials when you cancel a manu job."

7/23/2009,"i believe the current system only has a set list of keys you can bind, and that it detects the code of the key to define which one it is. if the key is not in the list it won't be accepted. that's why i think this is pretty stupid. you should only have a list of reserved keys you can't bind to, but any other key/key-combo you press should be detected and accepted and shown as it is called in your language.i mean, this is not like it's rocket science to a game developer! it's very common and standard through most games that use customizable keyboard mappings. i really don't see why ccp couldn't spend some time to update that module."
7/23/2009,"i'm sure this has been discussed previously, but i don't see a topic here, so i'll make one.i have two suggestions on how to improve account security.1. limit accounts to logging in from their origin country only.- i have an eve-online account, this account is addressed in the united states. it is terribly unlikely that i will ever login to eve from a country outside the united states. this feature could be enabled by default, but have a secure procedure that allows a player to enable/disable this feature. logging into the my account section of the eve website would need to have these same restrictions.- in the event a login is tried from a non-origin country, the owner should be notified in the same manner as described below.2. alert owners of accounts if someone is trying to guess their login information.- if someone somehow guesses my username, and tries to guess my password. if they fail to login, i should receive an email that has the following:* the username of the account they tried (some players have more than one account)* the password they attempted to use against my account (this would be very useful to tell if an eve-related site leaked information, since we could use passwords specific for these sites, if someone hits our account with that password, we know where it came from).* the ip address of the person that attempted to login to our account.excessive failed login attempts from a single ip address should also raise flags for gm's as well.suggestions have been made before, but these were ages ago, and we haven't heard anything about it."
7/23/2009,"supporting my own topic, since all the cool kids do it."
7/23/2009,"what ? a captcha to log in ? well thats cool ??? i guess but anyway...mhh yeah, those things would be good. i guess it would stop the chinese farmers..well thats what i can think off.for the account login, yeah but wouldn't that be a privacy issue since you know the ip of the person who tried to log in"
7/23/2009,"if something similar is not allready in place then maybe also3) more than 10 failed login attempts from an ip address per day , should automatically block any further attempts from that ip for 24 hours.stops brute force attacks."

7/23/2009,ip address's mean nothing today... they can be spoofed...remapped...redirected...proxye'd
7/23/2009,running a proxy for the eve server involves a little bit of logistics.
7/23/2009,your actually saying that thinking its that hard?your treading on thin ice pal.leave the geek work to the geeks and just take my word for it... its not hard at all.a little foolish perhaps... but easily done.
7/23/2009,"a warning should be sent, but you shouldn't be prevented from loging in. there's a lot of eve players that are in the army, and they travel a lot. this would mean they wouldn't be able to login anymore. i can also imagine some players wanting to login into their eve online account to train skills while on vacation in another country. what about that?this however, i totally support. any series of 3-5+ unauthorized attempts to your account should be communicated to you in the same way credit card fraud is. if someone is trying to bruteforce your password, you should know about it. then again, i believe your account becomes locked if someone tries to login more than 3 times in a row with the wrong info, but i'm not sure about that."
7/23/2009,"i'm a geek. thank you very much.did i say it was hard to do?no.i said it takes a bit of logistics to do. meaning, it is an annoying barrier for them. first they need their username/password, then they need to figure out what country their account is in, then they need a proxy that is based in that country. they can usually assume it's us but it's not always the case. ccp could also narrow it down to state/province or city (which can be configured by the end user). then they need a proxy in the same state/province/city as the account holder. systems such as geoip are generally accurate enough for this kind of usage. any problems a player has with the system it would be their option to disable it.ccp already uses such system with their credit card validation.these players can go through the secure procedures to disable the feature. that's why i suggest a system to disable it. a minority of players have this situation.the account being locked after 3 attempts would be very easy to grief, figure out the username of your enemy and fail to login several times, and he is then at the mercy of the timer or gm's to get back in the game."
7/23/2009,"1. if this was implemented, this should be a disabled-by-default feature. it is your belief that a minority of eve are international travelers, but you honestly don't know whether that is true. also, this is amazingly easy to get around with a vpn or ip redirection service and serves little purpose.2. i doubt ccp would release the ip that attempted to access your account. the account does not belong to you, and you therefore have to right to such information. i agree that a number of repeat failed login attempts should raise flags on accounts for suspicious activity."
7/23/2009,"they already show the ip of the the requester for any api call in the api logs, so i don't see why not."
7/23/2009,"heh, somehow i doubt a majority of eve players frequently travel internationally. but sure, it could be default to off. the problem with that, players that are most vulnerable to getting their account hacked are not the kind of players that will go and enable this feature until all of their stuff is lost. and by then they probably won't renew and ccp loses a customer if the player can't be reimbursed.another thing, the system could be setup to where it's not just by country, but by state, province, city as well. the end user could have the option of configuring exactly how restrictive their account is. country was just the first step. the only thing that's important is having a decent and secure procedure to change these settings so someone with the password can't just go to the website login and disable them willy nilly.see above post. api.as far as the account ownership, that may be true. but it's in ccp's best interest to help me protect my account from unauthorized use. because if someone breaks in and steals all of my stuff, my fault or not, and their gm logs ""show nothing"" they will lose an account (5 accounts in my case).if you have noticed, ccp has already started making changes to the forum (captcha), these are slightly misguided because i believe they are poor methods of solving the problem but it shows they are at least trying to do something to protect the players."

7/23/2009,"no chance.i know hundreds of people, myself included who have jobs that take them onto foreign soil. you're basically shafting a significant chunk of the playebase into not being able to play the game when they're away with work.you're also shafting everyone who travels to fanfest and wants to skillchange or log in the morning after an epic night out to talk to their corpmates.you're also shafting people who decide they want to emigrate and would have to run the gauntlet of customer support and wait till the next ice age to have their account details changed.you're also shafting people that decide they want to go on vacation, and take a laptop with them only to find that their account is locked because they're logging on from an ip in a different country.you're also shafting people who are serving in the armed forces when their tour of duty takes them to far away places.i can see the basic logic behind it but it has a horrible set of side effects where everyone who doesn't sit at home on their buns festering in front of the same computer day in and day out is being shafted. that's lots of shafting.even with controls in place to enable or disable it, it's a bad idea since someone could take control of the account, and enable it for their location, and the damage is already done before ccp has a chance to respond.sorry, i know it's suggested with the best of intentions but it's a terrible idea."
7/23/2009,"that's why they could opt disable it.give them the option of disabling it.they'd need to change the address on the account in that case, plus it would be possible for ccp to set up a system that handles this automatically, similar to a password reset mechanic. they get an email, click on link to confirm changes.a good fix for this would be to give players an option to disable it.perhaps there could be an option for players to enable/disable this feature?notice how i said a ""secure"" method of handling the enable/disabling. meaning the account owners email would be contacted before changes take place. heres a idea, rather than blocking the login, fire off an email to the users email account with a 6 digit code. ask them to enter in that code.- if they are able to connect to the eve server, chances are they'll be able to get to their email. maybe add sms option too.- once they enter the correct code, they have the option of adding the current location as a temporary location (24 hours) or permanent location.- these same restrictions would apply to the website as well.i much rather see a random number generate keychain toy implemented, but if ccp's not able to do that right this minute, these are other options."

7/24/2009,how can you not support this?would be like the early privateer days when empire was in total chaos.would be even better on tranquility.
7/24/2009,definitely supported.
7/24/2009,"cockpit, executive.i see no problem here to those who cannot figure it out: just quote it. it is an old trick.support for the hell of it though"
7/24/2009,support because i hate having to insert words.slade
7/24/2009,"i think an alternate solution that might even have a better chance would be to lobby for cargo mass to affect total ship mass. this would allow a lightly loaded/empty freighter to move faster, as it will be much lighter. this is something that should have been in game forever, but was probably never put in for database reasons. still, an extra database calc every time cargo is added or removed from a ship would not be a huge amount of extra cpu work, but would, imo, make a lot of sense.i don't think you're going to get ccp to pay attention to the 'small freighter' because in their eyes, it's already sorted."
7/24/2009,"if ccp introduces a mini-freighter it should follow the ""standard"" training path of ships. it should not require x industrial lvl5, only lvl4."
7/24/2009,"dude 1: hmm, i bought 16mil of tritanium and need to do 3 - 4 runs with my rigged hauler.dude 2: use an orca/freighter?dude 1: nah, i know!! i'll go to the forum and make ccp add a hauler to the game that just fits my personal need."
7/24/2009,"actually smartass i have an orca, obelisk, itty 5, and one of the transports. regardless of what i have i still find the inconsistency a point for improvement. in a game where almost everything is player constructed, supply lines are extremely important. the entire ship training system could use an overhaul."
7/24/2009,"once and for all: the orca is no ""small freighter"" and using it as such would be a misallocation of valuable mining bonuses (and skilltime).i myself happen to have an orca and a freighter... the orca is used for what it is supposed be: supporting mining fleets with bonuses and easy hauling. (hauling, not traversing through 15 systems) the orca is even slower than a real frighter.. i know it warps faster but its align time and sub-warp speed are horrible (just a reminder: coming out of warp at a gate, bumping it and going 3000m/s in the wrong direction in your orca is fun, try it out sometime).and my freighter, only used for hauling pos fuel, is 80% empty for most of the flights. not to mention the investment of 900million for the bloody thing."
7/24/2009,"you can still dictate range if you a. have a fast gang b. have a gang that can kill the fast ships quickly, to prevent being drawn away from the main body of the hostile gang.b can be done with arty very well, and you have the right support ship already on hand to paint. webs are for buying some time to destroy or outmaneuver fast movers, they're not only there for tackling. because this is what you want these ships to be: mere tacklers. actually they are (obviously intended to be) the cornerstone of minmatar tech 2 tactics, indeed for any speed tactics.the notion ""painters are situational"" equals ""speed and tracking are situational"", because you won't have both speed and tracking(=damage) without painters. since webbing for tracking purposes is counterproductive if you want to dictate range ie move quickly yourself. painters are your way out. rapier/huginn/hyena are painter ships with a web bonus. used as a tackler only when their gang is too slow to dictate range with hostiles going at 40% in the first place."
7/24/2009,"supported.during the nano era you absolutely needed a rapier/hugin in your gang if you wanted to kill anything at all. people started cross training for rapiers/hugins just because they were needed so much in gangs.with speed reduced to a normal level, i think we can cut the minnie recons some slack and reinstate their old bonus."
7/24/2009,"seems to me your incapable of reading even your own posts.unless of course you consider your own comments to be ill informed in which case i concur.your mixing issues in this paragraph.1) dictating range.even a single webbed hugiin / rapier can dictate range to a non speed tanked ship as long as it stays out of +2scram range , very easy to do with a 40km web range.2)force multiplicationa rapier / hugiin can slow down any target within points range, if that ship is using speed to tank then inevitable they will take more damage.a rapier / hugiin can also use its very underutilised tp bonus to increase damage on targets with small sigs.conclusion rapier/hug is just fine at force multiplication.if you are expecting to dictate range to multiple targets maybe you are just expecting to much of a single hugiin/rapier.personal attacks dont make your arguments any stronger.as a lolcaldari/lolmini/lolgallente/lolamarr pilot i fly the rapier and hugiin on many occasions.they are much better now than they were before the speed rebalance.before they were just too good.p.p.s.realpro tip: i never said they were.the real problem here is thisruleofthebone expects to be able to spread his webs and then sit happily twiddiling his thumbs or whatever.you need to prioritise your targets and get extra webs on the primary if you wanna improve your ""force multiplication"" role.dont ask ccp to do it for you with a overpowered ship so you dont have to think.still not supportted, eve does not need overpowered propulsion tackle fits."
7/24/2009,"i/we get it. not supported by you for whatever reason. thanks for thread bump though .**edit**actually...i will take an issue or two here:""you need to prioritise your targets and get extra webs on the primary if you wanna improve your ""force multiplication"" role.""this is not a force multiplier. a force multiplier allows a smaller force to take on a larger/more powerful force with a reasonable possibility of success. the force mulitplier should be capable of engaging multiple targets at once...not just on a single primary.""still not supportted, eve does not need overpowered propulsion tackle fits.""you could say the same for arazu/lach and it actually means something .and finally...while you probably won't it would be interesting to see the main you represent given your claim to experience. actually...don't bother. :effort:**another edit**actually according to your kb (i checked because i care) you have not flown a huginn since 27 september 2008 and the rapier is a no-show. how the heck would you be in a position to judge anything rapier/huginn/hyena-related when you mainly fly an onyx f1-f8 headrolling brick? seriously. dang."
7/24/2009,bumping since this is important.
7/24/2009,i wondered if anyone had asked previously about the viability of salvage drones. we have drones for everything else in game why not salvage.?
7/24/2009,"this has been brought up previously. about once every couple of months, actually.previously, there was a skill in the game for salvage drones, but i am not sure if the drones were ever actually implemeted. at any rate, the skill was removed, and ccp's typical response to this proposal is that the implementation would be a bloody nightmare, so they aren't working on it."
7/24/2009,"unless they did something unique with them (only make them usable by specialized salvage ships), then **** no. would only be used as a way for missionrunners to increase their already-massive profits, and move salvaging away from its own profession."
7/24/2009,"well, salvaging drones would be great but i think the whole salvaging profession should be reworked if you introduce them.make salvaging a profession like it was explained in the backstory.it should take a significant amount of time to gain anything valuable from a wreck... also the salvage loot should require more space: i.e. alloyed titanium bar/armor plates, even the ""intact"" ones require only 0.01m<U+FFFD> doesn't feel right... an intact armor plate salvaged from a battleship should require way more space than 0,01m<U+FFFD>when salvaging was introduced i immediatley thought about fitting a salvager to my hauler and start collecting wrecks in the universe... only to find my hauler to be the worst choice i could have made."
7/24/2009,you mean i could follow mission ships around in a vexor and clear out their mission space 2-3x faster???supported
7/24/2009,"in all honesty, i'd like to keep them as relative collectors items. tbh, i think the main problem is the cruisers being underpowered. they don't have the extra push you would want from a faction ship. if anything give them a buff, don't seed more. i like the idea of having the prized ship sort of thing."
7/24/2009,a slight update of the faction ships couldn't hurt.
7/24/2009,looks too low to me tbh.
7/24/2009,sounds good.
7/24/2009,"currently it is possible for a player with low security status to travel through hi-sec systems with relatively little worry. the faction police will respond to your presence but if you are in a fast ship then one has relatively little to worry about. even battleships are able to make it through with the faction police not engaging there disruptors for approximately 10-15 seconds after engaging you.however: when travelling through concord sov systems (notably yulai and three or four others) even if you are not engaged on the gates by the police spawns there is a random chance of incurring a gcc upon entering the system and even during warp through the system. this leaves the player unable to leave the system or dock and 9 times out of ten will result in the destruction of one's ship.this does not just affect outlaws but players with, for example, a security status of less than -2.0 travelling through a 1.0 system which has concord sovreignty.while a relatively minor problem it is a source of much irritation if travelling from one end of the galaxy to another.under no circumstances should travel through hisec be safe for those with low security status. the faction police are merciless and will destroy anyone who lingers around for too long or disconnects while travelling. added to that are the risks of happening across a switched on pilot with some tackle fitted. finding mid warp that one has recieved a gcc without even being aggressed by the faction police goes against the grain somewhat though."
7/24/2009,"agreed.the whole gcc system is bugged as heck, though."
7/24/2009,yes
7/24/2009,"in this instance, i happen to agree with lark. the gcc is there to serve a particular purpose, and in this case, it doesn't sound like that purpose is being served.i support a more general request to have ccp review gcc mechanics and update anything that seems to not make sense."
7/24/2009,"so ... what is the problem? i'm a bit confused.do you think concord also ""having a discrete beef"" for people with a negative sec status (even if they are just petty ""criminals"") on their own turf (it is their sovereign system) is a problem?or should concord display such behaviour outside of their sovereign systems?or should concord mind their own business and only deal with serious ""organised"" crime :ppilots with a negative sec status need to be wary of law enforcement, and quite frankly it is not surprising to see the equivalent of the feds give a hint here or there or put a stumbling block on ""their"" road for people bordering on criminality so the local cops get a little success too once a while. makes the chief and the mayor look good, in a manner of speaking. cause, well, normally the local cops are a joke who never catch much of anything."
7/24/2009,this just sounds ludicrous. supported.
7/24/2009,"while it makes sense that concord might be a bit more fussy than the 4 empires about who can travel in their systems, the way it currently works is in need of some fixing, especially the gccs during warp. failing that, improved documentation."
7/24/2009,"when you are aggressed by faction police, you can still use jump gates and dock. when you are under gcc, you can do neither (afaik), at least in a ship.special note: evading concord's wrath is an exploit.so technically, ccp's own lazy mechanics would cause anyone with a -2.0 traveling through concord space that gets gcc to be committing an exploit by surviving.edit: forgot to support"
7/24/2009,makes sense.
7/24/2009,"need to increase limit of items in a courier contract also, 100 just isnt enough without having to make multiple contracts to get items from 0.0 to the destination"
7/24/2009,good idea!
7/24/2009,yessss and fast
7/24/2009,"please. how many buyers do you think that there really are? and really, if someone is willing to pay several billion over and above the normal entry fee for a spot, do you really think they're not going to use that spot? the alliance name might not be one full of pvpers, but the players fighting will be. i cannot imagine any circumstances where a glut of non-combat players will threaten the competition."
7/24/2009,i see nothing wrong with what lark is doing.
7/24/2009,supported.on a side note current tourney should be unaffected and lark should scam the auction winner. if he is good he could probably get two or maybe three bidders to pay![edit]forgot to check the check box.
7/24/2009,"thread is pointless as ccp claw has already said that next time around the rules will be getting reviewed so i'm expecting the changes to come anyway.not supported as people have said, your just jealous that he thought of it and you didn't"
7/24/2009,i think all players should be able to join the tourny. if not luck of the draw whay not a fat wallet.
7/24/2009,"so first you argue for unbelieveable ideas, then you argue against them? make up your mind"
7/24/2009,"ok, but then it will follow you in low sec too, give you infinite duration global criminal countdown (at least as long as you aren't caught and get your trial and prison sentence), investigate where you live, seize your assets and all your clones, lock you in a cell if you are caught, kill you if you make resistance.are you so sure now that you want a realistic concord?a chance of not losing a ship when doing a gank against some day/month (compressed time instead of years/decades as this is a game) of locked character?"
7/24/2009,unsupported./thread
7/24/2009,that made me giggle considering that the thread has gone on for 6 pages after that post.
7/24/2009,"you want funny?every single reason for saying no is utterly stupid.even in-spite of the fact that this in no way hurts the criminal profession.other than taking away ""free isk"""
7/24/2009,"but drake, you know everyone likes free isk."
7/24/2009,"i see the problem and i agree with it. it is a complicated issue. eve has always been a game of effort vs reward. hiding and watching local is deffinaly more effort than running l4's. the fact that l4's give more isk per hour than 0.0 npc'ing is strange, maybe its caused by outdating. l4's are getting improved all the time and 0.0 has always been the same... i think this deserves some time from ccp to look at and balance it more."
7/24/2009,"supported.if ccp doesn't want duplicate models, just give the ugly model to the e-war frigate, who cares about those."
7/24/2009,i have not flown my helios since the model changed.
7/24/2009,i want my old helios back :(
7/24/2009,"if somebody sees you flying in a covops, then you're not flying it right."
7/24/2009,supported. also the drone commands need to be looked at. i hate it when i set them on a target (and have focus fire) and then they split into groups and they completely ignore the target i set them to (which is in drone range)
7/24/2009,"make all racial border regions low security (<0.5) for at least 1 jump so that it would not be possible to travel between amarr, caldari, gallente, and matari regions without passing through a low security system. one jump through low security space would make travel a bit more exciting and a little less inviting to afking (guilty of that myself). the possibilities this could bring to economic game play would be exciting as well. there would also be more opportunities for commerce raiding, and commerce protection."
7/24/2009,"this isn't us/canada* borders we're talking about.if anything the borders between amarr/minmatar, gallente/caldari, amarr/gallente, and minmatar/caldari would be have more security than almost anywhere beyond capital systems.edit: not supported"
7/24/2009,"i was thinking along the terms of a hotly contested ""no-man's land"". certainly not the us/canadian border. i do see your point though."
7/24/2009,there is a lot of no-mans-land. it is between the jumpgates. you never ever go there.
7/24/2009,not supported. if anything these systems would be (as ap pointed out) even more heavily defended by the races holding them. not to mention that the empires have a vested interest in insuring that trade vessels can flow from empire to empire with as little hindrance as possible.
7/24/2009,i oppose this for the same reason the people in-game would oppose this - it'd bugger up the flow of people and goods something fierce. commerce protection is for people moving things to dangerous zones.
7/24/2009,"and then that single low-sec becomes a bottleneck deathtrap that becomes absolutely bloodshoot impossible for the average player to go through.would be great for the pirates for a month or two, then players will pretty much stick to their own empires and the pirates will be back whining about no targets in low sec.what could also happen is all of the players settle up near jita, and the other 3 empire population dries up significantly.so you end up with empire/4.welcome to caldari online."
7/24/2009,"flying a freighter around is already the most boring thing possible, adding more risk to flying a defenseless ship around empire is not an improvement"
7/24/2009,"i would like to see commerce protection for people moving things through dangerous zones as well.your opposition to this proposal is very nearly mirrored by others in disagreement to it. i'm a contrarian, so the things you all see as negatives, i see as positives.when i made the proposal, i expected opposition. especially in the form of: i think it's too risk free to move freighters around empire as it is. i would like it to be harder and more dangerous. freighters should never be able to move between borders without an accompanying escort of mixed ewar and bb assets. i'd like the game to be more challenging, not less. it may be that there is an ""in-game"" solution to this already, and i think i know what it is.thank you all for your comments. while you have disagreed with me, you have brought illumination to what was for me; a dark place."
7/24/2009,"not supported, want to stop drones from killing you set yours to kill them or web and shoot. if you cant do that then i suggest you get a better ship or switch to a ship with drones"
7/24/2009,"no support as it is, though there are some funny and viable ideas.some ew that reduces bandwidth could be really cool, but only in the case you can counter it, so also a bandwidth bonus mod should also be introduced. but it would really touch the nowadays' balance of ships.so there are fine and funny raw ideas, but they are far from being a proposal."
7/24/2009,"i'd say no. battleship classes are supposed to be superior on a one to one basis in direct combat. that's why they're useful despite their large cost and slowness. the slowness is a big one, since bses cannot escape anything, ever, whereas frigates can pick their fights."
7/24/2009,"i can't speak for minmatar stations, as i stay out of those regions. however, caldari, and to some extent, amarr stations need their docking radii looked at.as i type this i have a ship in amarr at the (caldari) p8m4 station. a ship is right on the undock 37km away from me, and yet i am only 5km away from the station's docking radius.the amarr stations are almost as bad.now look at the gallente stations. as an example my alt is at p9m20 station in dodixie, the moment he undocks he starts leaving the docking radius of the station. i undock and stop ship, there is a rifter on the undock 9km from me, the station reads 6km from me.why the discrepancy? can this be addressed to even out the stations, to help somewhat in everyone's favourite game of dock/undock?i'm not asking for priority attention, btw. just.. something to get to eventually? (after you fix scan probes)"
7/24/2009,a discussion regarding dual monitor support has been going on for some time in this thread.has any member of the csm raised this issue with ccp yet? it's hard to overstate just how much dual monitor support could improve the game. imagine having one monitor for your primary view and all the information windows and chat on the second monitor. it would offer players (and fc's) a whole new way to enjoy eve.would anyone else like to see the csm push this issue?
7/24/2009,this has been requested over 9000 times already
7/24/2009,"csm minutes: 0101-08-0035 multiple monitorthis is possible in the graphics engine but is not supported in the ui code and would require a significant rewrite. also, we wouldnt be able to do this with the map because of the seamless zoom, unless we completely rewrite the map. it should be possible to only render in part of the frame, but things like the ship hud, messages aligned to the centre of the screen, and the overview, etc, would need to be fixed. all of it is possible, but a lot of work would be needed."
7/24/2009,they seems to be working on it.on the last fanfest they showcased it already.
7/24/2009,this would make fleet battles a lot more fun imo
7/24/2009,bump
7/24/2009,"how do you propose that they disable the feature? say a player lives in the us, is in the uk on business, goes to log in, gets locked out. so what, they just check the account page to disable it? oh, wait, if you have it happen that way then all the hack attempts will just be against the account page. you'd have to have them disable the feature preemptively, which is great until someone forgets, or doesn't know that this ""feature"" exists, and then they find that they can't play the game. it's simply not practical."
7/24/2009,1. people might not always be in their country. no.2. yes
7/24/2009,"the system to enable/disable/configure it should be handled by sending them emails and having them confirm their actions that way, so as long as they could access their mail, they'd be able to login."
7/24/2009,"less bad, but i still foresee major problems. i could only conceivably support this if it defaulted to being off, and even then i'm sketchy on it."
7/24/2009,"(1.) i agree with(2.) from seeing a corpmate's experience, if you suspect your account was broken into, and you want to know the history of your account's login information, the gm will disclose that information to you. in the case of my corpmate, there was a virus on his computer and the attacker was remotely controlling it, so the gm told him that it was his own ip address that was logging into the account.also, currently if you didn't know, any ip address that accesses your api information is available to you if you check it before the log entry is a week old. this is actually a nice way to harvest ips if you leak your api to an enemy.edit: beaten on the api thing"
7/24/2009,"this is what a truly well thought out and balanced idea will get you, majority of praise and approval out of those that respondat least this is mostly true in evesupported"
7/24/2009,yes please fix the login/out thing. it would also be nice to have a global logout button in case you need to switch accounts.
7/24/2009,i saw a post a year ago suggesting homeworld style navigation where you first set your coordinates in the plane and then your coordinate perpendicular to that plane. that plus a waypoint cue would certainly make the navigation micromanagement a little less painful.
7/24/2009,"i think they've added quite a bunch of pve content during last year.tech 3, wormholes, industrial capitals, orcas, low sec rats and some missions got a bit ""oomph"" too...i'm not saying there's not much to be done but yeah, pve has got enough attention compared to other things...i think wormholes are badly documented mechanics though. even though there seems to be clear ""difficulty"" levels etc it's hard to say what is what :/ also i think difficulty gap between normal pve sites and wormholes is too big, there should be a bit more easier wormholes too, with less profit of course."
7/24/2009,"meeting minutes: 2009/07/19present dierdra vaal, avalloc, erik finnegan, larkonis trassler, mazzilliu, meissa anunthiel, zastrow j, omber zombie, issler dainzeapologies vuk laudiscussiondierdra said he had received notification that the csm emails should be working, however the page to access it seems to still be failing.omber zombie confirmed that he had spoken to ccp diagoras who confirmed that despite the frontend being broken, the mail access should work correctly.account security proposal (maz)in raw text from: 2009.07.19 16:11:46erik stated he was fine with optional measures and discussing the issue, despite his belief that less frequent changes with better passwords to be better.issler said the ccp does not have worse account security than other mmos and she would not support the idea.mazzilliu thought this was still relevant because people lose accounts in stupid ways.omber zombie agreed with the proposal as long as it's optional.meissa objected to third party software being installed on his computer, password change reminders and others are not a problem. he said that most compromising happened due to user stupidity that no amount of software will solve.zastrow thought it not being a good business policy to make people jump through extra hoops to log in the game.mazzilliu agreed, and said that's why everything mentionned is optional.avalloc would love a token option. he hoped that one would be able to bind multiple accounts to one lest people who ""share accounts"" be upset.mazz answered that people sharing accounts don't have to use the token.meissa put his foot in his mouth and made a comment about mandatory password change that was not in the proposal.issler asked if mazz had any data to support the idea it affects a significant number of players.mazz said she didn't, but ccp issues warning/devblogs every once in a while, so she assumes it's a problem.voting followed.motion passed 8 for, 1 against (issler dainze)stuff about character transfers and problems caused by it (maz)in raw text from: 2009.07.19 16:28:51meissa asked wether it isn't already mandatory to publish a forum thread for every character sale.mazz answered it isn't.dv thought removing all info automatically goes too far and thought asking the user to erase it himself to be better. as well, he prefered this to be optional.omber zombie and erik agreed with the optionality.mazz agreed the mechanics of the change should be worked out by ccp but people aren't notified that the new owners will see petitionsissler thought there were better things for ccp to spend time on and as such would get no support from her.meissa put his other foot in his mouth and made a comment about erasing character history that wasn't in the proposal either. with no space or foot left, he decided to read the next proposals more carefully.mazzilliu replied that it was adding another entry in the character info, or requiring a certain npc corp used only for such purpose.omber zombie reminded that meetings are to discuss the issues, prioritisation is done later.issler stated that with the exception of petitions, players can already delete all other information themselves.erik and mazz said petitions could already be deleted by the owner.issler thought this was hence a non-issue.erik noted that personal notes on other pilot infos are not easily removable.voting followedmotion passed 8 for 1 against (issler dainze)"
7/24/2009,"make guns continue firing at previous target after reload (maz)in raw text from: 2009.07.19 16:49:18omber zombie understood, but thought removing one of the few benefits of t1 crystals [over t2 crystals] to be a bit weird.mazz said she was looking at it from the perspective of benefit of being amarr vs not being amarr, as lag causes a de-facto reduction in dps for everyone not amarr.omber zombie answered it was a tactical choice, heading into a fleet fight to choose a normal setup or a ""high lag setup"".larkonis said that considering that t2/faction crystals last practically forever, oz's point about reloading them is a bit moot.zastrow liked the idea because he's lazy as hell and doesn't like reactivating his guns. he noted however that in high lag situations, cycling the guns was more of an issue than reloading.erik wasn't sure to understand what were the negative side effects of having guns continuing fire after reload, but high lag should not be a reason to maintain any mechanics.larkonis said it removes a bit of the management involved in things, but the benefits would outweigh the downsides, especially for people using multiple caps to shoot poses.erik asked wether the proposal applied to other modules such as cap boosters and other mid slot modules.mazz answered the proposal didn't apply to those modules.larkonis suggested making it optional in the contextual menu <U+FFFD> la ""auto reload"".erik, mazzilliu and dierdra vaal thought that a good idea.voting followed.motion passed 8 for, 1 against (omber zombie)container idea (maz)in raw text from: 2009.07.19 17:06:47erik thought cans are intended as cargo buffs, and the division of cargo space in smaller segments throught it was intended. he also though the hassle implied in filling/clearing them adds ""role play"". he wants to keep things as they are.mazz said using cans to expand cargo space seems more like an exploit to her. and freighter pilots currently have no way to create smaller subdivisions without using courrier missions as placeholders.omber zombie wondered if the issue wasn't made void by the introduction of multiple cargoholds. he said a random buff to all cargo holds is unnecessary. he would however be happy to remove the cargo buff one gets from cans.mazz asked for clarification as to what the devblog stated.omber zombie said it was the ability to have multiple dedicated bays for fuel, ammo, etc.mazz said this was thus the perfect time to raise the issue since they are making the change anyway.omber zombie disagreed, as this proposal was asking for a cargo buff.erik said that if the proposal aimed at making partitioning easier, divisioning space with hangar divisions like the orca has would be sufficient.mazz said it wasn't a cargo buff, more a convenience buff as all-purpose cargo is more convenient than dedicated separate holds.meissa asked how mazz could consider extended space through cans to be an exploit as the devs had to state that the inside of cans was bigger than the outside. he also said cans were extra hassle for which you get extra benefit in the form of additional cargo space. nobody forces anyone to use cans if they don't want to deal with the hassle. he also didn't see the point of giving everyone 30% extra cargo without any extra effort/cost.erik agreed.mazz said it wasn't classified as an exploit, but was a nonsensical game mechanic."
7/24/2009,"meissa answered it wasn't nonsensical as one got extra hassle and extra capacity as a result. smaller freight containers would be an answer to the freight container being too large, not this.mazz said pos fueler have to use the cans to reduce their trips by 30%meissa answered pos fuelers use jfs.omber zombie agreed with meissa.mazzilliu agreed with the pos fueler aspect but not as far as it applied to, say, an iteron. stating it makes no sense and is annoying for no good reason.meissa answered it's annoying for a extra space, and that a lot of aspects of the game were of the form ""extra hassle, extra benefit"".mazz asked what it contributed to the game, adding she doesn't want to play an annoying game.meissa answered the contribution was extra space.omber zombie said that basing a wholesale cargo buff based on people fuelling poses haveing hassle to be ridiculous.voting followedmotion failed 5 against, 3 for (mazzilliu, zastrow and avalloc). larkonis dc'ed his vote didn't get registered.station dock radii (zastrow)in raw text from: 2009.07.19 17:27:06larkonis pointed out that many empire stations have the same issue, and being in 0.0, one should be doubly careful. more opportunities for station games is not a good thing.zastrow said stations should have windows, but until they do one should at least be able to dock before the session change runs out. he added he doesn't want huge dock radii and that people should still be able to be bumped off.omber zombie agreed dock radius shouldn't be an issue, but questioned the dock/undock practice instead of undocking outside dock range at a random point within x km.zastrow answered that randomness would make bubbling undock harder.erik didn't have any opinion on undocking inside dock radius or outside, but agree there should be uniformity.dierdra agreed.avalloc said that station games in 0.0 are to the advantage of the owner of the station. he dismissed the ""get a scout"" argument as being irrelevant as people can have a logon or dictor trap.omber stated the ""in or out"" question was relevant as the proposed solution was to change all outposts [exit ports] to be within docking range.meissa didn't like the idea of requiring scouts, as it favours alts. he thought station windows to be hard to implement, although an overview-style ""radar"" could be easier. he expressed his support of ""all in"" until such a tool be developed, and either way the discussion of this matter is a good idea.larkonis said if uniformity was applied to outposts, empire dwellers will want it applied to all stations.voting followed.motion passed 6 for, 3 against (omber zombie, issler dainze, larkonis)"
7/24/2009,"looting from wreck you didn't create = looter flagged to (wreck) killer in empire (avalloc)in raw text from: 2009.07.19 17:41:31dierdra pointed out that this was brought up during csm 1 and ccp declined it. he asked how avalloc thought he could convince them this time.avalloc stated that the players were still unhappy about it.erik didn't see why killing a ship changes the wreck owner. he also opposed the increased reward for piracy it would generate.avalloc asked why erik thought it'd increase rewards for piracy.erik answered it had to do with people who didn't participate in the killing stealing from the wreck.larkonis said it was something a lot of the player base wants, it being a huge problem in empire wars, and he would like to know why ccp wouldn't want to implement this. he added people would still be able to ""steal"" from wrecks, but they'd have to be more careful.omber zombie said ccp prefered the current implementation, and that the csm was free to find an alternate not already suggested (as this proposal was)voting startedmotion passed 5 for, 4 against (omber zombie, meissa anunthiel, issler dainze, erik finnegan)fix rockets (dv)in raw text from: 2009.07.19 17:53:57omber zombie asked why going for explosion velocity rather than base damage increase.dierdra answered that increasing raw damage might make them overpowered against stationary targets. the objective of the proposal is to make them more valid against their intended targets (small quick ships).erik agreed.voting started.motion passed unanimously.corp traitors and neutral support (erik)in raw text from: 2009.07.19 17:57:52dierdra said that neutral rr-ing in cases of malicious in-corp pvp seems extremely rare and as such probably not worth the development effort.erik answered he wasn't aware of the exact numbers, but that was up to ccp to investigate.larkonis agreed with dierdra and further pointed out it could be used to grief neutrals.erik asked details about said griefing process.larkonis explained some of his associates got people concordoken'ed by sitting outside stations and saying ""hi brosef, i can't afford to repair my ship, can you rep me"" and shooting one of them, causing a gcc reaction chain.erik said his proposal didn't involve concord.larkonis replied the griefing could be done by corp members.dierdra agreed this could be used to make neutrals flashy to a corp.erik answered this situation would give the victims a choice the current mechanics don't.larkonis stated that if someone was setting up to kill a corpmate, he's likely to be well prepared anyway. he furhter stated (with some more affection for the word ""brosef"") that it could incurr more losses to the corp as they would get flagged to neutrals in addition to the rebelious corpmate.voting followed.motion failed 8 against, 1 for (erik)"
7/24/2009,"fix to logoffski (lark)in raw text from: 2009.07.19 18:14:36dierdra asked if he was correct in reading 4 different solutions in the proposal, and said he didn't like the 15 minutes lockout, but the other solutions sounded reasonable.larkonis answered that there were inded 4, although not all mutually exclusive.mazz asked what happens when someone logs of at a pos that is destroyed before the person logs back in.larkonis suggested not logging off at a pos in danger of dying soon.avalloc asked if the suggestion is to stop the ability to change the arrival point after a disconnect.larkonis answered that it was.avalloc said it would be a problem in mazz' scenario and asked if this was an empire or 0.0 problemlarkonis answered it was both. adding that if one were to jump into a bubble and log out, he wouldn't decloak immediately, but after the 60 seconds, which is incidentally the time the ship stays in space.avalloc said if a pos was mistimed, it could be gone before the people logged off at it get a chance to get to safety.larkonis agreed, but that this was still using game mechanics to avoid getting one's ship killed, that losing a ship due to a pos changing hands was more the responsibility of the person timing it badly.voting followed.motion passed 5 for, 4 against (mazzilliu, issler and avalloc, zastrow)show info button with chat invite (avalloc)in raw text from: 2009.07.19 18:32:15larkonis didn't like going through the effort of searching the name of random plebians who convo'ed him, and expressed support for this issue enhancing his gameplay experience.voting followedmotion passed unanimouslybpo locking changes (dv)in raw text from: 2009.07.19 18:35:50omber zombie liked the idea of making locking less painful, but without corp hangar locking, there would be no way to tell who took what.dierdra answered this would be useful for moving bpos.omber zombie said allowing mass unlock without a way to track means something moved may never reappear.dierdra agreed it would be less secure, but shareholders would have to vote to disable locking, thereby voting to give the control away.erik suggested allowing the unlocking vote to be done on a whole set instead of individual ones.dierdra agreed this was part of the issue.meissa said the setting as described couldn't be implemented without being made useless (because temporary due to trades movement in cargoholds etc.) if the setting was tied to the bpos, and useless if it was tied to the corp because it can't leave the hangar without losing the setting.dierdra said the option would be tied to the corp as explained in the wiki.omber zombie said the problem was that selecting multiple items to [un]lock generates votes for every individual bpo. he agreed with erik's suggestion of batch voting without messing with roles.dierdra said it was implied in the issue.omber disagreed.dierdra agreed to clarify the batch voting partomber zombie said that the proposal was thus too complex for the needs. repeating his statement that batch locking was all that was needed.voting followed.motion passed 6 for, 3 against( meissa, issler, omber)meissa, issler and omber zombie voted no on the basis that the issue was too complex and should be reformulated as simply ""batch [un]locking"""
7/24/2009,"dierdra asked why specifically oz wants to bring this up.omber replied the issue came with the recent ebank saga where ricdic had one of his account banned but none of his other accounts, and that this was ccp's current policy.issler asked if ccp's rmt policy was currently unclear.omber zombie said it wasn't, that this was a general discussion on the issue.omber and issler discussed a bit about the issue of banning accounts belonging to the same person than the account banned for rmt'ing.erik said this could also be used to discuss more means to discourage rmt.voting followed.motion passed 8 for, 0 against.other businessdierdra reminded everyone to send their q&a questions.dierdra also said he would like people to send a list of issues discussed in previous csm meetings to be discussed (again) with ccp, to give ccp time to prepare answers.omber zombie said he had already pointed out that these things were already automatically on the agenda of the csm-ccp meeting.next meeting was agreed to be august 2nd.forgot to add the download links at the top, here they are:download: pdf | raw text"

7/25/2009,"years ago, when my eyesight was still flawless, i got majorly hooked on eve. that lasted for a year or two and ended with me having gone through two sets of glasses (i'm up to three now) :p don't get me wrong - i only blame myself for that, not taking enough breaks and so on - but i do wonder sometimes if it would've helped if eve had some sane fonts.anyway, i just reactivated my account again, and am somewhat shocked (or rather annoyed) to find it's still not possible to get a decent ui font. it was so bad on my 1920x1080 22"" screen that i just swapped it with my old 1680x1050 22"" one :/i should say it's not just the text size (which it seems you can now at least modify to some extent by making it less condensed), the shapes seem horrible too, i can up the chat window font size 2 or 3 notches and i still can't read it comfortably.so theres my vote, please consider making this possible!"

7/25/2009,"i was just talking about this with my corp. i'm glad i looked before making a new post about it.i support this idea. i do a lot on the market and currently have a few excel files to manage my expenses and to know exactly how much i need to keep to be able to reinvest, and how much is profit.a few wallet divisions would make my game time much more enjoyable.thanks for the already amazing game, though, ccp."

7/25/2009,gets in the way more often then not.
7/25/2009,lets keep this idea up there
7/25/2009,*bump again* :)
7/25/2009,rofl. though i say any drone lovin is good lovin. so: supported.
7/25/2009,you should need a freighter class ship to move assembled bs just like you need a freighter class ship to move them packaged. it should be harder to move a rigged ship then it is to move a repackaged one.
7/25/2009,"it'd be best like a freighter.no fittings, no cargohold, no jetcans, just ships.so they have zero tank, completely vulnerable, not for solo ship moving.but can carry as many or more ships then a mothership and go into empire.forget the t2 orca.... this has nothing to do with mining. as far as using it to transport ships for sale in empire, think the ship would have too much tank if it's designed to make a suicide gank anything but a sure thing. when you consider the value of a shipment of bcs the suicide gank should almost always be much more attractive then most freighter loads.the tug-boat idea is cool.... think that's generally what we're talking about, a ship made outta scaffolding rather then a hardened ship bay."
7/25/2009,0 tank? i was thinking of something with similar stats to a freighter - but with a ship bay instead of a cargohold.
7/25/2009,or we could just get a new kind of freigther containers that are bigger and can contain rigged ships. it should be pretty easy to code it so they have the same restrictions as a carrier corp hangar regarding goods within ships.
7/25/2009,im all for this but not a t2 orcathe freighter & transport skill at level 4 must be a requirementand the new skill to fly the ship must be a rank 14 skill and cost at least 300m
7/25/2009,yes please
7/25/2009,"ok, the mid warp thing is an issue. but as for the rest.. flying into a concord sov system with a low sec is like walking into a police station while you have an active warrant out for you... of course they're going to react."
7/25/2009,get rid of concord systems and fix gcc
7/25/2009,"only a pirate/ganker would want concord's systems eliminated. fix the bugs, but keep concord's systems intact. pirates will be less apt., like in the real world, to ""bum rush"" any tom, **** and'eve' wondering into pirates' attack zones.two days ago, i watched as a pirate, or other, with a bad sec. status got blown to bits by a concord vessel. it was the funniest, most immersive thing i had seen at a gate thusfar. guarenteed to disuade any other criminal from rolling up on the ""po', po'"" units at customs, for ex, thinking they are gonna run things.don't throw the baby-out-with-the-bath-water."
7/25/2009,i agree with this proposal
7/25/2009,it's certainly broken.
7/25/2009,sure
7/25/2009,"and i would like a free **** *** but i aint getting one, should i complain because noone wants to give me one?seriously, suicide gankers are giving miners a good reason not to mine. and then they just mission and hey we all know missions are broken because they give just as much minerals as mining. its a big wtf from me.spread the love a little <isk to missions, <isk to suicide gankers, >isk to miners and industrialists. then maybe we are getting close to how it should be."
7/25/2009,since when did concord have jurisdiction in lo-sec?
7/25/2009,"when sitting cloaked for hours u can still zoom in and look at the outline of the pretty little antenna tho :-dit was a damn cool ship, probably the best looking in the game.i too haven't flown it since, think i trashed the one i had been flying."
7/25/2009,agreed
7/25/2009,"typical achura response (damn uglies)old helios model was nothing short of sexy - now i can't even bear to look at the thing fortunately the number of people flying the things has plummeted since the change so i don't see them often, but would be nice if they didn't look like space poo."
7/25/2009,"if this proposed change went though, and chribba was also allowed to bring his veld-titan into highsec, i believe that eve would be the perfect game.(also boost the hyperion and fix logoffski mechanics)"
7/25/2009,"i will admit i choose to train certain ships because of their look. i thought i had a nice looking symmetrical ship, then they changed it. please return the original."
7/25/2009,"in my opinion the helios is one of the ugliest ships in the game... but beauty has always been a matter of opinion.beauty is in the eye of the beholder ;-)ccp switched the models of the cheetah too, which, in my opinion, was a mistake 'cos the probe hull is ugly =)for my fellow sufferes: seconded.but ccp wont change it.. they've turned down far more useful changes, no offense ;-)lax"
7/25/2009,"you could outsource some work to ea and have them make a sims 3 expansion solely for eve, based on sim city 2000, and please keep the cheats the same."
7/25/2009,"or better yet, they all shoot at it once and then go shoot whatever they want.then theres mining drones.. tell them to return to bay and if they finish their cycle before they get back or out of range of their target, they unload and sit there instead of docking. again with mining drones.. since container and drone return range was changed to 2500 m they shouldnt need to come all the way back to 500m or less. they drop off their ore at 2500m but continue towards your ship till they hit about 500m then go back to mining... minor issue but annoying when you're trying to get what you need for a project asap."
7/25/2009,judging by the rest of the issues that don't get fixed or take ages to fix i'd say the latter. supported however.
7/25/2009,"as much as i like shooting newer players, and having their drones aggress me on the undock, this is ridiculous.i'm also tired of half my drones deciding to change targets for absolutely no reason. i'm scared one day they'll go off and get me concorded :("
7/25/2009,"supported, the current drone ui and stances are painful at best.-vic"
7/25/2009,not supported.0.5 is unsafe enough for haulers as it is.
7/25/2009,hahahaha no.t.t;;;it's bad enough when carebears want high sec extended... but for people to ask for the opposite? should know better.and it's not risk free... there's this thing called suicide ganking.
7/25/2009,"there's nothing boring about the current structure of interstellar commerce. i was attacked by two real, non-rat pirates during my second (on my 6th now) day of training/""gaming.""your suggestion, though interesting, would spoil the fun for those of us less inclined to combative engagements. you could always attack a commercial convoy and take your chances (thru engagements with that corp.'s military escort or with concord). if that's not enough military excitement, then, i don't know what is.i love combat, and can find more than my desired share of it as is. following your request, the very nature of the game will change to a less individually adjusted ability for crafting an individual destiny, and more of a combat shooter. that's what low sec. space, pirating, mercenary exportition, escort/vip protection, and faction battles, to say nothing of the myriad forms of economic warfare, are for.if that can't get ones blood boiling, then, perhaps, nothing will."
7/25/2009,"often you will hear people come onto various forums asking for a t2 bs more geared toward traditional slug fest pvp. the issue is that if u just make a bigger, better bs with a lower cost (so that it's not entirely pvp prohibitive) then it becomes the standard, and likely becomes a solo pwn mobile.an idea occured to me that could perhaps satisfy those who seek after the bigger, badder bs, and still encourage a balanced, count on your friends situation.mostly i'll leave specifics for later, but basically the idea would be a heavier, more dense ship (so that it's size stays approximatly the same.) they would take the tier 3 bs, add 2 more bonus to it, significantly more buffer (not significantly more resistance. spider tanking can be bad enough as it is), and generally boost it's combat effectivness.the balance would be that these ships will be too heavy to use jump gates, and will not possess a jump drive of their own. the only way to transport these ships would be via carrier or mothership (or freighter if unassembled.) they could dock or sit at pos, be fit and rigged then jumped to the battlefield. pilots would then dock up into their ships from the pods they bring into system (or jump clone in) and pew pew until they die or win (at which point they must dock up their ship for it to be jumped out.)discuss. (as the idea isnt fully complete yet =p)"
7/25/2009,pvp t2 bs? marauders seems to do a nice job. check the videos from darknesss.
7/25/2009,a ship that can't be flown to its destination and restricted to the system of which its deployed is a wholly worthless and waste of good isk.at that rate ill go get a marauder and be done with it.

7/25/2009,i do lvl 4 my missions in caldari space. most of them are against guristas and include multiple battleships. the salvage is rediculous even from the battleships (i use t2 salvagers and 3 salvage rigs) and i'm not talking about smaller ships.i think that salvage dropped by the guristas need to be improved.

7/26/2009,"personally i think this is too soft. if you remote rep an enemy under attack, or apply any gang modules to an enemy who's under attack then that enemy should have killrights on you for 7 days. if you get involved in the war you have to be involved imo otherwise wtf is the yulai convention for?"
7/26/2009,supported.
7/26/2009,"...you do realize this will continue the killing of small-gang warfare, no? pvp shouldn't always be about who has the bigger blob, and hit and run tactics should be encouraged. pitboss and supporters, if you want remote reppers to have no escape, then why not fight in a belt? oh yeah- because then you can't deaggro and dock up if things get nasty :).personally, i actually enjoy it when people use rr- neutral or not, against me. reason being, 90% of the time, they end up doing something stupid- they aggress in something i can kill even with rr, they leave themselves open to ewar, or (my personal favorite) they leave their rep alts in harm's way. this thread was started by the pitboss, executor of empire's premier griefing alliance, privateer alliance. privateers are good at one thing- griefing. i'm sorry, pit- you talk a lot about neutral remote rep abuse- but when was the last time you fought outnumbered (including all participating ships, rr or otherwise) against someone who actually had a fathom of experience in pvp? i'm sorry if you missed out on a couple mining barge kills because their buddies were generous enough to help them get out of jita. and i'm sorry if you've lost a few ships to wildly inappropriate because your 'pvp' alliance is too disorganized and divided to learn to work as a team. the current game mechanic supports teamwork (between corp mates, alliance mates, and just friends you meet in the game), guerrilla warfare (you can hit and run when heavily outnumbered, and force your opponent to adopt a different pvp strategy than just the bigger blob wins), and the element of surprise and danger that eve is known for. pit, why not just bring anti-rr support? it ain't that hard. let's consider the circumstances that recently took place- privs decced wi- about 5 members of wi were interested in fighting, and between us, we had maybe 5 more friends/alts who'd help out as needed. that's 10 total versus an alliance of 200+, and you were still unwilling to fight because you couldn't work together to come up with an adequate counter to our strategies. would it make a difference if all 10 of us were in alliance? why don't you just bring 10 dps ships and 190 remote rep ships? find your own counters to remote rep. we have :)tl;dr: quit whining and find counters to it- there are plenty."
7/26/2009,i was waiting for one of the kings of rring for cheap kills to open his yap ... no offense but you said it yourself:this is the exact reason why i brought up this issue ...stop hiding behind the facade that its going to kill small gangs ... if you the had skills you wouldn't need to rely on 5 alt accounts
7/26/2009,"as usual, taken out of context- and still not particularly relevant. what exactly is wrong with me helping out friends who are getting station camped by a priv blob? if you guys can't deal with some rr, find someone else to camp.edit: not to mention- how the hell does bringing rr to make a 2 on 20 a 5 on 20 classify as 'cheap'? i'd say picking on carebears who don't know jack about pvp is a bit more 'cheap' than surprising griefers by winning a fight in which even with remote rep, we are heavily outnumbered."

7/26/2009,"in a nutshell, ships will be able to equip a new kind of boost. ship crewmen can specialize in certain areas of ship operation, giving you bonus to these areas. in npc academies you can have your crew trained to higher grades, which improves the bonus, but it requires you to provide the required curriculums to the academy for training you crew, and for commanding them, later, the necessary leadership skill. to take crew on board, you need to invest into a special rig. care for your crew means you might want to eject early from your ship prior to destruction, thus ejecting your crew with you, or you will lose the training invested into them.the basic thoughts behind crewseve-online is a space simulation. simulations always try to build a bridge between gamplay and reality.* it has been established through ["
7/26/2009,"abilities, dependencies and requirementsintroyou acquire freshmen from the academy, a new station service. equip your ship with the rig for one or more human teams (the crew rigs come in different sizes, as rigs will do in future), and off you go. through their crew, the crew rigs have similar benefits (and backdraws) like regular rigs, with the added benefit that you may choose which specialized team to put into them. while you cannot exchange rigs, you can exchange the crew in a crew rig to modify your bonus.crew can be trained in a variety of specializations. depending on the specialization and the grade of training, the crewmen will boost respective systems of your ship, giving you the extra power in a fight.improve your crew by sending them to the academy. the academy will ask for curriculums in order to teach your crewmen to the higher level. you also need the appropriate skill yourself in order to start a course. and in order to lead crewmen of a certain grade, you will need the sufficient leadership skill.when taking damage into hull, your crew will suffer. leading to random casualties until all die when your ship is completely destroyed and only you automatically eject as the hull begins to desintegrate completely. save yourself and your crew by ejecting early enough.this all comes as a whole new business area, too: personnel, the training of it, and the trade of experienced ship crew between pilots.to start with crewsyou need to acquire and rig your ship with a crew rig. the rigs come in different sizes and allow for one or more (up to three, maybe) teams of any specialization to be assigned to their slots.get crewmen from the academy (they will be untrained) or acquire experienced crew from the (contract) market or from corp mates, who are able to train them. assign the crew to the slots and you are ready to go. when you want to put crew of a certain grade (see training below) onto your ship, you also need the required leadership skill.implementation in the ship's ui (2 options)crewmen either come as individuals or in teams. the authors do not have a clear preference and would like ccp to decide according to implementation constraints, effort, marketability, and balancing aspects.similar to both options is the fact that crew takes damage upon the ship taking hull damage. either they die one by one (option 1) leading to an irrevoquable loss of the crewman's ability who may be replaced by backup from cargo, or they are injured (opiton 2) allowing healing them with the proper equipment.overcharging might apply just like for other slots - with increased ""casualties"" due to human errors in operating dangerous equipment.when you lose your ship, you will lose your crew, unless you eject early (before complete destruction), which will eject your crew with you. their escape pods will be attached to your capsule, either visualized or not. the basic concept is that they flee with you, if you succeed, and you can save them from destruction and losing all the bonus you trained them for.crewmen as chargea rig provides one or more slots for crewmen. any slot can take a limited (maybe 5) crewmen of any specialization, but it must be the same for any given slot. the total bonus is calculated from the average grade of the assigned crewmen, taking empty ""positions"" into account.comparable existing logic like the name suggests, the ammunition charge is similar to this. crewmen appear as count in the slot. as crewmen die, the count decreases, and vacant posts can be remanned from cargo."
7/26/2009,"crewmen as team modulea rig provides one or more slots for crew teams of any specialization. the bonus applied to the ship corresponds to the grade of the team. when you get into hull damage, your crew is injured, decreasing the bonus. you may improve the health using medical equipment like nanite for broken modules.comparable existing logic crew teams are like modules which you fit into the slots provided by the rig. they take damage like modules do, and can be repaired using the right equipment.trainingin order to improve your crew, you need to send it back to the academy. academies are a new station service, where you can also get untrained crew, if you do not want (or cannot afford) to buy them off the market. you need the according training skill to do so, appropriate to the specialization of the crew to be trained. crews have a fixed specialization, which cannot be changed by training. in addition, some curriculum are requested by the academy to start the course.when you want to put crew of a certain skill onto your ship, you also need the required leadership skill. such skills can even be split up by specialization, so that for helmsmen of grade engineer, you need a helmsmen leadership skill on level 2.depending on whether ship crews are handled as teams or individual crewmen, can be applied to this aspect accordingly.comparable existing logic training works like the blueprints' me and pe can be improved with research.summarysummary of the penalties* crewmen cost money - dayly, weekly or monthly salary. (to be decided by ccp)* crewmen can die during fights.* crew rigs have downsides like regular rigs."

7/26/2009,"i like it. it is a highly complex ""boost"" - instead of tweaking with existing weapons and modules. and it caters for mission runners as well as pvp."

7/26/2009,ye be a great add on to a o.0 or wh mining ops
7/26/2009,with some tweaking i think this would be a very good idea
7/26/2009,"sounds quite reasonable ! i would like to hear, what the csm assembly says to that next sunday. imho this could really improve mining in low-sec.i would like to point the interested reader to a post on features&ideas, called deployables and corporate specialisation, which could be capitalized together with this posting. just a thought."
7/26/2009,"um, i thought this feature was called ""corporation and/or alliance members""?i agree it is stupidly easy to break up mining ops and have a gank, if you can find such an operation in 0.0 which does not have advance warning through scouts .still, this is kind of a multiplayer game, right?"
7/26/2009,"aye, i think this is a very good idea, as cons specifies in his orginal post, no pvp pilots wanna be sitting around for hours on end protecting hulks etc so it does leave them wide open for attack, at the moment for miners its either stay in high sec or go to 0.0 for the rarer minerals where a bigger alliance can give system protection.the mmg sounds like a great idea, id say maybe limit the amount of guns you can have in a belt (sorry typing and dunno if cons mentioned this) but if u get each person flying haulers/ mining ships to drop a ""mmg"" it will be to powerful having say 20 of these guns in 1 belt wud be slaughter.but apart from that i think its a really good idea, cause at the moment for miners low sec is a nono.(not that im a miner myself i just think low sec is to overpowered on the pirates side , miners deserve some defence, plus it makes it more fun for the pirates:p)ark."
7/26/2009,sounds like a bad idea to me... thats what sentry drones are.... it would make low sec and null sec mining too easy. pvp is an integrel part of the game and pvp vs low sec miners keeps the market stable by keeping people that dont want to get shot in high sec. a security force isn't hard to get in a corp and if its that much of a problem hire some mercs for an hour or just mine smarter...
7/26/2009,if you don't want to be shot then don't go into low sec. whats to stop pvp'ers from setting these up to keep miners away? what stops me from defending a pos with these? why not just fly a ship with warp core stabs when mining? wouldnt this cause more deaths of low sec miners that feel safe with these guns up? how many can you put out at once? what would stop people from gate camping with them? just a few questions/comments i have about these guns for carebears.
7/26/2009,what's to stop them? well first... there's a fuel cost? second there is no miners already.lastly... what miners are being kept away?the real change is... 0.0... i could set them up... then ratting would be way safer. at the same time... the boring 2nd accounts can be mining.then it comes back to uberblob time. ewwwwwwww
7/26/2009,"the proposed fuel costs are low, you never said a dmg mod for the guns or a range mod. your also puting dreadnought size guns on an auto turret... how does that protect agains a crusier that ruins ur ops since it wont be able to track? i mean, that was ur big example of why its needed right? what ever happened to this being a mulit-player game, play with some security members and get them into ur corp. if you want to be safe stay in high sec or get some security. if you dont want to be bothered by pvp'ers your playing the wrong game. as for 0.0 your alliance isnt doing its job if u have roaming bands of pirates taking down ur mining ops in ur sovergn space... if you dont own the space its your fault ur getting owned in it... join an alliance that controls the space already. basicaly this seems to me like you trying to thake the multiplayer out of the mmo rpg."

7/26/2009,"it's not just him, i gather. albeit his choice of words is .. not exactly awesomesauce.i'm still having trouble seeing the problem here i'm afraid. gcc under concord sovereignty makes sense. it is concord sovereignty. unlike other systems where concord has to operate under a shared charter or together with faction elements, these systems are the domain of concord. it does suck, to go in there with negative sec status and pretty much find that concord is letting you trip over something so that the cops can get you, but at the same time it makes sense. plus it is a random occurance, it is not like this is an iron cast guarantee that if you have negative sec status and if you go through concord sovereign space they will let you stumble over something so the cops will get you.it's an odd chance event. bear in mind that to concord anyone which has negative sec status is not a well behaving citizen, but someone who is either borderline or already a criminal. concord does not have to take into account the realities of life in space they have their bureaucracy to maintain, after all.like i said, the random chance of incurring a gcc as someone with a negative sec status under concord's sovereignty does not strike me as ""bad"" or ""broken"".it strikes me more as an officer standing outside his headquarters and sticking out his foot when he sees john doe average policeman spot or run after someone with a criminal sheet running across the pavement."
7/26/2009,this is all true... however the gcc mechanic and concord response is there to punish players immeadiately for hostile actions in high security space. it's a rubbish mechanic that trips up even players who are not outlaw as such.
7/26/2009,"the mechanism is not rubbish, it's a random event which makes sense. if it happens it sucks, but that does come with negative sec status.keep in mind that we are talking about concord here, not the empire factions police. concord is the supreme watchdog, negative sec status means outlaw, regardless of how big the negative sec status. on their turf they are likely to let someone who is not a fully fledged good citizen stumble so the regular cop can get him.the gcc mechanic exists to punish players for criminal actions and not staying on the right side of the ""law"", for which the only means concord has is the mechanism of sec status. if positive, all is well, if negative, they at minimum give you ""the look"" (next step being they let you trip).concord, like every bureaucracy will not build up a complete file on everyone and all actions across all time, they use a simple response & action mechanism based on criminal actions and security status."

7/26/2009,"a need for dynamic missionseve online unfortunately features rather weak pve, with a finite amount of repetetive missions. mission running apepars to be the core gameplay activity for many pilots, and is the main income source of many. despite adding more missions over the years, the weak spot of missioning is their predictibility. sites such as eve survival and the cosmos database feature complete walkthroughs for all missions. the challenge level is not too low due to the encounters being too easy, it is low due to the static and predictable nature of the missions themselves. missions require no creative thinking and problem solving from the pilots, they have deteriorated into a ""read guide, press buttons in correct order, get your money"".several games feature parametrically generated environments and encounters, which improves replayability dramatically. instead of focussing on adding more of the same, ccp might wish to explore the avenue of dynamic content to dramatically improve replayability.some examples of dynamic content in gamesdiablo and several roguelikesfamous feature of diablo and roguelike games is the random generation of dungeons for almost infinite replayability. certain (quest-related) elements in the dungeons are premade, but used as random encounters.dwarf fortressthe whole world, history, pantheon, quests, npcs, and story is parametrically generated. creatures have a basic template which is then expanded on with history and stats. a must-play for any game designer or developer. well, a must-play for anyone with a few spare braincells. been playing it for several years now and i'm still not tired of it.

7/26/2009,"at the risk of coming across as an ass ....there is enough pve content in eve, this is after all a pvp game. i will agree that the pve side of things is of interest to marketing, since eve in its continued growth does and will continue to appeal to a variety of existing and future niche markets comprised of player mentalities and behaviour.still, ultimately we have to keep in mind that in eve the pve side of things exists in support of the pvp. this is not hello kitty online, as some would say.your references to third party games are nice, but rather without direct use without first mapping out which potential player mindsets and thus niche markets would even be exposed to competition between eve and those games. this while obviously keeping it within the broad general framework and goals of eve's mechanics.eve's marketing is primarily focused on distribution the subscriber growth opportunities through market channels, that is not the same as marketing through game design dear now, all that being said, i think you (and many with you, including some people at ccp) may be forgetting the biggest and strongest attribute of eve ... players drive eve. we get the pixels from ccp, we then run off and go crazy. the biggest growthspurts of eve have come from player driven events and trends (including scandals).so instead of priming pve against pvp, i would much prefer to incorporate both these things and that biggest attribute. result being a framework (perhaps under the cosmos paradigm there is room for this) to enable players to create their own missions, challenges and jobs. regardless of whether pve or pvp.now i realise that is easier said then done, but a lot of the tools are - on a basic level - already available. the biggest challenges would be to enable the utmost of flexibility without opening up to exploitation. this obviously being the most tricky part because of the schizofrenic nature of eve (but hey, let's be honest, when you look at the upcoming fw boost we already see people working out means to make the most out of the new reward mechanisms by pairing accounts in support or even against each other, these are things ccp do take into account).on both a design and marketing level the challenge is somewhat different, it pretty much comes down to the choice between the eternal race to add in new content complete with balances in an ever complexer race of complexity (law of diminishing returns, pretty much, in the long run) or switching to a framework where players are provided with further tools to do what they are best in: going crazy with pixels and driving the game and its exposure ever further.as a sidenote:it is probably best not to including jumpgate evolution in comparisons with eve you have to remember that the core developers ran away with their tails between their legs from eve after ""getting griefed"". as a result their game design became so screwed up they recently had to suck it up and go back to the table as their post trauma views on market and death concepts were so laughable that even in the ""family & friends"" debunking rounds the game pretty much died an agonising death."
7/26/2009,"just varying the hostile npcs that spawn in a given mission would go a long way towards making missioning more unpredictable. rather than having a mission where 2 battleships, 5 cruisers 3 sentrys and 10 frigates spawn every time, assign every shiptype a points value and have randomly generated spawns of a set point level for that mission. heck, use the points system from the alliance tournament if you like.it would be pretty cool to warp into a mission not knowing if you were going to get 3 battleships or 20 frigates."
7/26/2009,"you certainly seem to have many of us figured out already.an advantage of having predictable missions is that it allows players to work around real life schedules.a compromise might be to add a 'surprise me' button to the agent conversation window which would then result in the agent providing a semi-random mission within the abilities of the player. such a button might only be pressed on weekends. edit... the existing ""request mission"" button could be changed to 'bore me'. also, will the new random missions have sound?"
7/26/2009,"while ankhe's approach of comparing eve with other games (impossible, i know!) might not be appealing to all, why explain twice what others have done already ? at least you seem to know, what she's talking about. ;) now take the good from all others, and make it even better.we cannot neglect the fact that missioning is still a highly used income generator - and it is highly boring as it is. also, ccp is putting energy into creating more missions; which are just more of the same, as ankhe said. this is all notwithstanding efforts to get the epic arcs going, which also allow decisions. they are in the same way improving the fun factor in missions, as this proposal is doing.one note to play-generated content : i have been discussing that up and down with a number of pilots with very different background. besides the real tricky challenge of providing a toolset of ""success factors"" that are s.m.a.r.t., you need to avoid free text, which would else open the door to abusive language. but on top, the exploitability is huge as soon as you allow spawns to appear upon player mission setup. to get around it, i am discussing mercenary contracts to start with, where the money solely comes from the issuer's pocket.back to this subject : procedural content is discussed up and down the industry. eve should not lack. cause solo'ing does get pilots started. they will sooner or later get hooked up on the eve feeling anyway and move into the sandbox to play with the rest of us."
7/26/2009,"i support the introduction of dynamic missions.further, i would like to see all current missions aside from storyline arcs and epic mission arc's folded into this system.the fact that highsec farmers know exactly what ships are in a mission, when they spawn and what the triggers are is a problem that needs to be rectified-and dynamic missions will make the pve grind actually enjoyable for a huge swathe of people. enjoyable missionrunning in and of itself- mad i know!edit: the devs should be forced to play dungeon crawl: stone soup to teach them how random generation can be succesfull."
7/26/2009,"heh, comparing eve to ""other games"" is known to get you shot on sight in quite a few places in eve you have to keep in mind that missions, as well as other pve really was just conceived as a means to an end. it is only logical that the continuation of that train of thought leads to more of the same as the base concept is not subject to change. however, in the light of a growing subscriber base this is not necessarily wrong. depending on the various niches among subscribers this may very well be the better approach, given manhours and further commercial considerations.it's a concept which would warrant an expansion on its own really, and it would be perfectly paired with the early elements of cosmos (which apparently will come to us in pieces - no pun intended ..)as i mentioned earlier, i do think that the biggest forte of eve is the ability players have to go crazy drive things forward. providing a foundation for this only makes sense. but, this does mean quite a fundamental choice. it can't be both approaches, again considering manhours and commercial implications, it will have to be ""either/or"". and until, or even if, that choice is made we have to work with what we have.but yes, it is a topic on its own.my main concern is twofold, aside of the abovementioned:1. eve largely consists of a variety of types of subscribers, of whom a substantial portion plays eve for the pve side due to real life circumstances, and most notably playtime restrictions. dynamic mechanisms can easily upset that niche, so to speak. there will always be a need for ""knowing what comes"" as it lets people allocate time, in advance.2. a quite possibly equally large portion of subscribers uses missions as a simple means for isk, for them missions are a means to an end, they have little interest in spicing things up as making isk suddenly becomes flexible. as some would say ""unpredictable"".as such the somewhat simple approach of ""make it dynamic"" could easily upset this niche, again leading back to the closing part of item 1."
7/26/2009,"the prophecy has virtually no role in this game other than a building component for t2. it can easily be out performed in every capacity by other ship for either less cost of for more gain. prophecy:lows 2 eandcu 21600 tung plate2 heat sink 2sremaining fittings3 mid7 high1120 pg247.5 cpu25 m drone bayehp:65,417harbingerlows 2 eandcu 21600 tung plate2 heat sink 2sremaining fittings4 mid8 high1370 pg278.75 cpu50 m drone bayehp:57462harbinger get's more fittings, an extra turret, a 25% dmg bonus to 7 turrets. it also get's an extra high and mid as well as a larger drone bay. if the harbinger were to sacrifice 1 heatsink, it could come within 2k ehp of the prophecy ehp, while still doing more damage, and have more drones. simple solutions to the problem would be:1) drop the armor hardening bonus in place of a drone bonusor2) drop the turret energy bonus for a range bonus and powergrid, and potentially an extra turret slot.or3) add + 1 turret mounts + 1 low slot and more drone bay and powergridorabout 2 hands worth of other options we could count off.this is 1 of 2 ships in this class that has virtually no point of use in game atm over it's couterpart. even if you were to argue better tank, the trade off is so severe that justification of better tank makes no sense. if you went to the extreme for tank, harbinger could ultimately beat the prophecy with it's extra fittings ability and use of mid slots. prophecy is virtually maxed on fittings with 3 plates."

7/26/2009,"prophecy is a tier 1 battlecruiserharbinger is a tier 2 battlecruiserergo, the harbinger is supposed to out perform the prophecy.the prophecy is still the better option for upcoming missioners.not every ship has to have a pvp usage."
7/26/2009,"you're right, b/c teirs only matter for baseline comparisons of quality. let's avoid looking at the distingusing characteristics of other ships like he caracal vs the moa, the thorax vs the vexor, the domi vs the mega, the apoc vs the geddon, the raven vs the scorpion, the typhoon vs the tempest, the drake vs the ferox, the rupture vs the scythe the omen vs the maller, and whatever else it out there.using the tier argument is the dumbest thing ever when even the dev's have said that tier does not dictate role/function. think before you argue about the 2 hours of difference you just put up between a newer player flying one ship or the other.i'm glad that idiotic arguement got addressed at the beginning.what's even more amazing is that you don't realize that at lower levels of bc, the glaring hole that is the prophecy becomes even more pronounced because it does have less fittings, less turrets, less drones, less structure, less armor less shields, and fewer slots. so it's one useful feature, it's resistance bonus, or lack there of at lower levels becomes even more of a problem. which means that a newer player would be even better served using the harbinger over the prophecy.i no way does my argument only apply to pvp. the problems with the prophecy are universal. it can't perform well in pvp or pve or any situation between the two."
7/26/2009,a ship with resistance bonus always gives nice baits.
7/26/2009,"i think the prophecy is not underpowered when compared to its counterparts, i just think it lacks a real role. gallente have the drone / blaster mix, caldari have the gun / missile mix and mini have the missile-gun / gunship mix.all amarr have is great laserboat or less great laserboat. that said the prophecy is still a decent ship and certainly performs better than the ferox or cyclone.if anything i think the harbinger is a little overpowered as it far outstrips the brutix as a gank machine and has fantastic tracking and range as well.as someone who extensively flys the harbinger i wouldn't like to see it nerfed to much, perhaps give the proph a 50m3 drone bay and the harby a 25m3?"
7/26/2009,that would be a good change. maybe give the prophecy a damage instead of a cap use bonus so it is like a mini-abaddon too?

7/26/2009,"part 2 of the boosting terrible bc series takes a look at the cyclone and trying to figure this pos out.cyclone get's 2 bonuses:rofactive shield boostingon the topic of rof:cyclone get's 5 turret mounts. it's counterpart, the hurricane get's 6 and a double damage bonus. the cyclone is also almost strictly limited to a range platform because of it's delegation of mids to tank, and limited low slots for any sort of speed + damage. since it's also an active tanker, it cannot rely on both a burst tank and a mwd because it would require cap injection, which also uses a mid leaving 2 slots for either hardeners or a boost amp. this also means it has no form of tackle or webbing while at close range... thus the long range delegation.because it get's a rof bonus, it's hurt further for it's range duties because 1) range guns for minmatar rely on alpha, and 2) the faster the guns shoot, the more drawback there is to their very limited ammo clips for arty.on the topic of active shield boosting bonus:if a cyclone were to go a full out shield boosting midslot setup, it either a) has to give up 1 of it's 5 precious mids to a cap injector to have any chance of keeping the boost up or b) would be better served by extenders because they would offer more tank for a much more sustainable capacitor and would almost equal the boostable ehp of a capped out cyclone. if it went the extender route, it would automatically be served better in the situation that it were taking massive damage since it would not have to tick off seconds to regain shields. it would also nullify one ship bonus which brings the question, wtf do i have that for. but again, it runs into the problem of an immobile ship. so it either has to sacrifice it's tankability for maneverability, which the hurricane does way more efficiently, or it has to rely on a ranged platform. to rely on a ranged platform is silly as it has no slots for sensor boosters, tracking computers and limited low slots which it could dedicate to it's split damage platform.hurricane can both out damage and run a far more efficient tanking platform if it so chooses. it can also mix both roles much easier and draw an even bigger gain in choosing to do both over the cyclone. add to that it's ability to out perform the cyclone at range because it get's the more valued damage bonus to increase it's alpha as well as 1 extra turret (which we all know is better than a non buffed launcher any day at range) and you just can't find a reason to choose the cyclone for any role.possible fixes to the cyclone:1) let it mimic the typhoon by boosting it's drone bay to 100m with 75 bandwith. change it's shield boosting bonus to a missile rof bonus and add 1 missile slot.or2) add a turret, change the shield boost bonus to a tracking bonus, change the rof bonus to a damage bonus.or3)add a mid slot, remove a high slot. boost the drone bay by 10. or4)add a mid, remove a high, add a turret or change the bonus to a missile rof.any of these solutions would give this ship more purpose and utility. it would no longer be outperformed at both close and long range by the hurricane or it would get an acceptable tank for it's tradeoff of damage. right now, it just does not make sense to use this ship over it's counterpart."

7/26/2009,double post.
7/26/2009,"how about this:5. add 2 turret slots and switch 5% rof bonus to 10% optimal.this would effectively mean 5% increase of turret dps (40% alpha). it would become decent support platform for dispatching frigates at long range for people that cannot fly/afford muninns. and it would become true to its current description:edit: additionally replacing shield boost bonus with tracking would support the new role more, but every day is not a christmas. besides that, supported. from yaay's ideas i like 2) the most."
7/26/2009,i am not sure it is really all that bad with the cyclone. recent videos of kil2 and someone else where i forgot the name show that the cyclone perfoms really well. even when fighting multiple ships.
7/26/2009,"all of the problems you describe fall into two catagories.the first is that ccp believe higher tier ships should be superior in everything, thus the hurricane for some reason is superior to the cyclone in every way including shield hitpoint.the second is that the shield booster bonus is inadequate, it's not enough to clearly show a cyclone out tanks a hurricane by a fair margin.my solution is far simpler than your redesign.all active tanking bonus ships to have a clear role in pvp or pve should have their bonus increased from 7.5%/lvl to 10%/lvl.this suggestion is relivant to gallente and minmatar tanking bonuses ships and would rectify most of their problems.if you don't believe me, try doing the math. currently there is a clear incoming dps amount for active ships that after about a minute, their tank becomes apriximately 2% better than a passive bonused (resists) tank. the problem us the margin is far too small and the benefit is not great enough.with the active bonus going from 37.5% at lvl5 to 50% at level lvl5, you will see a clear difference from a bonused active tanked ship vs a non bonused one in nearly all small to medium sized engagements.then the cyclone will shine."
7/26/2009,the only problem with the cyclone is that nobody active shield tanks in pvp any more. that and it requires twice the skill of the hurricane to be effective in. if you fly it with skill its a great ship.bottom line is this. if you want 600 dps out of either ship your left with three slots for tanking. the cyclone will outperform the caine with these slots.
7/26/2009,this is not true if you use the blue pill and/or crystals.
7/26/2009,hrm so if you use an expensive implant set and some drugs it gets better? well ofcourse it does but what's stopping the buffer tankers from using an implant set and drugs also? mate it's not a convincing argument against increasing active tanking bonuses to 10% per level
7/26/2009,"i think that a discussion with ccp would prove very productive, as the csm may give ccp considerations they may not have thought about yet.reading evemail out of game would be nice, but i think a lot of people would love it to go a step further and be accessible through other mailclients.some questions for discussion:to what extent can eve-mail be read out-of-game as part of the current cosmos plans?does this include support for alternate email clients?can a copy of eve-mail be forwarded to an external email address, just like existing mail-forwarding systems?how can players organize their eve-mail? sent box? inbox customization? folders?the csm should gather some information from their players and forward the conclusions to ccp."
7/26/2009,"with the upcoming winter expansion it seems safe to say that the nda will really be put to the test.that aside, i agree with lvv that it is simply up to ccp to choose whether to use the csm as a sort of think tank (concept feedback obviously, not mechanisms) or not. that being said, given how the concept of csm is reaching a point where it is becoming a replacement (and a more structured and efficient one) to the features & ideas section it is never a bad idea to keep track of the place as a coherent subscriber feedback mechanisms. independant of the functioning of the csm members themselves. but i'm pretty sure ccp read the forums, they rarely come out of the woodworks but they do hover over us question is whether or not it is within the rights / roles / etcetera of the csm to step up to ccp and ask for insight on such plans as cosmos. maybe, i do recall an interview with ccp recently where it came to the topic of the power of the concept and instrument of csm, and the road of earning it. so there really is the potential foundation for the op, has csm reached a point where it can comfortably make such steps, and be comfortably communicated with for such a purpose? if yes, cool. if no, well, then maybe ""soon""."
7/26/2009,"adding to avalloc's suggestion ui show info button with chat invite (thread, wiki) i would like add to this the feature of allowing the pilot, who is inviting, to give a short message along with the invitation.the block level would then be threefold: allow all convos, show message first, block all. this message would give some better indication to the purpose of the invite, and allow the invited pilot an informed decision whether or not to take the call. much like a number of pilots have a note in their bio stating: ""don't convo, evemail rules"" this feature seems helpful to me for that purpose.the hail messages would then appear as motd in the created chat channel. handy, cause it would be visible to those, whom you invite to join the convo (but they would also see the hail message according to their settings). and it would also show as motd when settings lead to an immediate initiation of the chat."

7/26/2009,"issue i would state as simply: buffer tanking is unbalanced in relation to active tanking, with the former being too effective.this is largely due to the fact that hp increases for shield and armour are too great and the prevalence of readily available and easily fit resist mods.the former can be laid squarely at the feet of the ill advised hp buff.i would like to see ccp attempt to re-visit the balance between these two forms of tanking and ideally reduce the base hp gain of modules such as shield extenders and armour plates.i do not believe buffing active tanking would achieve a desirable result- ships in eve are far too survivable as current imo.i beleive such changes would be beneficial to gameplay, favouring small gang warfare and guerilla warfare; as current expecting a smaller gang to achieve anything vs a larger one is unfair when buffer tanks come into the equation if they are in a time critical enviroment; to give an example a 3 man gang locks down a drake or buffered geddon and has only a paltry timeframe to achieve anything before the blob arrives."

7/27/2009,"the exact reason? helping a completely outnumbered fleet is cheap? tort saying even if ccp decide it's cheap that people will find a way around? what does this have to do with anything? since the mechanics stand how they are atm, i wouldn't go betting ccp is on your side. why don't you come up with some actual reasons against his argument. if your alliance had any skills, you wouldn't have to rely on a 1:10 battle."
7/27/2009,"you flamers keep on missing the issue - does privateer gank and grief noobs and carebears? they do. is that ok - yes, cause wardeccing in empire is a feature of the game. having said that, whether being a blob ganker is ok or not, and where you wanna polish that e-honor plate and hang it over the fireplace, is your issue, and is not relevent to the issue at hand - namely, remote repping having no real consequences at all. imo, if you jump into a fight, you should be (game mechanics wise) equal to everyone else - and if people actively attacking/activating offensive mods on others are not allowed to dock up, people activating rr on someone should be in the same situation. its not about removing remote reppage or increasing the power of blob or whatever other spins you try in order to divert attention from the point - its about equal and fair battlefield (game mechanics wise) to everyone. if the players choose to blob, remote rep, grief, or whatever, its up to them - and it is as intended in eve."
7/27/2009,"i think the reason that so many people support this, is because, on the surface, it seems like a totally reasonable argument. sure, everyone entering battle should be forced to commit, right? but people aren't taking an in-depth view on the situation. why don't you people take a moment, read the previous posts, and actually provide reasons as to how the points brought up are invalid. you guys just don't know how to pvp are just ****ed that you can't win outnumbered fights, tbh >.>"
7/27/2009,"being a lowsec pirate in a corp of about 10 active members max usually means im outnumbered, either by other pvpers, anti pies, fw, big alliances, etc. so i know how to fight outnumbered, and i usually do so. as for no not addressing the issues raised by other posts - its because no issues were raise. saying ""omg we need remote reps to deal with blobs/griefers"" just shows how unimaginative and generally ****ty you are in the game.the point raised in the op was that neutral alts (that could be 40-50k off on some stations), are repping, and then if engaged can dock up and the 15min timer, and then do the same **** again. that rep, even for 10-20seconds might seem minor, but it could sway a battle from losing to winning or getting away. and i'm not *****ing about the hulk that got away due to remote reppege, or the privateer blob that misses kills - im talking about pretty equal situations, in which one party can gain a large benefit with very little to no risk. even ****ing falcons are in more danger than remote rep alts. eve is all about risk vs rewards - you can make more isk in 0.0, but its more dangerous (well trade is most profitble, but thats besides the point), etc. in this case, there is a major reward in rr neuts and no tradeoff whatsoever - unless said neut is stupid or got bumped off station/gate.as for dealing with wardecs in empire, breaking the concept of the game is not a solution to it - try hiring merc, paying the wardeccers, leaving the corp, or maybe, just maybe - fight back. mashp.sputting a 3 line post that has no relevant info other than a flame and saying ""people dont look at things indepth"" is bad bad posting - if you wanna troll, learn from the goons in caod first."
7/27/2009,i found it completely ironic that privateer alliance would be moaning about neutral remote reps when they are as guilty as their targets for this if not more so...four neutral remote reps in a fight today where they already outnumbered us and had the upper hand but the fear of losing a ship caused them to bring out the neutral reppers for the gank vs fight..you are a hypocrite pitboss and the rest of your alliance are as full of fail as the people you accuse.fix your own internal pvp'rs before you try and fix the rest of eve!!
7/27/2009,#NAME?
7/27/2009,"amongst the marines, militants, janitors, prisoners, exotic dancers, tourists, and scientists hanging out in my hangar, perhaps there are some worthy of being sent to the academy. maybe the damsel will want to stick around the next time i rescue her from her favorite jet-can. i'm not sure how enthusiastic the exotic dancers will be about going to academy and besides, they might prove to be quite a distraction to the instructors."
7/27/2009,"i like the idea in general. perhaps the slots would actually be for specialized ship officers as opposed to crew in general, as its my understanding that we already have crews on our ships, they just dont do anything from a game mechanics perspective. using the slots for officers would have the same effects you stated, just the explanation would be changed a bit to reflect that you are adding officers to enhance your existing crews.perhaps we could also implement something like t2 pods that would allow us to have a better chance of saving experienced officers when the ship explodes, as their ""escape pods"" would actually be compartments in the enhanced pods. enhanced pods would have higher ehp, but slightly slower align times and speed to reflect the need to protect the officers who dont have the same protection vs acceleration in the compartments as we do in the pod proper."
7/27/2009,"it might be interesting, but even in eve, there are limits on how much complexity can be thrown at the player at once. i think this change is entirely too likely to be on the wrong side of that line. not supported, even though i think i'd personally enjoy it a lot."
7/27/2009,"i like this idea, but it may be a strong interference with the gameplay. at the moment i am very dependent on my corp mates or friends. if i need a hauler or tackler, i have to ask my corp mates for their support. with this change i am playing alone in the future, because there isn't any need for these kinds of relations."
7/27/2009,there are at least 1000 things in this game that could be improved or balanced before ccp should worry about little people inside ships.
7/27/2009,"believe me, as someone who has put up and taken down way more then his fair share of death stars i know the feeling, back to page one with this one in hopes of something different"
7/27/2009,"agreed.the fact that ewar is imbalanced is almost a direct result of the rsd nerf way back when, and now more than ever the players are seeing and experiencing it.revisiting npcs is something i've been beating on for quite some time. and it's more than just the crap ewar issues, it's also security problems, engaging when your timers are up due to federation/navy conflicts, etc."
7/27/2009,/supported
7/27/2009,sounds like a good idea to me.another option would be to put webber batteries near to the timer so that a single ship can't speed-tank the npcs whilst capturing the site.
7/27/2009,"agreed, i noticed this problem also and with ccp taking a look at fw soon, this really needs changing."
7/27/2009,this isn't the only problem with the basic fw mechanics (see also spawning system and system numbers) but sorting the npc's would be a good start.
7/27/2009,i agree.
7/27/2009,i agree.
7/27/2009,agreed: this should be reviewed.
7/27/2009,"ok, i agree that npc's should be reviewed but i think you are missing the point. i.e. that the currently npc's dont need to be detroyed to capture the plex. if the npc's had to be destroyed first then this would make solo-speed-tank-plexing, as opposed to speed tanking, an irrelevant issue.agreed the npc's ewar should be in line with pc ewar i.e. give caldari navy multispecs, with eccm conteracting it. however, the amarr's neuting and tracking distruption and the gallente should have sensor disruption and warp disruption, these would be more meaningful if you had to kill the npc's to capture the plex.also, i'm amazed that the navies don't use ewar batteries at their bases."
7/27/2009,"supported. also, what is up with ""lexe"" being on the censor list?"
7/27/2009,yes.
7/27/2009,fw needs some love..
7/27/2009,"i agree,"
7/27/2009,agreed.
7/27/2009,agree > i like the idea that you should have to kill the npc that are defending the plex in order to capture - supported
7/27/2009,"npc's need to be destroyed for any capture, this is bare minimum that is required to change things.add (or remove) something to discourage (read: make impossible) the speed tanking with impunity, the speed tanking was the reason mwds were disallowed from mission in times past if i recall. this can be ai coding change to make them ignore what they haven't hit after x number of volleys or something similar. the ai is dumb enough to chase a target that is hundreds of km away leaving everyone else alone .. this is part of the ""speed tanking fw plexes"" definition as far as i am concerned."
7/27/2009,"with all the ""balancing"" going on around the universe, certainly looking into this would be appropriate.you have shown with the sleepers that the ai's can be improved.i also concur with veshta's suggestions..."
7/27/2009,supported
7/27/2009,this is the reason gallente pilots stopped plexing so soon into fw and it definitely needs to be looked at.
7/27/2009,"agreed, and how about plexes that feel more like a mission and less like a button with a couple rats? hell even some useless decorations floating around is better than what we have now"
7/27/2009,agreed
7/27/2009,supported 100%the npc imbalanced has completely discouraged our corp from fighting in plex's period. hope this gets reworked.
7/27/2009,minnie militia checking in o/
7/27/2009,i agree and i will be supporting this.
7/27/2009,"i have to wonder though, where would the pilot's go when docked inside a carrier? just looking at the map screen or something equally boring?although i think this would be a sweet (awesome) way of showing off the practical applications of walking in stations. just think, instead of sitting at a crappy blank screen, they could make the inside of a carriers station-like environment that you can wait in. it doesn't necessarily have to be as complicated as an actual station environment, just something sweet to do/look at while you're being transported around.the general idea of actually being able to carry active pilots around space is sweet, but it does need some fleshing out, imosupported"
7/27/2009,"i would think having the pilot (who is docked) share the same perspective as the carrier that is carrying it. just zap his overview and grey out his modules. maybe let him see the capacitor/shield/armor/hull of the carrier carrying him so he's ""aware"" of the ship taking damage so he can execute an ""emergency launch.""they act of docking with carrier/mothership could create a chat channel hosted by the carrying pilot where all the people piggybacking can communicate with ease. ""we're about to jump into action.. get ready.."" or ""our jump to system xyz has been delayed 15 minutes."""
7/27/2009,supporting this. carriers actually being able to carry ships in a useful manner? hell yes. would lead to some interesting uses of carriers and some awesome new tactical options to explore.
7/27/2009,"support completely.and no, carrier's won't replace titans for bridging, this merely makes logistics easier. a carrier can only carry two battleships - to carry a fleets worth of battleships (100) would require 50 carriers, still far easier to just titan bridge."
7/27/2009,this really needs to be a feature of this game. there's no good reason for it not to be.
7/27/2009,"csm2 had a similar issue called ""turning titans into mobile stations.""here was ccp's response to that item: in my recollection of the actual discussion, the above statement is probably a little too optimistic. they've spent some time looking at the problem and found it to be just too technically complicated to do. they did admit that as time goes on, sometimes a new programmer will look at an old problem a dozen other guys have already looked at, and see a new way of doing things that nobody else did."
7/27/2009,"love the idea. i don't think it's come up in this thread (if it has i'm a ******ed terrible poster), but what happens if the capital you're docked in logs out/crashes/somehow leaves space? are your ships immediately ejected as it goes to emergency warp? or are you stuck in a clone that is living in the great logoffski in the sky?"
7/27/2009,i was always under the assumption that you could dock inside carriers/ms and when i found out that wasnt the case i was pretty dissapointed. i really like this idea
7/27/2009,"iirc, ccp said that would require both pilots to be considered the owner, which wouldn't be good, and the db can't handle it anyway. however, like the thread in feutures and ideas mentions (linked in op iirc), ccp already have technology to teleport a player from 1 place to another (like f.e. gms/devs moving people to the main test system on sisi), so it could be solved by simply having the people docking get teleported to a station in a system inaccessible by normal means (or just into empty space in a system like that if it's easier, give the system a -100% penalty to speed and have an indestructible bubble wherever the ships end up to prevent people from fighting in there). that means that from a database etc perspective the ship won't actually be inside the carrier, the carrier is just the entrance and exit point to that area, but from a gameplay perspective, it has the same effect.well, in that case, they should just read trough the thread in features and ideas, check if they can implement it by doing it the way suggested there, and if not, write a rely there explaining why and what the problem is. they are 100% correct in assuming that a new programmer hired might see a new way of doing something to get around old problems, but the thing is that programmer might not have to be hired by ccp. with the several hundred thousands of people playing eve, i'm sure we have our fair share of programmers not hired by ccp, so if they want to find that new programmers original and special way of looking at the problem and provides a soloution, the forums are the perfect place for a brainstorming like that. if noone in this community can come up with a workaround after that, then yes, it's time to drop it:p"
7/27/2009,"it should be up to each individual to decide if they want to see the real text of have it censored. there's nothing i hate more than censoring. forcing censorship on people is like forcing religion on people. if you're afraid that your kids will see evil words and corrupt their souls, then just prevent them from playing online games in the first place. don't try to control the world, control your kids instead. also, as far as i know, there's no censorship inside the game, especially not on voice, so your kid will be exposed no matter what.as for clicking dangerous links, well... if someone is stupid enough to click just any link, maybe they deserve to get infected. but anyway, if ccp had the least amount of sense, they would be using smart regular expressions to filter for .exe file extensions in links or filenames instead of just replacing every instance of ""exe"" in the post."
7/27/2009,"one thing for sure, anyone playing this game will eventually get the read plenty of ****, either in local chat, corp chat, alliance chat, or hate-mailand if that's not enough, will hear all those bad words on ts/vent. so this forum filter is for show only, it achieves nothing."
7/27/2009,"precisely, which is exactly why it should be optional."
7/27/2009,big!
7/27/2009,"not supported. i already rig my t1 cruisers (and they have survived many fights because of that) so why not be able to do it cheaper and better? also, most of my fits require rigs to work at their best or at all, especially on frig sized ships.ccp has the right idea."
7/27/2009,"umm great, so what you're telling me is that you invested more into a ship so that you would ultimately gain from it's advantage in situations. what you're missing is, when it's less about what you did because everyone is choosing to invest in something since investment cost it lowered, your gained advantage in scenarios is diminished. thus it lowers the payoff of choosing to use those rigs while necessitating that you do rig because the standard has risen. ultimately what's happening is your ability to survive because of rigging is being cheapened by the fact that your competition is going to be bigger, stronger, faster too.when you make everyone special, nobody is. lowering the cost of rigs is removing the choice and adding the necessity to use them. you made my point for me and yet you still argue against it because you don't see the whole picture. everyone here who's argued against this point has argued a ""me"" centric argument without considering how it plays out within the entire environment. yes your ship gets a boost, but so does everyone else. where as there was once distinction in ship performance for set roles, now there will be none. so when your now armor plated t1 cruiser get's pointed more easily because the average newb in a frigate is sporting the latest and greatest in rigs, how will you see things any differently than you do now? the only difference is that your still going to run through the same amount of ships that you always have, and those rich bastards are just going to have more money to throw in different directions than they did before.so rather than rigs being the standard by which ship monetary class warfare is raged, it will instead be all faction gear from the lp store, or more implants, or more drug use. i mean where do you draw the line once you go down this path? you're not solving any problem you may have listed, you're just shifting the problem elsewhere.i can tell you that if this patch goes through and i do end up spending less to rig my hacs, or command ships or interceptors, you can damn well expect me to throw those same savings at gallente webs, or domi scrams, or amarr ean's or faction reppers. and still, my choice to invest will diminish your choice not to.i fought a guy a few days ago who spent an extra 8 mil on a small centi repper vs the t2 version for his taranis. he chose to invest 9 mil extra and gained an advantage for it. he was a ***** to kill. should i complain that centi reppers are so expensive compared to t2 giving him a huge advantage?"
7/27/2009,"yaay, your an idiot.ccp is doing it right. so stop this crusade you have of, you know i still don't know what your complaining about really. it's like your just complaining to get attention.let it go man, let it go..."
7/27/2009,"yes, everybody look at me, i'm moses coming down from the top of the mountain!it has nothing to do with how out of whack this game is going to become because of this patch. surely that isn't my intent at all.punisher before patch... 3x axuiliary nano pumps ~75 milboost active tank from 60-84 dps using 2 energized adaptives and a t2 small repairafter patch...punisher3x auxiliary nano pumps 300k, 2 amarr navy ean 44 mil, 1 coreli c-type small repairer 9 mil. +20 mil for additional mods.save 1 pg, 13 cpu. equal cap use, 100 dps tank. after patch... the guy who chose to invest still gets a massive boost to his ship for the same cost over the guy who just rigged. slass warfare arguement still exist, nothing has changed. that to me looks like a farse of a patch that has created a non issue out of something that people were content with until ccp brought up the issue. there was very very limited grumbling before this patch was ever mentioned... it's amazing how after ccp created the issue, all the wealth envy came out in droves. and yet still, it won't change that fact. all it does is remove part of the choice people have in game. this patch has 0 to do with the cost of rigs and that affect on gameplay. the rich are still going to be rich, and you're still going to be at a disadvantage. the only difference is going to be the diversity the choice to use rigs vs not had on this game."
7/27/2009,let it go...
7/27/2009,"i like the idea, as long as its balanced not to eliminate the need for player protection. i'd see this more as a means to allow your guards to respond from somewhere else in system, not as a way to eliminate the need for them. i agree that currently balance is too much in the favor of pirates these days, but eve isnt supposed to be safe, so the balance should probably always favor them a bit. i say this as an industrial player, btw."
7/27/2009,"so how many can be anchored on a particular grid?currently towers have a fixed 'load' that they can support so these devices would also need some sort of limitation on how many could be plunked down. or force them to require some other 'core' anchored device that provides power/cpu on the grid.they'll also need some sort of limitation as to where they can be anchored: must be anchored within 100km of an asteroid. this to prevent them being spammed at gates, around stations/outposts, and used as supplemental pos defenses.enable them to actively engage npcs (because the npcs will certainly engage them).tracknig and rof should be on par with pos anchored defenses and their scan resolution terribly low.otherwise... it's a pretty decent idea.also, they need to implement the same mechanic to allow 0.0 alliances to anchor defenses around other objects (gates/stations/outposts, but not pos structures that already have fixed defenses)better yet: all they need is one device - the defensive screen array. this item can be anchored at a belt or near a station/outpost/gate and allows the anchoring party to then put in place the same exact weapon arrays that are in the game for pos defense.the defensive screen array can lock up to 6 targets and can be controlled by someone with starbase defense skills in the corporation that anchored the screen. no additional rights are needed."
7/27/2009,"this idea just seems ill-considered on all fronts. pos guns for temporary installations? fuel costs per hour higher than the actual cost of the guns? if you want security on a mining op, bring friends, or fly a ship that can both mine and fight.it is utterly meaningless to talk about improvements to lowsec mining that aren't based solidly on the idea of putting worthwhile ore there. until you make it so that jaspet and friends are worth more than veldspar, you're rearranging deck chairs on the titanic."
7/27/2009,this.
7/27/2009,would they go bzzt-bzzt instead of pew-pew then? sounds nifty.
7/27/2009,this would be intriguing. whats to stop them from being used for gate camps though?
7/27/2009,"some short answer to the replies i have got.yes this is a multiplayer game, ipod is right there. the mmg is notto be used by a single player. since the guns takes time to setup,needs to be maintaine with fuel. it isn't a work for a single playerat the same time he/she is doing mining.so it is tool for mining ops with multiple miners. i have tried in myfirst post to point out it is for miners as in a collective groupdoing a mining ops.death doorsetp talks about sentry guns for miners. well if we take themight hulk, it have a dronebay on 50m3 and a bandwith on 25m3. a singlesentry drone takes 25m3. so if a miner in a hulk would use a sentrydrone, he/she can only use one at a time. also sentry drones is to targetbattlecruiser or bigger ship. most loadout on hulk is about hobgoblin and in some case hammerhead. hobs is better since you will have 5 of the sametype.conclussion is simple for a miner: don't use sentry drones, instead five hobs or equivalentdrones.sarcasm says that the fuel cost is to low. well perhaps if you mount a single one.but the idea is that you should mount zero to many mmg in the belt. the more youput there, the more expensive is it. so from an economical point a mining op will not have so many of them, because theywill drain the profit from the op.herschel says that ""bring friends to the mining op"". well the thing is that carebearstend to be with carebears and pvp with pvp. but that is not the main problem. the mainproblem is that pvp pilots don't want to be in a mining op. since there is to little action.hence the need for some kinds of protection for a mining ops (several miners and haulers).in the second post on the lowest row, i put some limitation how many guns you can have.that depends entirly on how long the mining belt is.the limitation is ""max anchor distance to other gun (s)10 000m (m)20 000m (l)40 000m""also in all my post above, i have talked about ""mobile mining gun"" from the name it is pretty clear that the guns can only be anchor in the ore belts and not at a gate.personally i can't see any problem with players putting this on a gate. however, the fuel cost can be alot. so ... if those players would like to drain they wallet with fuelcost on mmg it is they problem :-d.mister xerox mention that the large is the same size that kills dreads. well in theory a pirate could come to a mining belt in a dread/carrier. hence the need for bigger guns.however, if you want to anchor one or more of them it will cost you alot of isk.so to summarize it:1.) there is a physical limitation how many guns you can have, depending on the size of the ore belt.2.) there is an economical limitation how many guns you would like to anchor.3.) the mmg is a support to a corp/alliance mining operations with several miners/haulers to participate in."
7/27/2009,"the name states pretty clear that it is ""mobile mining gun"", ie for the ore belt.also there is a cost factor, they will cost alot to run every hour. so having those guns on a gatecamp will cost alot. so if ccp would give you the chance to use in a gate camp. the question would then be for you. how much should that gatecamp cost you per hour?1misk ... 2misk ... 14000m isk?but that is only theoretical since the purpose of the guns is to be placed in a asteriod belt."
7/27/2009,"how sad that we don't want to be shoot at? with this guns there would be equal fights. but i guess that pirates don't like that. it is better for us miners to stay in high sec and mine there, and you get less target to shoot at.so for me, it is thumbs up all the way for this really good idea."
7/27/2009,sounds good to me cons but then tbh i think there needs to be something like a carrier thats crossed with a hulk (mines around the same as a hulk but has the use of fighters / drones like a carrier)might be something else to think about for none empire mining and being a capital ship it would take a fair few sp to be able to fly it unless your hulk pilot is also a carrier pilot helps if i put a thumbs up
7/27/2009,"how about, instead of a fuel cost, give it a time cost?instead of some artificially-imposed limit on how many you may have on a grid, and another artificially imposed limit on having to anchor within 'x' kilometres of an asteroid, how about making the guns asteroid-mounted, with the mounting process requiring a drilling and fixing procedure that takes 'x' minutes to secure the gun to the asteroid.this way you do away with some artificial reason why the guns can only be in belts and replace it with an expected reason, and the fact that drilling the host asteroid and mounting the guns (to replace anchoring) will take a significant portion of time means players will be less inclined to spam them.also perhaps an additional requirement that asteroids that have guns fitted cannot then be mined themselves (or perhaps if it is mined, the gun's fixings become unstable and the gun ceases to operate).i also think there should be some mechanism for incapping / forcing removal of guns once the belt has been vacated - perhaps that the battering of asteroid impact will destroy the guns after 'x' period of time, or maybe that they are not automatic but must be operated by players in a similar way to pos gunning - that way some poor guy entering an empty belt in which someone has previously fitted a gun will not be aggro'd by deserted equipment.just a few more ideas for the pot!nice idea - probably needs a bit of kinking out but you could be onto something!"
7/27/2009,"i love the idea, its great for stimulating the industrial side of 0.0 and via that, to drop the mineral prices in empire. this will be a benefit for all in the long run.but!!the guns must have a range that is good enough to hit a fleet of 10 to 15 sniper battleships and actually scare them. they must therefore also have enough hitpoints to be able to survive a at least a couple of volleys from 5 sniper battleships. you would be looking at something along the lines of 40k to 75k hitpoints. this is to let them actually be usable in fighting for a period of time and to give the miners the time to run away or do what miners do in 0.0.with a decent price tag and maybe some playing around with price tags, and ranges between guns it could be very interesting. espescially when you start incorprating remote repping from logistics and people nearby to help out it could be very interesting.it would also give a good base for other tower that would limit the use of hics/dics, remote rep tower, etc etc etc.but all in all, its pretty genius"
7/27/2009,"not supported. if mining ships were supposed to be able to hold off pvp ships (which they shouldn't, ships designed and fitted for pvp should beat ships designed and fitted for pve), they'd have spare slots and hardpoints for guns/missiles and a tank."
7/27/2009,"hac prices have steadly risen for certain hac's requiring ferogel and other t2 components over the last four-five months. hac's like the deimos which have always had cost-effectiveness issues are now rapidly becoming too expensive to fly in pvp capacities. 160 mil isk for a ship that is not remotely as good as a battleship for its dedicated role is simply too much money, and this is the same for many other ships in the hac category.i would like to see the prices of heavy assault cruisers and other t2 items/ships looked at and addressed to balance the cost/reward balance for hac's."
7/27/2009,dyspro moon owners are that way ->
7/27/2009,"""cost-effectiveness"" is a matter of self perception.i'm perfectly fine paying the current price of hacs.welcome to eve, where even the market is full of pvp, someone is beating you right now, cause they can afford what you cant. :)tl;dr= no"
7/27/2009,"and if i have my way depending on which regions you are in, they will peak at 200m...as stated before, go complain about the material spreads in t2 usage"
7/27/2009,"its not an issue of you being willing to pay that much. certainly there are some hac's that i would pay that much for, but at this point, there's nothing a hac can do that a rigged battleship couldn't do at the same price. or a rigged bc at the same price. hac's have always been the expensive rock stars of the pvp realm but at this point is out of hand. they need to be at least reviewed. i just think ccp should look at it is all."
7/27/2009,"if hac is to expensive, do like i do.fly dominix as pvp. that is so much better. cost only 50m + equipment, and they do tank much better.well that is my 5 cent in the matter.or even better. go out there and kill those dysp moons, and taken them and build ship from that :-d."
7/27/2009,"""certain hac's requiring ferrogel""? all hacs require ferrogel, and quite a lot of it. as for your broader point, it's supply and demand. if you don't want to pay it, don't. plenty of people are still willing to buy - the deimos isn't especially good, but 20+ still trade hands in the average day in forge, and that's essentially flat over the last year. seems like people don't mind paying 135m any more than they minded paying 75m."
7/27/2009,"not only do you obviously have trouble understanding economics, but you are forgetting the number 1 thing hac's have that battleships don't; mobility."
7/27/2009,"i can't give a thumbs up for this idea about ccp begins to fiddle with the economy.however, i give a thumb up to cthul that have understand that deimos and other hac is much more agile ships than battleships.is deimos worth 200m? well if you can kill other ships to a profit that is worth the (ships price + your equipment + rigg )times two (atleast). then they are worth it.however, if you fly out from the station and then die right on the outside. well i guess no ship is worth the isk and time spending on getting that ship.// belnevyn ""the untouchable"""

7/27/2009,"what's this ""inflation"" you speak of?"
7/27/2009,"i wish hacs could be cheaper.i don't grind missions all day. i don't have the rl money to pay for a second account to make isk for me. i don't buy illegal isk. all i do for the most part is pvp, and run some level iv missions every once in a while to earn some isk to buy more cruisers and t2 fittings. right now i have around 123 million isk, which might not even be enough to afford a single hac, regardless of the fittings. are you saying that because i don't have rl money, or the time to grind (and i believe eve is supposed to be the one game where you are not required to grind in order to advance), that i must be forced to fly t1 cruisers all the time?i support this."
7/27/2009,"please visit your user settings to re-enable images.once upon a time, in a galaxy far far away, in a game which people played due to the immense amount of awesome that was in store for a character, there was a great looking font. this font, which was displayed on the map, above your navbar during warping, docking and jumping operations, and in the market headers was perhaps the most beautiful font to be seen in all of eve.it jumped out of the screen like nothing else could. when that font showed up, with its beautiful sans, the wide tracking and the pleasant size, i felt as if i had become a part of a greg martin painting.there is power behind that font. ccp whacked it, and their reason was to enhance the game with unicode fonts. seriously, i'm not going to redo this again, but if the developers of a game are so lazy that they need to give us impact to replace a font that is graceful, flowing and wonderful then you need to ask the developers what's going on inside those heads of theirs.i posted it in a thread years ago, and i'll post it here: that font was the reason i started playing eve. i'm not kidding. when i saw it, i felt like every little detail mattered. clearly, the developers don't seem to agree with me any more. shortcuts, lack of finesse and destroying original game audio/visual elements over the period of years has caused me to think that ccp no longer truly cares about the material in their game, and just getting a buck.if you support this, you are supporting not just bringing back the original sans warp drive active font, but you are also making a statement that it's sometime the nuances of eve that make the game great. when you strip a game of the details here and there, you are taking away the game's personality. you know all those games you see that are rip-offs of wow? yeah, they beat around the bush and use shortcuts just to deliver a product, instead of a finished, detailed quality item. this is no different, only the competition is coming from this own game's past.i've sat on this for over three years. now is the time to fix it."
7/27/2009,bring back mah font.
7/27/2009,"replacing a custom game font with an unicode font is not done, ea learned that when they removed the uo font from the new client too."
7/27/2009,"i agree.i did have a huge rant written up, but i decided against posting it, since it was unduely harsh on ccp. however, ccp, if you have a clue you will just stop adding features and spend an entire patch on fixing bugs. devote 6 months, a year, hell even 2 years to it, but at the end make sure that every major bug is gone. people would much prefer playing a game which works, rather than a broken game where the devs keep adding more broken stuff."
7/27/2009,"too much mushy feelings and romanticism in the op.but, oh well, beautiful font make me tear up as well - bring the old fonts back dammit!"
7/27/2009,"nice font !! i like it.ccp, please"
7/27/2009,"agreed, please bring the font back ccp. otherwise, i may have to punch infants."

7/27/2009,classic
7/27/2009,"people actually like that font? crazy. the solution here is to let us customize, and release the old font for download. these weird folk who like it can have it, and the rest of us can use one that isn't ugly."
7/27/2009,the font was replaced with unicode so that they could translate the text into other languages...
7/27/2009,this is what we call a classy font.
7/27/2009,"surely there are serif unicode fonts that look similar to the old one.siigari and i discussed this font and although this is a minor issue, i agreed that the old warp drive active font had an almost powerful effect on new players that was lost when they switched to a sans-serif font with low kerning."
7/27/2009,that font looks cooler
7/27/2009,thumbs up!

7/27/2009,ccp needs to bring hull repair modules in line with the repair efficiency of their shield and armor counterparts. since the defensive value that a hull can have is a fixed absolute this should not at all unbalance things.simple fix. do it.
7/27/2009,"current situation: there is no direct way to inform other players in eve online that you may be afk or busy for the moment. unless you consider the option of denying all conversation requests but that doesn't give the other player any useful information concerning your status.this is compounded by the having the person in your addressbook which means the conversation is accepted automatically whether you'd like it to or not. and if you're afk they'll never know it and it could lead to a ""diplomatic incident"" (tm).proposed solution:add the ability for a player to voluntarily toggle themselves afk/busy/available. this could then be conveyed by way of an icon on your portrait within all channels (including local.) and if a person convos you it'll tell them if you're afk or busy especially if the conversation auto-accepts. should you be available then the system will act as it does now."
7/27/2009,"you should also have an icon appear above someones ship when they are typing, to avoid killing people when they arent giving combat their full attention. for honor."
7/27/2009,"this is one of those things that i hope winds up being supported when ccp overhauls all the social tools this winter. but yeah, bring it up - if this isn't being planned, it should be."
7/27/2009,"i don't like it working in all channels. we should have the option to choose which channels this functions for. for example, i may want my corp mates to know i'm afk, but i may not want local to know (especially in a hostile system)."
7/27/2009,"not a bad idea. while we're at it, why not just make it like other social networking websites- you can type in your own status message?"
7/27/2009,yes.

7/27/2009,"supported. don't think the status should show up in local, though."
7/27/2009,supported.

7/27/2009,"this is a good idea. if i'm afk and a friend convos me i don't want them thinking i'm ignoring them.so, it should pop up in the chatbox in a special font some special text that is user customizable.for example: ""i am afk."""
7/27/2009,such a quality post.supported
7/27/2009,"having it show an icon in chat channels (especially local) would make this worthless, no one would actually use it for its intended function, they'd just set themselves afk when they're really not and vice versa. being able to turn on a chat request autoreply when you're afk would be all right, but most people will get the hint anyway when you don't reply to their convo after a while; it's not like people aren't aware that most of the people logged into this game are usually afk."

7/27/2009,i rarely agreed more with the goons.

7/27/2009,"i was thinking the same thing. maybe they're bizarro world goons?anyway, i support this for all channels except local - i don't want people in local knowing if i'm afk or not"
7/27/2009,"i would really like to see the game implement a jabber backend so you can connect outside of the game as well. gmail and facebook both do this already, and its proven to be quite robust and scalable. this would chatting system and allow for statuses to be set and the like."
7/27/2009,"this will make it so no one ever logs in-- fair warning, but yes, a sweet idea.as far as the afk thing, i think it should be optional based on each channel you are in. because of the way local works in it's current implementation, your name there can mean a lot of things, and even used for misdirection. sitting cloaked afk in a hostile system 23/7 and only operating 1 hour a day allows people to hide when their operations are taking place. since this is more of a convenience thing, the option to hide it from local/spy-ridden channels should be available."
7/27/2009,"i have proposed this before, so obviously i'll support this with all my heart!this should be part of the upcoming cosmos project if it wasn't already planned. seeing the availability status of corp, alliance, and buddies (when the 2-way buddy system is implemented) is a must!"
7/27/2009,"i support the general idea. but i strongly oppose local chat indicators. local should not get any kind of boost. we should be preparing for the eventual local nerf, which would make this indicator obsolete."

7/27/2009,"sometimes, you want it to do this (i.e. when bumping a ship outside of pos shields). personally i don't have this problem. just learn how to properly time stopping your ship so you stop before colliding."
7/27/2009,"current situation: right now the logging of chat channels is ""all or nothing."" you're either logging every single thing or you're logging nothing at all. it isn't very flexible considering there are sometimes you want to have a channel while other times you'd rather not, especially local when you're in jita.proposed solution: add a toggle for each chat channel where you can enable or disable logging. it could be done the same way you turn channel blinking on and off."
7/27/2009,very much supported =]
7/27/2009,"perfectly reasonable. just make it so that i don't accidentally click the button too often - burying it in a settings menu might be preferable, as far as i'm concerned."
7/27/2009,waste of programing time. i would much rather them work on other things with their time instead of going this direction.thumbs down.
7/27/2009,"would be neat, and hate to agree with a tri, but there's better things ccp could do with their time.that being said, implementing this might be pretty quick (one file per chat channel, log each to its own if checked, doesn't seem too bad). so, if its a quick fix, go ahead, if not, work on a higher priority."
7/27/2009,shouldn't require too much effort to add.
7/27/2009,"current situation:the overview is normally a very helpful source of information in combat situations. unfortunately it doesn't offer enough when it comes to pos modules. there are only two ways to tell the status of a pos module, one is via the ui at the control tower. and the other is by selecting the modules in space with the overview. but wait! with the latter you must then hunt for the target bracket by spinning the camera around and then zooming in to see if it says: online, anchored, unanchored, or incapacitated. if the pos module is crowded among a bunch of others this makes things even more frustrating. add in the ability to turn off brackets and the fun (hahaha.. no...) spikes even more!yes, there is a third way which ties in with the second one and that is locking the module and seeing what the health is. this unfortunately is only useful in determining if it is incapacitated. and if you're a dreadnaught in siege you may have just wasted precious seconds locking on to an already incapacitated module. proposed solutions: add another column to the overview which shows the status of pos modules. or create a new set of filters associated with incapacitated, online, anchored, and unanchored. or create color tags/background within overview for showing the pos module's status.pros:anyone who has ever done a pos shoot will no doubt cry tears of joy with this change being added. carriers, motherships, and logistics pilots will be able to pick out which modules need repairing much more easily."
7/27/2009,agreein with dis.
7/27/2009,pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee add a column for this. god it would be so helpful.
7/27/2009,"all my 5s. in massive fleet fights, figuring out what's online, and what's incapacitated is a pain at best, and absolutely impossible at worst."

7/27/2009,for the love of god
7/27/2009,good idea
7/27/2009,"this would make it even easier(too easy) for sniper fleets to ""incap"" defensive clusters on a pos. currently you need to at least either get within 100km to look at the pos modules or have a cloaky scout relay targets.while i agree the current methods of trying to figure which pos module has which status is a pita. i think allowing anyone looking at their overview from any range what so ever(as long as they are on grid) is to excesive a swing in the other direction.tl;dr = no"
7/27/2009,"please add this, pos shoots are bad enough as it is."
7/27/2009,"if there is a 100 man sniper fleet sitting at 160km from the tower, and they can't see the modules statuses, it's not going to change the fact that all the important modules are going to be incapped in 10 minutes.if you want a compromise, how about you can see the status if the module is within the targeting range of the ship you are currently piloting. all this does, in essence, is saves the ctrl-click. it still preserves the ""no 400km scout"" from your idea, but also makes it suck less to shoot a pos."
7/27/2009,yes indeed! that would be nice
7/27/2009,"yeah, 100%.i had an idea originally for agents to move you to new agents in different systems as you complete missions so mission running wasn't so static.this pretty much falls in-line with my ideas, so supported."
7/27/2009,totally acceptable change for the prophecy. i personally feel the harbinger is fine as it closely mimics the geddon. the prophecy just mimics that gift you get from aunt clair every christmas that was more appropriate for girl who was perpetually 12.
7/27/2009,"except when it's counterpart can tank nearly as well while adding considerably more offense. if the prophecy had more powergrid and/or capacitor to actually benefit from it's role bonus, this would be less of an issue. if every low and mid slot were dedicated to tank, a harbinger would actually provide a better buffer tanked ship than the prophecy due to powergrid alone.if both ships were to active tank, the harbinger would still outdamage considerably, still have nearly equal tank, and more capacitor to run that tank while having an extra mid slot to further bolster it's capacitor or add some sort of utility. not to mention a bigger drone bay and considerably more powergrid which will not all be consumed by that 1 extra turret and mid slot. so again, why use the prophecy in that scenario when it just get's out performed on so many levels. if it were to have a capacitor role bonus, or a range bonus or something extra to consider to mix with it's armor hardening, then yes maybe you could distinguish the ship's role. but currently, what it can do, the harbinger can do more of way better."
7/27/2009,"i agree the proph needs a boost. a larger drone bay/bandwith + a damage bonus/armor rep amount/armor amount (- cap bonus) would help.however, your tier debate is a bit tricky. its not as simple as they scale/dont scale. as a general rule, higher tiers are better and should be better than their lower tier counterparts, one main factor having to do with increased cost. why make them the about the same when the harbinger will become useless?all races have many different roles to play with but amarr. gallente gets blasters/rails/drones. caldari gets rails/missiles. minmatar get shield/armor and projectiles/missiles. amarr gets just lasors. all amarr ships are either heavy tank ships or heavy dps ships (cept apoc for snipingand arbitratorr for drones). making both the harbinger and the proph dps would be a mistake, the proph would just be a weaker version than the harb. however, adding to its tanking/buffer abilities would fit in nicely with the rest of the amarr line up (or go different with a drone boat like the arbitrator).a drone boat (large arbitrator) would be sexy."
7/27/2009,"teirs have never mattered when it comes to performance. people always make that mistake because they assume that a teir 3 has to be better than a teir 1. take the geddon as a prime example. it's a teir 1 battleship that does more damage, has more drone capacity and near equal tank to it's teir 2 counterpart. it also has better cap stability than it's teir 3 counterpart even though it concedes it's capacitor.take the vexor as a 2nd example. near equal speed, and tank as a thorax. yet the thorax does a completely different thing than the vexor. either ship is debatably better than the other and it really comes down to understanding their role, not their teir. same for the ferox vs drake, although there is some overlap which quite honestly their should not be with the shield hardening bonus.the prophecy's issue is that it does not have a defining role. to define it's role as a tank is not adequate because it does not fill that role well in any regard. you can get near equal performance from it's cruiser counterpart with a few various distinctions (extra fitting for plates vs lower sig and speed, etc). so why pay more for the battle cruiser class in this instance? if it's going to be the tank role, fine, but allow it to be by allowing to fulfill that need well. otherwise, change it.btw, agreeing requires ticking off the support box."
7/27/2009,"profecy is fine, leave it alone."
7/27/2009,thank you for yet again trying to snipe at one of my post without at all refuting with good evidence why i'm wrong. maybe if you'd actually back up your statement rather than just snipe i'd give a rat's ass what you felt.
7/27/2009,"let it go man, let it go.... it's just a game.i feel the ship is fine as is. i'm not sniping, and no, i don't have to convince you and give examples why it needs to be boosted. you started this thread so it is your responcibility on presenting things to convince us it needs to be changed.i am not convinced."
7/27/2009,"debate is a 2 sided affair.... you can't say it's fine without providing evidence in light of your argument. even if it's just a fit you think works, or build you might try, you have to provide something. i've provided a base argument. i cannot provide further argument without knowing what you're side of the coin is like. i cannot show you why your opinion is flawed without knowing what your opinion is. it's terribly easy to say it's fine as is, it's hard to back up why the ship is fine as is. for me to go out and try to counter every possible argument would make this thing unreadable and long winded. but if you provide me subset of every possible contingent, it's so much easier to prove to you why you're wrong and i'm right.thus far your ""it's fine"" remark has done nothing. i've shown why it get's out classed at any role it's assigned to thus making it obsolete. there is no reason to have redundancy in an class of ship as it just makes one ship worthless. you haven't even refuted what my op says. you haven't stated how it tanks better, or how it works better which is the point of the topic. without doing the above, you're sniping... you're taking me out without without providing me a chance to fight back... the definition of sniping. so either provide some proof as to why the prophecy is good or ""fine"", or gtfo. it's your sort of comment that makes this forum worthless."
7/27/2009,and then he wonders why nobody likes him.
7/27/2009,"do approve, the prophecy is laughable compared to even the ferox."
7/27/2009,i've flown both ships... i honestly can't see what the big deal is... one has defense and one has aggression emphasis.somehow i seriously doubt your that experienced.not to mention your obvious ego issue.
7/27/2009,just here to reiterate that dps is the only thing that matters.
7/27/2009,"i think the numbers above speak for the lack of defensive advantage of the prophecy all things considered. i'm actually very experienced with both ships, which is maybe why i can see clearly and formulate more of an arguement than a it's ""good, trust me.""you look at any of the other tiers of ships that mimic what the prophecy's role is:punisher - highest powergrid of the frigates, considerable capacitor in it's class, most low slots, highest armor.maller - highest powergrid of the cruisers, considerable capacitor, most low slots. most armor baseabbadon - highest powergrid, considerable capacitor, 1 less low slot than the most of it's class, but a gain of nearly 2100 armor and a mid slot.prophecy - 14% less powergrid than it's class alternative, nearly 600 less base armor. equal low slots, a loss of 300 base capacitor with equal recharge time and 1 less low/mid combo to help gain capacitor. even though with max skills the ship can get 25% more ehp, it's already yielded 12% of it's armor hp back because of the higher base on the harbinger. to active tank, the ship is already conceding 1 mid which aids capacitor. it's also yielding some power grid, some base armor and a huge damage fall off for this slightly better tank. it's nearly impossible to argue price point on any t1 ship because after insurance, it's nearly negated... i believe it's about 2 mil difference in the end. to choose either tank on the ship severely cripples it's performance at any other task, where as it's alternative can nearly match it's tanking capability while still performing the role damage boat, drone boat, range platform, mid slot utility, and capacitor beast better (i'm sure i left some out).there are my facts, where are yours? not one person has even offered up a viable tank solution to compare this ship to it's couterpart because quite simply, it's does not hold water."
7/27/2009,"the dear old prophecy is fine, leave it be."
7/27/2009,"for god's sake, just implement the damn update already! the point the op made was ccp already said they'd fix this (whether the whining gankers like it or not) so they should just stop procrastinating and do it!"
7/27/2009,"i love that word and indeed, just implement it ccp. you said it would be dealt with soon, now keep your promise."
7/27/2009,"not supported at all, in any way. no."
7/27/2009,"last year, there was an amazing in-game event: malkalen. no, not the malkalen incident, which was little more than pretty footage. no, i mean the malkalen relief effort. in the wake of the malkalen incident there was a major capsuleer effort to supply the rescue effort. it was as simple as putting up npc buy and sell orders for trade goods, and posting a few news articles, but it created a powerful story that any pod pilot could take part in - and many did, both altruists and opportunists. it was a brilliant use of existing mechanics to breathe life into the news.by contrast consider the recent turnover of halmah, a fw system taken from the amarr by the tlf. there was a post up on the official forums about the capture shortly afterwards, in which the minmatar forces claimed to be freeing all the slaves, followed immediately by an amarrian response that said no way. and sadly, that's true. ccp has posted through prior scope new articles and in today's chronicle that there are social and economic repercussions for system occupancy. as pilots we can make claims about those repercussions, but nothing we say or do makes a real difference.ccp could change that, and it need not require the development of a major new game mechanic. i would like to suggest that ccp takes the malkalen relief effort as a model for adding in-game economic consequences and stories to fw. for the amarr/minmatar conflict it would be as simple as posting a few million ""slave""/""freed slave"" trade good units on the market in a system after a capture and posting a scope story about the turnover. ""24ic takes auga, slavers descend on the new bounty"" or ""tlf captures halmah, transport industry struggles to move the millions freed before an amarrian counteroffensive"". something similar could be done on the caldari/gallente side with confiscated trade or industrial goods.appropriate buy orders could be placed elsewhere in the relevant empire space, allowing pilots to resell these resources and recoup their investment (a pure sale in the case of slaves and confiscated goods, or as proxy for the ""subsidized transport fee"" for freed slaves in the republic). it does not need to provide a profit (although that might be worth considering), as many pilots would take part just for personal reasons. since these systems are low-sec, it will also encourage the faction that lost occupancy to stick around and disrupt trade runs, and give pirates an incentive to involve themselves in the inevitable ""real"" chaos that would come with a change in administration.this change would allow dedicated players and corporations to have a ""factual"" impact on the socio-economic outcome of fw actions without requiring significant development or having an unbalancing effect on the player goods market, and notable successes (or failures) would be good subjects for later news stories, getting players more interested in the current state of fw.[edited for grammar.]"
7/27/2009,"i kinda like this idea. supported, at least in principle."
7/27/2009,i support this idea fully. whilst it will have little impact on the lives of many pod pilots in eve it will also require almost no effort to implement. for those who do roleplay surrounding faction warfare i think it would be finally something that could be done which could been seen as a pure rp effort in secondary support of fw.
7/27/2009,"jade constantine brought something similar up a long time ago.that said, supported, but keep in mind that it shouldn't be a ""winner takes all"" situation where people will leave the losing side just because the winning side takes all rewards, which basically grinds the whole conflict to a halt just like what happened on the gallente/caldari side."
7/27/2009,"if there were an in-game consequence to system occupancy, it might help get people to sit there for hours doing the plexes."
7/27/2009,"why do mission runners deserve more protection than miners or ratters who choose to go to low sec solo ?if you played wow on a pvp server , would you complain that people keep killing you will you try to mine / fish whatever ?keep in mind that low sec is the equivelent in the eve universe of a pvp server.high sec is the equivelent in the eve universe of a pve server, if you want to avoid pvp use high sec."

7/27/2009,"current situation:anytime you jump through a gate, through a jump bridge, relog, or do anything else that is considered a ""session change"" the client forgets any passwords you have entered for your ship. this is especially frustrating when using ""jump bridges"" on friendly pos that don't belong to your corporation. each time you use a bridge the password must be re-entered. the same could be said for friendly pos shields which require a password as it can only be typed in after you've entered the solar system. proposed solution: i propose that ccp look into adding the function of eve client remembering passwords between session changes. pro:it will cut down on the additional effort of re-entering password if you're going through multiple jump bridges or if you have to leave a system and return."
7/27/2009,yes please
7/27/2009,"yes, i always forget to paste in the stupid password."
7/27/2009,o/
7/27/2009,please do this jesus christ.
7/27/2009,yup. maybe some sort of savable password list would be nice too.
7/27/2009,please
7/27/2009,"there is no reason not to do this. please change it, ccp."
7/27/2009,absolutely! annoying to no end.
7/27/2009,can we get ccp to let our ships remember that we enabled fleet member useage of hanger and maintenance arrays on carriers too while were at it? thats just as annoying.
7/27/2009,i concur
7/27/2009,do it
7/27/2009,yes 110% agree!
7/27/2009,eve needs cookies!
7/27/2009,1
7/27/2009,this was just about fist-through-monitor frustrating when i was checking out password mechanics on sisi. i cannot imagine doing it for real. supporting this wholeheartedly.
7/27/2009,yes please
7/27/2009,"definitely, this is another of the many things ccp should have done in the first place."
7/27/2009,i like cookies!supporting cookies for eve!
7/27/2009,also i feel it will be beneficial to let all the alliance through a jump bridge without needing to enter a password each trip.
7/27/2009,i want it can i have it? please?!?
7/27/2009,"so i was moving through highsec with my alt the other day to grab some ammo so i could continue my merciless quest to kill the ebil carebears that invade my beautiful home of egg - and by instinct, i hit the directional scanner scan button. to my horror, i saw the following: 2 fleet pests, 3 navy ravens, 1 nightmare, 1 mach, 4 mega navys - and other assorted hulks, orcas, retrievers, and lesser bss. and as i sit there, pouring saliva all over my keyboard, i remembered it was highsec.nooooooooo. this ebilness of the carebears should not and could not be allowed... all of them, like the malicious little midget albino guineapigs that they are, scheming us hardworking pirates of our isk by staying in highsec under the defense of the corrupt concord.and so i suggest - those ebil bastards give us hardship all year long, tempeting us with their faction fitted faction ships and yet never risking anything - so forget the risk/reward situation, forget about balance, forget any stupid idea other than this stupid one - lets have one day in the year where concord and the faction police go ""afk"" (grab donuts and coffee?) and highsec becomes a no man land, where people can gank anyone and anything - 24 hours of complete and utter mayhem, of ransoms and faction ships exploding and of carebears tears. lowsec people always get the rough end of the stick, so let us have 1 day in which all our dreams and hallucination come true.having said that, i doubt this will ever really happen, but a pirate can dream, cant he?"
7/27/2009,"supporting my own idea, cause im cool like that."
7/27/2009,there are quite large areas where you can shoot to kill every day of the year (except for patch day's and such).it is every system with a 0.0 to 0.4 sec rating.maybe that is new to you
7/27/2009,"another of the threads ""i want to gank stupid people in highsec"".if you want to gank them there live with the risk of loosing your ship to concord.if you dont want to loose yours. then gank the people in lowsec and 0.0.not supported. balance is fine as is."
7/27/2009,"yeah, but thing is they only fight people who want to fight. they want to fight the helpless players with impossible forces. because that's the cool thing to do. hey man, i'm all for pvp, i love pvp'ers because well, people buy my stuff because the last item they bought from me got blown up by a pvp'er. so pvp'ers are essential for me to make isk.but what your asking for is just stupid. grow a pair, and go hunt down targets in low-sec or 0.0. i'm sorry low-sec is near empty, but perhaps instantly blowing everything out of the sky with impossible odds everytime a player jumps into low-sec isn't the best way to encourage more players to go into low sec."
7/27/2009,"would be awsome to have a highsec free for all day!sadly, those marauders and faction bs's will be all docked up and the pilots will be sitting in a bar. or perhaps the pilots will be sitting and smacktalking in local about how unhappy they are about not being able to do missions."
7/27/2009,umm....no.

7/27/2009,"supporting despite the use of ""ebil"" in op. random senseless ganking is fun."
7/27/2009,no can do...there are enough stupid people venturing into low sec and 0.0 space. go kill all of them first before you start looking for highsec targets
7/27/2009,"yeah, actually thats probably what would happen. everybody would take a break from eve. since it would be announced.the only players that might actually play would be new players that happen to be joining eve for the first time, only to get insta-wtfpwned when they undock.great way to introduce players into the game.welcome to stations online."

7/27/2009,someone needs a hug.
7/27/2009,"this is kind of a little known thing, or atleast it seems to be, but tracking disruptors are overpowered for use on unbonused ships, right now there is nothing wrong with what a bonused ship does to a turret cruisers dps. the problem is that any ship with a spare midslot can fit a td and really open up engagement options for itself.thought it was hard to hit a af before? wait till those jag pilots start fitting a td in one of those midslots and pwn just about any turret cruiser.the myrmidon flies exactly like a bigger arbitrator if you put some td's on it. domnixes are pretty good as well.next time you want to fly a frigate sized vessel and you have a spare midslot throw a td in there, a single unbonused td effectly adds 40% more speed to your ship as far as damage negation goes.anyways, i think i outlined the problem enough, my suggested fix is a nerf to there effectiveness in general and a increase in the bonuses on td bonused ships. now i don't want them to be absolutely worthless on a unbonused ship, just not quite so awesome."
7/27/2009,"remember, td still do nothing to missile ships."
7/27/2009,"right cause fully what, 1/6th the ships you encounter maybe are missile ships, in any small gang scenario you will have multiple viable turret ships with which to use your td on."
7/27/2009,"if they were actually overpowered, it wouldn't be little-known. mid slots are scarce - how many ships think a td is better than a mwd, or a point, or a cap booster? besides, they ought to be usable - i want ships to at least consider using spare mids for ew in normal circumstances, and i mean all types of ew. ""nah, you don't need a sensor booster, throw a painter on instead"" should be something that gets said more often. td aren't generally as good as ecm, but they're probably the closest, and their power level is fine. the problem isn't with td, it's with tp and sd."
7/27/2009,not supported. tracking disruptors are fine. they can be countered with maneuvering your ship.
7/27/2009,"so how does it figure this out - if you warp to one bookmark and fly to another, which does it display? maybe have bookmarks included in the ""nearest"" options, or something?"
7/27/2009,"like when u r jumping, it shows current location and destination"
7/27/2009,"when warping, you mean? it already does that. what exactly do you want?"
7/27/2009,"you can always press f10 to show the solar system map, and hover your mouse on the closest pin icon to see which bookmark you're closest to.otherwise, just pay attention when you warp. if you warp to a bookmark, the ""warping to"" text will show the name of the bookmark."
7/27/2009,this.if you want a nice looking covops to die in get an anathema.
7/27/2009,"fail logic. i could just as easily say that the other model was always the t2 astrometrics ship for gallente, so why change it? change the t1 (t1 meaning worse, worthless t1 frigates, less important than t2) counterpart to match the more important t2 model. they switched the wrong one if you ask me."

7/27/2009,"so you're suggesting that there's a valid reason to be looking at a covops model? you should either be cloaked, have a scanning screen open, or both. if you don't, then you're doing it wrong. seriously, on what basis do you suggest that a guy whose career is literally telling people how to play the game better that he doesn't know how to play?"
7/27/2009,"is this thread titled ""how do i fly a covertops correctly""?"
7/27/2009,"you are so right! why would i look at my ship anyways? they obviously don't want me to look at my ship because they have the first person view featu.....oh**** there is no first person... i can still see my ship when i'm cloaked thank you very much. if you couldn't see your ship at all it would be extremely difficult to see what you were doing.just because he's in that position doesn't mean he represents the majority of eve's players and their ideas. i for one didn't vote for him. think of corrupt politicians. it happens.edit: do csm delegates even get paid?edit2: they don't!! why does he have the authority to tell me how to play my game and which ship model i should use, then?"
7/27/2009,"lol, leave it to someone in eve university to ""get it"".besides, i can't cloak my ship while docked.the original maulus hull has sort of a bug shape to it which is almost attributed as ""cute"". the imicus is definitely not cute and because of this, we wish to have a cute ship which we fly a lot.what's the ratio of helios to keres you see flying about? i'm not one for making statistics on-the-fly, but i'm almost certain there are a lot more covert ops than electronic attack frigs.so. how about you change your position? vanity has everything to do with eve."
7/27/2009,"no - if you'd just asked that, this thread would have been over a week ago, and with much the same result. indeed."
7/27/2009,"i'll tell ya what hershey...if you don't have any constructive comments, then save the killmail epeen bullshit for your corp/alliance forums.siigari got my point precisely, as have several others that have contributed to this thread.the imicus is an ugly ship.the maulus has a useless role.and yet someone at ccp made the call to switch the t2 models instead of the t1 models, thus retiring a pleasing model and forcing everyone who used to fly a helios to retrain for something else.if it was so simple for them to swap models, then they can do it again... and get it right instead this time.also...csm aren't career gamers. they aren't even ccp employees. they are volunteers who got picked to voice our opinions to devs, because ccp is too lazy to respond to customers themselves."
7/27/2009,"wasn't intended as epeen, just as comedy - i never said i could do any better. and seriously, anyone flying t3 in march obviously cares more about doing things in style than they do about doing things effectively. it's fine if you want to play that way, but you're in the minority if you do. i wasn't referring to his csm tenure, or his rl career. dv is director of training for eve university. when he says someone is doing something wrong, i'm inclined to agree with him."
7/27/2009,"idk if i'm correct in saying this, but all i've heard that eve university can do is blob with frigates and an occasional cruiser. tbh that takes no skill. how much training skill does it take to train somebody to do that?"
7/27/2009,"""man, all those big alliances do is shoot their enemies. it doesn't take skill to do that, any monkey can click and f1-f8"". statements like ""they just blob"" says nothing about their skill level - do they blob well, or badly? do they win fights, or lose them? i've never flown beside them or been a part of them, but i know that they're a corp that people get pointed towards to learn how to play well, and that they're a corp that advertises the presence of gobs of newbies and isn't plowed under by wardecs 23/7. their killboard shows 47% efficiency, which isn't bad at all for a corp with their demographics. from what i can tell from back here, i'd have to say that they're pretty good."
7/27/2009,"the fact that such sets and drugs don't exist? there's a 5% shield hp hardwire, and that's it. actives, on the other hand, can get gargantuan drug and implant bonuses - something like +92% tank if you use strong blue pill and a full high-grade crystal set.edit: typo. originally said 62%, meant to say 92%. stupid numpad..."
7/27/2009,this.
7/27/2009,"i'm not sure what a huge isk investment has to do with an underpowered ship. a huge isk investment is a great boost to any ship. it will not change the fact that the ship in question lacks any real muster compared to alternatives. the standard t2 fit is extraordinarily lacking no matter what combo of gear you try on this ship. can the ship perform well in isolated instances, yes absolutely. can alternatives perform considerably better in those same instances, absolutely. it not really filling a role if there are already better options for the same role out there. so the better idea would be to change it's role to something more unique within it's race/class.bare in mind, one of the options i've offered up is to give it more ability to define it's role as a shield tanker w/o changing it's offense. i'd be very happy with this choice if it came down to that. right now, w/o ridiculous implants or boosters, a normal tank i can come up with can be overcome by a large portion of t1 cruisers. and on top of that, it will cap out very fast or have to sacrifice some of it's ability to active tank for an injector slot. and even still, with an injector, it's not buying a large amount of time additionally. add to that the problem that in order to get it's best tank, it's uses up 80% of it's cpu, 35% of it's power grid, and cannot fit an mwd because it is dedicating those slots to tank. so it becomes an immobile, sorta ok tank with no ability to fit any armament and extra-ordinarily in efficient capacitor. how is that in any way shape or form acceptable compared to what almost any other bc class ship can do?what's even more amazing is that it can passive recharge for considerably more cap stability and less fitting requirements while adding double the amount of ehp at about half the recharge of the best but shortest lived burst tank. how does a shield boost bonus make sense with the ships current stats if a passive tank with no bonus from the ship negates every intention of an active tank on this ship in the first place. ==================================================================for the record, best burst tank i can get is about 1122 with max skills every 3s. with a med injector and 800s plugged in, it can sustain that tank for 45 seconds with 6360ish shields as a start point. assuming even damage distribution and it's tank lasting exactly 45 seconds at which time it caps out assuming no reload on the injector it will have gained approximately 16,830 shields for a total of 23,190 shields. best possible scenario for the best burst tank.for a passive tank with the same shield hardening, the same ship can get 162.5 shields recharge per second with a starting shield of 15,338. 162.5shield/s*45s= 7,312.5 for a total of 22,650 while still retaining it's ability to recharge at max capacity at the end of that 45 seconds and with nearly 100 more cpu and 400 more powergrid to use. it also does this by completely bypassing one of the ship's bonuses which is specifically geared towards shield tanking. will expensive implants and/or expensive drugs change that argument slightly, yes. but for the common man, no. and no drug will change fitting requirements"
7/27/2009,"...cont.you could also swap the ability for it's shields to recharge quiet as fast passively with more buffer by swapping out purger rigs for extender rigs. in this scenario the ship will start with 23,326 shields and yet again, the same shield hardening. additionally, it will gain 126.5 shields per second at peak. this means best case scenario in 45 seconds of time it will gain an additional 5,692 shields for a total of 29,018 shields while retaining it's capacitor, and approximately 400 extra powergrid, 100 extra cpu.in both passive shield recharge scenarios, i will concede that part of it's recharge will be lost as it will not always regain it's optimal amount per second. yet in both scenarios, even if you were to remove 2000 shields from the recharge (which is high), it still retains capacitor, it still retains it's ability to recharge after 45 seconds at max potential for whatever remaining shields are left and has the allure of much more usable fittings. not to mention that it's recharge ability in 45s is already outdone by it's raw hp by an amount of 2-4.5 to 1 ratio. if you were to dedicate just one mid slot to anything other than active tank, this difference becomes even more glaringly problematic. so why should a ship that get's no bonus to buffer tank either equal or outperform a burst tank in every way from a ship that gets a 37.5% boost to a burst tank if.... and only if.... you have maxed skills with the ship itself.and finally, if you were to task any of these 3 ships with a tank that lasted less than 45 seconds, the burst tank suffers more by comparison with every removed second."
7/27/2009,"fit close range, put in nos in the missile hardpoints, when the rig changes come out, fit a set of capacitor rigs.but seriously you haven't given me a reason why we can't just increase the bonus to 10%/lvl"
7/27/2009,"which would be a boost (i.e. the topic), and yet another of the many options to suggest along with any of the other options i provided initially. hence you would support the idea of this post which would be reason to click that little box and not sound like you're against me."
7/27/2009,"well truth be told/signedbut only if it increases one of its bonuses or stats, not to make it a different ship.i like the tanking bonus and rof bonus, just needs more of something. cap? shield hp? bonus %velocity increase would be another good thing, make it faster than the cane by 30m/s"

7/27/2009,"doesn't. i was just trying to address nian's ignorant comment. as for the rest of your post, i'm not sure you quite understand how passive shield tanking works. you don't just sit on your peak recharge all the time - you only get that at a very specific point. if your enemies are kind enough to be doing low dps forever, yes, passive tanks are great(which is why missioners love them so much). in any sort of real pvp, passive tanks are awful - they take up too many slots to counter a damage profile that doesn't come up very often. also, did you include the fact that an active tank fits 3 gyrostabs and a dcu in the lows instead of 4 sprs? i hear that has an effect on the ship's performance. i'm not trying to defend the status-quo cyclone here - it's a pretty bad ship, and is in serious need of more mid/low slots and/or an unsplit weapon setup. i tend to be a bit dismissive of csm doing balance work, because it's sort of a bottomless pit, but this is one of the better targets for a balance thread. i just don't like to see stupid arguments being left unchallenged."
7/27/2009,"well ofcourse sir, gyrostabs and sprs have an effect on the ship. only drakes would fit sprs in lows if pvp. and no drake pilots do that since it tend to ruing the purpose of the ship - damage.as for the cyclone, it's a minmatar ship (and it's really fast accually), so it would be stupid to use sprs; they ruin your capacitor. with 4x sprs in lows you can not even tackle. usually in pvp, like gank canes and such, the shield is just a small buffer. not a passive tank. buffer is not passive.passive is not buffer. see my point here? back to cyclone being minmatar = capacitor already suck. so having the ship shieldtanked, either it can't tackle. or you're just wasting capacitor. so throw on a couple of lse 2's and dictate range.the thing here is, that cane does this alot better than the cyclone. the cane accually outperforms the cyclone in both active and buffer tanking + dps.therefore giving the cyclone a boost can be a good thing to do. it's stupid having a shipclass and rendering it ""really bad"" since the tier 2 is much much better. and in the eve climate of today, neither local tank nor passive tank are prefered. buffer and/or rr is the most used pvp tanking method if you're in a gang. the cyclone is a weak gang ship to. it can fit an active tank \o/... and nothing more. the hurricane out performs it in gangs and solo. since the hurricane can tank, tackle and kill at the same time. cyclone - pick two, dps, tackle and tank. hurricane - pick three, dps, tackle and tank.see my point again?"
7/27/2009,"cyclone is a great ship, head to the my eve section and watch some videos of it taking down multiple tier 2 bcs. you don't need the implants and boosters, but if you do have them its a terrifying ship.what people don't seem to realize is that it requires excellent skills to really shine."
7/27/2009,"actually, if you choose to do 3 gyro's in the lows of an active tank, it cant even last 45 seconds. i went with an active tank and a dcu2 with 3 power diagnostics to both boost capacitor, and boost max shields/shield recharge... hence the best possible active tank comment. furthermore i pointed how how crippling on fittings the best possible tank is, thus limiting the ability to fit guns, launchers, or other high slot mods in the first place. the only way to point out flaws is at the extremes because middle ground has way to many variables. we'd argue forever on middle ground with an infinite set of possibilitiesi also conceded how active vs passive tanks work, but explained how the recharge factor of a passive tank is only about 20-40% of it's total tank over equal time. buffer/passive tanks gain the advantage of requiring 0 time to already have a significant tank advantage over active tanks. active tanks require more time to equalize the field and eventually overcome buffer/passive tanks. so the real argument is, less time benefits buffer/passive tanks more than actives. the exact opposite of what you argue. i would encourage you to go review the numbers game i posted more closely to see exactly how that argument plays out."
7/27/2009,"i've broken a golem in a sacrilege, a faction navy raven in an absolution, seen a carrier broken by a 3 hacs, and a million other impossible things. doesn't make it amazing, it just concedes that some situations are dictated by luck, others by stupidity.you ever seen a magician on the street doing card tricks on tv. believe it or not, they don't work all the time, the camera just shows the times that it does."
7/27/2009,"5 x auto's , nos/neutsmwd,injector,large sb,scram,invulngyro's and speed modscheap shield resists rigs in rig slots if you want.the cyclone is an excelent skirmish warfare bc.if you read the description of this ship, thats exactly what its supposed to be.not the easiest ship to fly, not one for noobs, but in the hands of a skilled pilot this is not a ship to be underestimated."
7/27/2009,"looking at yaay's fit for the passive tank, it seems he's using 3 lse, 2 invuln, dcu, 3 spr, and 3 purger. it's a drake-like passive fit in order to get the numbers he refers to, and even then, it only works that way at peak. if that tank breaks, the pilot is totally screwed, whereas the active pilot can still tank even if he's dying(and maybe live long enough to kill the attacker because of it). i have difficulty believing that someone with as much pvp experience as yaay did something as laughable as putting together a passive shield tank for a cyclone with a dcu in it, and then claimed that proved his point. that's the sort of lolfit i expect from someone whose idea of the perfect ship is a nighthawk with t2 purgers, not form someone who was a long-time fc for a serious alliance. if he was talking about a buffer, fine, great - perfectly reasonable fit. but his fit had sprs and purgers in it. here's the rough numbers, assuming fits that don't totally suck. a decent buffer tank(i'm not going to discuss the passive further, it's a lolfit) without rigs gets 66k ehp. the similar active fit with a cap booster gets 36k, and reps 723 dps. the active tank is better after 41 seconds of combat. if you rig them up, it becomes 90k and 1153 dps, which means the active is better after 47 seconds. if you factor in capacitor, you change the rigs slightly, and the turnover is instead 55 seconds. if you add 3 pdu to each fit, for the biggest tank possible, turnover is at 63 seconds. this is ignoring shield recharge in all cases, because it's unlikely to be relevant. those turnover times are decent for the active tank in some roles, especially at the lower-cost end of things, though in no case are they great. they become quite nice if you crystal up, of course - the last example has turnover at 36 seconds with a high-grade crystal set in, or 30 seconds with a strong blue pill as well(even assuming maximal penalties). those numbers look a whole lot better, though they of course can't be taken too heavily into account given their cost. there's also more room to throw faction gear at an active fit, which again makes it better in the case of someone who has far too much money. for most roles in pvp, the buffer tank is better, though that is of course true for most ships. it's often true even for the ships with an active tank bonus, which is really kind of a shame. a cap buff might make the active tank option work better, or even a shield hp nerf, though that'd have to be accompanied by a corresponding buff somewhere else. still, i don't think any of those numbers i gave are especially unreasonable. the tanking mix on the ship has been pushed towards active about as hard as any can reasonably go, i think. as for my comment about passive tanks, they tend to be well-liked because they're an easy way to get a high sustained tank - on most ships, higher than the sustained active tank. it's not really relevant for the cyclone, because the passive sustained is about the same as the active sustained, but i was speaking more generally about why passives get used."
7/27/2009,"i take offence to that, perhaps your own paradigm complex is blinding you.i am well aware of the cyclones immence capabilities for active shield tanking when fitted correctly and with an implant set + drugs.that however is a moot issue, as i said, there's nothing stopping other pilots using implant sets and drugs, it doesn't have to be tank related but they will still boost the effective of whatever ship they chose to use them with just as well as what you would choose for a cyclone.what baffles me is you didn't event considder the imbalance of resists vs repair bonuses.as i said, long ago a long lost but most informative thread took place that broke the bonuses down to effectiveness and it was concluded using math that to balance the two only needed the repair bonuses to be increases to 10%/lvl.let me tell you a truth, originally the repair bonuses were 5%/lvl just like the resist bonuses but ccp realized that it was well out of wack and to be cautious they increased the repair bonuses to modest 7.5%/lvl that we have now.given the changes to tanking style and the prevalence for ehp and rr tanks in pvp, it's time to rebalance all local repair bonuses to 10%/lvl so the ships with those bonuses are the choice in smaller engagements.also guys did you count the total slots of the cyclone compaired to the other tier1's? a while ago it was concluded that the cyclone was sub par so ccp gave it an extra medium slot.btw, i still believe the cyclone could do with a speed boost so it's the fastest battlecruiser."
7/27/2009,"you've managed to give the ship a setup most t1 cruisers can beat in dps or tank, and most certainly speed and agility, utility, as well as sig radius. about the only advantage it has over the rupture is raw ehp at the higher cost of more mods and more insurance. rupture can still do virtually everything that ship can for more dps and a different style of defense. the rupture can easily skirt it's gun tracking and range while dishing out more than enough dps to double it's tankable damage, while beating it's speed, and hanging outside it's nos/neut range. you're putting that ship in a situation where it's relying on it's contender to not be paying attention to range, or for a fight to start at 12km or less to even have a chance of being affective. almost all ratting, less not pvp setups can out tank it's damage, dish out considerably more damage than it's tank which will break the ship in time measured in seconds. i mean it's not even versitile in it's ability to have a decent tank, decent dps, and decent cap warfare, with decent speed. it's countered and beaten on virtually every front together. thus, it makes the alternatives in similar roles such as the hurricane far better solutions to that style of fighting.for the record, the hurricane can come up with virtually identical stats while dishing out more dps, and with a higher base ehp. the difference being that the hurricane can be far more useful in other capacities as well."
7/27/2009,"so much wrong stuff i dont know where to start.ok some t1 cruisers may be able to match its dps or tank, but not both at the same time and definatelly not with neuting ability as well.remember we are talking about skirmish warfare here so the cyclone is not sitting still it may be doing 1.5k to 2k m/s considerable reducing damage from missiles and somewhat from tracking depending on the exact situation.i would like to know the setup of this ruppy that can deal more damage while maintaining an orbit in point range of a ship doing 1.5km/sit would need 5 425mm a mwd and a med injector.that does not leave much fitting for plates / resists / gyro'sno the ruppy will not be able to skirt the cyclones tracking , it will have at best a marginal speed advantage meaning it will end up either pursueing the cyclone or running away with very little tracking to protect it, while the cyclone can repair its tank the ruppy cannot if plated/resist.the cyclone pilot abrubtly changing direction could also easily bring the ruppy into neut / scram range at which point it dies, or if the ruppy pilot is orbiting to far out he is gonna lose his point and let the cyclone escape. a lot of ratting setups dont fit injectors neut them and they are going down, the ship is not sitting tanking, it is using speed to its advantage to reduce damge taken, add in a 35% bonus to shield reps and its not such a wimp as you seem to think.as with all combat in eve though , you need to pick your targets and i was not trying to say this ship can go head to head with other bc's or bs, but flown with care it can usually get away from anything large enough to hurt it.there are ships out there that are better at dps/tank or cap warfare or are faster.what you have in the cyclone is a ship that can do all 4 things fairley well at the same time.cane is a nice ship for sure, though to do what you say it would need to be dual armor repped with no plates otherwise it would lack in agility to a clone2 slots for resists leaves 2 slots for speed / damge mods whereas the clone has 4, cane having 2 extra mids.it would be interesting to see a cane fit for this role for comparison."
7/27/2009,"if were talking about speed fitting a cyclone v's hurricane, back before the massive speed nerf another thread or two took place on speed fitting minnie bc's.after sitting down and working out the minimum fit for a speed fit bc, even with the 1 less mid+low slot count v's the hurricane, because the cyclone had a tanking bonus and 5 medium slots, the cyclone actually tanked better and kept the speed it required.the issue for a cane is, if you fit enough speed mod to make a speed ship, which i consider a minimum of 3, then you only have 3 left in low for a tank or gank. if you attempt to tank, you slow down as it would be armor hence a bad thing. so you can spend 3 slots on gyro's for the gank. after that you are left with your 4 medium slots, assuming you didn't tank with your lows, your going to have to put something tank based in your medium slots, perhaps an extender. if you do that your down to three slots, next is your mwd, so now you have two slots, a webber and a scram is the usual choice.after all this you have lots of dps, but your tank is crap, rigs could help but you would probably also want to get some ambits in for falloff. speed is as it should be.if you fit a cyclone however you know your dps isn't going to come close to a cane, you could spend 3 lows on gank but you only have 4 lows so after the 3 speed mods, you have one left, gyro ofcourse. next is your mediums, you could do the extended trick like the cane but you have an extra medium over it and a booster bonus, so you fit your lsbii, its cap hungry so you have a couple of choices, put in a cap booster or use your 3 utility highs for nos. i go the now route personally. maybe even 2x nos 1x neut, suck the enemy dry to keep your tank going and then neut them so they can't shoot at you (assuming hybrid or laser boat), then your mwd, a webber and a scram, leaves one slot. either an invii, sbaii, med cap booster..? up to you but what ever it is, i would go for something that helps my tank.in the end the cyclone has worse dps, but its utility is greater than the cane, oh and don't forget your larger drone bay. ewar drones?see what i mean? the cyclone has uses, you just have to work a little harder to figure those uses out.btw, as i suggested you all check the slot amount for each tier1 bc, i thought i should tell you them.high(turret:missile)/medium/lowprophecy- 7(6:1)/3/6 = 16ferox- 7(6:5)/5/4 = 16brutix- 7(7:0)/4/5 = 16cyclone- 8(5:3)/5/4 = 17so even ccp figured the cyclone was bad, several times and has buffed it even past the others.it was originally 8(5:3)/4/4."

7/28/2009,"supported!afs definitely deserve 4th bonuses! there's hardly any reason why they should not have it. some of the ships' bonuses need careful thinking though, one example being the harpy. if you want to boost it's sniping prowess with damage bonus, it will start to seriously melt faces with blasters too. tracking bonus will also make it an enyo with bigger buffer, shield regen and faster speed (should the enyo sport 400mm and even with 200mm harpy seems to have 1m/s faster speed with ab!). oh and it will also have a longer optimal range, meaning that with careful piloting you can keep the hit quality bonus of optimal range while enyo will drop to falloff.i like many of the ideas posted here except things that force the ships to specialize a lot, like bonuses to scrambler&disruptor range for the jaguar (i want to keep my acs!)in case you are not very interested about the jaguar/minmatar in general or the enyo, im afraid there's nothing else here for you to read. others, please continue as a jaguar pilot, id definitely want to see a tracking bonus. even though, as i use 125mm, my tracking tends to be pretty much just what's needed. when using orbit 500m with ab, the range tends to be around 1600-2000 meters and transversal around 0.4 and the 125mm's tracking is almost 0.5. but it would still help when dealing with the drone cruisers, making them atleast a little bit easier to tackle for a while untill help arrives.enyo definitely needs something too to make it something else than an assault ship for drone-challenged gallente pilots. do take into account though that the enyo's optimal+falloff is about the same as the jaguar's currently (both almost reaching to overloaded scrambler's range). what this means is that, should the falloff bonus be added, enyo would become a... hmm, a 'rather hard' opponent for the jaguar. as a user of an active tanked jaguar i feel that there might still be a chance to beat the enyo though, but im afraid almost everyone uses the 2xmse setup . jaguar can still outrun an afterburner enyo though and mwd+disruptor setup is quite hard to support with already heavily cap-dependant ship. (not that i have any field experience with enyo, other than a few fights against it).and please, please swap the bonuses between wolf and jaguar, or atleast give the jag falloff and let the wolf keep falloff bonus as well (sorry arty users, but i have my reasons that ill state next). as the thrasher's already an insanely effective small arty platfrom and optimal bonus is totally worthless with acs on the jaguar, there arent too many reasons for the optimal bonus on the jag in the first place. sure it can tank better than a destroyer with smaller sig radius against people shooting with bigger guns from far away. sure, it's faster (while still less agile!) than the thrasher. but what happens when you are caught by a fast close range tackler? you have a very expensive (for a frig) ship that deals a fraction of the destroyer's damage while tanking only a little bit better than said destroyer. what this means is that the arty jaguar is worse in just about everything except tanking sniper battleships and such. on top of that you have the lovely price difference that a thrasher and a jaguar have .currently it really feels like the jaguar is a t2 ship with only 2 bonuses which is ridiculous. thankfully though it's still quite awesome.sorry about the long post (im very enthusiastic about the jag )i hope atleast some of you had the endurance to read the whole wall of text."

7/28/2009,"the reason changing this mechanic would be a bad idea is because it would make it significantly harder to combat enemy fleets of a larger size, and make people less likely to fight at all- which is never a good thing. specifically, it will just mean that the bigger blob will be station camping the smaller group, and the smaller group will have no chance of breaking the camp until it breaks up itself. i'm not saying that a small gang should be able to go after a large fleet, however if the large fleet doesn't have their sh*t together and work as a team to keep their squishier ships alive, then hell yes, they deserve to die.on the other hand, your base argument is that remote rep is currently overpowered, which is a much more reasonable argument than the one that a major mechanic in eve should be changed because you lost a couple ships to be people who know what they're doing. should people agree with your argument, then you could argue that rr needs a nerf- which is again, a reasonable argument.the problem is the proposed solution- it just wouldn't help things. if you want to nerf remote rep, why not talk about a boost in fitting requirements? a nerf to range? or some similar rebalance.make a coherent argument as to why anything should be changed, and you'll find people are a lot more responsive. so far all i've heard is 'lol u pussies used neutral rr when we blobbed u on station and managed to kill a couple of us. clrly you fail at life, and we should change a major game mechanic 2 benefit mah griefin' alliance. also, b**ches aint sh*t.' am i missing any of your major points?"

7/28/2009,"so wait... are you wanting a change to this mechanic or not? please stick on topic as this is for either supporting the claim to give aggression to remote repairs or for looking at why it shouldn't. your post was just a plain bash against us. as said before, why should we shoot ourselves in the foot by not abusing a mechanic which everyone seems to abuse. and your great fleet set ups, would have had a remote rep or two, and so u could have abused the mechanic as well.pitboss is only one man, and atm in control of a corp with 166 members. he is not on all the time and therefore has no control over who does and doesn't use remote reps. that figure count is only for his corp, the alliance holds even more people which he is not in-charge with, so your asking a train to fly here... if someone does not want to loose a ship, then he will remote rep, and what really can he do about it?from my experience with bsg, in that fight i am guessing you either lost a ship, or something didnt go right for you. since the last ship u lost at jita, you took one hell of a rage, cause u engaged without confirmed support... and lost. tho to be fair, u did calm down after a while, and apologized, which is always good.please try to keep on topic. start a flame topic elsewhere and we shall have our monkeys get on the problem as soon as we teach them to read."
7/28/2009,"ok two things here.1. tfs wasnt using neutral remote reps and your in corp/alliance pilots already outnumbered us. that makes you as guilty of abusing the game mechanic as the next bloke.2. i pointed the above out as hypocrisy because it is, that wasnt an open license to personally attack me as a woman. that from pitboss just goes to show his general disrespect for women and his obvious issues regarding women in general. it had nothing whatsoever to do with the debate over neutral repping.the fact that pitboss and the privateer alt commenting below him needed to throw themselves in the gutter with personal attacks on an out of game level goes to show the type of mentality, immaturity and general lack of integrity privateer alliance is full of. as much as pitboss would like to think he is widely respected in this game and on the forums, i think he just pretty much lost respect with a great deal of people in one emo raging ""omg a woman has pee'd on my game experience and shown my alliance up for the hypocrites we really are"" statement."
7/28/2009,"you know i had to go and find what igs was... and i really dont see the resemblance between my comment of u attacking us and wizards and fairies... do u play the right game?well thats what theory's are there for, possibilities yet to be proved wrong.yes... we used 4 remote reps... so what is the problem. when we fight people use them on us, so we are allowed to use them on other people. and i thought u would have known, 0 casualties are better than 1+ so it was smart of them to ensure they had some back up.and no there is no lead by example, this is a game, if u lead by example, u only reduce the chance of you winning. the only way to get this changed if more and more people abuse this... then it will be changed. i ned to ask, is this like a subtle attempt at weakening our fleets? you cry because we use rr and then u hope for us to stop, which then, u bring in your own rr? theres an other theory u can 'blow out of the water'"
7/28/2009,"kailen- just post from pb :) unless you guys went to the same school of caps lock, it's pretty obvious that kailen's your alt :palso- any comments on my argument that this would kill the ability to fight against blobs?"
7/28/2009,"i am not a pb alt, and my caps were only to high light that this discussion is about the aggression countdown, not remote repairing itself.as to your thoughts on the blobs, i would say theres both a yes and no answer. not everyone wants to use remote reps, so i would say they would be limited in fleets, with only one or two people using them. so the smaller fleet needs to concentrate fire and use ecm to disrupt the larger fleets main dps'ers. but generally the larger fleet would win just due to superior numbers. the absence of the aggression countdown would greatly help the smaller fleet, but it is not fair from the larger fleets side. a 290k tanked ship with reps will survive for a good while before needing to re-dock. so while the larger fleet concentrates dps on that repper, it just re-docks, and repairs, only for them to have to do it again. and any good repper will have eccm. so its wasting a lot of the fighting time for the larger fleet, just for the smaller fleet to get some lucky kills, when the larger fleet has to concentrate on a heavily defended target.so yes, this nerf would cause people to become more inventive when it comes to dealing with larger blobs, but i dont think it would kill it off, it would just remove the easy way out. you still have ecm and other methods of disrupting larger fleets"
7/28/2009,"hey guys, lets keep on topic. thread cleaned of off-topic and trolling."
7/28/2009,"alright, so, if this is the only way 'small' fleets can kill 'large' blobs, maybe the issue isn't that this shouldn't be fixed, because it's obvious that it does.the fact of the matter is, a new way for small fleets to combat large fleets needs to be proposed.as i said before, you can't be neutral and help someone in a fight, that puts you on a side.irl, if someone were to bring painkillers to a fist fight, that person would become part of the fight.instead of all of this trolling and whining about people fixing an exploit that's 'the only way' for small blobs to beat big blobs, then the issue isn't that the exploit doesn't need to be fixed, something else needs to be done.exploits != tactics.it's like saying pre-nano nerf, using nanos was a tactic. no, it was an exploit that, if not taken advantage of, would've made your ship useless at the time."
7/28/2009,"to be honest, it's not hard to counter rr as is. hell- probably 10 of my last 15 kills have been people who brought it neutral remote reppers- and that's really not an exaggeration. as you said- the counters to rr are primarily dps and ecm- both of which are highly effective when used correctly. a lot of it is knowing your enemy- and in most cases, if you have a blob of gank ships, you should be able to outdps remote reps- unless the people you're fighting bring their own blob of logistics. hell- my most recent kill had 2 logistics alts repping him, and was tanked for gallente- and just 2 of us still managed to pop him before he could redock (not to mention, he had a pretty nasty active tank on the thing- probably around 900 dps tank without rr). it's possible- it just forces a bit more creativity in your fleet composition."
7/28/2009,"yes to both of the top two fights. when repping, it brings you into the fight and puts you on to a side. so let this continue, but give the reppers an aggression countdown, so they stay in the fight.i am perfectly fine with people repping, i just dont like reppers being able to instadock, repair and come out again in a matter of 30 seconds, while the main targets own tank has held and he can continue his repping work.thats what this topic is about, its not about criticizing [spelling?], or abusing the reppers for wanting to get into a fight, its about keeping them in the fight so they can pay for their decision, either with death or a pat on the back, depending on who wins"
7/28/2009,"exactly this.neutral means not picking sides.repping someone means picking that person's side.the only way at all to justify no aggression is if there was some super lame forced mechanic that split your rep to every ship in range, allowing the one without the neut repper on their side to just move in range to steal some of the rep... but how lame/unrealistic would /that/ be.current mechanic is illogical."
7/28/2009,"/facepalmand repping means the opposing force has the right to engage the repper.it means the repper is no longer neutral because he is red on your overview.however, the repper has not committed an aggressive act, therefore he is able to dock at will.you could always..... not fight on a station."
7/28/2009,"it is still, very much so, indirect aggression.you're helping someone else aggress a target better than they could without your help.just as everyone /against/ this proposal says, ""eve is a dangerous place. get over it..."" ... eve /is/ a dangerous place, that means it's dangerous for logistics aswell. for every action there is a consequence. so far logistics near stations don't have any real consequences, and are invulnerable to attack due to insta-docking for free. there is no reason being outside a station should be a 'safespot' for anyone.if you want safety, don't undock. camping the dock to help a buddy then docking once you take damage is an exploit, not a tactic."
7/28/2009,"1. does the combatant gain an advantage by having a neutral perform remote repping? i would say yes. the aggressor is being boosted and will be harder to kill.2. should the remote repper be considered a neutral once they start to support a ship that is actively engaged? i think it's safe to say that if you are an active participant then you are not neutral. 3. if you're an active participant and therefore no longer a neutral should there be a consequence? ccp you decide.somewhere in a war torn land (rl):enemy combatants are engaging one of my squads and intend to kill as many of my men as possible. out of the corner of my eye i see two adult males that appear to be resupplying class v (ammo) to the enemy. i call the squad leader that is closest to the suspected resupply effort and ask him to confirm what they are doing. he informs me that the men i've identified as conducting the resupply are in fact delivering ammo to the enemy soldiers. the men i've identified are not armed and have not engaged my soldiers, but since they are actively supporting enemy soldiers they are no longer neutral. for those that do not understand why i've declared them hostile: without ammo the enemy soldiers are no longer a threat, or not as much of a threat. by eliminating their source of ammo i can win the engagement or improve my chances of winning the engagement. killing the two males that are resupplying them with ammo seems to be a logical and acceptable course of action."
7/28/2009,"pitboss... sad man sad. i had told myself i couldn't be bothered to post in this crap... but i just can't help it.since you've been around so long (5+ years) you should remember when it was adapt or die... with the other alternative being stfu in eve.now it's the above 2 with an overwhelming addition of emo whine on the forums for change.a little back-story for those just joining:4-6 of us shut down the privateer alliance in jita for basically 2 weeks (honestly when you re-dec'd us for another week i almost pi$$ed myself laughing). you're rant is we had neutral rr and rr is overpowered etc. dude seriously if you can't figure out how to defeat 4-6 (generally less) of us with 1-2 rr guys helping... you're doing it wrong and need to emo rage quit now (can i have your stuffs and put it to proper use)rr isn't broken. anyone can do it. it's cheap, it's effective, it's about the only counter to blobs/huge station camps since nano and ecm took a hit. you shouldn't be rallying support to get rr changed you should be figuring out how a small group could put that much hurt on your alliance with so little effort.neutral rr is the same as a non-neutral rr. same rules etc, same limitations. only difference is that the 1st time or maybe 2 (if you're really not paying attention) you can suprise someone. pitboss... me doing 50+ kills in just those 2 weeks to your alliance isn't an rr's suprised us, it's a you fail. we had the same group the same guys etc... nothing changed. we fight against rr on a daily basis. it's simple to counter (if you know what you're doing) and i'd be glad to help you guys out with a remedial class on... watching who reps who, what they fit, what they use, and counter it. one size does not fit all and 1 tactic sure as h3ll doesn't always work (except rr against you guys apparently).let me give you a little taste of what will happen if they add an aggression counter to rr like you are whining about (since i doubt you've thought that far ahead). stabs pitboss... lotsa stabs. sit there rr, align out, warp. rinse and repeat (and no you guys don't use hic's for crap so don't even use that argument).. btw, you can warp out and back as fast or faster then docking and undocking @ jita 4-4... we've tested. you'll still fail, you'll still whine and all people will have to do is change a couple of mods and tactics a bit. tbh i could care less if you succeed in nerfing rr/adding an aggro timer since i'll just change what i do again.omg falcons are wtf pwn..., omg nano is wtf pwn, omg wtf rr is wtf pwn... whiners need to whine.. whining about a tactic because you are too dumb to counter it is sad. but it's the way eve is going. all hail the age of emo whiners expansion."
7/28/2009,"also clarification for rr etc in highsec:1. if you help a person in any way that is being attacked or at war you are automatically flagged to those people/corps?alliances.this can be rr (remote rep) energy transfer, tracking links, logi drones, sensor link's... anything that helps that ship. once that happens you are fair game to be shot and killed by anyone that was fighting the guy you helped (ie you are a valid target).being neutral only helps you as i said above the 1st or (if the privateers 2nd through 50th time) to suprise your enemy. all the same rules etc then apply.discuss"
7/28/2009,is it possible to get an update on this?thanks
7/28/2009,"it would be very cool to have something like that, but a barrage of them would be a little too crazy me thinks. also there is another problem. missiles of all kinds fire from only one point on your ship and hit only one point on their ship, so they follow one straight line when flying. if u wanted something like a barrage, then u would need to equipped 6 rocket launchers to a raven and fire them all, but ccp would need to have individual launcher points on each ship. the same as turrets, so when all are fired they leave the ship at different points, and they should hit different parts of the enemy ship. making barrages look cooler as 6 rockets (other another missile) are fired and follow different paths so u see the 6 travel and hit the targets ship."
7/28/2009,agreed. boost rockets so they are effective against frigates.
7/28/2009,let's keep this on the front page.
7/28/2009,well i miss this option under audio:
7/28/2009,signed- atm my option is no sound or be deafened by my shield booster
7/28/2009,yes. please express that we are not happy with the way the sounds got nerfed with apocrypha.
7/28/2009,fully support this proposal.audio is an integral part of any game's sense of immersion. these issues should be prioritised asap. i'm looking forward to that seamless experience that anyone would expect from such an awesome game.

7/28/2009,/signed
7/28/2009,i support this.
7/28/2009,npcs in general need a kick up the arse.
7/28/2009,supported - npcs are currently unbalanced a vigil shouldn't be able to speed tank every single amarr plex.
7/28/2009,i agree
7/28/2009,"oh hey i should read this forum more often. agreed, as to op's suggestion."
7/28/2009,agreed.
7/28/2009,"have to support this as the npcs in plexes do need an overhaul. the caldari ecm npcs are particularly noxious in a 'closed system' like fw where you have no choice as to which type of npc you face. it's one thing to face jamming npcs in venal when you are ratting, quite another when they are the enemy you must face in a given form of gameplay.the speed-tanking issue is also a problem. in my opinion, it's strongly related to the need to ensure that plexes that allow in larger classes should make the use of those larger classes strongly desirable.cosmo"
7/28/2009,"fair enough, you don't support it. but you're misrepresenting the concept quite a bit.first, the 'against' force can suffer faction hits if necessary. that's a balancing decision for ccp. i neither rule them out nor recommend them because i leave that to ccp to decide in terms of the weighting of it.second, the 'against' force can't just roam around the high-sec of the chosen enemy at will. the restriction on them is as much as is on the minmatar militia in the high-sec of the empire they have chosen to oppose. i say this clearly.this is not just a mass war declaration in disguise.further, the barriers to entry can be financial as well as standings if ccp deems it necessary. i don't rule it out or recommend it one way or the other. for reasons the same as i explain above. please don't interpret silence on a particular point as one thing or the other.now, others complain about 'neutrals' in fw. well, plenty of militia corps constantly complain about the issue but as long as standard war decs remain possible (and despite the complaints, they always will unless ccp want to totally break faith with the rest of the eve player base and insulate fw completely) it won't go away.some say that the element of the ally power not being hostile (ie. its forces not being war targets and its space being unrestricted by npcs, etc) is a problem.well, that can be looked at as a single element of the proposal by ccp in consideration of balance. there are pros and cons. the intention at root is to limit the scope of the 'against' declaration. it forces a third force to choose. if you allow the ally power to be effective both through npcs and its militia pilots then you also, i would submit, in all fairness have to allow the third force to be effective against its facilities (ie. plexes).the question there is whether that broad an 'against' entry is actually desirable. that means any balancing in terms of standings, isk commitment, declaration periods, cool-downs and so forth, that ccp introduce are fairly moot when it comes to the third force being able to rapidly switch its focus to operations against the other power. i do leave that up to ccp when it comes down to it but i think it removes some of the overall attractiveness of the concept in both design and rp terms.incidentally, a further point with regard to rodj's question as to why anyone would want to be in the militias with this option on the table. well, i did answer it and i think satisfactorily but ccp's latest proposals on rewards add to my answer even more so.third-forces (that is 'against' fw participants) would not be eligible for lps or other rewards that full militia members would be eligible for. an important element of making basic militia membership attractive while the 'against' option remains useful for mercenaries, freebooters, alliances, etc.incidentally, i do realise that a basic philsophical difference exists between me and those who think fw is merely transitional play and can't be an end in itself. in my view, that notion is anti-eve. i think it is why fw is regarded with disdain by many. if fw is to be a valid endgame option (which it should be like any other gameplay in eve) then wider participation and more options for participation are important.i can only claim my interest is primarily in the health of fw and not my own narrow interests. i say it pro forma for the record as it's been raised.cosmo"
7/28/2009,"hi cosmo,i like the general idea but i do not like the restrictions on who can shoot at what ship that stays in place. i hate the current mechanic where a fw fleet is roaming consisting of players from several corporations and only some of these are decked.if we allow these third parties into the conflict then they should become valid targets to other third parties whenever there is a fight going on.i thus do not support your suggestion as it currently stands.how about the following:if your corporation or alliance has wardecced a fw faction:in enemy high sec:- faction navy of wardecced faction will attack you on entering system- when you aggress an enemy faction pilot you will go flashy. (any pilot from any corp/alliance can now shoot you without a sec-hit or gate guns)- you get gate guns- you do not get a concord sec hit for attacking enemy faction pilot.in enemy low sec:- when you aggress an enemy faction pilot you will go flashy. (any pilot from any corp/alliance can now shoot you without a sec-hit or gate guns)- you get gate guns- you do not get a sec hit.in neutral low sec:- when you aggress an enemy faction pilot you will go flashy. (any pilot can not shoot you without a sec-hit or gate guns.- you do not get gate guns on you.- you do not get a sec hit."
7/28/2009,"i don't support gate gun fire (automatic or otherwise) on people who are in a concord war/fw war type state with respect to others.gate guns are not intended to give people home advantage (especially not in low-sec but not in high-sec either, in my view). that's what the npcs that spawn in high-sec against enemy pilots are for.i also don't see why 'any pilot from any corp/alliance can now shoot you without a sec-hit or gate guns' is a valid or balanced suggestion to make about people who are engaged in a concord/fw-type war in any type of space.your proposals amount to almost totally removing the point of a concord/fw war state. the effect in practice of this would be counter to the whole point of my proposal.thanks for the input but i'll stick with the basic principles of my proposal.cosmo"
7/28/2009,"this is debatable from my point of view but i though it would be nice to make low-sec system captures mean something real.that aggression rule is not ideal especially in highly populates systems, but without it one would always be better off in third party corp then in a real militia since the militia ships will be primary in mixed engagements:example:'team gallente:'""anti-caldari corps"" 5 ships""gallente militia"" 5 ships'team caldari'""anti-gallente corps"" 5 ships""caldari militia"" 5 shipssince the anti corporations can not shoot at each-other since they are not at war the militia ships on both teams will be called primary until all the fw ships are down."
7/28/2009,"definitely not supportedi have read quite a bit of the thread, and someone else mentioned this, but i see no real downside for being a third party participant.breakdown, benefitsmilitia you are declaring against has to worry about 2 opposiing militias+any third party forces, you have to worry about the militia you are declaring against.so right off, militia members have to worry about 2 parties + all third party participants and all the third party participants only have to worry about 1 opposing force.there is absolutely no reason for a corp to join the militia when it can limit the amount of people that can legally shoot it simply by going with the third party route. i don't think any standing hurdle would justify this."
7/28/2009,"well ships have ""max concurrent operation users"" right?why not use that as a baseline for max docking (+must be in fleet)? :)"
7/28/2009,"which is precisely why i can't support this. ship logistics are already too easy without making them even more so. if anything they need a nerf imo, but that's another discussion./ben"
7/28/2009,"you seem to be saying your carrier has room for 2 bs but not for 2 pilots. that's a bit ludicrous. not a huge fan of rp, but someone ought to justify that in context before just saying ""nope cant have more people in your giant ship.""in any case i support this idea as long as there is a fitting requirement, and preferably one that makes the mother-vessel more vulnerable somehow. it could be a powerful change, so it probably deserves something of a trade-off."
7/28/2009,how many ships you can move doesn't change. you just get the ability to move the pilot aswell.
7/28/2009,"supportedi like this idea, its useful and adds a bit more hmm to the game. and may also lead onto walk in carriers... which would be great"
7/28/2009,"i love the idea. in fact, when i first started playing eve, this is exactly how i thought carriers did work! i can see this working extremely well, even with current game mechanics. you fly you ship to the carrier in space. right click, select dock. carrier pilot accepts. session change and you load into a station type screen, (perhaps ccp could create cool carrier docking bay screens, one for each race, or simply use the screens already in game). docked players are removed from local, and also cannot see local. they have access to a fitting screen and the corp hangar (depending on roles) as they would in a normal station. pilots should also be able to change ships within the carrier, pending the ships are in a corp hangar tab they have access to.they would undock as they would normally with a confirmation required from the carrier pilot. the only drawback i can see this having is it has the potential to reduce 0.0 traffic, and subsequently spontaneous pvp in border systems, due to many people taxiing along with a carrier pilot for simple empire runs to check markets, buy bpos, skillbooks etc."
7/28/2009,not supporting.i think i'm going to by default say no to the majority of yaay's posts.can i get an amen for that? : o pnothing personal yaay...but your really turning into a paranoia-delusional some such or another.let's face it... how can this so called rig patch be that bad?cheaper rigs for small ships? frigate pilots can now afford to put rigs in?and still have the option for larger rigs? (if i read the patch notes right)don't you think your just jumping the gun a wee bit?
7/28/2009,"how is adding 3 more slots which could have countless diffreent fittings each making pvp more cookie cutter??????if anything, pvp fittings were cookie cutter even more so than now. nobody rigs frigates unless they're stupid and have too much isk. now it's possible. i like the rig changes, it adds more diversity to the game. screw you all who have enough isk to stupidly rig your frigates and don't want me to be able to!"
7/28/2009,"i'm seeing several major points in the op, and i'll address each in its own section.large rig prices will decrease drastically: the current lack of understanding of market pricipals buffles me to be quite honest. rigs atm are a niche market - increase for rig demand (more people buying small and medium rigs cause they are finally logical to use) ----> increase for salvage material prices and better prices for the less used materials ---> equal or higher rig prices.gain vs loss: read the rig description - on most rigs you gain something and lose something in return. for example, armor rigs increase armor relate stuff, but decrease speed. price is another factor, but isn't the main issue at hand. so allowing the use of rigs on frigs/cruisers will not remove the win vs. loss equation, but rather make it more reasonable.loss of diversity : diversity and cookie cutter fits are very rarely influenced by rigs. i could fly a buffer tank cane or a repper cane or even a nano cane - and the rig prices will have little effect on that. however, being able to rig it reasonable might might ill use more t2 frigs over using battleships, which means more diversity, rather than less. if a rig that was nay affordable before make my nano or other less common fit much more reasonable, it will only increase the sightings of such fits.""smaller rigs would be smaller bonuses for less cost"": i'm starting to doubt your intelligence level here. this is exactly what is going to happen. let me teach you a simple truth about about math - 10% increase for 1k armor is less that 10% increase on 10k armor. same for any other number. will a 1k increase in speed mean my frig will be able to speed tank more effectively if i'm going over 3k either way? not very likely. will it mean i'll get the tackle on people far away or on faster ceptor/etc more often? pretty likely.""everything will be rigged now = rigs meaning nothing"" argument: thats actually pretty cool imo. will that mean all frigs will be rigged? almost def. will it change anything in frig vs frig fights? not noticeably, and def. not more than fitting and ammo choices will. will we see frigs being more effective as a ship group? idk, but i think that is more than likely - same for cruisers and bcs, and it will allow for much specialization in niches, meaning the ""big, bad bs owning everything"" myth will be much less prevalent. also, will that mean that rigs will have no more ""umph"" factor? no, cause we still have t2 rigs that will cost 40mil or so for med, and 5-6mil for small (thats just guessing, though i think its gonna be much higher still, more on the factor of 2/3 decrease per size group rather than the 8 decrease for t1 rigs) and will still allow the concept of bang for buck fittings. also this will increase the use of t2 rigs on non mission or faction ships, which imo might reduce the ""omg its faction and t2 fitted"" factor, but will make it more of a real t2 rig, and less of a ""t2 but more like faction"" rig. in conclusion, will this rig change have its problems? more than likely. will this change lead to some balance issues? prob. is it more reasonable than only using rigs on t2 ships and bs/bcs? yes.p.sdoes this post have too many of the ""is my mom a ****? more than likely"" type sentences? yes, but i still like them edited for legibility."
7/28/2009,"supported - a small rig should have a significantly smaller effect than a large - perhaps 1/4, 1/5 or even 1/6 or so, with a correspondingly lower price."
7/28/2009,"rigs do they are percentage based,a trimark on a mega adds far more (2000ehp unfitted vs 80) than on a punisher. not supporting this topic."
7/28/2009,what's the point of a rig that gives a 1.5% bonus to a frigate? who would bother with such a worthless item?
7/28/2009,"nope.this, the basis of your entire thread, is not correct.they have drawbacks for a reason. they were intended to be used to specialize your ship for a specific role, allowing for more, different roles. it's also the reason why t2 has less rig slots than t1, since t2 already is a specialized version of t1.so yes, we're getting cheaper ways to fit smaller ships. this will open up rigging for smaller hulls too, especially t1 hulls, where it previously didn't make a lot of sense, since the same rig would be better spent on a larger hull instead.in conclusion, there will be cost effective means to specialize t1 frigates in the future. this is great news for everyone who loves to fly small hulls.by the way, i'm not getting why smaller rigs should be less effective. the bonuses are already percentual, it's not like we had a rig that gave you a flat 500pg which would be hilariously overpowered on small hulls."
7/28/2009,"that's an additional 1.5% of survivability... seconds count in this game.for you to call that worthless... is nothing short of laughable.course i'm not supporting this thread by answering that statement or re-enforcing it... only that i'm stating a fact that people will use these ""worthless"" rigs to get that extra edge.... even if its a very small edge.small edges win the game these days..."

7/28/2009,"in my opinion you're missing the whole point. rigs are made up out of junk you gather from wrecks. they're not so hi tech or shiny. i think it's more like assembling self-made turbo on your toyota corolla mark ii. makes your car do some noise, maybe burn some rubber on wet concrete too on good day then engine blows up.i think some rigs should have more hilariuos side effects though."
7/28/2009,"ccp has got a good idea going with this proposed change to rigs. the only problem is that many people with existing, well researched rig blueprints are going to get the short end of the stick when all of their existing blueprints become large rig blueprints by default.for example, those with control capacitor circuit blueprints can rest easy, as those are popular rigs for ravens. however, people possessing gravity capacitor upgrade blueprints are out of luck, as there are probably few (if any) who would want to put those rigs onto large ships. it would be nice if, after the change, there would be a way a player could convert existing (and now large) rig blueprints into small or medium rig blueprints, at the owner's discretion."
7/28/2009,"uhhhhhhh that's why we use percentages in eve.with bigger ships you get more effect and in smaller ships you get less effect cause of smaller hp, damage, etc."
7/28/2009,this actually makes sense. i'm not sure how this patch is going to change wealth envy much. seems like a lot of fluff without a lot of content.
7/28/2009,"supportedthese expensive rigs, can clear the dirt between the good and great pilots. you say it doesn't make a difference, but i am sure it does, small may it be, but that small difference can change everything in a fight"
7/28/2009,"pvp isn't expensive, but it isn't cheap either. how about doing some isk making work to pay for your play time. don't whine to ccp and demand cheap pvp.you want to min/max, you should have to pay dearly for it.otherwise, get in a rookie ship and go to a starter system.highly supported to op.edit for typo and to add this:the casuals whining for free epics have come to eve."
7/28/2009,"yeah, i support this argument. i do not think this is a good idea for the balance of the game. frigates already have good advantages over their bigger siblings, and really the upgrades are the reason why you move into t2 class ships."
7/28/2009,"well the idea is not to give the miners weapon to defend of every pvp pilot. the idea is to give them some tools to make the fight a little bit more even.the only defence a miner have today is a few drones. even the drones is not much help, since you can only have 5 active small drones. or an mixed of medium and small drones (which we all know is crap setup to have). or god forbid a single sentry/large drone.another problem, which i belive this idea will help, is that there is few pilot in low sec and way to many in high sec.so how to get pilots out from high sec and into low sec and finally to the life of nullspace?.well introduce them gently into the environment. give them some equipment so that they can defend them self. once they can see that they can defende them self without to much losses. they will begin to get more and more friends out.and at one point it could be that high sec will be for noobs (except jita and other major tradehubs), lowsec for some experient pilots and nullsec for the eliteplayers or pilots that shouldn't be there but is there anyway.so for that reason i fully support this great idea.for us pvp there is also a nice addition. i can think about alot of nice tactical situation where even we can have use of these guns.i would love to have a couple in my hangar and have them deployed in mining belts for some nice target to take out :-d."
7/28/2009,"ccp messing with the market is bad. you not being able to pay for a ship, means your loss. if the price gets too high, then it will go back down, because other people will stop paying for them also. capitalism is such a wonderful thing.oh, not supported."
7/28/2009,hopefully the cost-effectiveness issue will be fixed when insurance is overhauled. hacs are not too expensive. fly t1 cruisers if hacs cost too much. that's what they exist for.
7/28/2009,"considering the sheer amount of sniping hac gangs i've run into, i'm fairly sure that they are cheap enough."
7/28/2009,"ccp adjusting build cost wouldnt be messing with the market, it would be balancing, nothing wrong with that.however while i am going to press the support button, i dont think they should change the build requirements of hacs. they should fix alchemy/moon mining in general to get supply and demand into balance again. the hac prices are just an indicator that something else is wrong atm.right now there isnt even a healthy supply/demand relation, simply because supply is fixed. the ammount of people able to use t2 stuff increases. so the demand for the moon materials increases. however the production of high end moon stuff is completely fixed. even if i would pay 100 times the price that it is going for now, the total supply of them wouldnt change anything, since it is allready maxed."
7/28/2009,"changing material costs for hacs wont change anything unless they remove desp need - it will only make owners of r64s richer. when supply is cornered, suppliers can demand any price that the market will pay - and if people are still buying hacs at 150mil, changing anything won't matter. this isn't like the t3 change where you have tons of people supplying materials for production - you have limited r64s, and most of them are owned by several big alliances who are usually together. add to that the fact that trade isn't as simple as reducing production costs = reduced price tag, as people can play the market as they please.tl;dr version - ccp can try and **** with the market, but unless consumers stop being willing to pay 150mil per hac (or whatever) prices will not change. and for that to happen people will have to create big ""buyers groups"" that will say no to high prices. but that will never happen, cause people are stupid and usually follow the herd mentality anyhow.so no, not supported at all. but please, when you do buy that hac finally, please faction fit it and come to lowsec - i could use a nice ransom."
7/28/2009,"i can't see the sense in this argument... i think it's because it's not an argument after all, but some kind of whine. you have no money because:1. you're lazy to make some2. what you make you rapidly go to get it poppedwith the same effort and logic you should propose that carriers with fighters and stuff (and skills too, yes) should be not more then 123million isk, because you just have that amount. so what? don't buy any, m8, you don't have to. 123mill is good for approx 100 rifters with okish fittings, so you can do a lot of pvp, go with it.the price for hacs is just fine, they give you approx the same tank as a good bs, with real good sensors, locking time, mobility, and at the same time, they can put out quite decent dmg. and until peepz buy it for 160mil, the price will not (and shouldn't) change.no support"
7/28/2009,"so the problem are the alliances that are holding the r64 moons..... i wonder why that problem keeps popping up everywere... ow wait maybe its time to revieuw that! that brings me to alliance cost to run space, (for noobs, yes pos fuel & jb cost isk....). to run and defend space properly u need sov... that sounds fimiliar, ccp is going to change the sov system end of this year. so maybe in a year or 2 the op get's his way, after the sov revieuw, after r64's distrubution revieuw & probaly after some l4 mission boosts.like i always say: ""cheap ship is dead ship"". i always spend atleast 250m on my hac's if i pimp them with faction, they need that love. with recons the same, they need faction to be flown properly, in a pvp way not a blobfest, there u need ****ty t1 cruisers for"
7/28/2009,"no.there is no problem. prices are a factor of supply and demand and people playing with said supply and demand in order to artificially raise moon mineral prices. also, since the moon mining dupe bug was fixed, there are less minerals on the market = more demand = higher prices. now ofc, the mineral prices might be too high for reason - but again, its not about alliances or sov, its all about what people will or won't be willing to pay.so basically, if you have a problem with the prices of hacs or moon minerals, don't pay it. if enough people are not willing to pay, prices will go down. but like i've said - since people are stupid, its more than likely that people will still pay todays prices for the next 2-3 months."
7/28/2009,"get out. seriously. you think things are bad at the moment, i remember paying 300 mil for my first vaga... and i had to travel across 3 regions to find on on the market.kids today don't know they're born.with no big wars on at the moment prices should stabilise.cost effectiveness is in the eye of the beholder. to some people a diemost is obviously worth 160 mil because people are still buying them at that price."
7/28/2009,"we all know the problem is r64 moons, it always has.it's about damn time ccp did something about it, it's been going on for far too long.0.0 space = if don't have an r64 moon, oeps sorry you're dead cause 1 r64 moon will give more income than the tax of 500 players."
7/28/2009,"the only problem is with balance between moon materials in production, should the other two r64 be balanced like prom & dysp in usage the prices would stabilize a bit lower, but not droping too much so it's meaningless. that and fixing damn alchemy allready.anyway is a matter of how spread wants t2 to be, maybe they are actually not that bad with it reaching such prices as it was too wide spread. but raising the issue to know what are the thoughs of ccp may not be a bad idea at all.there are too much richie rich kiddos who spend too much time at internet spaceships, but for the average player, according to qen and other devblogs and real data, losing a ship which with rigs and t2 fit can reach >200 mill. lose is a hard enough hit. so what does ccp think about it?an other way to go is removing the damn insurance allready on t1 ships for older players (say 3 months old?), suddenlly losing a bs worth 250 mill. is not such a vain thing."
7/28/2009,"like i said, there are parties that have enough r64's to do this stuff. that are responsible for 20% of the dyspo market (kuch kuch delve). no offence t1 goonies, just a example. r64's attracts big alliances and once a alliance got enough of them they can manipulate the whole t2 market. we all know what happend when delve was sieged. the problem is that there arnt enough r64's that are owned by non big alliances. u can wonder now should it be able for someone to have a r64 for is onw,.... no deffinaly not. but if i look here i see 6-7 large alliances holding 95% of the r64's of witch 3 own 60% of all the dyspo moons. i wonder if there is a real market in r64 mins...."
7/28/2009,"actually the issue is with r64 moons, but not in the sense that most people assume it is. many people assume that every alliance in null space controls a vast swath of r64s and r32s which fuel this massive conspiracy that there is this conglomerate to control the market.the truth is far more sinister.the actually truth is that way back in the way back machine when the game was bright and young, whatever dev team seeded the original moons did so half drunk and dumb with no sense or rhyme or reason to balance.so in reality we have sections of space are literally overflowing with r16s and r32's. seriously, its a freaking cadmium fest. and then you have sections of space where its nothing but r64s, and in some infinite wisdom, that i have yet to figure out in my lengthy time here, they seeded those r64s according to racial space....which would make sense if the actual build requirements and spread were spread according to racial space.but as we know now, they are not. only 2 r64's go into the bulk of all production, and to make things worse every expansion since a point of time has actually made it worse by bulk copy pasta build requirements (see jump freights) so that instead of fixing this balance in demand.. its actually made it worse.you want to fix t2 prices... fine... just argue from the right platform.either the build requirements change to use the less used r64's (some of us have pushed the idea that all industrial t2 items should use the amarr lines instead of gallente) or moon locations need to change as well (which wouldn't be so bad in of itself either)"
7/28/2009,anyone have any arguments why not?
7/28/2009,"following up on issue 0101-05-0038this was listed as ""resolved"" by bane glorious, despite no in-game resolution and no resolution listed on the csm ""resolved"" page.as this has been an ongoing issue for literally years, it would be appropriate for the csm council to actually see this thing through and get ccp to actually make necessary changes as has been suggested over the years.""resolved"" autocannon issuelocked large projectile/tempest thread warning: 47 pages long.analysis of training large artilleryadditional known projectile issues:1. specific to republic fleet emp ammo (noted by kessah). why is the damage modifer for rf emp ammo at 52.5, while the equivilent ammo for gallente (gallente navy antimatter), and amarr (amarr navy multifrequency) have their modifiers set at 55.5? an added point to this, both amarr and gallente navy ammo damage is spread across two damage types, while emp is spread across three further lowering its damage effectiveness.2. per ccp zulupark's rather vague conversation regarding tempests and large projectiles in general, it appears that ccp has determined that minmatar ships fight in falloff. with the laser weapons buff, this essentially places all short range combat in minmatar versus amarr situations at optimal for the amarr (using high damage, short range ammo), while minmatar ships using autocannons (using high damage, short range ammo) are essentially ""always at optimal range"" even when at full falloff range for the autocannons.3. as mentioned below: lasers, hybrids, and missile systems all have skills that decrease a major disadvantage to those weapons systems. controlled bursts affect only lasers and hybrids, while rapid launch (for example) affects only missiles. projectile weapons do not get a skill that helps specifically with autocannon disadvantages.edit: changed ""rapid fire"" to the correct skill ""rapid launch""edit: change of titleedit: addition of major locked thread."
7/28/2009,i would also love to understand why there is a skill to reduce the primary drawback of hybrids and lasers yet not such boost exists for projectiles.controlled bursts.
7/28/2009,one more amazing reason to bring the font back. how much cooler and easier to read the map was.

7/28/2009,doesn't work very well... every time i encounter other languages in eve my winblows system goes berserk on the lettering.mac however doesn't break a sweat... prob due to language packs or something.but seriously... i do like that font.
7/28/2009,"the font being unicode and the font being crap (difficult to read, mainly) are two separate things.that said, an easier to read font would be nice (but i don't particularly care for serifs)"

7/28/2009,"honestly, i would rather just see a freighter given some sort of option to reconfigure its cargohold into a hangar. when you use it to transport goods, you cannot access the hangar; when you use it to transport ships you cannot access the regular cargo hold.this would save the devs from having to design a completely new ship or even code in a new one, and would also prevent from adding to the propagation of more skills that have to be introduced each time a new ship is designed.other than that, i'd support the idea."

7/28/2009,"conventional cloaks and cov ops cloack should be scannable.. although it should take a considerable amount of time for the last one.let me tell you why. it's become a fairly regular ""tactic"" in 0.0 to take a bunch of recon ships/bombers, move to a hostile system and stay there 'till judgement day. you can do nothing about a red recon gang sitting in your backyard that's only 3 hours active per day and afk for the rest.even if it takes half an hour to do it --> cov ops cloaks should be scannable.ccp promised us 2 or 3 years ago that they would make non-cov ops ships, that are using a cloaking device, scannable..... so either it is hard to implement or they quickly disregarded that idea.."
7/28/2009,"funny how pvpers and pirates bash on carebears the second they want some aspect of pvp nerfed, but that they are the biggest whiners when something affects their own little world. i'll say what you keep telling carebears when they whine about anything: learn how to live with it! there's no such thing as free lunch!"

7/28/2009,"this didn't bother me massively until i started to siege towers, but it really needs a solution. supported."
7/28/2009,"kinda intersting that it is nearly only goonswarms and goonpets that like this idea.i wonder why ??i would say that they want an easier way to do pos bowling.in my experience this idea is crap. and let me explained it:1.) an experience fleetleader keeps track of which guns have been taken out and which is left to take out.2.) an experience and good tactical fleetleader tells which target is primary, secondary etc.3.) a good and exeperience dread pilot follows his leaders order.simsalabim problem is solved in an very easy way without any more coding for ccp todo. instead they can spend they hour to implement other features that is needed so badly in eve.well that is my 2cent in the matter and i stick to it.thumbs down for a bad idea."
7/28/2009,"supporting this, although being able to apply filters for incapacitated/online/offline mods would make it an even better idea.what exactly does this idea have to do with pos bowling?"
7/28/2009,"this proposal has nothing to do with pos bowling. i have no idea where you are getting this from unless you're just trying to be inflammatory per your opening sentence. have you done pos warfare? the issue is for anyone to easily tell what the stats of pos modules are. the fleet commander's job especially should be easier and not bogged down in trying to zoom in on a module for status. ""large artillery battery is primary..."" what?! there are 6 of them! which one?! yeah, that argument fails. even if the fc can broadcast the target but then that isn't what you are going for here.not applicable here. you ignored the applications the new ui improvement would have for repairing modules too. i really do wonder if you've done pos warfare or not."
7/28/2009,"what is the point of giving the option to pick ""view"" and ""take"" permissions with pos modules to alliance if it does nothing?alliance can't view /or/ take, yet you have the option to set 'view' and 'take' to alliance...it's like this whole menu does absolutely nothing at all.with or without permissions, /some/ alliance can put stuff in. (i'll get more into the 'some' part in a bit)with or without permissions, alliance can't:viewtakemanufactureresearchor pretty much anything else you'd do with a pos...and not even all members of alliance can give, it seems almost random who can.ceo of ex.ecutor(why is e-x-e censored???) corp in alliance can't give, but a couple of the directors can. my alt who is a director in said corp can't give, yet one of our brand new recruits with no roles set can give.none of this changes no matter what i set permissions to.before you think this is a centralized bug, note that i have two pos's set up, and both have the same problems.something needs to be fixed here, and fast."
7/28/2009,"the whole pos system needs to be blown up and coded afresh. it's utter nonsense how it all works. as for the e-x-e censorship, it's because of a spammer going around posting links to keyloggers. no idea why they forgot the leading dot, but hey."
7/28/2009,"anyone else notice this as a problem?i mean, i'm pretty sure that there are people that have tried this...kind of makes sense if a corp wanted to allow alliance to use some of their modules.nice that the interface is there, sad that it's just a tease.."
7/28/2009,"supported. i personally don't want to see people given rights they really don't need. for example, to give rights to a corp hanger at a pos, you give rights for all offices as well, which makes it a security risk and is silly.while you're at it redo the entire permissions system. it need help badly."
7/28/2009,for someone who is standing on there very small yet very tall podium.. you certainly do not have a great deal of support from the pilots who use these ships.hence my ego comment./thread

7/28/2009,i am. ship looks to cool to never see them in space.
7/28/2009,after some test on eft. i can only say yes.but perhaps the good way for this ship would be to more drone or launcher. why don't put in this ship 6 slots for launcher with some bonus in heavy assault.they are already some ship use them.exemple :vengeance -> bonus rocketstealth bomber -> torpedomalediction -> rocket> rocketsacrilege -> heavy assaultdamnation -> heavy assault why not prophecy -> heavy assault
7/28/2009,"because the prophecy is an amarr ship, and amarr ships use lasers and the odd drone. the ships you list are all khanid ships. seriously though, if the problem is that the tanky bc gets a less impressive tank than it should, boost the tank. toss an extra thousand or two armor hp at it."

7/28/2009,i support ambulation completely.

7/28/2009,"i'm also signing in as one of the 'no ones' who want walking in stations.if it's not your cup of tea, that's fine, but a lot of folks are very much looking forward to it both i and my wife (who has her own characters and accounts) are really jonesing for it.as to why - it's hard to roleplay in a spaceship. new eden is more than hulls and a lot of folks want to experience that. so what if they recycle the code? that's just good business and the cross pollination will mean that both games will benefit."
7/28/2009,"i know, we all want to see the rest of your boobs :-)"
7/28/2009,"the idea is simple it follows the same concept as a mobile warp disruption bubble, but in this case its a cyno jammer. it would take quite a bit of m3 to move, aswell as having a long anchoring timer but once online would jamm a certain radius around its self say 150k. they would come in many sizes small 75k/ medium 125k/ large 175k/ xlarge 225k.these special bubbles would also have a cycle time, after which they would go into a state named recharging at which point the jamming capabilities are nullified. the recharge time would be a quarter of the cycle time. for theories sake lets say 30 minute cycle time, this means recharge would be 7.5 minutes. why are these needed: they would be another card in the fc's deck as well as allow attackers and defenders alike to temporarily shield themselves from hot drops/titan drops/ and such if the bubbles were set up correctly. they wouldnt prevent warp ins or affect warping in any way.if the bubble was dropped after the cyno went up or during once it came up the cyno would still be valid but ships would randomly appear cloaked acros the system using the same mechanic that is seen when the cyno dies as you jump. the cyno would also go instantly red, and not auto run another cycle.ofcourse these would only be able to function in 0.0.the other idea would be to make this a highslot mod for black ops bs's allowing them to create a cloak of jamming around an area where during the time only covert cynos could be opened.the first idea is the primary one though, i hope you like it please discuss."
7/28/2009,i support my train of thought
7/28/2009,i support this product and or service.
7/28/2009,"i like the general concept - but the practicality of it is questionable at best. so you cant cyno within 200k? ill just cyno a bit off in a ss (5mil off), and warp the capitals to the field - yes it does make me a bit susceptible to drag bubbles/dictor/hic bubbles for my capitals, but its easily avoidable. same is true with people trying to warp dics/hics on my cyno, as i can do it in a safe off from all the planets, and just get a bubble towards them, so anyone warping to tackle my cynoed caps will be caught in it.so until said issues are address, im ambivalent and not supporting. sorry."
7/28/2009,"i will grant you that yes but a cyno off grid and a cyno on grid are 2 different thing for instance a titan cyno'ing on grid just jumps in dd's aligns and gone.titan off grid shows up on directional and fleets have time to scatter.caps on field can immediately start combat, caps warping in are at a disadvantage.this ^^^^ will take between 5-50 seconds depending on bumping aligning and warpin.several seconds is the difference between having pos ammo and pvp ammo or scripts right. getting hic's on the field to hinder their warpins and spread em out.sure if it goes 200k you can cyno at 201k but that still not where you wanna be is it. assuming the fleet is near the center of the bubble that gives the tiran much much less range on their dd cause they come in 200 away and it only goes 250k (tested).it also makes the difference between a regular dread gang and a sniper dread gang., bridged in support and everythign cant immediately appear on field therefor the friendly forces. have time to react and dont have the panic of enemies appearing on top of you. thought your points are valid they are not hitting at the heart of the argument, which is to hinder not stop cyno of enemy support bridging or caps coming in, that extra few seconds say 30-40 where they land load and align you can be more prepared than if you didnt have the jammer shroud."
7/28/2009,"also how effective is a hot drop that has to start off-grid. it loses its ohs**t factor. instead you get cyno up 30 dreads on directional, get bubbles up between us and load pvp ammofinally more often than not you'll get the cyno warping to your grid uncloak hit cyno button and go oh s**t and by that time support has him locked and done"
7/28/2009,"interesting concept, though i must say that you numbers seem off - the recharge time idea is kind of silly, and there's no need for four sizes. still, i like the broader idea."
7/28/2009,"supported.also would like to see low sec usage, no need to restrict it to 0.0 like warp bubbles.a similar mod for a rorqual would also be an idea to help protect mining ops from hot drops in addition to giving mining ships laser dps , but thats another issue :)"

7/28/2009,"god, everyone that has anything against this proposal doesn't do a good job at /hiding/ the fact that nerfing this would ruin the one thing that they enjoy doing in the game.eve is a game about risk/reward.suicide ganking has no risk, and lots of reward. in some cases more than l4 missions. i watched a freighter full of capital ship parts get suicide ganked a couple weeks ago, the loot from that would've been wondrous if i was a part of it...if there weren't insurance payouts for illegal activities, then it'd force suicide gankers to pick targets that'd offset their loss.currently, the /police/ offset your /criminal/ activities..doesn't make any sense at all."
7/28/2009,"this man has made the points.not supported, stop whining about suicide gankers. there's plenty of ways to keep yourself safe."
7/28/2009,"the point of the topic wasn't whining about the act of suicide ganking, that's all and good.the point of the topic is how nonsensical it is for concord to pay /you/ for breaking the law.i've never had a problem with suicide ganking, and i also don't think removing insurance payout would stop or even slow the act of doing much at all. it would just make you pick your targets more intelligently.you won't just suicide gank a floating destroyer for lols.you won't just suicide gank a caracal on his way to a mission.you'll suicide gank a cov ops frig for the possibility of carrying bpo's.you (or a scout character) would scan cargos of industrials and pick ones with juicy cargo for you to gank.you'd make more profitable decisions to offset your loss, a loss which there is absolutely no reason for the police force to pay for.it'd be like if police paid for your car that got wrecked while they were chasing you."
7/28/2009,"a interesting addition to the role playing aspect of fw. i would prefer something more in deep like temporary agents giving out slaves to move to rehabilitation centers and then a second agent there giving out freed slaves to move to other locations. with the mechanics added with the first epic arc it would not be difficult, it added the possibility to deposit something in a container in space, so it would be easy to add a ""rehabilitation station"" in space. each race has have several agents asking you to move item a from agent a to agent b, then item b from agent b to agent c and so on around a circuit that in the end return you to the starting point. a temporary circuit sending you with a load of freed slaves to the rehabilitation center, from there to a station with a load of workers (and assorted people) and then from that station to the starting system with a cargo of vitoc (remember, vitoc addiction is not curable so you need it to keep the ex-slaves alive) don't seem to hard to make. after implemented it would require only to move the position of the first agent to a new system when that is controlled by minmatar.amarr would have similar agents asking for a raid against rehabilitation facilities to get potential slaves, dropping them in conditioning stations and bringing (again) vitoc to condition them.programming some similar circuit and bringing them on line only when the condition warrant it don't seem too hard.edit:it is a mission idea, so slightly different from the op idea, more based on market, but bot should make some fw aftereffect visible to the general populance."
7/28/2009,sounds like a good idea.
7/28/2009,sounds good.
7/28/2009,some good ideas on this thread
7/28/2009,gotta agree with this.
7/28/2009,the principle is sound. i have often thought that agents in space at appropriate non-fw capture mechanic plexes might be one way to make this kind of thing relatively automatic.cosmo
7/28/2009,"i agree that this would be a much better way to go, both for immersion and balance, but it would require more development on ccp's part. my suggestion is intended to provide some sort of ""real effect"" to occupancy changes that the rp crowd can enjoy (and the pvp crowd can enjoy griefing) with truly minimal ccp effort. i would fully support your idea if ccp decides that they are willing to devote staff resources to making the effect of occupancy more transparent within the game.if anything i would expand your suggestion into a mini-game of sorts, where occupancy slowly converts existing resources from one faction-specific type to another, and there are tag-style missions available allowing you to use personnel ""trade goods"" to convert the types more quickly (e.g. slavers, rehabilitation experts, medics, what have you). as the resources change type, courier missions open up to deliver them to the home systems. this would allow the minmatar a chance to speed up the freeing and repatriation of slaves, and the amarr a chance to disrupt these operations and to recapture slaves if they regain occupancy (and similarly for industrial output for the caldari/gallente conflict). the resources could replenish over time, keeping people from both sides active in the fw systems long after the immediate occupancy clash, and create disruptable trade routes.however i would bet that ccp has already considered many such ideas, but scrapped them due to staff time issues. hence i proposed my limited idea."
7/28/2009,"i don't support this because think about it. when you mission in lowsec, you should probably align in order to make a quick get away. at least you would if you're smart. now when a flashy comes into your mission, you're going to leave and probably not come back. they know where it is and might wait for you. does it really matter if it takes them 30 seconds or 3 minutes to find you? you're not going to finish the mission anyways, so with this you're just trying to prevent the inevitable."
7/28/2009,"as a weapons system, rockets are utterly useless. i understand the point of rockets - in that they provide something which hits reliably, but even when they do, the damage dealt is minimal.lets do a bit of mathcraft here:no skill bonus, no ship bonuses:3x rocket launcher i: 19 dps - 12 grid - < 4.5km range3x 150mm autocannon i: 24 dps - 12 grid - 0.4 + 4.0 3x gatling pulse laser i: 26 dps - 15 grid - 2.0 + 0.53x light electron blaster i: 32 dps - 12 grid - 0.5 + 1.5from this alone, you might say, hey, thats not so bad! rockets trade off dps for range and not having to worry about tracking! except, rockets also have a explosion velocity of 85m/s, a speed attainable by practically any ship in eve.if the enemy happens to be going at 170 m/s, even if you match speeds with him in a chase, rocket dps drops down to half the original amount, to 9.5 dps. 170m/s is approximately the speed of an enemy frigate while webbed with a tech 1 web.secondly, as ship equipment is upgraded (to best named), range and tracking increase, while with rockets, the range and explosion velocity of said weapon remains constant. my proposal:boost rocket damage by 20%: so that rockets have a base damage of 30.boost rocket explosion velocity by 200% - so rockets have a base explosion velocity of 255m/s. this is still lower then the speed obtained by many frigates, but would allow rockets to deal full damage to a tackled cruiser, at least."
7/28/2009,"supported.also, although missiles in general need a look at, throwing the "" missiles are nerfed, lets fix that first before rockets"" argument isn't the answer. rockets are wtfbbq****ed atm, which also affects ships such as the crow/mael/vengeance/hawk - making them less than ideal (with all 4 you could go missiles and long range, but thats not a fix to the prob, just an adapting to the situation) - something that the missile fix (which may or may not happen in the far future) will not address sufficiently anyhow."
7/28/2009,"missiles in general neet to be looked at, they've been nerf'd way too hard.plus you get to add the joy of travel time to every last bit of dps numbers..i love missiles and have well over 6m sp put into them, but every last post about numbers involving missiles put them way under any other weapon.."
7/28/2009,while i appreciate the help to get rockets fixed. maybe bump the existing threads instead making new ones.
7/28/2009,there's an existing thread for this:
7/28/2009,"this suggestion shouldn't even have needed to be posted, it's how it should always have worked."
7/28/2009,it's common sense imo.how about the ability to have a 'key ring' that has stored passwords that automatically work unless the pos's password has been changed?

7/28/2009,and sisi was completely lagged out and the joining queue was impressive.
7/28/2009,"this is a exelent idea!! it needs to be supported by a login message or something. this will bring pvp to the carebear puppies that are afraid of pvp. they will get a taste of pvp when they come out in t1 cruisers and stuff. maybe they will like it and cut the carebearing. /supported*edit, this topic will get roasted by carebears... but hell... what do u expect form them if they miss out 1 day of income, 45m x 6 hours, 270m"
7/28/2009,getting randomly ganked by blobs is not good pvp.
7/28/2009,up
7/28/2009,"good 0.0 is fine, is the problem of the corp/alliance if they fail at exploiting and aiding their members as they should: moons & plexes (and almost all of them can pretty much be run by two guys, or one and his alt, which is not uncommon for 0.0 players to have) can make a lot of money. belt rats allready have an higher chance for higher meta drops, and in general more drop, again not our fault if ratters can't be bothered to loot it (yeah i know there are bigger inconveniences about hauling stuff etc. but still is part of the sandbox is players fail to create a local market about it, and anyway in the age of jumpbridges and jf, lol). in case of players residing in npc regions that are nto as secure as territory with sov, they have higher chance for faction/officer, so it evens out.one thing though is true, changes proposed by ephemeron should be implemented as is a no brainer that people that can log after dt has higher profit that anyone else.bad 0.0 needs a boost though, is just not right you can earn more in empire than there, but as has been stated, only ccp knows all the details about the bounties & drops and how it all is even out. one change i would make though is to mvoe from a direct bounty to tags model for everything. this way you would accomplish two things: you force everyone to loot stuff (including hisec runners) so is easier to control ratios between minerals & isk, and on the other side you force players to haul stuff, so it can be intercepted by other players. in hisec mission runners would have to transport them to concord stations, which could be camped by gankers or hisec wardeccing corps or sell to players buy orders (probably losing money)."
7/28/2009,"while i support this concept, this tends to become another nerf to 0.0 players. highsec players can easily turn in their tags freely - 0.0 players have plenty of risk transporting tags around."
7/28/2009,could you stop bumping your whine thread dave its a violation of forum rules.
7/28/2009,"oh for the love of god, stop nerfing ecm.tracking disruptors are fine - learn to maneuver your ship against someone tracking disrupting you, learn to recognize tracking disruption and change ammo.tracking disruptors don't have the range to be usable at fleet sniping distances, or at the very least, if used at those distances, the tding ship can be very easily shot at.yes, i know guns are supposed to be better than missiles, but everyone is already used guns, and more reliability is a key reason that missiles exist."
7/28/2009,td's are fine. i almost never see them used except on pilgrims and curses. now yeah i could fit one on my harbinger but i find a webber far more useful. and they already nerfed the sh*t out of webbers.
7/28/2009,"tracking disruptors do nothing to drones, do nothing to missiles and do nothing to an enemy's ew. compared to sensor dampeners and ecm, they only do one very specific thing, so they should be pretty darn good at it."
7/28/2009,didn't ccp fixed that and ewar affects drones now?though not sure how effective that would be. :)
7/28/2009,"not sure how you can blob poorly, if you have enough ships it's really hard to lose. they aren't plowed under by wardecs because there's too many, nobody is willing to fight against such numbers. 47% is actually kinda bad considering that they are flying cheap t1 stuff and even with their blobs and numbers don't kill as much as they lose in cheap t1 equipment..."

7/28/2009,related thread:
7/28/2009,"yes you did miss the point i'm afraid, the argument in buffing the cyclone isn't an argument of cyclone a v's cyclone b. its cyclone v's other ships of its class.so while the implant set and drug you choose for the cyclone is the best option for it, they are not the best option for the other battlecruisers. thats the point.as for the scale of the booster bonus, think of balance in regards to bonuses resist v's repair.5%/lvl resists give you an ehp bonus, it also assists in passive tanks and rr gangs.repair only assists repair, it has little benefit in ehp and it has no bonus in an rr gang. finally its completely counter productive in a passive tank.like i said before, 5%/lvl resist is almost always far superior to 7.5%/lvl repair, there is only a very small window of incoming dps that the repair bonus is superior, and that superiority is only after a a minute or so and only pulls away from the resist bonus by about 2%.to increase the repair bonus to 10%/lvl increases the window of superiority for incoming dps and makes repair bonused ships the best tankers in small to medium engagements, while leaving the resist bonused ships the kings of large engagements.that is what is the point to the repair bonus been buffed.in regard to your assertion of this making missions ships even better, be honest with me, just because the repair bonus gets boosted to 10%/lvl, would people drop their cnr's and start flying maelstroms? i don't think so. missile ships are still the best pve ships in game.i will remind you that the repair bonused ships include several gallente blaster boats that are best used in small to medium gangs also."

7/28/2009,"i have flow the cyclone, got some kills in it, like it but i'm not silly enough to think its because its a good ship, it was because people think its utterly worthless when in practice it is mearly very very bad (i feel sorry for anyone who flys this in pvp engagements who can't overheat).could do with another mid tbh but i can't see that ever happening."
7/28/2009,"your original comment on the topic was ""...what's stopping the buffer tankers from using an implant set and drugs also?"", and that's what i was referring to. were you referring to a buffer-tanked cyclone, or a buffer-tanked drake/brutix/harbinger? i assumed you were referring to the cyclone, which gets next to nothing from drugs and implants when buffer tanked. i have never understood the love for the raven. its tank is ugly, its dps is mediocre(even on the cnr), and missiles have all manner of suck attached to them that turrets don't have to worry about. the drake i can understand, but the raven is just unimpressive. give me a dominix or a pulse abaddon any day."
7/28/2009,"completely incorrect conclusions.consider a clone that has dual od and dual gyro.dpsruppy 4 x 220's * 1.25 for maxed damage bonus = 5 x 220'sruppy has 5 x 220's with 1 gyroclone has 5 x 425's with 2 gyroclone has ~40% more dpsyes the lol torrent rage is gonna do nothin versus a ship doing 1.5k m/stracking and sig.the extra od the clone fits null out the extra base speed of the ruppy.before pilot skills and implant both ships do around 1.45 km/sboth ships have big sigs due to mwd, both sigs way beyond min required for max damage from cruiser guns.both ships have similar speed hence no tracking.resists against barrage ( kin + exp )cyclone ~60%ruppy ~50%reps before skillscyclone 82.5 per secondrupture 26.7 per secondso to recapboth ships similar in speedno tracking to reduce damage.clone is gonna do 40% more damage per second against weeker resists while boosting 3 times faster.dude this ruppy is gonna get pooned.your use of torrent rage screams eft fit.seriously before you talk down the clone get out there and fly it skirmish style. it rocks."

7/29/2009,"looks as if you are as loud mouthed in the forums as you were in alliance chat goddess, fyi sukmanobov has never used nuetral remote rr. i also know for a fact that rico felix, sombra, shan, pb, delzoun, jared, wolf, and most of mbalm does not use them in fact i know of no one in mbalm that does. if any one does please feel free to tell us.i will admit to using my alt to rsb suk every now and then but thats no gonna help if im in a rupture and a domi undocks. tho if i undock a rupture to fight a cruiser/bc a remote nuet remote mega / logistic ship i.e. ggb would change the fight in the wt's favour.if privs are using nuet rr then you have every right to complain just don't go spreading rumors about priv's using neut rr in fights as a norm because we don't.p.s. notice the word ""nuetral"" not corp before all the post about i seen privs using rr"
7/29/2009,not that i know of. please name corps.
7/29/2009,"ha ha ha loki the biggest nuet rr user in jita problem is that if you fight say phoon vs phoon. both are around the 30% armor left, then you target undocks his neutral rr domi then its pritty mutch all over for ya as there is no way your gonna burst the rest of that phoon plus the the rr domi. so the fight then becomes a ""can i get docked before i pop"" then smack in local about how you gt docked in time. the end because you won't undock and fight again because he has nuet rr.i agree with both proposals pb - aggrotimer and viktor vegas - that out of corp rr should not be alowedp.s. i just read kailen thorns post about his use of neut rr, i don't support this but its his choice if doesn't mind being a hypocrite"
7/29/2009,i so support this
7/29/2009,lol fine. i get them to join the corp/alliance. your scenario still fails if he waits to undock is in my corp and rr's me. you gonna switch targets and kill him? nope you're gonna dock. same as you guys always do and did.try thinking around the problem and quit whining. beating rr is easy and we do it daily. this includes the privateer's rather fail attempts at rr.eve forums.... if you can't beat em... whine about it and ccp will do it for you.
7/29/2009,"what are u on about man? i dont use rr? my main dosnt even have skills to use rr. and plus i fly frigs, so what is the point of it?where'd i say that i did? i was agreeing that rr was ok, but they need to put a aggression countdown to keep them in the fight. so they can be shot at and blown up for trying to help the fight"
7/29/2009,"right firstly,jita is a big place, your not the only war targets docked. so you and 1 - 2 others sitting outside, could mean bait. generally theres 10+ in jita and we do not know who is working with who, and who is helping with the bait. so we generally are cautious. out of all the war-targets i have fought against, your name probably stands out the most. and its warning bells, as to not give this guy a fight. cause he abuses the ass outta rr. thats why we didnt go to jita, cause we knew it was a lost cause.rr is not the problem!!!! its the aggression countdown which is not their when someone rr's which is the problem. please, people need to understand that before posting. rr is not broken and anyone can do it, but the aggression countdown is broken.no see, warping off takes time. all rr's i have seen are battleships, and they take time to align. so a frig would be on bumping duty. plus if that bs takes damage, it must dock + repair, but hey they cant!! cause of the new mechanics, so they need to rep themselves and come back into the fight. so that dosnt work...."
7/29/2009,"also, if ecm is to be used to counter rr, which if it has a good set up, it has eccm and that will waste the ecm. plus that will also give aggression to the neutral rr, and if he is a player, he can then undock in a dps ship and pop there rather weak ecm ship which engaged him to stop. so again, no, that dosnt sound good, does it?your little justification fails. so before posting loki, read that rr is fine!!! the aggression countdown, which is not there, is the problem"
7/29/2009,"repairing someone isn't an act of aggression, and should never be considered as such.you already get the ability to shoot said person for 15 minutes if he sticks his head into your war. just be happy you're not dealing with people that use their rr's differently (ie - have that alt steal from can belonging to their corp, then when they rep them, you get no chance to attack them). i believe that is more of an issue than what you're complaining about. not supported. not to mention privateers use this tactic to get remote sensor boosters and reps for themselves as well. so this is a bit of whine in my opinion."
7/29/2009,"many in this thread that are for the change have expressed their view that this is a bug or an exploit, but has that ever been confirmed by the devs? if not, i don't think it's too far outside the realm of possibility that it is intentional. i think it's also at least possible that if intended, it could have been meant as an alternative strategy to out-blobbing station campers (as stated by others). you have to admit for a small group of players caught in a station by a larger force, the options are pretty limited.if it did change, would increasing the survivability of logistics ships help?it seems to me that if a change is made for the sake of consistency then the conditions should be plainly spelled out in a way that offers no room for interpretation. would something like ""any action that harms or benefits a statistic on a ship flown by a pilot with an active one minute aggression timer triggers a one minute aggression timer"" suffice?"
7/29/2009,umm kailen... the top post is mine. the 2nd one was from a corpmate of your's sukmanobov (please at least read them and get your stuff straight before jumping up and down and waving stuff). i never said you specifically used rr and to be honest again could care less.
7/29/2009,"yea, its ok loki, it wasnt a rant at you, it was a rant at sukman. at the bottom of his post it says p.s. i read kailens..... the ps part was what i was getting at, not at you"
7/29/2009,"it really is kind of disturbing how many people don't bother to read what the post is about and just say ""l2fightrr""...i think it's been said here many many times that rr isn't the issue.i think it's also been said here many many times that the lack of an aggression time is the problem.rr is a purely logical tactic.lack of aggression creating ""god mode"" for neut rr is an exploit."
7/29/2009,"kailen...you realize if you ran around and didn't sit at stations and gates you guys wouldn't have these problems with rr? i can do whatever i want since i don't have these mythical issues. a good majority of the time i don't even bother with rr since it's not needed.also the tasking of a frig to bump people.. lol gl with that. from what i saw (with very few exceptions) you guys and organization haven't seen each other in years. also try setting up a rr ship (pick a logi, bs, hell i don't care). drop 5-10 ecm drones on it and watch the 1 or 2 or even 3 eccm's you crow about not do jack sh!t you're jammed m8 period and if you're doing it properly 1-2 jam cycles on the logi will let you kill your target(s). again if you guys bothered to test things you would know this... but it's easier to whine on the forums about it.you want to b!tch about something that's ****ed and op, try the ecm drones lol. those make me go ouch when i see them the thing you privateer guys don't get is... most of eve doesn't like ya.. (might be those dec's against carebears and people that don't want to fight) i dunno. sometimes i'd get convo's from people that hated the privateers and wanted to just stick one to you and they'd help out. my group had between 1-3 guys that had rr's of some sort around some of the time (could be 1 hs large rr on a mega, might be 2 rr on a domi, could be a logi ship). sometimes i had nada. tbh, alot of people @ jita and other places are looking for fights and rr/sensor boost/remote eccm boost people to get aggro and a fight. hell i do it all the time to get fights.add aggro counters to rr alts, i just add stabs align, add 1-2 rr's on each bs or go a new route. makes no difference. it's just pathetic you can't figure out how many ways there are to beat it currently"

7/29/2009,"i agree completely. i trained for the vengeance thinking it would be a fun little soloing af (great slot layout, great tank, somewhat mediocre dps) only to find out that rockets have a lower explosion velocity than hams. what the?this is clearly a broken mechanic, and i can't believe it hasn't simply been fixed as a bug yet. personally i'd be happy if rockets simply had their explosion velocity fixed. however i'd be ecstatic if they were brought in line with heavy assault missles and torpedos in terms of their damage, velocity, flight time, rate of fire, explosion velocity, explosion radius, launcher capacity, and launcher fitting requirements relative to light missles.thank you dierdra vaal for taking this before the csm and hopefully a speedy resolution can be achieved (next patch please!)."

7/29/2009,"you don't play fw do you?reading won't help you much, sign up and join a few fleets that are mixed with anti-militia cherry picked wardecs.of the 2 fw forces you're fighting you only see 1 on a regular basis, 2nd force is on other side of empire. regardless, the more you see the better, more kills. there is zero reason to try to ""avoid"" the wardecs as the wardecs are the whole aim of joining fw.we want more wardecs not less.... or the ability to actually return fire on those who attack our fleets.currently if you join fw you already have to worry about the 3rd forces, because they kill half your gang (without you being able to return fire) and leave you alone to be killed by the militia.1. you already have to worry about all the forces even if your corp doesn't have wardec. 2. the 3rd party is already at a *massive* advantage in the current setup of ""you can't attack them""."
7/29/2009,"sorry posting this on an alt..this is a bad idea becuase it changes the fundimental idea of fw in the wrong way. fw was, from my understanding, supposed to be a way to give a stepping stone for pve players to move more into pvp. by doing this you have moved the whole concept of fw into the same basic concept as 0.0 space.fw is not complete and we all know it, it needs help but this is not the way. find a way to make capturing a system mean something, that would be more help to fw. give fw pilots points for plexes captured, missions run and fw targets killed and let them spend those points on special items like faction ships and weapons, ie reward them for the war effort. that would help fw a lot.i would now take this thread a different way, i think we should limit wear decing on fw corps not expand it. fw is in some ways about rp. this means that the focus should be on attacking the enemy not dealing with any petty bunch of bullies that want to get their jollies shooting some new to pvp pilots.to this same end i think an effort should be made to limit the corporations allowed to participate in fw. a faction standing is all well and good but the mechanic is to easy for pirate corps that want to bully noobs to get aroudn it and use this as a fresh hunting ground. cosmo i have spoken with you often in the past with a few different characters and i respect you so do not take this wrong but this proposal is doing nothing but putting more bullies with clubs amongst the baby seals. to fix fw you need to fix the system so the focus is the fw and not the various side aspects. give the players a reason to fight for their faction not give more players easy targets. keep the alliances out of fw. if they want to take part in the fw mechanice they can start a sister corp that allows their members entry and give them allied access to their alliance. i mean the entire idea reaks of destroying the concept of fw when you think of it. using sf as the example, they want to kill amarr supporters. great then run out into 0.0 space and take on cva, but in faction war these supporters are supposed to be supported directly by the various factions. would the amarr really let a petty bunch of pilots run muck over their people? if you want to bew in fw then be in it, not playing on the edge. pick a faction and make a stand, not pick and choose which targets get you the best publicity at the time.so as someone that has played both sides of the amarr/matar war, no i was never a spy and yes i was in two different characters at different times. i can tell you that i see no benefit in this proposal for the concept of fw. in fact i would go so far as to say if this was adopted i would never play fw since if i wanted that level of action i could go to 0.0 space and things would be celaer of who my enemies where.the fw concept as it stands is solid, it just needs fleshing out and some moree control added. do not alter it into another version of 0.0"
7/29/2009,check the amarr militia killboards bud.
7/29/2009,on the other hand people would be more willing to play eve and go on fleet ops because they wouldn't have to face 30 soul numbing jumps each way to get in on the action leading more people to play the game and stay subscribed.
7/29/2009,"i don't support because this whole thing can be resolved by rebalancing the price structure.something like: 100%/50%/25% as someone suggested would work pretty well. as the dev blog stated, small rigs are slated to be between 100k-1m, but if you think about it...it's either a whole ship or a single rig for a ship that will die quickly regardless of what rigs it has on it.in a way, the rigs seem to balance themselves out because almost all rigs are percentages; i.e, an armor pump rig won't give a frigate 10k more armor hp; it would give something like 100-200. now tell me, is that worth the potential cost of another ship you could buy? this may not make a difference for the rich, but for people who try to conserve every single isk (like myself), it's a huge difference. small ships get blown up quicker, so you end up spending more isk fitting ships anyway."
7/29/2009,"ah, but a speed rig of 10 % will benefit a frigate considerably more than a battleship. you can't argue straight numbers, b/c not all ships are equal in the same regaurd. 10% more speed on a frigate can break tracking just like 10% more armor rep on a battleship can break some ships dps advantage. do you know what 10% more armor on a frigate is like when missiles are in play? have you ever shot an afterburner based armor tanked retribution with heavy missiles?"
7/29/2009,in short: agreed.resized rigs need to be looked at very closely again prior to implementation.
7/29/2009,supported. not like a support fleet can help the miners much if they get bbq'd by snipers to begin with.
7/29/2009,"there used to be an alliance that did pretty good for itself, living in low sec behind a scouted pipe, while they did missions and mined inside. it took some scouts, a good location, while still they weren't free from disaster, they gave themselves a higher chance to make isk/live there without much threat.i can't remember their names, but living or operating in low sec takes more effort than endlessly sitting in high sec wishing you could go there, waiting for ccp to fix low sec.not supported. becoming more dedicated as a corp/alliance, is the only really fix for this."
7/29/2009,i can't find the delayed local issue on either of the sites.
7/29/2009,the proposal is to allow the titan and the black op ship types to lock on cyno generators and open the jump portal to the pos cyno generator.
7/29/2009,quoted for truth.
7/29/2009,"t2 ships need to be far more expensive still, that 300m+ sounds like a pretty good starting point."
7/29/2009,supply and demand. sorry.
7/29/2009,still distribution of moons & weight in industrial process sucks.
7/29/2009,"yea, complaining about an issue that is player base driven isn't going to solve much. too many people get rich and fund their efforts throughout eve in this manner.not supported."
7/29/2009,which drawback are you referring to?
7/29/2009,he's referring to specific skill meant to improve an inherit disadvantage to a weapon system. controlled burst for example lowers the cap necessary to fire laser and hybrid weapons. rapid fire in missiles reduces the rate of fire for all missile systems. projectile weapons do not get a weapon specific skill like this.
7/29/2009,"just for reference, i believe the missile skill you're referencing is ""rapid launch,"" which gives -3% rof per level. turrets do have a similar version, which is actually named ""rapid firing,"" which gives -4% rof per level.as for the other two points, i endorse them with every fiber of my rustbucket being."
7/29/2009,you have my duct-tape.
7/29/2009,give the ghetto people some love too
7/29/2009,duct tape has feelings too!
7/29/2009,"wasnt there something that ac hit better at the edge of falloff, so you go a bit further off you will run out of the lasers absolutely short falloff and they wouldnt hit at all?- there are skills which increase falloff, something that autocannons benefit most as they got the biggest base falloff. you broke your own argument here.trajectory analysis: ""advanced understanding of zero-g physics. 5% bonus per skill level to weapon turret accuracy falloff.""- as a side note: rapid fire would be a turret skills: ""skill at the rapid discharge of weapon turrets. 4% bonus per skill level to weapon turret rate of fire."". missile uses rapid launch. so the rapid fire benefits projectiles too.cant really support this as it stands. (and before you start bashing. yes i use projectiles.)edit: added falloff skill"
7/29/2009,falloff advantage is a myth!the mael for example only starts to outdamage a hyperion with same damage mod numbers (usign that just to compare directly weapons) at 42 km!!!under 42 km the blaster ship stilloutdamages the ac one! that both using long range t2 ammo. with 1 extra damage mod on maelstrom only it outdamages the blaster up to 4km.. then drops behind... up to 30 km.... aa yeahh so much for the range advantage.the apocalypse (the damm no damage bonus ship) outdamages the maelstrom (again with same damage mod number) from 15 km up to well up to infinity!!!!!the abaddon outdamages from zero to where the sun stops shinning.so no ac falloff doe snot give any reasonable scenario advantage.ac would need to be like 40% larger to give us a realistic advantage over blasters.... won't even dream of lasers.
7/29/2009,ac's are gimped.ccp doesnt care.train amarr.
7/29/2009,"those weapons take capacitor, minnie guns do not. that would be like suggesting missiles are lacking this type of skill as well, even though they don't take cap. and to be honest, you should be happy you're minmatar and don't have to train it.not supported."
7/29/2009,"seishi maru, do you have the numbers also for short range ammo?"
7/29/2009,why should it? it`s all chance based. 50% base chance to hit for tempest/mael using barrage vs 100% for geddon with scorch on 36 km is no good at all.===signed. somenthing needs to be done
7/29/2009,"quite a few folks have done the math regard this as well as actual trials done show that the damage done at falloff follows the start path of all weapons having falloff. because of our supposed ability to fight in falloff, our damage is nerfed again if we actually do so.second, as it currently stands, if both pilots have equal skills and using similar style ammo (amarr navy multifrequency versus rf emp l), the mega pulse laser t2(base optimal of 24km, falloff of 6km = 30km base) can hit a minmatar pilot with their best 800mm autocannons t2 (base optimal of 4.8km, falloff of 16km = 20.8km base). in order to hit at all, a minmatar pilot would have to be in the amarr's optimal ranges. this is true for all t2 pulse weapons. even if you switched out the ammo for the longer range proton l ammo, you would still be in the optimal range for the pulse weapons.that being said, you are partially correct because you could outrange hybrid weapons in falloff.thank you darius and seriously for seeing my mistake regarding rapid fire and rapid launch, it has been fixed.in regards to the acs benefiting most from the trajectory analysis, this is true.. however, this is cancelled out by the fact that laser and hybrid weapons get an equal bonus with the sharpshooting skill. and to add yet another insult to injury.. the sharpshooting skill is a 2x training modifer, while the trajectory analysis is a 5x traning modifer (if my math is right, that means traj a is 250% longer to train than sharpshooting).for additional mathmatical data: large projectile/tempest issueedit: spelling errors, giving credit where credit is due, and additional data on lasers/hybrids"
7/29/2009,"i am not minmatar i am caldari.there is no way the systems can be balanced when two of the three systems have a skill that helps them and ignores the third. either projectiles are more powerful than hybrids and lasers if you don't have controlled bursts or they are only balanced when you max out controlled bursts.all the other gunnery skills buff all the weapon systems. as far as i can tell this, the the swap of three arty calibers for ac's, and lasers idiotic design are the only glaring omissions of a specific system in the entire game. i feel both are balance issues which can be correlated with available data pretty easily. hell the focus on ac's for minmatar would make you think ccp intended for them to be the brawlers but it sure doesn't work out that way.for example lets look at a common mael vs a blaster rokh(imaginary) fit.8 800mm's 8 neutrons3 metastasis rigs ""4 gyro's 3 mag stabs2 invuln fields ""1 co-processor 2 rcu's1 mwd ""1 cap booster ""1 warp disruptor ""1 x-large shield booster ""4 berserker's 5 valkyrie'sthe maelstrom isn't bad but as a brawler it suffers bigtime from being incapable of fitting a good tank and maintaining the mwd, point, and web/sensor booster combo that you can do in an abaddon or hyperion. all the while it can't do anywhere near the dps of a gank fitted abaddon or hyperion and has a smaller tank than a similarly kitted abaddon, hyperion, or rokh. a similarly kitted blaster rokh has 11k more ehp and only 154 less dps. this of course is only if the two ships are setting at optimal ranges. unfortunately for the mael pilot his optimal is only 3km's with hail and the rokh is 10km's with void. i see this as a pretty fair fight between two good pilots between a sniper frame and a brawler frame which just doesn't make sense. the rokh would probably lose but the fact that it could hang pretty well is just crazy when it shouldn't come close. any good abaddon or hyperion kit would have a webber or sensor booster rather than a cap charger and the mael would get flat owned. in a fleet battle anyone flying anything minmatar is already at a disadvantage to any ship in its tier kitted for its role. the rokh and and scorpion don't really apply, the dom and apoc can take a phoon, the tempest is the worst bs in the game, and the hyperion and abaddon can take a mael pretty easy.normally with only 3 tiers someone wasn't going to have a top bs in a tier but with the rohk and scorpion not even being applicable its pretty sad that the minmatar are 3rd in two tiers and 4th in tier 2. of course these ranks are my opinion and every ship has a counter but fitted per role the minmatar bs's lose every time.one way or another controlled bursts makes the three systems unbalanced in game at some point or other so that point can't be disputed."
7/29/2009,"there's a popular opinion floating around that all weapons systems should be equaland to lesser extent - that all ships should be equali think it is a wrong direction for eve, we should have greater diversity, stronger sets of advantages and disadvantages.i do want to see some kind of minmatar ship boost, but i don't want it to be in form of more gun dps. minmatar simply aren't supposed to be the dps race.what i think is valid is to take the significant disadvantages of minmatar weapons and argue for stronger advantages in other aspects of minmatar ship performance.the state of the game is such that there has been too much nerfing/boosting that erases sets of advantage/disadvantage by averaging out and homogenizing everything. we need less of that."
7/29/2009,"i agree with ephemeron. while projectiles do underperform at the battleship level, they should not be fixed by making autocannons into longer-ranged blasters, or artillery should not become railguns."
7/29/2009,yery nice.i disregard most of the changes to make all of the ui moveable and feature rich.simplicity wins. adapt or leave.i can't help feeling they are growing the game to the point it becomes barely manageable / playable for all the features.
7/29/2009,i can only support you once per thread and i was the first supporteralso the new forum protection breaks the link
7/29/2009,just having them reuse the freighter model again would mean that this could be done very easily. i'm not sure about a freighter being able to be both an awesome item carrier as well as awesome ship carrier due to their already low cost and high utility.
7/29/2009,"a simple freighter with a ship hangar instead of a cargohold would fit the bill.no new skill, simply a second ship in the same class."
7/29/2009,"the most likely course they would take is just like you and vankul suggest, a new ship of the same model and skills with a ship hangar instead of a cargo hold. really though, i don't think that allowing a single freighter to configure between one or the other would be too much. it could either haul goods, or it could haul ships, but the two would be mutually exclusive on any given trip. of course this would still require extra coding for a new game mechanism, so it would be much faster and easier to make a new freighter with a large ship maintenance bay."
7/29/2009,venkul please .i prefer a new ship simply because it will add a new item to build and give something extra for the market.naturally it would use the same kind of components of a regular freighter but in different numbers.
7/29/2009,sourcei like the rig idea. it could possibly work on both freighter and jump freighter. also it saves art department lot of work on new model/textures.
7/29/2009,"i've done this proposal before... and a lot of people kinda made some good points and alot made a mess of things and many went off some place else.so to make this simple and straight forward... i'm not interested in doing anything else... just simply this.coding wise it should be simple...if your training a skill... say warp drive operation v.and you want to start training jump drive operation i.your going to finish warp drive operation v in 5 hours but your unable to inject the jump drive skill due to the fact you don't meet the perquisites.this forces you to train other skills and delays your planned training.i propose that we be allowed to inject skills that can be trained so long as the prerequisites are met within the 24 hour skill queue period.now for that begging question of ""what if you change your mind""if you try to change your skill queue.... and you don't meet the prerequisite skills for injecting the skill to begin with... you lose the skill.much like implants.this forces you to make careful choices... i'm sure some of you will cry over it.. but there is simply no way around the exploit.ccp is not likely to allow free injection of skills because of the potential abuse factor... so please don't ask for it here.. make a seperate thread for it.this is a compromise... a fair one at that.... and i'd be content with just this minor annoyance put to rest.no more... no less.pros: one less pain in the ass to deal with.cons: honestly... the only one is if you inject a skill and change your mind and you end up out a good deal of isk... well you only have yourself to blame."
7/29/2009,"yes, please.i am so tired of having to put in ""filler"" skills just so i can make sure i don't lose training time.frankly, the queue should have been this way in the first place."
7/29/2009,"supportedthe proposed idea wouldn't be hard to implement at all.anyone that decides to whine about losing a skill just because they dropped the training of the prereq skill /needed/ to lose that skill.. ""what did we learn here today?""and if ccp thinks that the above would be an actual issue, then fine, make the skill turn back into a book, whatever."
7/29/2009,supported
7/29/2009,too much work for something that will delay your goal by less than a day and occurs rarely. you will be training another useful skill during that time anyway.
7/29/2009,supported. allowing to train a skill when the prereq is in training and will be done within 24 hours is common sense.
7/29/2009,"if your going to say why your not supporting it.. at least bother to put some effort into it.to put it into terms your able to understand... the time you spend training that other skill... is time wasted when you could ""legally"" training the skill you wish to inject.if you can't see that... then your obviously new to the game. if your not new... then give it some time... you will grow frustrated soon enough."
7/29/2009,"i did say that the time it would take to implement this is simply not worth it. i even provided two reasons.1. this happens rarely and pushes back your skill completion by less than 24 hours.2. since you're training another skill during that time, you don't loose any training time. you might get to your current goal a few hours later, but you will get to your next goal a few hours faster. you don't waste any time at all.this doesn't frustrate me at all, simply because it happens so rarely and doesn't matter anyway, as i said in my 2nd point. i understand your point and think it's a good idea, but it's not worth the time required to make it."
7/29/2009,supporting.
7/29/2009,"either implement this or put serious restrictions on the sell/buy order forums, as in only items that can not be sold using ingame tools (such as services) can be sold using those forums."
7/29/2009,"hi,i think almost all alliances in eve that has a jb network has problems tracking the jb network.perhaps a good addition to the game would be a jb network fee. this fee would be calculated based on the liquid ozone consumption of a given ship and subtracted of the char (with a warning message that can be disabled if required).the jb can be configured to charge for the fee by lo or not.this would bring the concept of the jb to something much higher than it is.- jb could be public and allowed to be used by anyone (and even perhaps shown on the overview)- this would help alliances to prevent or even charge the enemies that try to use its own jb network. knowing the password wouldn<U+FFFD>t be enought.just a few comments about the issue... but i think the idea can be developed further.att,yu lee."
7/29/2009,"extensive jb networks are really bad for small scale pvp. only the large scale fleet battles benefit.eve should be more restricting on jb networks, with much higher costs. and jb itself should be much more vulnerable to small roaming gangs."
7/29/2009,"supported, with a ""ram"" that does what ""approach"" does now."
7/29/2009,"best idea since 'pos fuel packs!"""
7/29/2009,if not a column on the overview how about an extra filter (the same ones that filter in fleet/corp/alliance/wreck/wreck viewed/etc)?this makes it easier for logistics pilots (sup?) to focus on their task.
7/29/2009,"anything that makes setting up, maintaining, sieging, or blowing up poses easier. signed."
7/29/2009,pretty much this.
7/29/2009,"i whole heartily give this my support, ccp you *really* need to put a little more work into the permission system, its convoluted and unnecessarily so. i have faith in you as developers, and really, this is quite honestly the best mmo i've ever played, but we need this."
7/29/2009,support
7/29/2009,1
7/29/2009,"i don't support yet another one of your proposals. i find you bash other opinions all the while one of your's fails from the start. the amount of dps you can get with even focused medium pulse and faction ammo on that low fit is enough damage from something the floats around 20 to 25m isk.it's a battlecruiser, there are only 2 of them, you can't seperate roles, or specify to much difference in them. if you don't like amarr train something else."
7/29/2009,"the proph is a durable beast. it just doesn't fit into a ""need to be on top of the damage dealers list at my corps pvp gank ventures"" attitude."
7/29/2009,"i know that i need to tick it to agree, but i would like to see an actual proposal to what the boost should be :).i understand that the proph lacks in tanking/buffer ability right now, but an added bonus + a tweak to armor amount/whatever could increase that role to where it should be.about the tier argument.look at any cruiser or frigate line. you will obviously notice the general increase of use/ability as you go up the tier line.generally the tier 2 bc is better than its tier 1 counterpart with some exceptions (such as the increased possible shield tank with the cyclone).tier 3 bs are all gank ships with high dps that cannot as easily be matched by their lower tier counterparts (caldari are an exception, as their ""fleet"" bs is tier 3 and not tier 2). a tier 3 bs should be able to destroy its tier 1 counterpart easily (with the exception being caldari again with the scorp). the teir 2 ships are fleet ships."
7/29/2009,there was a comparison table on eve files some months ago that compared prophecy to other t1 bc in same class and to all it was inferior. it realy need to be looked at.
7/29/2009,once you've seen them can we have evemail updated and alot of the basic problems fixed?
7/29/2009,how about a cyno jammer module that consumes strontium clathrates and effects an entire grid?
7/29/2009,thats also very possibly and doable. the idea is to just give us the tools to have a local cyno jammer whether its anchored or module base really doesnt matter to me
7/29/2009,"supported.i personally like the idea to revamp the black ops to a more important role.for example if you bring a black ops on the field, it can balance somewhat the battle. because a black operation can either go undercover and also jam on the other side sometimes."
7/29/2009,history:the problem was brought before the ccp during csm-ccp meetings 01 - 20-23 of june 2008. the topic in assembly hall concerning the same issue is locked due to inactivity (
7/29/2009,"to be fair to ccp, just because nothing has come out on the topic does not mean that they've done nothing. for all you or i know, it could be getting fixed in the next patch."
7/29/2009,think about it:- how many password should the system remember? 1-10-10? all those you have input this session? today? this week?- how much more lag when you have a fleet warping around in a system with one or more pos if the system should try 10 or 100 password every time you jump/move within the shield protection?sure it is annoying but i am unconvinced that this solution will be better.

7/29/2009,"tracking disruptors are kinda weak compared to other forms of ew.not at all saying that other froms of ew need to be nerfed, it's td that are underpowered, a lot.if you compare : damps and ecm have a chance to 100% disable a ship's targeting ability (only fof will work in that case, all scrambling, webing, ew effect is cut off).tracking disruptors reduce the efficiency of turrets (usually not disabling them totally, even in situations where it would be the most efficient).in most cases, you'll find it's better to have a damp ship than a td ship. damps are already not the best stuff around, so it shows to the crappiness of the td!the td values before they had scripts was not bad, using that value as a reference for the scripted value would be a start (it makes it half as efficient as it originally was, but that kind of boost is what it needs)."
7/29/2009,"you can't be serious. ever hit a gunboat with a tracking disruptor? they are totally disabled. kill their drones and then slowly grind them down as they wouldn't hit you anymore.and at the situations where you fit td (500-20000m), damps would be quite useless. especially when fighting bigger ship which would be still able to lock you even after you damp them."
7/29/2009,"i was wondering how long after the ecm nerf a topic like this would take to appear. longer than i expected tbh.so in essence, the complaint is that an ew module is effective.um.... yeah. deal with it.(not supported)"
7/29/2009,"they don't do anything to drones, either.and they take up a valuable midslot"
7/29/2009,"i fly a pilgrim with 2 td.so, td would be very useful when on long range, but the optimal of td isn't that high (damps either, but whenever it succeeds you've got to lock again).on shorter ranges, reducing the range of blasters or autocannons is useless, and reducing their tracking is not that effective unless they are shooting something the size of a cruiser.using 2 td on tracking scripts doesn't avoid a megathron to hit an orbiting bs, it has basically no use at all. there's not many options to disable a megathron shooting another bs, tding doesn't help too much, neuting has limited effect because of cap boosters, damping is useless.i'm very sorry to say that, but we're left again with ecm as the only effective option.td are too weak in their current state to be a proper cover for a bs being shot by another bs. trying to td smaller ships shooting larger ships turns to be totally useless.so, yes, the td can be effective and sometimes cripple a gunboat, but it's very situational, it only works on larger ships shooting smaller ones, only if the target being shot moves fast enough and you're still defenceless against anything else than turrets.ps : i lol at the idea of td on drones, what will i do, cause one drone to miss half its shots? it's only 10% of the drone firepower."
7/29/2009,"to those of you who tell me to quit complaining about them, i am the one using them 90% of the time rather then being on the receiving end. they are useful inside 10km against autuocannons, you can web scramble a hurricane then sit at 7km and your 100% outside of there optimal+falloff or so deep into there second falloff increment as to make very little difference.i'm not complaining about how effective a td is on a arbitrator, (awesome ship btw) i am saying that they are too useful on unbonused ships.the difference between a td from a bonused ship and a td from a unbonused ship is too narrow.but whatever you guys must not be using them, try it out. i promise you the results are much better then they should be."
7/29/2009,"obviously, you fight very poor hurricane pilots :). note that the following comes from the td rifter being my primary ship of choice. look me up at gallente.eve-kill.net.lets take small ships: a webbing rifter won't be able to kill a good td rifter pilot (who changes scripts and ammo types properly), but the webbing rifter can always escape. due to speed.autocannons, ruptures, hurricanes. neuts and a plethora of light drones destroy rifters/af's that have td's. can't td (or rep!) without cap. let alone shoot for the appropriate races. you mention ac's in your examples, but it's the minnie boats i fear the most as a td pilot due to the utility highs used for neuts.add in drone boats and missiles (assault missiles make small ships cry), manual flying (kite the pilot around 2-3km in a small ship makes the range script meh and the tracking speed useless since you need to keep up, and the recent agility nerf, td's really aren't overpowered. the right setup, and/or manual flying, destroys a gang of td frigate sized hulls.if you are going to complain about a race hurting from td's, it is not minmatar by any means. utility slots for neuts, and lots of drones does not a ship afraid of frigate hulls with td's make. neuts are the counter to td small ships. if you have equal ship sizes, webs allow for disengaging due to slowing down the chaser. maybe amarr have it rough with no drones nor utility highs, but 1) you can always still put a neut there2) lots of people say that amarr as op atm, but look, there's a counter!finally, this really applies to small gang warfare. larger gang, td's become rather useless since if the targets separate, they can find something to snipe. or focus multiple webs on one tding ship at a time and destroy it."
7/29/2009,"did i claim i was killing hurricanes in a rifter? its possible in a jag, but i don't think the rifter has it in it.no i said td's are effective against autocannons even inside 10km.webs do not help you to completely disengage, webs help you to get out of that initial 10kms range, if they are still putting damage on you and the same speed once unwebbed you won't end up getting the required 24km away from them. neuts only help you inside of 12km.apparently the majority of the community is fine with td's being as effective as they are on unbonused ships whatever, i thought i would point it out that they are a little too effective on undonused ships.edited to remove unnecessary crap."
7/29/2009,"just fyi, my post was supposed to relate to all frigate sized hulls, not just the rifter."
7/29/2009,vs mega 2 range scripts and orbit at 7-10k. game over.if he gets too close switch to tracking speed and rub hull with it. tracking is **** at that range without the td already. the 2 td will make it toast.

(actually, i'd like to hear sounds at my ship and at the camera, so for example if i'm watching an enemy ship orbit, i'd hear the missile fire, and a few seconds later i'd hear it hit. this allows sound to give situational awareness that even the hud sometime's can't provide.)"

7/30/2009,"i like the idea of crews. one, it makes sense. two, everybody complains about somebody getting a free lunch, and having to pay for or support a crew fixes that. ccp has already provided cosumables and commodities that look exactly like something that is intended for a crew. foodstuffs, supplies, booze, dancers (party ship!). you get the idea. crews can also fit into the ""cost-consequence"" concept that makes this game popular and challenging. also, they would be an isk sink for both the economy, cutting inflation, and an isk sink for all players that takes the ""endless isk machine"" element out of the game that also damages the economy. here is .02 isk from me on this for this that could help the crews concept. 1. crews need supplies and commoditys that keep them alive, taking up cargo space. 2. the longer in space, the more tired less efficient a crew is. no more free lunch in wh exploitation. 3. running out of supplies means a starving and demoralized crew which means a less efficient chip. the ships stats should suffer.4. crews would need consumer goods, spirits, etc, to be more happier. therefore items sticked up for ""needs"" and items for morale would be different and a pilot would have to balance this. 5. crews are lost or reassigned when a ship is destroyed, therefore it is more incentive to not get a ship blown up so often. this could balance the ship capability between the careful missioner running lowsec with an experienced crack crew and a pirate who loses ships and crews constantly and has a ship staffed with green horns.6. players who lose a lot of ships would have to pay more for a crew than a player with a better reputation. who wants to work for a captain who loses scores of ships? it would cost more. therefore those who fly poorly would be punished for it. 7. to keep with the storyline, amarr ships could have slaves, but the drugs used to control them actually mean something in the game and become sought after as commodities, making drug running a career in eve (which seems like it was once intended but never picked up). 8. crews should have drug boosters like capsuleers, but of course there is legality, addiction, etc. 9. for the drama, when a ship is at that level of structure where it loses control, it would be interesting to see escape pods punching out. but use of smartbombs and killing crew wholesale would at this point be a heinous security hit."

7/30/2009,"well..... you were describing what would happen if there were more wardecs, but really, that is a description of the current reality.in the current situation the 3rd forces only have to worry about 1 target, while the fw need to worry about all 3rd forces.the less wardecs rather then more wardecs approach could work, but surely there is a balance that doesn't involve locking 3rd forces out.as for alliances, the sister corp setup doesn't work all that well. it becomes a hassle when you need those pilots for defence of a wardec'd parent corp. in certain situations it becomes necessary to transfer all pilots from one corp to another to get around the games limitations. kinda defeats the purpose of the corps even being related in the first place. an alliance wrapping these very much related corporations would make the whole setup a lot easier to manage while opening up options for greater industrial support of fw."

7/30/2009,20% per level increase in projectile weapon capacity
7/30/2009,"i would like to reference 3 active threads on the subject.ships and modules - tempest needs changingfeatures and ideas discussion - minmatar battleships, and their rolesfeatures and ideas discussion - how bad ac really are.... proof inside!"
7/30/2009,"i wouldn't mind something else as an option.here are the problems as i see it though.minmatar are designed for close combat. they are ""generally"" the fastest, most maneuverable, smallest sig radius, and only race with three close range weapon variants. the problem is that there are very few examples of this being a successful design philosophy because its rarely enough of an advantage to get them over the proverbial hump. even worse is when they are not the best at these categories.look at the successful frames like the rifter. it's 19% faster than the next fastest frigate, 8% smaller sig radius than the next smallest, and 9% less inertia.compare that to a failure like the tempest. it's 14% faster, 15% smaller signature radius, and 4.5% less inertia.the problem is what works on a frigate doesn't necessarily work on a battleship. they just don't fill the same role in a fleet. these additional stats and the bonus's are nice but when its squaring off against three frames that can be great tanks it's just not enough. it's the weakest tank with the weakest guns.even worse is that other than directly changing the ships stats any skill or module options open up the possibility of making other good minmatar ships overpowered with the exception of bringing ac's up to snuff. if you remove the rate of fire bonus the dismal dps gets lower. i would love to see a module that reduces signature radius but that could significantly alter the playing field. it is the only ewa that has no counter. this could actually do the trick for the failing missile boats and minmatar ships. however if you make it a high slot it further nerfs the dps of the minmatar ships, if you make it a med slot it hurts the generally crappy tank, and with the fitting nightmare on minmatar ships a low slot means sacrificing a damage/tracking mod or sacrificing at the damage or tank level in high or midslot fittings. not to mention how this would effect on the other races ships. if they were easier to kit this would be a non-issue but of course they are also the hardest to kit(generally).almost the whole fleet is a mess. imho the weakness of large ac's is most of the problem for the bs's though."
7/30/2009,"just a quick reminder first, remember if you support this topic, select the ""support this topic"" check box.. you can go back and select it later as well.i think a direct comparision needs to be addressed so that the issue can be seen more clearly.the t2 mega pulse laser versus t2 800mm autocannonsadvantages:- has a higher damage modifier- 5x the optimal range- instant clip reload- ammo rarely needs reloaded.equals:- rate of fire- fittings requirements are within 5%.disadvantages:- 25% less tracking- 50% less falloff- uses capacitort2 neutron blaster cannon versus t2 800mm autocannonadvantages:- larger clip- much higher damage modifier (almost by 33%)- higher optimal range (75% longer optimal)equal:- rate of fire- fitting requirements are within 5% of each other- near equal tracking (hybrid superior by .001 rad/sec)disadvantages:- 40% less falloff- uses capacitort2 seige missile launcher versus t2 800mm autocannons (a full comparision with the torp launcher will take more time than i have right now).advantages:- easier fitting requirements- never misses- ammo is pure/changeable damage, not divided by various damage typesequal:- no cap usedisadvantages:- almost double rate of fire- shorter overall range- not instant damage"

7/30/2009,"as a minmatar pilot by choice, i have to support this. minmatar artillery and autocannons need a buff, but especially autocannons. the easy way to fix this would be to drop the terribly small clip sizes for artillery and to improve the actually performance of large acs either by improving the optimal, but preferably by improving both optimal and falloff. it doesn't have to be a huge amount, but 5% to both would be a positive improvement.the upside for ccp is that they wouldn't have to have their statistician ask embarrassing questions as to why no one flies minnie bses.p.s. for good measure, fix the typhoon's armour. 5% here would be much appreciated as well."

7/30/2009,"easier yes... rational no.you'll be allowing pilots to inject skills sequentially without restraint.there would be no more risk of forgetting to get that book... or transportation of skill books from ""safer areas"" to dangerous areas.the only way it keeps it reasonably balanced is allowing pilots to inject the skill in question so long as you finish the preq within the 24 hour queue period of the window.... thus allowing you to train the skill you wish to train next.if you don't finish training that skill.. the new skill is deleted.i think it would also be fair to suggest that you could change your mind about the new skill but only if your going to finish training the preg regardless... in that case you just remove it and insert what you want to train.all of which must happen within in the 24 hour window."

7/30/2009,"i dont see any problems with jumpbridges as how they are now. jumpbridges are more for small fast transportation (constellation station to constellation station). big fleets cant use them really unless u have a hauler next to every jumpbridge to refuel it. besides, who's using jumpbridges for large fleets with all those titans ingame? titanbridge ftw...i see the idea were the op is going to. blue jumpbridges can always be used if u have the right password. if your not too lazy u can scan every jumpbridge out. about your fee idea... i think that is something for alliance high command level, they own moons, so they pay for that and they need to make sure their jumpbridge system is properly working inline with logistics refueling. it comes down to organisation within the alliance your in.jumpbridges as they are now are perfect for skipping fast a few systems to get out of settled constellations. see it as a bonus for holding sov. /not supported"
7/30/2009,"this.make fitting req. of jb stupidlly large so a pos can barelly fit a couple of medium/small batteries and some ewar, and reduce the shield hp a big deal so a small roaming gang can incap them.this would force owners defending their networks and forcing battles around them."
7/30/2009,"makes sense - not being allowed to charge a fee is kind of silly. and while making bridges vulnerable to roaming gangs is a nifty idea, it's an unrelated topic - make a separate thread for it."
7/30/2009,"personally i would have thought that if ships were traveling a zillion times faster than light, crashing into stuff would be a common occurrence. but back to the topic.im going to say not supported.it is one of the few ways you have of catching extremely fast ships racing to gates if the muppet flying it wont manually slow down (or setting autopilot jump) to prevent him/herself from bouncing back into the jaws of death."

7/30/2009,"sorry for posting here as a new player, i saw the thread that suggested players be at least one month old before posting topics in here but i felt this warranted a discussion and was directed to start a topic on it in the forums by isd tipene.my issue is with the ""god mode"" of the concorde police. i find it very unrealistic and abusive that players cannot under any circumstances win a war against the concorde police. someone stated that in order to defeat a single concorde ship you must be exploiting. i realize without this rule a high security zone would be at risk but it is just bad design to stand no chance whatsoever in a war with the concorde police. all zones should be able to be controlled by the players."
7/30/2009,"i half agree. i still think there should be some high sec space as is, but it should be centered around the main empires, not just the four main races, but the khanid and the other sub races too. each of these empire's space should be 100%, surrounded by low sec space. to achieve this, my suggestion would be to purely limit concord to .8, .9, and 1.0 space alone, adding .5, .6, and .7 to low sec territory. this would still leave ample space for carebears, but amount to massive profits for daring traders who would risk region to region travel."
7/30/2009,"the proposal i made is to prevent insta-alt spamming.obviously your not that type of personality so don't take it personal.as for concord...this is a mechanic that has been in place for years.it's also in the eula... to debate something like that is not going to win any points.there are many ways to win a ""war"" with any number of players.you just have to find the one that suites you best.1: make a corporation and war-dec them.2: suicide gank them (you'll get concorded but that doesn't stop you from doing the ""act""3: hunt them down in low-sec/null-secthere are many creative ways to get it done... but asking ccp to turn off ""god mode"" as far as concord... won't work.this is eve online... not pvp-online.... not carebear online or hello kitty.it's for all styles of play of all kinds...if it gives favor too much to one side... you effectively ruin the game on a grand scale.welcome to the classic war between those who wish to kill unendingly... and those who wish to make a living off of selling the very weapons of war."
7/30/2009,"pretty much what drake said. i think you'll find this proposal gets split pretty much down two lines - those of us who enjoy playing eve the way it is, and the people who would like to turn it into a demolition derby.the problem is neither group can survive by itself. they each depend on the existence of the other, and this is a fine balance that ccp has managed to walk quite well, truth be told. what you're proposing would essentially turn the game in goonswarm online - which is not a game i am interested in playing."
7/30/2009,"my issue is not with declaring war on other players. i am talking about declaring war on concord themselves. policing should be done by the players, not some artificial gods which are invulnerable. for a new player like me it destroys the immersion and just leaves me feeling like i'm paying to be a slave under a tyrant that cannot be defeated.that's not the player-driven environment that the game advertises itself as."
7/30/2009,"the problem is that players cannot really police eve online, just like raph koster experienced when he tried to have player-driven justice in ultima online, he found that it was impossible due to the fact that there cannot be permanent player-enforced consequences for those that break the law.in real life if you commit a crime you go to jail if you're caught.in an online game, you cannot have players ban other players from the game. and even if you could, that person can always come back with another ip address and other account."
7/30/2009,your taking it a little too literal here.first off... under whose judgment and authority?eve online is not the wild west where you bribe the local sherif and get away with murder.as a new player... your overwhelmed with the game and all the things you have to learn just to fly the damn ship.... your not interested in running for your life and avoiding the local pirate gang while getting robbed blind.concord's sole purpose in life is to enforce the high sec systems to allow those players who are not interested or not yet ready for the life of low-sec/null-sec to function as they see fit.keep in mind high sec is not safe... its just safer(tm).the player driven environment you seek is only achievable in null-sec... there you will find no law enforcement and you can pretty much do whatever the hell you want.otherwise the player driven environment is mostly economic based at best... everything you buy... use... destroyer... tends to be manufactured or pilfered or looted by a player like yourself.well.. not everything... but most things.. such as your ship for starters.all in all high sec is more like a starting point...i suggest you take some time to figure out the aspects of the game before you cast judgment on the system as it is now.
7/30/2009,"player-driven justice actually worked in the early days of uo(i was there). if you angered too many people you would be hunted down relentlessly.in real life if someone has the capability to amass a gigantic army no police force could stop them, because police aren't invulnerable in real life. i'm not talking about removing concord, only to have them able to be fought with a large enough force. it should be extremely difficult to pull off but not impossible like it is now.i'm also not talking about giving players the ability to ban other players, that would never work. bans should only be given to hackers and exploiters."
7/30/2009,sorry to be blunt... but this is not the game for you if that's what your seeking as a whole.all i can suggest is that you head on down to 0.0 space and you can enjoy the total freedom you seek.but that will never take place in high sec... however there are ways to get revenge if you **** off alot of people enough... trust me... there are ways.just isn't as direct as you think it is.reputation and honor are very valuable commodities...and tend to come in short supply.concord is not the one you should be worried about :)
7/30/2009,"ok, go out in rl and amass an gigantic army to take over the us. concord is not only police, it is an army, backed by all the empires as they want a certain level of safety. as already stated in other threads, if you want a realistic concord you should be capable of escaping or killing the local patrol, but then all your empire clones would be destroyed, all your empire assets would be seized by the police, you would be hunted and attacked at every gate, till you are caught and locked in a cell for 40 years or permanently killed. as that kind of realistic effects would destroy the game ccp has chosen unbeatable concord and little long term consequences of your actions."
7/30/2009,"raph also refused to implement a meaningful standings system in uo which made it impossible for players to tell at a glance who was friendly or not. someone commented above about ""goonswarm online"", but the truth is that life in goon controlled space is way less complicated than in empire. if someone is blue to me, i can probably trust them. if they're not, i certainly can't. there's no weird npc mechanics to deal with, just real justice served up by real people. if a goon screws a goon, he's out, end of story."
7/30/2009,the problem with this is the fallout that would ensue from fleets being impervious to concord. i would give it two hours from the time the patch that removed concords invulnerability till jita was a raging warzone from gate to gate.
7/30/2009,"that's just the tip of the iceberg.in all reality the market would literally crash.... maybe not all at the same time or in the same day.pvp'ers constantly ignore just how 1 ""stupid carebear"" can impact the entire game.(thumbs butterfly effect)that's valid theory folks... no doubt bout it... lot of people tend to have tunnel vision these days."
7/30/2009,those are good points. you're right i know a huge war would break out but only because the mechanic was there to begin with. it set up artificial boundaries which has impacted every other aspect of the game. if concord was controllable from the start the wars would have been fought already and the corporate alliances could have established their own empires throughout the universe.
7/30/2009,"and that would bge an absolutely horrible state of affairs. i join the game as a new player and before i even know how to fly my ship, i'm being accosted by some corporate pressgang saying if i don't fly with them, i'll be shot down everytime i undock.you'd kill the game, plain and simple."
7/30/2009,"no it didn't (i was there too). while it's possible our experiences were different due to the sharded nature of uo, i dont think so. the ""reds"" banded together quite effectively. with no shards in eve, it would be even less effective here. anarchy leads directly to tyranny when the strong take over because they can."
7/30/2009,it's ridiculous how some people here fail at arguing and providing arguments based on facts.
7/30/2009,"its a gamestop repeating yourself.eve is pvp, nonconsensual pvp is pvpthere are already consequences to shooting someone you're not 'allowed' to. stop trying to make it impossible, because that's what you're aiming for.this isn't wow, there are no safe zones (except docked) where you can get your character to and no one's allowed to hit you anymore.if you don't want pvp, log. even docked playing the market you have people out for your blood."
7/30/2009,"i'm well aware of the fact that it's a game. that's why i am using the approved process to bring something to the attention of the player's representatives that i don't agree with in the game mechanics. if this was real life, i'd have sued someone already.despite what other people may have said, this is not what i am aiming for. i am simply aiming to make suicide gankers suffer the same moment of pause when they undock as i do. it only seems fair. miners have to decide what to mine to maximize profits. manufacturers have to decide what to manufacture for the same reason. why should the suigankers get a pass on that decision just because they're being subsidized by the system?all i want is for the suicide gankers to have to think before they shoot. why are you so against leveling the playing field?"
7/30/2009,last i checked.. this thread is about revoking of insurance for getting concord'd.what the #### does this have to do with pvp?stop derailing the thread.... or go make your own thread about pvp'ing because this has nothing to do with it.
7/30/2009,"for some suicide gankers the idea is to make them not want to mine... that is the whole point in some instance.. yeah thats it.. with the prevalence of macro's invading every system, the only way to get the point across is to make their hulks and mackinaws go boom every 15 minutes.. they get the point and go somewhere else.. oh and btw you don't need to spend a lot of money to pop a tanked hulk or mack.. its almost a science.. and looting the wrecks is easy too, including your team's wrecks.. you just have to know what you are doing.. for a lot of gankers that do this professionally, removal of the insureance payment won't be that big of a deal... hulks and macks still go boom.. and the salvage from one of those is in the millions if you get the intact stuff.. plus the modules.. it all sells.."
7/30/2009,"i don't recall quoting you when i made that post.too many people here are equating in game mechanics to rl principles. who cares what a rl cop or insurance company would do? the cops and insurance companies don't make the game or the rules, ccp does.you seem to forget that a hulk can be suicide ganked by 2-3 destroyers in cheap t1 crap for a total loss of... ? even without insurance, its not going to stop anything.considering there are already plenty of ways in game right now to keep from being suicide ganked, why are you trying to get in game mechanics changed just to penalize one small section of the game? play the game."
7/30/2009,the heart of this issue is that the proponents dont want non-consensual pvp in empire.
7/30/2009,this.
7/30/2009,again.. what does this have to do with insurance voiding due to getting conocrd'ed?
7/30/2009,"i never suggested that it would stop suicide ganking. i suggested that it might the gankers think before they act. if they choose not to, that's not really my problem.you very nicely dodged answering the question you quoted. so i'll re-ask it. why are you bound and determined to not have this one mechanic changed, since it does indeed impact such a small part of the game. i mean if it's so small, it shouldn't matter, right? keep it as is, change it - shouldn't make any difference, since it's just a tiny little part of the game.i just want the job the gankers choose to follow to actually reflect it's true cost instead of having that occupation be subsidized.unless you'd like to propose to ccp that they start seeding the market with free minerals so my chosen occupation can be subsidized too?"
7/30/2009,"isn't insurance not the same as concord? meaning the insurance company could care less what you do with your ship, they're still going to pay for it if you have the coverage...."
7/30/2009,who are less than 1 month old as an player (on a per toon basis).if you've not noticed.... we've been getting hit with spam posts of a nasty nature.all you need to do is make an alt and you can instantly start posting without restraint.and as a forum admin myself (not these boards obviously)... i happen to know that your not exactly able to respond on-demand.and its going to get out of hand... until ccp decides to replace this miserable excuse of a forum board with something decent (phpbb anyone? let alone any others) i think it might make things a little better and require these idiots to put time and effort into there attacks.hell this could apply to all boards except those needed by rookie pilots for that matter.i'm sure a lot of you are going to whine and rant about alt's... but 1 month... well at least you had 30 days to think about it.flame away.
7/30/2009,how bout longer ... people who've actually have some experience with the game who are suggesting changes in it ....supported
7/30/2009,longer would be painful... i think 30 days is fair... but i get your impression.perhaps 2 to 3 months for assembly hall as far as making new topics....but after 30 days you can respond.problem is... its a bit of a can of worms issue.
7/30/2009,this^^^
7/30/2009,^^
7/30/2009,"i admit that some newbies will sometimes post stupid things in this forum, but in general it's pretty good. i don't agree with your proposal at all. i think everybody, whether they are a veteran player or a new player, deserves a voice in the assembly hall. if you feel that certain posts should be moved or closed, there's a nice little ""report"" link you can use. i have used it several times to report spam and moderators usually respond within the hour if they also judge the post to be inappropriate.stop being such an elitist. it's not because you have been playing for more than a few months that your ideas are necessary better than a new player.i have been playing this character for about 2 months, and i've made countless posts in this forum, most of which have received positive support. are you saying i shouldn't have been able to post at all? who are you to decide?"
7/30/2009,"the spam problems are happening on every board, not just ah. and i don't see it removing the problem of stupid proposals, because most of those are made by vets anyways."
7/30/2009,your calling me an elitist and yet you have the odacity to make such a baseless post?this has nothing to do with knowledge or experience... it has everything to do with keep the garbage from hitting the forums at full force.i've been playing a year thank you very much so i suggest you keep that in mind next time you start spitting fire.i don't know anything more than most pilots but i know enough to know that most people who start playing this game for the first 2 months think they know everything and start spitting all sorts of garbage on the boards.i've had to stop screaming outright to keep ccp from nailing my mouth shut : o pi also know that some people know better and don't do such foolish things... but they are not you and they are not the majority.this is to make sure that the privilege of posting here is done by someone who has put at least 30 days and not some random half assed idiot screaming about getting ganked because someone stole his jet can.
7/30/2009,no it doesn't... but it does eliminate about 50 to 75% of the problems that tend to come within the first 30 days : o)
7/30/2009,"lol! man, calm down. it's not your place to decide who should be allowed to post in this forum, period.right... and you're going to tell me that this comment is not elitist-ish? you're basically telling me i should be showing you some kind of respect because you have been playing for 1 year.okay, i'll stop you right there. again, who are you to define what constitute a bad post and what is not? who are you to judge? just because you don't agree with some proposals, doesn't mean they shouldn't have been posted in the first place.if you really feel that a thread doesn't have its place in this forum, use the damn report link and let the moderators decide, it's their job, not yours."
7/30/2009,"agree, this is a good idea. six months would be a good time imho."
7/30/2009,aren't you just being a bit hypocritical here?and your taking this a little too seriously... i suggest you back up and re-read my post carefully.i said people like you who know not to post garbagy things are not like you.the greater majority tend to go off the walls.now if you can't take a compliment like that... you got some serious issues.i also said that just because i've played for a year doesn't make me any smarter than the next guy... i also said people who've only played for a couple months tend to be very green.you don't need to bow down to me or anyone else... but i sure as hell won't bow down to your attitude.the issue is preventing insta-spam alts. not stopping people from being able to post.get it straight and stop assuming.
7/30/2009,"i doubt there is a need for shc approaches like ""ban 08's"" or similar.what the assembly hall needs is better moderation really, to differentiate threads. sofar the assembly hall is doing much better then many people anticipated tbh, but sometimes you see something wierd or something that just does not fit in with requirements for here."
7/30/2009,"for those unfamilar, ccp is working on some sort of system called cosmos to improve game communications ( email, contact list, etc )my biggest point here regards voice communications.i think currently the eve voice ""program"" is run separately on a different cluster then the main client does. i say this because i've had the game totally desync but have eve voice work until i am forced to restart the client.if ccp made eve voice an external application, you would gain the security of authentication ( corp / alliance based ) with the added stability of not being directly tied to the main client.adding this feature to out of game evemail access and chat, you could really add a valuable feature to the game.i do not initially see any game mechanic downsides, since almost everyone uses an out of game voice program at the moment since eve voice is tied to the stability of the main client, and you just cant lose voice comms if the cluster freezes up."
7/30/2009,"o/ shadowandlight, agree with you totally."
7/30/2009,i don't know about making it oog... but i do know eve voice is vastly terrible for a lot of my corp... we use vent as a result.making eve voice oog would be no different than using vent or teamspeak... kinda a waste of time.but it would be some sort of improvement for certain.
7/30/2009,what about eve voice doesnt work well for your corp? i find it pretty useful with more security. and the voice quality is excellent.
7/30/2009,welcome to the 25 to 40% of the games population.the problem is eve voice doesn't take into account every conceivable hardware configuration let alone security....and considering the ui sucks ass when it comes to making adjustments... vent is a far better choice... and in all honesty security is superior with vent due to the fact its on an entirely different server that won't go down when someone trips over an ethernet cable killing the db clusters running eve. :)that and voice comms can be adjusted by rank.teamspeak doesn't have the nice features that vent has... but they are working version 3... and its still better off as far as functionality.don't get me wrong.. eve voice is a great thing from what i've been told.. but when the vast majority of your corporation can't get it to work?there's a major problem there.so as i've said... any improvement is welcome here.
7/30/2009,"not supported. if you want true oog voice over communications, then use teamspeak or ventrilo.they can't make the voice client separate from the game client for the simple reason that voice channels work with chat channels. when you join voice, you actually join a specific channel (corp, fleet, alliance, etc...). an oog client wouldn't be able to easily sync with that info, so the problem would still be the same. if the main game client would be crash or disconnect, the voice client would lose sync and disconnect from the channel."
7/30/2009,"not sure if all this is possible, but i'd certainly like to try to get it. supported."
7/30/2009,"speaking from experience of probing over 100 missions/ss in lowsec with an alt using cov ops 4, probing skills all at 4, and sisters gear. even for a battleship, it would take me 2-3 scans (thats after finding target on directional - without directional it takes even more), and moving probes in between scans is another 10-20seconds added on the 6seconds scan time per scan - so were talking about atleast 40seconds of probs in space. if you dont scan atleast once every 30seconds in lowsec, you deserve to die.also, unless the pirates/mission busters come in with a cloaker, you'll see them on short range scan (go 1/2-1 au on scanner) and if there is a gate (there usually is) the cloaker will uncloak regardless. in non gate missions, you can always drop a can on the warp in and be safe. seriously, i agree that the hunted should have a chance - but that doesn't mean that the hunter needs to be gimped - it means the hunted needs to stop being a ****ing noob and understand that lowsec = danger, so be on your ****ing toes.not supported. supporting the removal of ""bad words"" filter though, cause thats the only way to get to carebears apperntly :)"
7/30/2009,"supported, it really is ridiculously fast."
7/30/2009,"ahh look its exlegion again.still trying make the game catering you.after failing in your first tryyou did improve:no attention csm.it didn't take you 2 days to notice you didn't support your own proposal.but:you still totaly fail at grasping the probing mechanics. it ""only takes 5 sec"" thats a joke right ? (deploying will take as long as this)bet you never used a probe to scan someone down in your whole eve life. please continue failing at playing eve.oh btw not supported."
7/30/2009,"relax, my man. im not posting this request to specifically **** you off. why are privateers and ex-privateers on such a hate-rage most of the time :\? first, i still would love for a csm to at least ask if the current probing mechanics is supposed to overlap in function with the onboard scanner. second, yes i probe. although not yet an expert, i probe plenty; mostly exploration sites. but lately ive been interested in probing ships, as i feel it is a little overpowered in its present form and would like to add my opinion on how to make it better for all sides involved, not just the prober. but in the end it is just an opinion that i dont expect everybody to accept or like. what i do expect is mature responses from all sides of the fence. in other words, if you have nothing nice to say but still feel compelled to add something to the discussion a simple no support will do. now, if you feel like adding an objective justification for your response that would be appreciated :). to get back on track, ill admit im not yet at the 5-second probe-and-retract time yet. my best record stands at 7 seconds and change (after letting my onboard scanner do most of the work), which on its own isnt too far off. but keep in mind some of my probing skills are still at level 4 and i am not using sisters combat core probes. i expect to be fully capable of probing someone down in less than 6 seconds within a few weeks, maybe a month. this translates to an alert prey having to spam his scan button every 5 to 6 seconds to even suspect theyre being probed."
7/30/2009,"the idea of fleet formations has been thrown around here and there over the past 5 years. usually after some discussion to decide what fleet formations would even be, the idea is put at the bottom of ccp's priority list and put off for a ""future"" release. the reason for this is no one ever comes up with a reason the 100's of man hours shouldn't be spent elsewhere. why program in a complicated new part of the game unless it really adds something? those people could of been making something more important for the game.this post is to put forward an idea that clearly outlines a goal for formations and hopefully gain public support to push the idea through to ccp in a way that makes it seem wroth the time and money for the outcome. as i think i've come up with a way fleet formations could be used to enhance eve, and not just become a sort of gimmick.safety in numbersfleet formations will be of two types. each serving a different goal with different strengths and weaknesses, keeping formations from becoming something have to do to stay competitive. while still serving to give tactical advantages if used correctly. to enter a formation one simply invites other to join or others right click on someone in range in their fleet and select join in formation. this way a player can ""hide"" behind another.the two types will beoffensiveanddefensiveoffensiveso your flying with a small fleet of 4 mates in cruisers when you come across a fleet of 4 ships. 1 hauler2 ecm boats1 battle cruiser with remote rep you try to take down the ecm 1st but they keep taking out your senors, and seems like there is just to way to break the hauler and get the yummy loot yolk inside. what do you do? you have everyone in the fleet form up into an offensive formation. this gives flight control to the leader and is done by right clicking the person you want to join, much like forming a fleet. right click, join offensive formation.your 4 ships now all share their sigradius decreasing their ability to avoid attacks due to transversal velocity. however what you lose in sigradius you gain in senor strength! adding 50% of the next ships senor strength type in the order down, with stacking penalties. so you put your highest at the top as to not lose the big bonuses. the offensive formation also increases the tracking of the whole formation by the level of skill the leader has in the offensive formation skill.you charge the ecm ship, together the ecm ship is unable to break your locks and you can take the two ecm ships out. however due to the increased sig radius you lose 1 cruiser. while you were fighting the enemy fleet noticed you got into formation and took it as an moment to split up. by forming a formation you lowered the area you could cover and the ecm ships lured you away form the hauler and the battlecruiser. the ecm ship and the battle cruiser get away. next time you should of keep another ship out free with lots of eccm to keep the hauler locked down. defensiveso your flying around with 2 ecm ships1 hauler1 battlecruiser 1 logisticsyou already lost your last ecm ships to a pirate gang of cruisers, so you've now brought a logistics ship along with you whose pilot has high formation skills. suddenly you are attacked! it's a group of 5 cruisers, back for blood!you waste no time in having everyone form up behind the logistics ship into a defensive formation!however in a defensive formation the smaller ships are allowed to set orbit speed or fly in a straight line following the defensive leader. while in a defensive formation all of the involved ships combine their sigradius (minus skill level 3%per skill) and becoming easier to hit like while in offensive. however, in a defensive formation, when the enemy locks on to one of the ships they lock on to one big target that is all of the ships combined."

7/30/2009,"the fleet has combined their signatures into one to confuse the enemy fleet!when shot on, a group of ships in a defensive formation will take damage randomly based on size. thus bigger ships get hit more offen, while smaller ships get hit less often, thus hiding behind the signatures of the larger ships.this protects the ecm ships and logistics form focused fire. the ecm ships are able to break locks. however logistics ships can not rep consistently either. most of thier cycles go to healing the large ships, so as damage trickles down the the ecm ships he is unable to to heal them. more pirates join the fray and start forming into separate offensive formations. they bring in 2 offensive groups of 3 cruisers each, and one defensive formation with a logistics ship behind a battleship. your fleet tries in vain to take out the logistics, but the battleship gives it too much cover. you are unable to run and slowly die to the incoming fire. the smaller ships watch as their protection is blown away , like the shell of an artichoke. you die in a glory of fire and pulp. but at least you weren't focus fired to death. did i mention defensive formations share the highest warp core strength of one ship? so one warp scram and your whole little group can't run away,on the plus side you could bring one ship with a ton of warp strength, but then you would get multiple ships scrambling you anyways. imagine almost dying in your frigate in a large fleet battle, so you fly towards a group of battleships and quickly duck in behind them, taking the focused fire off your back and letting you escape. imagine forming together 10 frigates to spread out focused fire. but if you get to many together, the dreads on the field see you as a giant titan sized glowing red dot and start one shooting your frigate fleet. imagine forming into a death ball of offensive might and breaking through ecm and causing mass alpha damage.the idea here is to have the mecanhic it'self balance out the issue of forming mass death balls. by getting balanced formations of big and small ships, you can raise the sig radius to levels that aren't too high, but still protect the smaller ships from larger weapons.so one battleship and 1 frigate, the frigate will almost never get hit. with the battleship being 90% of the hit chance, and the frigate being 10.but one battleship and 10 frigates the chance of hitting one of the frigates would become equal, thus you need another battleship to cover the smaller ships.obviously this idea needs a lot of work. like what other bonuses should offensive formations get. should thier be different types of formations in each?"
7/30/2009,"summary defensive formations to allow for smaller ships to duck behind larger ships, or just to simply have focused fire forced out among many of the same sized ships.offensive formations to cut through ecm, boost tracking, and combine alpha damage timing. also offensive formations formations are based on range, to leave a formation simply take control by issuing a new movment command and get out of range. this allows for formations to be freeform and keeps the control of whats going on in each players hand. if you were forced to not be able to move at all you would be unable to run away.also in free form formations smaller ships could keep up thier orbits as long as they stayed in range. formation size would be dependent on range."
7/30/2009,no
7/30/2009,"i'm sorry that you spent so much time writing something so elaborate - but i cannot support the idea you came up with.a. cause this isnt a tactical/c&c/strategy game.b. cause other than the obvious difficulties applying it ingame, it breaks the sandbox. you've obviously played too many rts games, but the only reason formations give ""bonuses"" is cause you can't control each piece individually with enough precision. since in eve everyone can fly a ship, in theory you should be able to utilize fleets to protect the people in the back/have people in different ranges/have a front tackle group with snipers in the back/etc. some of this theory can work in game (obviously tacklers and snipers or ranges), and some could have worked had collision detection worked better and the bullets flew in ""paths"" instead of just hitting. but ofc, this is quite hard to implement cause you can't manually control turrets or ships to an extent that this would be viable.tl;dr versionformations are awesome, and could work had ccp implemented manual shooting and movement and fixed the collision detection - but those, quite like ""walking in stations"" are very very low in the priority list of a game with so many other bugs (double overview bug for example).""the reason for this is no one ever comes up with a reason the 100's of man hours shouldn't be spent elsewhere"" - your reasons are unsatisfactory."
7/30/2009,i entirely agree with mashashige.
7/30/2009,i have to agree with the previous posters.no support
7/30/2009,as much as i love to force formation an fleet in parade formation for a fantastic screenshot... the programming involved is just not worth it in light of the mass number of issues needing to be resolved.perhaps at a later day... but that day is not now...and may never come :(
7/30/2009,"there's a nice feature in the probe scanner where you can right-click a given result and select ""ignore other results"" to mask everything else.this works well when you're scanning using normal probes, but not when you're using combat probes to scan for ships.the filter only applies to the objects listed in the results at the moment you click the function. that means every time a new ship enters the range of the probes, it will be listed in the results on the next scan. in order to filter those new ships out, you have to find the one you wanted to scan in the first place, and then right-click again to ""ignore other results"". you have to do this every time you scan again and new ships show up. this is extremely annoying!this could easily be fixed by changing the filter system from an exclusion list, to an inclusion list. basically, when you'd right-click a given result and click ""ignore other results"" it would translate into ""only show me this result"".either way, something has to be done about this, because right now, that feature is not much use when scanning for ships."
7/30/2009,"nevertheless, a reminder to the ccp about the problem would be very appreciated, as almost everyone in eve community is affected."
7/30/2009,supported.some of the gallente station models are so borked that you couldn't bump someone off it with a mwd titan :p
7/30/2009,an official status update on this issue would definitely be appreciated.

7/30/2009,"obviously it wouldn't just brute force all the passwords it knows. maybe it would try the last known corp password, then the last known alliance password (of the pos), then ask for the password. i am sure some computer scientists can figure it out. lol"

7/30/2009,"most moons are not profitable to exploit, so making a profit from that isn't as simple as it might sound."
7/30/2009,"it is not only moon mining. at the poses you can build supercapitals, do simple and complex reactions. every one of those activities give a revenue, be it paying a lesser costs building your supercapitals than buying them or selling advanced materials at a higher price than the basic components. so even barren moons, if used the right way, can give a profit. if that is enough to make a difference depend on the corp organization."
7/30/2009,"also r64's alone give an stupid amount of money for any alliance holding them. they can fund fleet after fleet of bs/t2 cruisers for their members if they wanted to (not that allways happens).and the other moons would be profitable if eventually sov is moved to planets, there is a lot of moon minerals flooding the market because all these sov claiming or reaction running poses."
7/30/2009,"simple and complex reactions are not very profitable for the most part.there are 6 simple reactions that cover the costs and at most 5 complex that return enough profit to cover the large tower they are on.of course it is a different matter if you hold the moons as they the profit margins can be higher, but thats not the case and holding the good moons is most certainly not a ""1-2 man job"".sure a moon can return a profit but it is nowhere near what some seem to think."
7/30/2009,there is no point to wis. eve is a game about internet spaceships. the last thing i want is for my enemies and wts to have something to do as i camp them in a station.

7/31/2009,/me wants to see an ishkur with scram range bonus. inties would sh** their pants.
7/31/2009,doublepost :p
7/31/2009,"sorry- i thought all you fellas were the 'whiners' asking for a boost ^.^ so you're basically complaining that your af is too cheap? i fly ishkurs, and i can attest that i have never paid too much for one. as for vengeances- it's because so many people are caught up in the 'boost rockets clrly they are broken' bandwagon to realize that rockets aren't meant to put out a ****ton of dps like blasters- they're meant to be an anti-frigate platform- which they do amazingly well as. if you're dumb enough to get in blaster range of an ishkur, then you deserve to lose your venge. kill his drones, then watch his tank melt to your rockets.including that afs are hard to hit is by no means a joke- it's an incredible tool, and acts as a gigantic boost to their survivability and versatility. hence #5- you can engage anything and leave if it goes sour, whereas you couldn't do it as easily in a cruiser or bigger, since it's too easy to get scrammed/webbed if the other pilot knows what they're doing."
7/31/2009,by now we know you dont agree with af's getting a 4th bonus tortugan.
7/31/2009,"people should stop feeding the troll.you are not super pro by killing a lonly bs in a af, the target simply was a noob or pve fitted. if you doubt this you can check my killmails for afs that tryed to solo my mega(you don<U+FFFD>t even need drones for them, the key is simply a neut). rr works with any kind of ship, and better for bigger ships since the got more buffer.any kind of ship is effective when you bring bigger numbers. by the ability to multitackle bigger ships are more effective since they can applay more dps and got more hp. any kind of sig/speed tank of a frig becomes next to useless if you have several webs on them anyway(or 10-20 drones).if you don<U+FFFD>t enter web range you will get preaty mutch owned by anything since you lack the buffer and at 20km you are a easy target, even for bs guns.to afs actualy yes they could need a the 4. bonus to make them a more interesting ship class.wolf, enyo, harpy, retrebution should have a extra damage bonus. they are ok in gangs to take down ceptors(a destroyer also performs well here with the drawback of beeing a better target for bigger ships).with this they also do better vs bigger targets like cruisers since the damage diffrence wouldn<U+FFFD>t be this big anymore giving them a better chance to take them down before drones eaten thrue your tank or you run into serious cap issues(even without beeing neuted).jaguar, ishkur, hawk, vengance should have another bonus that helps them with tackling\tanking. 5% signature radius reduction or 5% speed per level would be good, since it helps the ship to reduce incomming damage and works with mwd and ab."
7/31/2009,"seriously tortugan, quit trying to say rockets are not broken, its not that we want blaster dps out of them. its that for the fitting reqs they should atleast outdamage 3 unbonused autocannons, but they fail to even do that. just about anything with a sar ii fitted can tank a vengeance.they are broken, sure they shoot out to 10km, but so do small pulse lasers, also they are the only small turret / missile launcher that on average will have to reload before killing a frigate.as for djego, giving the vengeance another tanking bonus would be a bit overpowered those things tank like champs."
7/31/2009,"if assisting a friend via rr is considered an aggressive act, who's to say that using your own local reps isn't? is your next suggestion going to be 'hi this nightmare came out and active tanked our whole fleet ccp pleaase nerf tanking so i may continue griefing miners. kthx.'who's supporting this change? blobbers, griefers, and privateers (all of the above). who's opposing it? people who actually know their sh*t and enjoy having a chance in hell of fighting outnumbered.bottom line: the current mechanic is fine how it is for several reasons-1) rr is not an aggressive act. just like running local reps vs running a warp scrambler- rr is a defensive boost only.2) there are numberous counters to remote rep- try being creative about how you fight rr gangs- in some cases more dps is best, in others, ewar is king. 3) this would only serve to boost station blobbing by people like the privateer alliance, and once again, provide yet another nerf to small gang, guerrilla style warfare.4) everyone can use rr. it has never been classified as a glitch, an exploit, or anything of the sort by ccp, which seems to be the main argument for the change."
7/31/2009,"don't take this personally but are you ******ed or just stupid?in one situation you are repping yourself and in the other you're repping someone else. there's nothing remotely the same about either situation (see what i did there with ""remotely"").somewhere there's a village missing its idiot maybe you should find your way back before they issue an amber alert."
7/31/2009,i don't support docking/gate aggro for repping. the mechanic where the repper can be shot at (in empire) is enough.
7/31/2009,"i, too, support removing rr in its entirety....well, it may not be what was proposed, but removing rr outright would solve the op's issue quite well."
7/31/2009,"was running some numbers guys, it seems that only ab frigate sized targets get damage reduction vs rage rockets provided the target is webbed.mwd targets receive no damage negation once webbed and not very much before being webbed.also mwd frigates appear to receive no damage reduction or very little vs regular rockets even without being webbed.interceptors receive very good damage reduction vs rockets even when webbed due to very high speeds and sig radius bonus.still think they need a boost though, bump."
7/31/2009,"hopefully this is just growing pains from the new engine. but deep down, and i hope i'm very wrong, i can't help but think the current sound is to help lag? i hope this isn't the reason, there were so many things i loved about the past sound pre-apoc. i can't count how many times i've just logged off in disgust because of the sub-par non high quality sound i would expect from ccp."
7/31/2009,"supported, needs some love asap"

7/31/2009,"way, way too complicated. by this proposal, crewing a ship becomes more complex than fitting it."
7/31/2009,i like it. would add another level of depth to the beautiful ship customization.
7/31/2009,"this is all very complex. i think if such a system were to be introduced it would need to be kept simple.4-5 crew slots on a ship.crew cannot be transfered and are lost if the ship is repackaged or destroyed.as you fly around in space a crew division has a random chance to level up.crew give very basic bonus' for example:engineering 0-5% cap rechargegunnery 0-5% damagenavigation 0-5% velocityi like the idea, but i feel it would benefit mission runners more. the average lifespan for any ship i buy for pvp is usually less than a month. a lot of people might not want to risk their vessel with an elite vector assault force crew etc etc. the idea does have merit though."
7/31/2009,i agree.
7/31/2009,"i just heard about armageddon day 5 mins ago so i read up on it, this would be a great idea to have it like a yearly or monthly event, it would give us something to look forward to, i'd skip sex for this."

7/31/2009,"supported only cause i can see the break coming with speed and tracking. we already have issues on some fronts, so allowing it to just get worse would be a no no.in the same vein, you'll need to make the balance on cruiser size rigs well enough also, since some rigs slated for hacs are going to be all but required imho."
7/31/2009,not supported.sub-battleship pvp has needed a boost for some time. the breakout of rigs into class sizes is a step in the right direction. it increases options.
7/31/2009,i feel you have missed the point. not supported
7/31/2009,"on the issue of market cost:i've examined as many potential fights as possible, on average, between t1 and t2 frigates and dictors, i've found about 15 to 18% of all rig slots filled. let's low ball even that number to say that 5% of all frigate rig slots are used and lost upon ship destruction. if the rigs on all tiers of frigates are lowered by about 100x their current build cost of goods, and every frigate class ship from this point on were rigged, it would affect market production as such:5% is 1/20th of all frigate class ship rig slots on average.market build cost is lowering by 1/100thmeaning that: based on current kill board statistics (which are very conservative for this argument, you would need to see 5x the current death rate of frigate and dictor class ships with 100% rig usage to equal the current build cost of goods.you have increased the demand in the market by 2000%you have increased the potential supply with in set market by 10,000%. that is using drastically conservative numbers against my favor. this is running the assumption that current supply of input materials remains constant, and that current ship loss ratios remain constant. so if after said patch frigate losses rise and bs losses fall because more people are flying smaller ships, that has more impact on every rig market, not just battleship, not just frigates.if the prices fall, then naturally demand for said goods will go up. what will happen is a new equilibrium point will be met where supply driven by price (limited to larger more expensive rigs and ships as we're assuming 100% rig capacity on frigates) will be lower than the current going rate.yes demand increases, but input needs drastically decreases."
7/31/2009,"i fully understand the intent of the patch, which is why i'm against it. i also understand the original intent of rigs and am fully for that intent.research assembly hall and tell me how many whines there were about rig cost and balancing before the announced plan. compare that to any of about 100 other issues and topics.i think the system was fine before the developers created an issue out of something that was non-existent. i also feel the patch is a reduction in game play variety as it removes an element of risk and choice. people attempt to counter me on that last point, but they're not comparing apples to apples. yes i realize that ship setups are limited without the aid of rigs. yes i realize that ship setups can be altered using rigs. it does not change the fact that diversity of scale is lost.if rigging becomes a necessity, where is the wonder in how a ship might perform with and/or without them? the fast frigates will become slightly faster, the tougher frigates will become slightly tougher, the ewar frigates will become slighly stronger. but everyone will be doing it, so the new averages and lows of performance will all be slightly better.before this patch goes live, the disparity of the high end performance of a frigate and low end performance of a frigate were/are much greater. if rigs become so cheap that they're common place, you're just improving the low end number, which ultimately affects the average.if for some reason the patch went live and both the low end performance of a non rigged ship were countered by the high end performance of a fully t2 rigged ship both improving, i'd be all for it. but when comparing strictly rigged ships using what amounts to equal quality of gear, that's not happening.and for those who complain about benefits to the poor, it's not fixing that problem, it's just reallocating in into one of the other fields of diversity of scale. rather than blow 60 mil on rigs, i'll instead throw 60 mil on faction gear, where as you won't choose to do it, or have the option/money to be able to do it. the class warfare will still exist, and a level of diversity will be removed.the question always comes down to, why would i pay 15 mil or more to rig a ship that cost 500k or less? the answer is, because that's the intent of choice verse performance. do i think rigs as a whole could be less tedious and/or slightly cheaper, sure. but this patch is completely removing the point of rigging and the value it adds to a particular ship. can you honestly tell me after this patch goes through you won't be more suicidal in that rigged frigate, where as before you might have held off using it for another unrigged in that particular instance? can you tell me you expect to face ships consistently who said, nope, no rigs for me, the trade off just isn't worth it? or can you tell me you won't continuously destroy rigs on ships at leisure just because you desire a different flavor that day, where as before, it was about having different ships for different abilities? even the rich now aren't stupid enough to destroy rigs rather than buy a new ship with a new rig setup, because it's just not worth it. rigged ships, no matter the size, are a valued commodity in game that shouldn't be altered as such.have you ever forgotten to upgrade your clones and realized it just before a really good fight was about to take place? remember how the risk of going into that fight weighed heavily on you because you had to decide if it was really worth getting podded. have you ever gone into the fight anyway and gotten the rush of adrenaline from doing so? that is the thrill of this game. rigs are just another take on risk."
7/31/2009,"armor rigs will kill a frigate's speed if the penalty stays as-is, which means that it won't have much effect anyway. trimarks are so popular because large ships don't need speed; frigates do, and any decrease will hurt a frigate considerably.also, a 10% armor bonus is nothing...a frigate has ~600 armor hitpoints...so a 10% boost would be what, 40 more?"
7/31/2009,"what are you complaining about then? go get those faction mods.rigs give a % boost, and with mods like that, the cost of them should scale aswell. fitting a set of 3 20m trimark to your 60m geddon will increase your hp by 45% at the price of doubling the cost of the hull before adding mods. in the same way, increasing the hp of a punisher by 45% should increase the cost of loosing the ship by 100%, but with the current planned changes the price for a frigate trimark will be 4% of the current trimark price, aka 800k, so a full set would be 2.4m, so on a frigate you're still spending 800% of the hull cost to increase hp by 45%. for newbies that don't have the skills to fly a t2 frig instead, that 2.4m is actually a big chunk of money, and if you're an old player that can fly better ships, and are just looking for a cheap throwaway ship that you can keep loosing all day long without having it make a dent in your wallet, spending a few m extra on each one ruins the point.i can honestly tell you that only idiots would rig a t1 frig instead of spending the isk equivalent of 1 single rig on flying a t2 frig instead, and t2 ships should be rigged anyway so nothing changes there.considering the groups of people that would choose to fly t1 frigs outside of comedy ops ala battle haulers, yes. ehm, yes, i'd rather switch to my second ship with different rigs then spend 2-3m every time i want to change a setup.like you said yourself, people that like to waste money can buy faction mods instead and experience the same risk. that also adds the excitement of getting good loot for the other side and the challenge of getting it back home safely aswell, or the same thing for your own side if they manage to win the fight despite a few losses and can loot the field and bring lost mods back to the owners."
7/31/2009,"do not support.the status quo is that one always rigs t2 cruisers, makes a personal choice on t2 frigates and bs (usually depending on where one lives/ difficulty of logistics [for example, in empire and lowsec rigging bs is dumb, in remote space, it makes a lot more sense]), and never other t1 ships (with the possible exception of a really cheap one or two on a bc).making smaller rigs cheaper will increase fit variety by making rigging much more viable on frigates and t1 cruiser/battlecruiser. since rigs are so varied, there are a lot of useful things you can do with those slots (although some rigs of course are useless, there's still a lot of choice: cap, speed, guns, tank, etc.)also, it will help solve the t2 problem. the soaring prices of t2 ships have dramatically increased the rich/poor power wedge, and made pvp less fun: needing to spend a couple hours to replace a ship is good because it adds consequence to pvp. needing to spend 4 or 5 hours is bad because it strongly deters pvping as much (except in a huge cheap ship blob, which ain't nearly as fun), and adds an unpleasant element of extra grind for those who just pve to fuel pvp. cheaper rigs will significantly buff t1 ships due to the extra rig slot, which will bring the rich/poor gap back down and return more fun to pvp; its not quite as good as changing the moon mineral system to produce more and move around would be, but, its a good alternative to help solve the symptoms of the t2 moongold problem.the one and only issue i have with the proposed changes is scaling: 100%/20%/4% will make fitting rigs on frigates completely mandatory, and make fitting the strongest rig possible regardless of price mandatory there too. rigs will also become mandatory gear on bc and cruiser, but it will still be worth choosing which rig to take based on price. the 20% is too low too, but not nearly as insane. maybe 100%/50%/25% would be better, maybe 100%/66%/33%, whatever, i don't know the exact numbers but the ones proposed by ccp are definitely too much."
7/31/2009,"i don't know many instances where i couldn't take a t1 bc gang up against a hac/recon gang and not win consistently. that's not an issue of t2 vs t1 price wars, that's an issue of tactics. t1 frigates are meant to be throw away ships, rigs are not throw away devices. that said, good pilots can choose to rig t1 ships currently and make them perform insanely well. why does everyone always make this boil down to class warfare?"
7/31/2009,minmatar primary weapon systems (acs and artillery) need a serious re-balancing to make them competitive with the other races'. this has my total support.
7/31/2009,"as previously mentioned this subject has been previously brought to attention several times, yet no csm or ccp comment to be found. next csm election i will vote for the guy/girl that has this issue in his/her platform."
7/31/2009,"you're doing the bonuses wrong, it's role bonus + racial bonus 1 + racial bonus 2. having cruiser(s) 5 for a requirement is also a bit steep so that really shouldn't change. otherwise i support a good change to the other faction ships."
7/31/2009,"keep in mind that csm 1 already brought it up and ccp kinda said ""nah we don't want to!""the reason they gave was that they believe faction ships fill a niche and they shouldn't waste resources on balancing them.the argument you can use against them is that they released t3 modular ships, which are even more niche due to their pricetag than faction ships, and are even harder to balance."
7/31/2009,"not supported.i know the feeling of having coverts hiding in your system, and not being able to do anything about it - but ****ing up with cloaks mechanics is just not the solution. there are the ingame, and utterly annoying/bpring options of constant bubble gatecamps/baiting/constant home def fleet ready for action/ ignoring the reds - it might suck balls, but you can combat the cloakers.what i would agree on, is when 0.0 finally goes delayed local (if it ever happens), you could have pos scanning arrays that locate cloakers with a 10min cooldown or some such mechanics. but until then, just learn to deal with cloakers."

7/31/2009,"remove local, problem solved... hell many problems solved"
7/31/2009,"i like the idea of ""cloaking-fuel"" so co***s can become a rolebonus that reducing the fuel amount needet for cloak and stay cloaked (for example 1 ""cloakfuel"") and other ships like a bs will need a huge amount of fuel (100 ""cloakfuel).so the fuel wouldn<U+FFFD>t take much cargo in cov-ops and sb<U+FFFD>s but much cargo in other not specialized ships like macroravens.i realy think this would solve the ""cloaker-problem"" and wouldnt hit the cov-ops and sb<U+FFFD>s very hard^^just my opinion^^"
7/31/2009,this. not supported.
7/31/2009,"thanks for the support, guys, keep it up.this is something that needs a serious look-at."
7/31/2009,agreed pos permissions need reworking. my fear is that the sov changes will force this issue to be put on hold.
7/31/2009,"how is that any different from being forced into an empire upon character creation? the only difference i see is that the empire uses a cheat to control its sovereignty, whereas in your scenario these ""accosters"" are other players that can be bribed, convinced, charmed, black-mailed, double-crossed or even destroyed if the new player already has connections in game. you must not have seen any pkk groups on your shard. it was also possible to be safe from reds through diplomacy with other reds. these games are supposed to be about socializing, aren't they?"
7/31/2009,"because i got to choose the empire i joined when i made my character. if you don't like those choices, don't play eve.i am starting to detect the strong scent of troll emanating from this thread."
7/31/2009,"would it not be also feasible then to let the player choose the region he/she wishes to start in? maybe have a map which shows player controlled empire sovereignty in the regions of the universe. you mentioned earlier that you believe there is a split between people who want all out war and those that do not. while this may be true to an extent i think you are ignoring the capabilities of players to police themselves. reputation is everything in a true player controlled environment, you can see evidence of that in this game with the economy. i would just like to see that expanded to the rest of the game. i'm actually kind of hurt that you would accuse me of trolling, i've been nothing but constructive this whole time and i truly believe this is a serious issue in the game. but i apologize if i've offended you in some way that would make you think i have ulterior motives."
7/31/2009,"how does a truely new player know the differences between these player-controlled factions to pick a starting area?if you are really as new to eve as you say you are, i'll give you the benefit of the doubt. the rules you speak of, with no npc police and complete player authority exist in the geographical majority of the galaxy. ""empire"" space is a relatively small area in the center of the galaxy. are you familiar with the acronym nbsi? nbsi stands for not blue shoot it, and it is the standard operating procedure of about 90% of the corporations and alliances that live outside of empire space. it's not ""if it's a war target shoot it"", it's not ""if it's hostile shoot it"", it's shoot it if it's anything other than someone pre-qualified to enter this area. this is eve. there is no pk vs. npk here. there is no ""good"" or ""evil"". in areas with no concord there's only ""blue"" and ""everyone else"" and everyone else is a target. if you have not spent time in 0.0 space, frankly you lack the perspective to suggest this type of change. brand new players should not be subjected to the absolutely impersonal destruction that the player-run powers of eve would rule with. this isn't theory. the alliances already run this way. this would not change inside empire."
7/31/2009,condord used to be weaker.however the end result = lag.so they made concord stronger with less ships spawning = less lag.you're missing some of the mechanics here (like suicide ganking) as well as the backstory.
7/31/2009,"if that were the case, you'd be unable to undock until you were press-ganged into the virus alliance holding u in station.new players would not be able to see a single ship in space because they'd be insta-popped on undocking until they joined the horde."
7/31/2009,so all new players have to have existing contacts in-game before being allowed to undock without being popped?what you gunna bribe em with?[sarcasm]sounds like an amazingly awesome new-player experience[/sarcasm]somehow i think eve is a little more inclusive then that.move to 0.0.problem solved.
7/31/2009,"i find it hard to believe that peace treaties or non-aggression pacts between alliances do not exist in eve. also i know corporations do not always stay within the same alliance, and(i'm assuming here) in 0.0 space territory sovereignty changes occasionally. am i wrong about that?it seems you are also suggesting that every alliance is about ""absolutely impersonal destruction"" which just seems preposterous. you do know that other players are actual human beings just like you with emotions and thought processes, right? in over a decade of playing online games i have never met a player who could not be reasoned with in any way."
7/31/2009,"players are forced into the horde right now, and this horde uses a cheat to keep players in check. if it was player run they would all be banned. that is the main problem with the mechanics as it is now, there isn't an equal playing field. you wouldn't need to have existing contacts that was just one example, you would also have the option of joining with the ""virus"" since you decided to spawn in their region. after that you could find ways of going to another alliance more suited to you or find a smaller corporation to live in a low-patrolled region or use diplomacy to get a non-aggro pact with an alliance.right now that small invincible alliance in the middle is undercutting every other alliance by offering players total security which is imbalanced."
7/31/2009,"with a month in game and no 0.0 experience you are coming off like a know-it-all tourist explaining to the locals how they could improve the local culture. your 10 years of mmo experience mean nothing in eve. my previous 10 years of mmo experience also meant nothing in eve. get off your soap box and start learning before you start pontificating. try flying out to goonswarm space (or hell.. you pick the alliance) and fly into ""their"" space and start negotiating with them as an independant newbie.. let us know how it goes."
7/31/2009,"and cva space only counts if your a minmatar, otherwise your pretty safe from them. but please get of that soap box, eve is nothing like any other mmo out there at the moment. the only thing close is jump gate evolution, and its still under development."
7/31/2009,"the equal playing field is that anyone can be killed anywhere at anytime for good reasons or no reasons.if you're like me and generally **** people off then you'll find-out soon enough that condord aren't perfect protectors. :-)banned? are you suggesting players vote on bans? wtf?? you: ""hey i just spawned in your space, this game is cool, can i join"".them: ""**** off""you: ""hey can i get a nap?""them: ""who are you? go away"""
7/31/2009,"you disregarded the content of my reply without actually debating the arguments raised simply because of this rule you've imposed that i must have a certain amount of time spent in game before i can create opinions about mechanics which i think are flawed.also, any diplomat knows to negotiate before entering foreign territory. i don't see how name-calling is warranted in this thread. i'm not trying to be dogmatic i'm just a concerned citizen."
7/31/2009,"no i meant if concord was run by players, and those players used cheats to make their ships invincible, those players would be banned by ccp.is that how you negotiate?"
7/31/2009,"concord is the default, it fills a gap that players can't fill 23/7.there is nothing stopping you from starting a police alliance/corp, it wasn't possible early on because a certain critical mass is needed to make it worthwhile, but it can probably be done now (if you could find any players wanting to be police). you just wardec anyone that causes trouble and come to defence of noobs getting can flipped etc.this is how someone with no position negotiates.you: i want a tv!clerk: righto!you: no money....clerk: credit?you: nope, aren't u friendly to noobs?clerk: **** off!edit: you're aware suicide ganking is very effective right?influence map:"
7/31/2009,"lol. run a bit around in low sec and reason to the people at the gates. run in delve and reason with goonswarm. run almost anywhere in 0.0 and reason with the guys there. but before doing that be sure that your clone is up to date. alliances ave treaties with other alliances, yes, that is what being blue mean. look how standing work.but in 0.0 if you aren't in a friendly alliance you are a target. no one care what you are doing there.maybe you miss a point: people can and will profit from your death and you will lose from your dead, both good reasons to kill you if you aren't a friend."
7/31/2009,"but with your great idea all territory will be foreign territory. so when you are ""born"" the first time you have nothing to bargain with and no way to do your diplomacy before meeting me.so your choice will be ""join my corp for newbie players with 50% tax and 2 hours of mandatory mining every day or die""."
7/31/2009,"nephilimyoua re new, so you dont know it...but there was a time when concord was beatable....do you know what happened? some crazy guys just spend half a days killing everyone in a big trade hub [yulai] und killed/tanke concord the whole time killing on and one..noone could stop them until the gms had to get active and ended it...sicne thatd ay killing concords is an exploit...the story is of course longer and has more reasoning but...with todays thousand of players more [yulai was a few years back] such stuff would happen alot more often.....bad idea even if it makes a part of the game ""non-player-driven"". see...concord is not unbeatable....they just have failsafe devices for your ships or something so they can even prevent you from jumping into wh space....concord is beatable if you had a ship not controlled by them..."
7/31/2009,"no man, i'm disregarding your points because they are based on your theoretical model of how you think eve politics should work, when you haven't taken the time to find out how it works already. it's like you're explaining to eskimos the best way to keep warm in the winter when you've lived in florida your whole life and you've just reached the arctic on your first far-north cruise. the eskimos just might look at you like you have no idea what you're talking about. if nbsi is the standard for existing player-policied regions, what would make it different if empire was player-controlled, and how is it a benefit to a brand new player to be thrown into this environment on day 1?"
7/31/2009,"actually - concord as they currently are is quite immersion breaking.if you're off in deadspace and you're a player and you shoot another player, *bingo* you're dead. period. every time.but the angel cartel guys you were flying against before that other player showed up are entirely concord proof.huh?concord, once upon a time, could be beaten. things changed and the mechanic changed.now, highsec is needed. i don't think anyone other than a few maniacs want that to change. concord is what makes high sec high sec - could that be changed and keep the balance while still improving immersion and opening up options?the answer is yes - by making eve even more of a sandbox.okay - high sec systems - how do they stay highsec?first - deadspace complexes should be hard to find (like your agent is always telling you) and things inside should be virtually impossible to find. each system should have the potential for several thousand of them although the server should only pay attention to active ones.that would mean that your agent would send you to only inactive ones on regular missions and inside that mission space you would be nearly impossible to find. however - that deadspace would be more like lowsec. you could shoot at whoever you liked etc. the key to keeping highsec missions safe is to ensure that the mission complexes are very hard to find. not impossible - this is a sandbox after all - but hard enough that a player getting a mission and flying out to one is unlikely to be bothered unless he dallies out there for 8-12 hours.a subset of this is that agents would be able to give out missions to players to occupied complexes - resulting in pvp action. if a group of players set up a pos in a deadspace area, the agent might send some players out to deal with it. these would have be keyed differently and rated for difficulty somehow, but it could be done.finally - concord could be called. if you were under attack, even in deadspace you could yell for help and the nearest concord ship would fly to you (using the ordinary rules, accel gates etc.) it would be very tough but you could possibly beat it and get away. the higher the sec, the more likely, as well, that concord or the navy would find any occupied deadspace areas and attack. if the players won they would know that a more devastating attack would soon follow but would have some grace time to escape although it would be under fire from concord and the gate guns if they fled the system.the higher the sec, the less deadspace areas, the more concord and navy. the balance would be to keep things the same. devastating raids would be prevented by the navy and concord acting together. for instance, if 200 pirates jumped into jita, they would have a helluva fight on their hands as the naval force in that area would be similar and there would be concord as well.the idea here is - make it a sandbox. make concord tough not by game fiat (deus ex concord) but by making them really tough.simple reality is that players with a big enough fleet should be able to do what the elders did and the reaction from the empires should be similar.harder for ccp? oh yes. but much more a true sandbox. players could then become fatal, or the rabbit and expect to succeed (if they were lucky) and be able to do all the things those npcs do.now that's a sandbox."
7/31/2009,"you can trash concord all day long if you want. just go to 0.0 and run some missions for the blood raiders. tank kinetic for cruisers, em for battleships."
7/31/2009,"you completely misunderstand the topic of this discussion. what you need to understand is that many people who play eve online are not interested in pvp, and just want to be left alone to do their carebearing in peace. yes, eve is a pvp oriented game but it is not only about pvp. you should not be able to come annoy me, or blow up my ship every time i'm trying to mine or trade and just want to be left alone. people should have the option to freely move around empire space without having ""local"" open, completely carefree.we have a perfect balance right now. over there, in goonswarm controlled space you are king and master. you make your own rules. you let in those you choose and you kick out those you don't like. you are free to be nice or grief nice people who are merely trying to make money.luckily you cant project your power to empire space. here, you cant do jack to me. in fact you can kiss my behind. you cant interfere with my activities, you cant hinder me in any way. it's beautiful.what can you possibly complain about when you have access to better ores, better rats, and much, much more money? you might say that all this is at the expense of being in constant danger and having to protect your space. but see, you enjoy doing this stuff. you gladly do it. but many people simply don't want any of this, and i see no problem with that./not supportedalthough i think it's ok that concord should not be invulnerable, their ships should keep on coming until there is nothing left of the lawbreaker/s in question.think of real life police... sure you can kill a police officer, even blow up his car, and take his gun but you cant defeat the police. they will keep coming, and they will keep looking for you until they get you and kill you if necessary. and if the police cant handle you, swat will come, and if swat cant take care of you the army will come and you will definitely be ****ed then. if we didn't have something like this in place we would have ananrchy, chaos. and that would not be good."
7/31/2009,"wow, that's a lot of words. i was just saying that you are more meaningfully protected in a player justice system like exists in 0.0. when i'm carebearing in nullsec, the returns aren't as good as empire due to the low population density that nullsec supports, but i feel safer than i do in empire. in empire, anyone can suicide gank, scam, can flip, etc without consequence. in 0.0, that gets shut down hard.i do agree however that the easiest solution for the op's problem is just for him to find a 0.0 alliance he likes and leave the rest of you alone."
7/31/2009,"what i don't get is your concept that we are forced to join an empire from the time we start.when you start your in an npc corp that does nothing for you and nothing to you and other than war dec immunity, which is the whole point, your a freelancer. you can fly to any other empire and work for them or travel between them at will.beyond that what your suggesting is an entirely player driven system which you know full well doesn't have much appeal or there would be mountains of successful examples. instead there are zero for a reason.i would set and discuss the intricacies of game theory with you but since you didn't take the time to learn enough about eve to have an informed position its not really worth my time."
7/31/2009,this/thread
7/31/2009,as much as i would like there to be some way to get offices to come out sooner i am not sure this is the way. corp a gets rent isk from corp b. corp g takes over station and voids rental. sounds like corp b has paid isk for something they dont get. even if you refund the isk are you going to take it from corp g who never had it or forcing corp a to cough up isk.second why force corp b to pay impound? again you are making corp b pay. if as you say two months is adequate time to fight to retake a station under the old way corp b is back in business upon friendly retake because they still have the office. the new way they have no office and have to pay to get their items back.third what about a griefer gone mad? corp g has a spy who suddenly forces all stations it controls to unrent. i see the proposal opening a new area to griefers.i am sorry but the fact the present system maybe a bad mechanic doesn't make this proposal a better one.if you want to play with unrenting why not fix another aspect of it that has not changed since day one of eve: to unrent you must be physically present at the station. why not champion remote unrenting?
7/31/2009,supported if you just remove the ability for the rent to be renewed.that pairs it down to 30 days which is well within reason.
7/31/2009,if i was going to take over the station.. i'd gut it... vent the damn thing to space... and repair it.frak the offices and there so called renters.leave or die.: o p it now belongs to its new owner.i have trouble understanding why or how this is acceptable(inability to evict previous renters) short of blowing the station to hell.
7/31/2009,"i think there are a variety of options for a boost already listed by myself and others throughout the thread. any time you deal with a thread like this, it's better to show the desire for change and not pin that change on a particular idea. i've exprerienced that several times in the past where the message of change gets lost in the proposal for change. i would be very happy if people would show their support for change and list out any variety of what could be better options. that gives the devs a variety of points to work off of rather than put the entire burden on them."
7/31/2009,"wrong. we do get to dictate their policy, because without us they will make no money and there will be no business. (what's up with your sheepish attitude?)their very success depends on us, players.off course they have to sift through thousands of suggestions and proposals and choose what's needed and what's not. that is their job, they get paid well for it, and their wise decisions make eve one of the best mmo's out there. but we do get to tell them what needs to be done, and they must, and will listen to us.i agree that walking in stations is unnecessary and all that effort would be best diverted into other directions. there are so many things that can be done that would be much more useful!"
7/31/2009,no.
7/31/2009,"/supportedwalking in stations is a nice concept, but dev resources could be used in better endeavors."
7/31/2009,"not supportedi am really looking forward to wis and i hope that they choose to integrate many ""ingame-games"" like poker, chess and hopefully the best strategy game in history ever: go."
7/31/2009,"so if someone will not upgrade their clone, it's because of balls or something else? and how can wingmen protect from focus fire?alright, its just me. i don't like this feature so i will just use something else. but wtf with their prices?"
7/31/2009,/signed
7/31/2009,"the theory is that t3 ships are supposed to have a isk price similar to t2 ships, but to make up for that, you pay sp when you loose it, unless you choose to eject right before it dies. if you train the skills to level 4 instead, the performance will still be very good and you only need to train a rank 1 skill back up from level 3 to 4. they saw that just having a high isk cost wasn't enough to make people capable of flying t2 ships utilize t1 ships aswell, so they created a different incentive for it instead, trough the sp loss. not supported."
7/31/2009,don't fly what you cant afford to lose.not supported
7/31/2009,"i think that feature is pretty good. i wish they applied it to all t2 ships as well.it adds an element of hardcore to eve. and it is not very strict. if you lost all subsystem skills after death, then i'd understand your complaints. so, just be thankful you don't lose all your skills, just 1 level."
7/31/2009,why stop there... have it affect all aspects of ship command or something.if anything people would spend less time being suicidal in the game with there immortality complex and more careful and studious about how where they fly.personally i'd be a little bugged about it... but if anything it would defiantly make the game more hardcore.
7/31/2009,"the theory is tradeoff in investment. here it is the benefit of a lvl 5 skill vs a lvl 4 skill. in addition to risking your ship, (which btw it's a ship with 10 bonuses rather than 2 or 4) you risk time invested in that skill training.considering it takes approximately the same time to train hac 5 as it does all 5 skills for this ship to get more than double the useful bonuses, i'd wager that you're pretty alone on this argument. there are 1,000 other ships in game, feel free to explore those if you don't like the t3 model payoffs.people keep telling me this is hello kitty online, sadly, i agree more with ephemeron that those kitty's need to have their heads cut off and ravenous dogs chasing them more often. my apologies to all the poor innocent kittens out there."
7/31/2009,"i have even better idea for more hardcore in eve. no clones. when podded, you lose this unlucky account. imagine how half of a fleet gets doomsdayed and register their new trials now that is hardcore!"
7/31/2009,5/10 trollyou go first... and then we'll see whose laughing.
7/31/2009,so predictable :)
7/31/2009,not supported. i like the extra risk when flying t3
7/31/2009,"if you're about to die just eject and you won't lose sp, duh."
7/31/2009,"reading through peoples idea of what insurance is for is bizarre.that said - i can see both sides of the arguement. pvp, wanted or not, is a strong driving force in market stimulation. without it the high sec industrialists would have a much harder time selling the products and produce.the stupidity of this is there is very little punishment for a ganker. they fully understand the risk they take when they attack and can calculate the money outlayed versus the possible reward from the wreck. the thing that is missing here is reality. what insurance company in its right mind would insure someone at a fraction of the cost of a ship, that is destroyed 2 hours later.....answer, nearly all of them, once. after that you would pay far more for insurance in premiums. repeated insurance mis haps would eventually result in no one wanting to insure you....ever again.sure gankers take a security status hit - big deal - go kill some battleships and recover this. higher insurance costs for repeat gankers on an ever increasing scale. then place cheaper, less reputable insurers in low sec systems, (where all the gankers tell industrialists they should be anyway) - that charge far less but have a % chance of not paying out."
7/31/2009,"i could get behind the idea of a sliding scale of ship insurance based on actual market value and pilot performance (i.e. ship loss). it might need some tweaking, but the overall idea is intriguing and it accomplishes my main goal."
7/31/2009,"give us the tools for player run insurance and this wouldn't be an issue.riskier pilots would pay more, gankers wouldn't get insured, and your standard player would play and pay more or less how they do now."
7/31/2009,supported. i just dont think it feels right to get insurance if your go jihad on someone. terrorists should not get money :-)
7/31/2009,supported. insurance sucks. concordokken insurance is no exception.
7/31/2009,"as a tool to filter out all the nonsense and scam-suspicous courier contracts which currently dominate the contract overview i'd like to propose the following additional filter options for courier contracts:1) display only courier contracts with both source and target destination are in high sec: yes/no2) display only courier contracts with both source and target destination are npc stations: yes/no3) filter by a range of cargo volume4) filter by a range of contract rewardall four filters (together with the already existing filter by collateral) should be combinable.independent sorting by volume, reward or collateral would be nice too.(the currently available filter ""min price""/""max price"" is related to the collateral. that's ok, but the fact that sorting by ""price"" is related to reward is a bit inconsequent and confusing.)a filter by range of the number of jumps between source and target would also be useful but i could imagine it's not easy to find a performant implementation because it depends on the specific router settings and the distance probably isn't stored as a precalculated value in the database. if i am wrong and it is easy consider this as option (5)."
7/31/2009,yes.
7/31/2009,"it is my strong belief that the newb tutorial system is still very insufficient.i'd like to propose introducing intelligent/scripted pvp bots. for example a newb can choose to fight against a speedy interceptor or a heavily tanked heavy assault cruiser... or any other class. these ships would be fitted with some of the most common fits and have behavior similar to what a good pvper should be doing. i understand perfectly well that this will not teach people to become expert pvpers, and you cant possibly predict even half of the possible pvp situations, but this is a hell of a lot better than what is available atm, and this way people wouldn't have to lose ships while learning."
7/31/2009,but that's still pve and not pvp...
7/31/2009,i never said fighting bots constitutes as pvp. i said it would help prepare people for pvp.
7/31/2009,they are called sleepers. see the wormhole next door.
7/31/2009,"this isn't really needed.there are plenty of corporations that are already willing to take in new(er) players/toons and show them the ropes of pvp in an actual pvp environment. eve university [e-uni] jumps immediately to mind, and the way they keep getting war-decced, there are ample opportunities to get the desired experience.no support"
7/31/2009,"a wider variety of npcs to shoot at during the tutorial, with your agent talking you through how things work, introducing npcs with speed tanks and neuts and e-war and so on would help lay some groundwork for the basic principles that pvp works off. i agree that would be a good improvement to see.this wouldn't be a 'pvp bot' though and shouldn't really be advertised as such, the whole point of pvp in eve is that its open and derestricted and can't really be emulated by a scripted rat except in the most basic terms. setting up a newbie in a fight with a scripted npc and saying 'well that's how pvp works, you're ready for the big leagues now kid!' will just mislead and frustrate players (especially when they jump into lowsec/0.0 thinking they're hot stuff for pvp and immediately get owned by 20 hacs on a gate!). player vs player is best taught by players, and newbies who really do want to learn how it works would be better advised to join one of the corporations like eve uni which give real pvp lessons."
7/31/2009,"as anyone whose ever engaged in any kind of pve knows, all the various factions have their own ship colorings, stats, and bonuses. while these are well represented in the current faction ships, with 4 ships for empire factions and 3 for pirate factions, i feel it would be interesting to allow players to get in on the factional modification of their vessels. by investing in these effectively as an extra rig, you can tweak ship abilities and maybe give your vessel a new role, thereby encouraging an influx of new ship setups into eve, in addition to altering it's appearance.the big idea:-all t1 and none-faction ships would get a new slot, hencefor refered to has the ""overhaul slot"". into this slot a factional overhaul would be inserted, which function as a sort of hybrid between rigs and t3 parts in functionality.-at faction lp stores, three new items would be added. these would be factional overhauls for frigates, cruisers, and battleships, at 1k, 5k, and 20k lp respectivly. destroyers and battlecruisers would be considered cruisers for use of these modules.-at the (as yet hypothetical) release of these overhauls, one would be availible for each major faction and pirate group. primary overhauls (amarr, caldari, gallente, minmatar) can only be put on their respective race's ships, while the pirate factions (blood raider, guristas, serpentis, angels) could be applied to whatever race's skills are required for their faction ships. other race's and group's overhauls could later be added to their respective lp stores.how they work:in most respects, a factional overhaul is a hybrid t3-part and rig, in that it has major bonus relating to skills (like t3 parts) while being destroyed upon removal from a ship.in order to ensure balance, factional overhauls would not effect directly used modules and skills such as resistances, damage, and repair ammounts. instead they would all have an ewar bonus, a logistics bonus, and a minor hp boost of around 5% for the ship in question. pirate factions would gain an additional unique bonus relating to the faction in question.each race and pirate faction would have a skill (exe: angels cartel overhauling, caldari navy overhauling) that affects the extent of the bonus the ship in question recieves.examples:federation navy overhaul[descriptive text]skill bonuses : 5% bonus per level to sensor dampening effectiveness. 7.5% bonus per level to remote armor repairer range.role bonus: 5% armor increase.serpentis factional overhaul[descriptive text]skill bonuses : 5% bonus per level to range of sensor dampeners. 7.5% bonus per level to remote sensor booster effectiveness. 20% chance per level for ship and cargo scanners targeting this ship to fail.role bonuses: 5% armor increase.additionally, a side effect of a factional overhaul is that it changes the ship's color scheme to that of the appropriate faction. for instance, applying the serpentis factional scheme to a myrmidon would give it the black and gray camo pattern of the serpentis, plus all shipboard lights become green. were it a federation navy overhaul, she ship would become black and white striped with flashing blue lights.overallthe intended result that would be gained from these overhauls would be that ships could be optimized for unique roles to supplement those the ship already has. by creating vessels that can preform many roles we can break out of the deadlock of fits and encourage some experimentation and creativity from players. a prophecy that can drain capacitor to power it's tank, a vexor that can smuggle illegal goods without concord noticing, and a remote repping hurricane are all possible with these overhauls.this is my first assembly hall proposal, so please tell me what you think."
7/31/2009,intriguing idea...but kinda feels like the future tech 3 of said ships in a sense.
7/31/2009,"i apologize then, i didn't understand that at all the way you phrased it. some of the negations you've used threw me off."
7/31/2009,i'm wondering if your concern will be taken care of with cosmos.i'm hoping that cosmos will prevent me from posting in the csm meeting planning threads.

6/26/2009,"having been encouraged by some people to put in the form of a specific proposal my own suggestions for accommodating non-aligned corporations and alliances in factional warfare (fw) gameplay, i put it forward here.i have taken the time to make an extensive argument on this in my blog: faction warfare and 'third forces'i won't reproduce it here for reasons of space but i will present the offered solution in full. i invite anyone to peruse the blog entry itself and i hope any interested csm members will do so to better understand my reasoning.simply put, it should be possible to enter factional warfare in a fully-featured way by opposing a given faction without joining an opposing militia. in other words, a corporation or alliance should be able to declare against a given militia and the following should then apply: they are at war with all corporations in the specific militia. they may attack complexes belonging to the empire of the specific militia they are declared against. they may not secure complexes belonging to the empire opposed by the specific militia they are declared against. they will be fired upon by npc navy forces of the empire to which the specific militia declared against is a member. any other abilities or penalties as may exist or be developed in future that may apply to opponents of a specific militia will be available but only with respect to the faction of the specific militia declared against. a given corporation or alliance should only be able to declare against one militia at a time.taking the case of my own organisation, the star fraction, and the amarr militia what would this mean? the star fraction and amarr militia corporations would be war targets to one another but caldari militia corporations would not share in this. the star fraction would be able to attack and capture amarr fw installations but not caldari fw installations. the star fraction would not be able to formally secure minmatar fw installations (or any other for that matter). the star fraction would come under attack from amarr npc navy forces but not caldari npc navy forces.this is a consistent and coherent approach to the issue which provides a way to participate in fw with some useful options. notice that it means people who wish to fight, say, the amarr militia but not the caldari will only be limited in their ability to travel and operate in amarr space and not caldari space. immediately a much more nuanced approach to the wars between the empires is available to those who may indeed support, say, the gallente federation but have no big quarrel with the amarr empire.it also allows for a much wider participation in fw by many corporations and alliances in a way that makes sense in rp/ic terms. mercenaries, freebooters, outlaws, minor faction loyalists, loyalists who don't want to be in any militia and alliances in general can declare against whoever and get involved without the absurdities (and impossibilities) that arise from enforced membership of militias. it squares the circle, both for in character reasons (ccp are right, alliances are extra-national entities ic, they have no business being in anyone's militia) and mechanical reasons, of alliances not joining militias.eve is a more mature and deeper game of war and politics than the current fw arrangements allow for and this suggestion seeks to improve matters to the benefit of the whole game. there are more levels of detail it is possible to discuss with regard to this proposal but they are more properly a matter for ccp to consider. what is presented here is the broad design suggestion that there be a fully-featured against option for entry into factional warfare participation without the necessity of joining any militia.cosmo"
6/26/2009,thank you for posting this individually. i believe this is well done. the external reading on your blog is also helpful.
6/26/2009,"makes a lot of sense, and would get more people involved in fw pvp, which is a good thing. excellent work, cosmo."
6/26/2009,this seems an entirely reasonable proposal.
6/26/2009,supporting.
6/26/2009,"its a well thought-out, sensible and entirely constructive proposal that provides balance to the potential participants and moreover, will definitely supply a boost to participation in the flagging fw arena and enable small-scale pvp to a wider audience while allowing rp entities to more properly express their opposition to specific causes. i'd urge the csm to consider this proposal seriously and i hope that a champion can be found to promote and argue this concept to the current council and ccp in the formal meeting to come."
6/26/2009,"while i don't participate in fw myself, that is, in large part, because i don't want the baggage associated with being in a milita. this seems like a reasonable and balanced solution to that baggage.supported"
6/26/2009,"i actually quite liked this idea in the other thread - it's a way for alliances to get involved in fw without them actually joining a militia with enough downside not to make it grieftastic. i'll give it till next wednesday for people to comment in here about it and if erik (who seems to want to champion anything fw related) hasn't picked it up, i will."

6/26/2009,"i'd love to see this happen, but i think your downplaying the effect it would have on trade. yes, its too much for a single trader to make an alt network to go hub to hub... but if players can get together and form banks and stock exchanges, do you really think its beyond possibility a corp could get together and form a jump bridge network and charge traders to use it? a medium sized corp with alts all cyno v capable would do the trick. just charge for fuel + a fee to use the bridge. you'd make billions.so, i'd love to see it, but i think you need some type of assurance we won't see traders using this to neigh-instantly get from one hub to another."
6/26/2009,"first - i think was asked above - wtf are you doing mining during wartime without adequate protection? there's little to no advantage in this scenario, because as it stands, a good gank squad will just throw tacklers into the system and warp in on top of you.if the cyno alt pops the cyno right on top of you, pop the alt. he's gotta be in wt gang for cyno, so he'll be shootable (set your overview right). if he pops a cyno at a nearby planet or something, you'll see your wts pop into system just as if they'd come in a gate and you can get your miners out. the balance is held in that the target corp would effectively be able resume logistics with the same toolset. there's little/no way that with effective cov cyno hopping, you couldn't move your haulers around.edit: now with thumbs up. also - took me 6 tries to post."
6/26/2009,"the alt cyno ship, so long as it has not engaged in any aggressive action towards ""you"", and has not given direct assistance (repair) to ""the wt's"", will not be flagged even if in the wt's fleet.i agree with disagreeing here - but no, the miners (and/or their protection) would not be able to shoot the cyno if he is not, themself, a wartarget (or conditionally flagged to you)."

6/26/2009,"very interesting ideas :-) maybe for strategical reasons, some of this might be introduced rather as rigs than modules. but right now 3 drone upgrades... seem a bit poor to me, as well..."
6/26/2009,exactly. you said it perfectly...you don't have what it takes to kill the ship.good that you've admitted it.move along people.
6/26/2009,"supported. killmail should show pilot hitting themselves for top damage with ""self-destruct"" as a weapon, as a final blow and no fitting is shown.as of why? you were already dead due to being tackled and not able to get away, you merely quickened the process. you will still deny loot and fittings info to your enemies as well."
6/26/2009,"that is not proper logic. think before you post.a killmail means you killed them. you assume, since you're attacking, that you've killed them. you have not if they self destructed.also, a person could be under attack by one frigate, themself in a battleship, and could self destruct. (could as in ""may"", if they're stupid). this doesn't imply that the frigate killed the battleship, or was causing innevitable death."
6/26/2009,"if you don't have what it takes to get the kill, you don't deserve any reward. short and simple. besides, considering how eve really is a griefing game, and looking at the wannabee l33t lads going up against the wall over this, just for that alone it's worth it btw, you already are csm member now, you won a seat, no need to work the masses anymore"

6/26/2009,"i think the whole proposal is a very good idea. supported! i don't believe there is a need to keep the timer updated between the server and the client, so this wouldn't create more load on the server. the timer can start when the server-side one does, and then countdown on its own until it's over, unless it's renewed by another agression.however as you said, only ccp can confirm that for sure."
6/26/2009,"i remember from my short stint in 0.0 the lack of the aggression timer, and it annoyed me. i agree, as the client should take care of it (it should be much less trouble than the module timers). supported."
6/26/2009,definite support for some sort of timer/fix

6/26/2009,support
6/26/2009,"why not should be simple to implement me thinks, would be nice for jumping through gates as well.have a red timer for two minutes display if you have no-dock/jump aggro and have yellow one show the remainder of the 13 minutes in the fashion of the gbc and the ratting timer."
6/26/2009,"even if intended now as a gang/fleet supporter, that ship should be useful as well in solo, so any more useful bonuses / fitting stuff should be given... as an alternative, a t2 myrmidon might be created to be another bc-sized drone ship with good dronie bonuses stronger than ishtar"
6/26/2009,"i think all of us have forgotten our drones at one point or another, which brings up the topic of getting them back and the possibility of others stealing them.i propose that if someone forgets their drones, they can continue to view their drone info in the ""drones in distant space"" drone window. if the owner warps back into the control range of his drones, he can then right-click his drone window and reconnect to them, much like reconnecting to probes. this would then put the drones back into his control. this would also be possible, and extremely more useful, in the case of unintentionally disconnecting.i've had only a couple instances where i had forgotten my drones and they were still listed in the ""drones in distant space"" window, and when i had warped back to them, i still had control. this seems to be a mechanic that, to me, should work 100% of the time - if it's not working, give us a reconnecting option, please. battleships are slow, and flying around at 150m/s to scoop up your primary source of dps, in some cases, is frustrating. on another issue that has been mentioned here is drone stealing. drones are never intentionally left and there should be possible repercussions for stealing them.my second proposal is on something else that doesn't make sense - drone damage. i've seen some forum posts before about drone damage and asking ccp to enable players to view it. please let us enable the viewing of drone damage. there are many players whose primary damage source is drones, and, quite frankly, it doesn't seem fair that they can't view it. it also doesn't make much sense why drone damage cannot be viewed, whether it be logical or technical; players can see what damage drones are inflicting upon them, why can't the owners of those drones? drone damage was displayed in the log a couple years ago. refresh my memory, why was it changed?lets hear it."
6/26/2009,"while your proposal makes some sense to me, i would be much happier if drones that were left behind, would go instant rogue and started attacking all targets on the grid in order of weakest to strongest. it sure would make the end of cap ship battles far more entertaining."
6/26/2009,supported - reconnecting to drones would be useful and reasonable.
6/26/2009,"drones rely on targetting assignments. once they loose their controller, they are useless. even so, drones retain corp information -- they wouldn't fire on corp/fleet mates."
6/26/2009,"well, drone losses due to disconnects are really annoying. i support the idea of reconnect. with the new scan probe system, it proved useful and functional, so why not with drones... whereas that prob with drone stealing... i think its ok so far, as when just forgetting them its not a technical mistake, but our own. maybe drones could be given free to scoop up for anyone only when the owner leaves the system or docks..."
6/26/2009,"yes, upgrading clones is completely rediculous. especially when you can lose all your sp by not doing so. it is a feature that will drive potential customers away from eve, resulting in lower sales for ccp. if ccp had half a brain, they would do away with it.why risk almost everything a player has based on one little click of a button. such a rediculous requirement..."

6/26/2009,the effects are too visible imo aswell
6/26/2009,the effect is large so that people who are using ecm know who not to target.
6/26/2009,"module effects do not create lag. lag is network related, effects are not using the network.what you think is ""lag"" is actualy a low frame rate (client-side only) and will only affect people with lower end machines.if you want to prove this, press ctrl-f to bring up the performance meter and look at the fps.most people playing eve online have decent gaming pc's, so if you want to get less ""lag"" then just lower the effects slider in your graphic settings or upgrade your hardware.those effects cause no problems for me.not supported."
6/26/2009,"i, too, disagree. eccm is locally-rendered, and thus is dependant upon your prefered settings and hardware. i believe a great percentage people are capable of rendering this withou t a significant drawback in-game, thus warranting no actions from ccp."
6/26/2009,"let them provide an option to turn the specific effect off then, something which would also be a big help with the clouds in space that sensor boosters create :/"

6/26/2009,"the combat logs are missing a lot of useful stuff.what is displayed : - dps weapons (project, laser, hybrid, missile) - warp scrambler/disruptor (sometime)what missing : - webs - drones - ewar!!!why?because the logs information can be useful for combat analyze after the combat but it's important to know who fire ecm on who, who got dampened by who.....). we need the complete logs and not a partial one!you can check why these log are useful here. as you see on this macro podkill, you have the timestamp for the start and the ending of the combat plus some information like the dps and with kind of wreaking damage i have done. the warp scrambling entry is not always in the logs and need to be fixed too."

6/26/2009,"yes, that surely would be a nice thing to have... not standing at the gates after hours of ap-jumping maybe selecting a specific station in the beginning would be even more useful. might save a lot of ships flying in the systems an thus reduce a bit server load as well, who knows"

6/26/2009,"yes, i am totally in favour of my suggestion. especially since it is a no-brainer to code it into any future patch. probably takes no more than a few seconds to get it done, so priority should not matter at all."
6/26/2009,"i agree this is extremely annoying, but i don't know if this would be the way to fix it. they should probably just fix the bounding boxes of the gates instead, or make it so you can't warp that close to a gate."
6/26/2009,"surprisingly, i agree with kaylan. especially that second bit. i would be in favor of 'warp to 0' on an acc gate putting you at the edge of activation range.that said, this is even frustrating in a cruiser. i can't imagine how it feels in an orca."
6/26/2009,i can't remember how many times i got stuck in this already be it in my starting days with mission and later on exploration.supported.
6/26/2009,"y tu, de'veldrin?op is backwards: the desired fix is the warp-in distance. you're attacking the result of a error, not the error itself.before they restricted smartbombs next to gates/stations (range of 5k, at least), the issue was that you could get insta-popped in 0.0 by these smartbomb fleets. was the fix to make you appear more than 30km away from the gate when you jumped in? no!. the fix was to restrict the action not the result.sorry... good call-out, but you're pointing at the wrong thing."
6/26/2009,supportedspending 10 minutes wriggling a battleship out of a gate is never fun.

6/26/2009,i concede your point. i'm still in favor of the idea of reducing the frustration of acc gates.
6/26/2009,"(it seems my purpose here is to point out the folly in peoples propositions and declarations of late. i appologize with due respect in comments like such, but they call for contextual debate..)surely your experience being stuck inside a gate does not warrant the op's submission in-game. either you moved your ship into that gate (aligned or however), or you landed ""inside"" the gate's ring. the first is a personal issue that requires user common sense; the second is an issue and should spawn it's own (and new) discussion."
6/26/2009,"that is another way to fix the problem, but i don't care which is used."
6/26/2009,"well, i agree, a nicer possibility to harvest gas clouds would surely be nice - let it be for wh-t3 gases as for booster stuff or maybe future other materials made from gases. in my opinion it would do if there wasn't needesd a turret slot for them, so we could fit them onto barges/exhumers without problems. if not that, a gas harvesting ship not requiring much other than basic gas cloud harvesting skill might be nice as well..."

6/26/2009,"part of the genius of the system is the diminishing returns. it's why newbies can compete with vets - a guy with 1m sp can fly a t1 frig about 2/3 as well as a guy with 100m sp, instead of 1% as well. you need more sp put into a field to be less efficient than the early sp investments, because otherwise you're playing old players online. if you have enough time to take a skill to 5 - and believe me, a lot of players do - you have enough time to spend that effort even if it's only as good as level 1 was. not supported."
6/26/2009,this.horrible idea not supported.
6/26/2009,"i think this is a good idea over all and could be very balanced.however the problems are in the details of your proposal and the main reason you dont have any votes at this point.if this was applied in the opposite fashion of what you are suggesting it could workyou are saying most skills should get a level 5 boost, with a few being left alone for balance, but actually for it to be balanced and not screw everything up, it would apply to very select skills and not any othersfor ccp to figure out which skills should get this level 5 bonus would take going over the entire skill system and looking at many, many different situations, then forum discussions and talks with us the player base, and thats before any programing or anything technical"
6/26/2009,"herschel covered the main reasons why i am also echoing the no votes.an additional reason is game balance. not only would ccp have to go over the entire skill tree to identify which skills 'qualify' for the boost, they would then have to evaluate each of those skills and their effects on in game ships, modules, and other effects to make sure they don't unbalance the game."
6/26/2009,agreed. no.
6/26/2009,herschel pretty much covered it and therefore not support.
6/26/2009,"oh yes! please! want that, make it so that older players have even more advantages! that's brilliant.btw, you're mistaken when you say: 5% extra. it's never 5% or 3% or 2% extra, it's 25% instead of 20%. believe me, it's different. and besides, look at it this way:small hybrids lvl5, 25% extra dmgsurgical strike lvl5, 15% extra dmg, total: 40%now add rail spec. lvl4, total 48%increase it to 5, and the total is 50%trust me, it makes a diference. not to say that moar bonus is bad."
6/26/2009,"i think the ""drones in distant space"" needs to be fixed. if you forget them or disconnect and then come back, ""reconnecting"" to your drones to regain control would not only make sense, but would be very helpful.others have stated that ""drones are free loot"" like salvage; i disagree to this - maybe they are now, but i think this should be changed. lost drones and salvage are hardly the same thing. salvage can be intentionally left, however, when drones are left i think everyone can assume it was not the owners intention; in the case of disconnecting, it can't be helped.i fully support the op."
6/26/2009,"wtf. you're in privateer alliance, supposedly a pvp alliance. stop crying."
6/26/2009,"virus, imagine if everyone in jita had their drones out, which they don't currently cause of lag and loss of drones.just consider it.i know it sucks, i've lost plenty and stopped letting them out. what we need is quicker launch and attack for drones."

6/26/2009,"for the umpteenth time, ccp still need to get their art and ui people to fix the damned probing interface."
6/26/2009,"maybe he wanted to say, that for the same reason battleships can fit into carriers and freighters have much more cargo-space than you'd think possible when comparing sizes to industrials. that may even be the reason why freighters cannot loot normal wrecks (they can't, can they? i once read something like this), because they employ a high-density space-folding technology that needs certain conditions to allow loading and unloading.and about the windows. maybe they aren't windows, but sensors or shield emitters or whatever shiny stuff modern spaceships need to work properly. i mean, come on, windows in a spaceship bigger than a 1-man fighter? why? even with high-end sci-fi material technology they're probably weaker than the rest of the superstructure (otherwise you'd build the rest out of the same material, i guess), let alone armor, and who needs to look out of a window, if every angle of space around the ship is covered by camera drones?what i want to say: for me the current ships' scaling works, maybe with a little bit of imagination, but i always thought, this would be mandatory in a setting like the eve universe anyway."
6/26/2009,"in the real world a frigate looks like a piece of junk barely capable of defending itself. destroyers are slightly larger ships displaying decent firepower. cruisers are good sized ships capable of holding their own in any modern battle. battleships were/are large ships and one look at them said ""don't **** with me"". carriers are huge ships and the new super carriers about to enter construction make even those look small. please reflect proper ship size in eve.p.s. i work for the us navy."
6/26/2009,supported!the archon example is classic and perfect. battleships would *not* fit in that ship hull.
6/26/2009,"the current scaling is really out of whack, stations looking like they can only hold 3 carriers and carrier looking like they can't hold even 1 battleships.however this might take a long time to improve as scaling them down is not as easy as it looks, the textures are made to exactly fit on the model and just simply scaling it down is not possible.however i really think that people should stop commenting that ccp should spend their resources otherwise. guess what you have no idea how ccp runs internally and neither do i, although i don't start talking out of my ass.supporting the thread to have the art department have a good look at it."
6/26/2009,i'm hoping you're wrong. it'd be nice to have someone sedate to be the voice of reason on the council for a change.
6/26/2009,"yeah, but it's that 10% that takes it from ""lets make pos queue k?!?"" to a worthwhile and fairly easily implementable idea. i r serious yamamoto, this r serious pos queue thread.i forgot to support this."
6/26/2009,"supported. i just set up a pos, and it was boring"
6/26/2009,supportin'
6/26/2009,this is an angle that keeps coming up in my mind too.....if a player attacks a militia player then they should take standings hit against the militia and faction.this easily ties in with other mechanics to do with navy npcs etc.
6/26/2009,"oh, please. i was grumpy way before i got my ass kicked twice at the polls."
6/26/2009,"op's original proposal is not terribly good, but i'll agree that *something* has to be done regarding the fw relationships to non-fw ones.i don't have any easy solutions (or even better ideas ), but the fact remains that the current implementation leaves a lot of headaches for all sides.even though i'm not involved with fw, i think it's one of the most important things that ccp (and csm) should be looking at."

6/26/2009,omfdeity_of_the_week! why? just give me one good reason you should ever wish to get out of your pod. in here you are quite literally immortal. to go consorting with - well - meat? the flotsam and jetsam of humanity we kill without blinking a metaphorical eye in combat. the remnants of evolution you left behind when we chose to become part of your varied ships. come on now - it's really dangerous out there. you could get your remaining meat fried - totally killed. permanently!(at least it should be if cccp do it right. this needs to be the most dangerous thing any pod-pilot has ever done to make it worthwhile.)
6/26/2009,"there topic name changed.and yes it will lessen some wardecs because main tactic used is shoot a bit, rr, de-agress and dock, rince and repeat.now once you have agressed your only way to get out of combat is to either warp out of station grid or dock at another station in the system.this however won't be easy because you will have points on you so you would have to fit wcs, this in turn lessens the buffertank some people have.your actually facing more of a challenge that way and agressing people has more chance to get repurcussions.next to that it's insane someone can undock, fly 50km away from a station and still be in dockingrange.ccp increased the stayingpower of ships a lot, the de-agressiontimer however has remained the same, docking range is way out of order.fix those things and voila, if you wardec a corporation you have 2 choices, stay docked or actually engage in a fight without hugging tactics."
6/26/2009,"should name changes be allowed? i can thinks of a few good reasons to allow or not allow it. it would seem to me the most obvious reason not to allow it would be to hide your identity from other players.i personally think this could lead to new depths of game play and bounty hunting. like one name change a year for an isk fee or something and you would have to make a post on the forums, but you have a serial number keeping records of you, new skills could allow different levels to tracking a person. all names changes could be tracked, or something.this would allow those who hate having a crap name the made up a year ago and are stuck with, but those who are trying to hide are not really avoiding the system as they would want to, at least from more experienced players, which another point entirely."
6/26/2009,we can change our names?

6/26/2009,"well i have been a vice-secretary... secretary tasks can take quite a lot of time, but it is quite a special role. when i was only doing the regular csm stuff, i spent about one hour a day reading forums, assembly hall, speakers center and the hungarian forums who are primarily responsible for voting me in. to this you can add about one hour a week to read and process all the issues being raised, plus i spent about one to two hours discussing them with my experts, depending on the issues. then we had meetings lasting at least 2 hours, plus preparing and maintaining my own issues (and sometimes other people's issues) in the wiki, thats another hour or two. this is 13 hours so far.and time to time there were special tasks as well, ccp asked for our opinions about this and that, needed extra preparation, and there were times where we had to spend time doing internal organization, like mailing around, priority votes, moving stuff from csm wiki to evelopedia, etc etc... you get the idea. it can be pretty time consuming."
6/26/2009,"it was in the blog announcing the csm, but otherwise the csm got told at the first meeting."

6/27/2009,supporting this awesome idea.
6/27/2009,"it's come up on the other thread and do wonder how standings might be used for non-wardec situations also.the game has sec status and the combat zones are low-sec which takes care of this to some degree.....npc corps adjust their standings to players and corporations based on what you do for or again their pilots.it could be possible that there is some room here for the players in a militia to act much like npcs when it comes to standings, allowing attacks on anyone who has shown -5.0 worth of hostility. this would mean that the militia would effectively wardec anyone who makes a regular target of faction pilots npc or otherwise. may have to actually trigger the wardec mechanic though, could get confusing as -5.0 isn't actually a legal attack in other situations but just an indicator of the relationship.....it gives an automated standings setup for a non-player controlled ""alliance"".... which sounds handy....food for thought anyway, i can't see a complete solution yet but all the pieces are out here on the forum..."
6/27/2009,this is exactly what i was trying to say in the little bit in my post:
6/27/2009,"thank you for taking the time to look this over, oz, and i'm grateful you are minded to pick it up if no-one else does.cosmo"
6/27/2009,oz picked this up before me so i'll let him roll with it if erik doesn't. looks pretty cool from my end. supported.
6/27/2009,"so, you're proposing a method whereby corporations could take part in fw and be able to take credit for the militia's successes without any prospect of also taking the blame for their failures?maybe that's a bit harsh, but there's so many other ways that fw could be improved, such as allowing corps that are also in alliances to sign up.there might also be issues arising from one side's third parties not being able to shoot at another side's third parties."
6/27/2009,"i will support anything that will let my rp minmatar republic loyalist alliance take part in the rp minmatar storyline, though as the mechanic for letting corps sign up to the militia is already there, regardless of whether or not they are in an alliance, that might be simpler, especially as the option to defend would be important for us."
6/27/2009,"i don't know about harsh  i am not proposing this for any one side's benefit but to what i believe is a general benefit  but it's not quite right. it seems to rest on a notion that only conquests of systems can be successes and only losses of systems can be failures. it may be that people are allowed to get away with such a portrayal but that's what counter-propaganda is for.i think there's a level of detail to how things are interpreted that could be gone into but it's both for ccp design and also ccp story-telling to take care of. for example, i would suggest that only full militia members should get acknowledgement from the empires in the form of medals and so forth. on the other hand, a really outstanding third force could get a news mention quite legitimately if they truly deserve credit.allowing individual corps that are also in alliances to sign up is, i think, in conflict with ccp's view of what alliances are and what the empires are, as well as being problematic from a mechanical point of view (though nothing should be insuperable, i would agree) - but it would also be fairly problematical in terms of such things as an alliance having only one corporation exposed to the dangers involved while the majesty of its apparatus as a whole can support them logistically and in other ways. that is where the concord war dec of old retains its usefulness. a particularly troublesome third force can be decced by an opposing third force. this is an instance where the concord war is precisely the right tool for the job.at any rate, i am flexible as can be on details and implementations. the main principle for me is the 'against' option for meaningful and active entry into fw and the suitable balance and checks required to make it work are a matter for ccp's judgement.cosmo"
6/27/2009,"ok then, let's consider the following...under this proposal we'd be left with a situation where corps in the militia would be getting shot at the opposition's militia, the opposition's allied militia, and the oppositions's third parties, but the third parties would only be getting shot at by the enemy militia.now, given that 90% of eve doesn't like being regularly outnumbered, why would the average corp join the militia rather than adopt third party status?"
6/27/2009,"you may have noticed that i haven't suggested a specific hurdle in terms of enabling a corp or alliance to declare against a militia. this does not mean that i think there should not be one. it may be financial, it may be a standing hurdle, it may be both or it may be something i'm unable to come up with at the moment but ccp might. that's an important element of balance that would i am sure be looked at and i have no problem with it being looked at. i mention this before dealing with:aside from not wishing to overcome whatever hurdles may or may not be involved with declaring against a militia, in order to be able to defend their faction's systems, to gain the rewards and recognition that is only due to full militias and for all the important roleplay reasons that you and i would support.i do actually anticipate some shifting out of certain corporations to third force status. i think it actually would be better for the integrity of the militias and make for coherent roleplay within the militias.note that i don't conceive this suggestion as being implemented, if at all and in whatever form, on its own. i would be startled and amazed if only a single change of this kind was made to fw in its next development cycle. but i'm conscious that i can't suggest an entire raft of reforms with one proposal and expect it to be taken up.i think people who care about fw should be making proposals on improving plexing and general occupation/conquest mechanics, making fw more meaningful and consequential, dealing with the balance on attack and defence, etc.this proposal is about unlocking fw for greater participation that makes sense with regard to the cases of a) alliances and b) corporations that don't wish, for whatever reason, to sign up with a militia.anyway, thanks for the questions, they are important to consider.cosmo"
6/27/2009,"i think it's probably the best way presented of enabling alliances to enter fw tbh...the only problem i see here is the inability of allied fw entities to aid each other in these circumstances, however, i can't recall the last time i saw amarr and caldari or gallente and minmatar joint fleets."
6/27/2009,"in principle good idea i think. however fixing fw lag should always be higher priority, doing this wouldnt be usefull anyway when the only result is that alliances can now also get desynced if they try something more than fighting solo."
6/27/2009,brilliant in concept. would love to see the bugs worked out and something like this implemented. well done cosmo.
6/27/2009,"yet.if this were to happen you'd see min/maxed domi camps rring each other with deployed sentries and sensor boosters that make low sec even more unattractive to the casual pilot than it is. low sec needs a boost, not more incentives not to go there."

6/27/2009,"first, machinima (movies made using video games) is awesome. just look at clear skies or day of darkness 2. walking in stations promises to greatly enhance the ability for players to make interesting movies, as you'll actually be able to portray the pilots and stations themselves (instead of using half life 2, or only showing ships).as such, i propose to ask ccp to keep machinima in mind when designing walking in stations, especially with the wis camera controls. perhaps this is already in the works (we dont know), and perhaps it isnt. but as it is being implemented i think it would be a great loss if ccp passed up this opportunity for machinima."

6/27/2009,"anyways just throwing this out here. how does everyone feel about a one time in a lifetime, or a one time every 2-3 years to redistribute your sp (or only 50% of your sp). i know quite a few newer players who have made mistakes on skills they trained up and now are stuck with skills that they dont use. i myself have this same problem when i was a younger player and flew caldari. i quit and came back to perfer minmatar as i then understood the game and its mechanics more, but i was stuck with 4 million sp in missile launcher operation. tbh i would perfer a once per lifetime of a character use or a once every 3 year use as this is a much bigger change then redistributing attribute points."
6/27/2009,"well we have attributes remap once every year, so why not skill remp?"
6/27/2009,because this would just make people dump all the useless skills they trained and specialize them - so now everyone could be epic killing machines of doom.you trained it knowing you couldnt go back - keep it that way.
6/27/2009,"that all depends on how much sp you trained for skills other then what you specialize in. tbh most of the skills that we regret training happen when we are newbs. this is mainly to help solve that issue. also with newer players coming in and with so many ""regular"" players with 20m+ sp, the newer players stand a lesser chance against all these specialized sp players (assuming they have half a brain to fit the ships correctly) especially when they have no clue what they are doing as far as what skills to train.something similar was said about attributes i believe."
6/27/2009,"this.there's a world of difference between optimizing skill training time using attributes and redistributing actual skill points. some of the things which would happen:1. extreme specialization. you meet a guy in a ship = he probably has perfect skills for it.2. assigning roles. once corporations and alliances can decide exactly how many tacklers, cap pilots, probers etc. they want, they will start telling people to respec.3. fotm to the extreme. all of a sudden everyone would start flying the 3 or 4 currently ""best"" ships and then whine after a nerf that they've ""wasted"" their skill redistribution. this is in fact no different from whining about ""wasted"" skills today but today it actually makes sense.those are obviously additional points to consider aside from the obvious: character development has consequences, you're shaping a specific character with a specific history. attributes have always been secondary and easily manipulated (learnings, implants) but skills are something else.sorry, no support."

6/27/2009,"of course no one is forcing you to put an afterburner on, dont be stupid. but it's another mod you ideally dont want to leave the station without. along with a scrambler, a web, an mwd and a cap injector. lets put it this way: a megathron with 2 1600 plates and 3 trimarks (seems fairly normal to me) goes 822 m/s with an mwdwhen it's webbed with 90% that's:10% * 822 = 82.2 m/s top speed.when it's scrambled and webbed with 60% web its top speed is 116m/s, that's:40% * 116 = 46.4 m/sthat's almost 50% of the speed of a 90% web.so that's the problem with the current situation.ok?(got the speeds from eft with all lv 5 char)"

(maybe the return of those slots should be included here ) the supersize-miner might require an easy-to-obtain extra skill, level 1, to use. of course higher levels increase the cargobay further, as with industrials.i am really glad to have found this thread, and endorse our representation on the council through omber zombie.motion supported"
6/27/2009,"soo much to be done to the business side of the game but so little time ccp, here's a few things that come to mind.- corporation roles/management still a nightmare. give us detailed (!) description of what role does what.- public pos modules still bugged, and have been the past 2 years and more.- bpo unlocking/locking takes ages, give ceo the right to just unanchor the damn thing, or give shareholders the right to allow ceos that!- alliance-wide pos use plz, was promised eternities ago.- storefronts and a builder's info link on ships so we industrialists get credit for our work, not just isk.and finally, mining. lots of rumours are going around how mining mechanics are going to be changed, but i can only ask you to do this very carefully.many people (like me) have trained multiple accounts so they can mine efficiently - for example playing 3 hulks, a hauler and a rorqual at the same time. taking this possibility away (like was done to scanning with multiple accounts) will cost subscriptions and make many people very angry. i don't wanna sell my hulk pilots!on the other hand, mining has to change we can all agree on that. i would propose making it optional to mine actively:1) cut ""autopilot mining"" returns (with that i mean mining as it is done atm, with a 3 minute cycle time semi-afk) by 30%2) make it possible to ""be good"" at the minigame or whatever you have in mind for mining to boost returns.that way, people can still let their secondary and tertiary accounts mine (even with reduced income) and actually do something during those 180 seconds on their primary account.yue"

6/27/2009,[proposal] mwd stabilizer.the recent changes to warp scramblers have made them too overpowered imho. i suggest that a new module should be introduced to balance the power.microwarpdevice stabilizer i.when activated this unit attempts to compensate for fluctuations and scrambling of the ships microwarpdevice.
6/27/2009,"supporting this, as i supported the other one: lets put it this way: a megathron with 2 1600 plates and 3 trimarks (seems fairly normal to me) goes 822 m/s with an mwdwhen it's webbed with 90% that's:10% * 822 = 82.2 m/s top speed.when it's scrambled and webbed with 60% web its top speed is 116m/s, that's:40% * 116 = 46.4 m/sthat's almost 50% of the speed of a 90% web.so that's the problem with the current situation.ok?(got the speeds from eft with all lv 5 char)"
6/27/2009,fix this gay mod plox
6/27/2009,"so with 2 mods used your mega is 50% slower than it used to be with 1 mod (yes scram does also the disruptor part, but most ships will still need an additional disruptor to get better range). so now recheck with 2 90% webs."
6/27/2009,"your other topic is of no interest to me, however i can see this being a viable change that could make things a little more balanced, and can appease both sides."
6/27/2009,"no im talking about before and afterso that's scram + web before vs scram + web after.that's all, comparing apples to apples here, nothing more."
6/27/2009,"changing the collision box to make it fit the gate skin tight, change warp to 0 to warp to the outer perimeter of the gate, or deleting the collision box. i don't care.i suggest to simply delete the collision from the gate, because it is the easiest possible fix. some objects in eve don't have collision and it does rarely break visual immersion. getting stuck in the gate is much more annoying than having to cope with the visual impression that the ship flies straight through it.last time it happened to my orca, it took me half an hour to get her out again and it was really frustrating. i even discoed two times, but whenever she warped back, she ended up stuck in the gate again. it also looked horrible, because she was not visually stuck. from the looks of it, she was hundreds of meters away from the structure. she still acted like a fish thrown in the desert, making spastic manoeuvres forth and back.eventually i got out using the same disco-mechanism-exploit, that some use in lowsec to avoid gate camps. if that had not helped, i would have had to make a petition and ask for a gm tugboat."

6/27/2009,"very few people gas harvest as it is, making people train another ship doesn't really help people get into this profession. i don't see a real reason for making gas harvesting more skill intensive."
6/27/2009,"perhaps this is because it seems like there is little support by ccp for those who do gas mine. you see people gas mining in various flavors of combat ships (moa was suggested earlier in the thread) getting no bonuses what so ever.a dedicated ship would not only make gas harvesting more appealing (new ship, wee), it might even make a gathering profession a little less painful (bonuses)."
6/27/2009,"leaving aside the chicken-and-egg stuff (my old brain won't cope with it before three cuppas), there is a large investment of gametime, and cold hard cash, by a player willing to adopt these specialist skills. (bows to all the gas miners) as well as that there are the risks incumbent with mining in the kind of systems where gas appears( not thatkind of gas...!)it is a matter of balance and respect from the designers/economists of ccp that they are allowed some benefit from their dedication.we are not all cut out to be chribba ( gods love him) and he, i dare say, should be given his due for what he brings to ccp's ""dirty little secret""...some people have to mine to keep the game's economy going. a few of those people, well, might actually enjoy doing it, are prepared to support the rest of the game with their time and dedication, and should be rewarded accordingly; gas miners and tankers to haul the stuff would really stand out, as would mining tools elsewhere in the game."
6/27/2009,"what? i only want bonus for one of ship we have. hulk, mackinaw or skiff, maybe skiff is the best. or strip gas miners, why new ship, skills?"
6/27/2009,"this is not a huge issue & requires a minor tweak by ccp.i agree with others that the simplist is to include gas mining on the barges & exhumers.we curently work in a wh-c5 and use the ferox ship for gas mining, can fit the 5x t2 gas miners and provide a tank as well.i see no need for a new ship type just to cover this area."

6/28/2009,"hawk and vengeance both suffer from the inadequacies of rockets. fix rockets and they move way up the list of ""good afs"".matari afs with tracking bonus .. talk about being overpowered. near perfect resists for tank (easy to plug), very high damage for their class, capless weaponry and high speeds .. you want to add superior tracking to that list?enyo is scary as is, maybe allow for a pure gank fit by giving it a 5th gun slot, similar to what was done for zealot.ishkur is the best af currently, no contest. drones just add so much versatility that nothing really compares.quantum rise gave an indirect boost to the af class due to the new speed mechanics, but the class itself needs an overhaul as does so many things. make them matter as a whole and don't apply band-aid which usually end up being all thats done when the cries stop.no to deliberately overpowered ships!"
6/28/2009,"when rockets are rebalanced i hope ccp are sensible enough to look at the ships that use them as part of it. a damage related 4th bonus for the hawk and vengeance, couple with whatever rocket changes are made, should bring them to around 140, 150 dps. seems pretty reasonable to me.your take on the minmatar afs is pretty staggering. to start with the obvious, your claim that they have very high damage for their class; the wolf has the lowest dps of all the ""gank"" afs (enyo, retribution, wolf and harpy, defined by slot arrangements and weapon bonuses rather than tanking bonuses). in fact the wolf is outdamaged by one of the ""tackle"" afs as well, the ishkur, which is frankly appalling. the jaguar fares a little better, beaten only by the ishkur in its category, but only because the rocket using afs are terrible. note that the ishkur puts out around 100 dps more than the jag in a typical set up. a tracking bonus is the perfect way to address this, as it allows the minnie ships to actually put their high speed to good use, countering for example the retribution or harpy by flying in close and attempting to speed tank, but when fighting an enyo try to stay at range and use their falloff to win.the ishkur needs to remain where it is and the other assault frigs should be brought to that level, in my opinion. i apologise to any ishkur pilots, but giving it another good bonus, like a drone damage bonus, would just be crazy."
6/28/2009,"in the current situation destroyers do not forfill there role the way they should. they are suppose to be frigate killers, but in fact, you see them being used in pvp so rare, and when they are used, there efficiency is low, except for those rear cases when people using them have excellent plan and amazing setups. first of all, let's look at the balance between destroyers. what is the destroyer people love most? it is the thrasher.i find it stupid that thrasher dominates so much as a pvp destroyer. i tried all 4 destroyers in pvp and realised that thrasher dominates. i spent hours fitting catalysts and coercers, and could barely reach any efficiency close to that of a thrasher. does that mean that thrasher is overpowered? no, in my opinion it is the only somewhat worthy destroyer.so let's figure out why: thrasher: 70pg, 170 cpu, tracking and damage bonuscoercer: 75 pg, 160 cpu, tracking and cap bonuscatalyst: 60pg, 170 cpu, tracking and faloff bonuscomorant: 55 pg, 210 cpu, optimal and tracking bonusfirst of all, power grid, catalyst and comorant severely lack power grid. severely. catalyst has less power grid, same cpu as thrasher. why? comorant is a disaster, it cannot fit 7 150mm rails without any additional modules. all other ships in game can at least fit highest caliber guns of there class. conclusion n1: bring power grid of ll destroyer more in-line. increase power grid on catalyst and coercer. second problem i see are the stupid bonuses. let's start with a catalyst. we have bonus to falloff, and as a class they get bonus to optimal. so if i shoot rails i will use them in optimal, so the ship bonus is simply wasted. if i use blasters, then the optimal bonus is nearly useless as it gives me only extra 200meters, which is virtually nothing. conclusion: if it is suppose to be a blaster boat (which it probably is) change the class bonus to 50% bonus to falloff, and the ships bonus should be changed to bonus to small hybrid turret damage. comorant comorant receives bonus to optimal range, which means you would use it as mini-sniper boat with rails. if you are using rails at the limit of there optimal, you probably will not need the tracking bonus, so it would be of more use if comorant would receive a damage bonus instead.thrasherminmatar frequently fire in falloff even with arties. both close range and long-range setups for this ship would benefit if class bonus would be switched to bonus to falloff, instead of bonus to optimal. the third problem i see affects destroyer class as a whole, and that is the 25% rof penalty. destroyers are the shortest living ships in game: they are easy enough even for battlecruisers and medium drones to hit, and have effective hp of a frigate with a plate. (i achieved higher effective hp on a punisher then that you get on most destroyers) so if they live so little, at least make those few seconds they do exist on the battlefield worthfull! let them deal some proper damage! yes, it will increase damage of most setups by 25%, but i think this will not bring destroyers anywhere close to being overpowered, in my opinion it is currently one of the most underpowered ship class in game, they can neither escape the guns, nor tank them, so let's make there slogan ""kill, or be killed"".why that might be good: high-dps ships are good in pvp. fast high-dps ships are good in pvp. and destroyers are cheap to loose, that will make them perfect if you need to bring more dps to bear and haven't got much cash on hand. this will also make flying destroyers more exciting, they would unleash large firepower but would be fragile."
6/28/2009,"slots:this is the final part of the proposal, and i do not view it as necessary, and not everybody agrees on this, but i think that this would be the final touch in making destroyers worthwhile ships. all battlecruisers have more slots then any cruiser in game, this enables them to tank additional damage they receive due to larger signature radius. then why do destroyers receive less slots then there frigate counterparts? let's have a look at tristan, we have 3 low and 3 med. slots, a total of 6 slots. all destroyers have 5 slots. i believe every destroyer deserves an extra slot."
6/28/2009,"yes to grid and rof, no to extra slots (destroyers supposed to be glass cannons)"
6/28/2009,"1 extra slot would not make them mega-tanks, let's face it. but as i mentioned above, slots aren't something i am conserned about that much. if they are glass cannons, let them be cannons."
6/28/2009,good basic idea. as other have pointed out it may need refinement but it has potential.i am in favour.
6/28/2009,"i agree because sentries shooting drones unbalances the races in lowsec. the guys that fly ships that dont have large drone bays, dont care, or like it the way it is because they can launch a bunch of crappy t1 drones to help them tank....meanwhile gallente in general and all the racial drone boats like the geddon, phoon, etc get screwed. if we all had the same proportion of dps in drones, it wouldnt matter...but we dont."

6/28/2009,"simple suggestion: make bookmarks linkable in evemails and chat windows, just like items are.clicking a link would open the ""add bookmark"" window and let you edit and save it.to link a bookmark, you would simply drag either it's item icon (if copied in a container) or the bookmark itself from your people & places window to a chat input box or an evemail body.this would allow everybody to share bookmarks simply without having to copy them as items, which has been a wanted feature for a long time already. it would also not require much development to do since it would be using the mechanics already in place (link window, and add bookmark window).i know some form of bookmark sharing has been requested in the past, but i haven't seen a post requesting simple bookmark linking without a whole bookmark sharing ui."
6/28/2009,yeah...
6/28/2009,good sense. bookmarks as items have seemed insane to me for a while.
6/28/2009,no. you might not notice it at first but there's a lot of stuff why it makes sense that you actually need to hand over the bookmark personally.
6/28/2009,"and i don't see any of those reasons as being valid. it just doesn't make sense to me that in a world so advanced technologically (universe of eve online), pilots can't share simple coordinates over a communication channel or evemail. it never made sense to me."
6/28/2009,"scenario: a spy is with your gang in a safespot, bookmarks it, and links to a member of another gang in system. he never leaves fleet to draw suspicion, and the other gang doesn't even need to probe for you.in this iteration, i give an emphatic 'no'.i could support linking bookmarks in fleet only, as it could be useful; from a gameplay perspective i feel anything more could be too exploitable."
6/28/2009,"i think that's irrelevant. spies are part of the game, and this would just make their role more realistic. there are several ways to counter spies (asking for the api key and retrieving all characters in same account for example). all this would do is make it slightly easier for them to relay secret locations, but i say again, only slightly easier.if you're that worried though, i would be for a restriction on which channels the bookmarks could be linked. i have nothing against it being only corp to corp, or corp to alliance, but not player to player."
6/28/2009,"a bookmark is essentially either a system and three numbers, or a system and a globally visible object(like a station). it makes perfect sense that this should be able to be transmitted via chat channels. and it's not like this is going to overpower spying or anything - spies can already do far worse than giving you a warp-in."
6/28/2009,"ran this in f&i for a couple weeks, implemented reservations/possible drawbacks. now let's see who can support this.tldr:provide some ship customization with limited colour schemes and corp/alliance logos.prelude:the call for options to customize one's ship as every player's primary in-game representation has been heard since the very first days of eve. even now, suggestions for this still pop up in the relevant sections of these forums every few days.so far, discussion of the issue has suffered from unrealistic expectations by its enthusiatic supporters and rather elitist contempt by its detractors.it is believed that a well-considered, evenly worded proposal will garner more universal support and a better basis for consideration by the csm and ccp.issue:even once walking in stations goes life, most players will continue spending the majority of their eve lifes in space, surrounded by their capsules and, beyond, the hulls of their ships. it is believed that their social and fictional experience would profit from the possibility to influence the looks of that spaceship and thus some form of individual expression in the game world.while there are a variety of ships to choose from, practical considerations usually decide which ships players will fly. some simple options for customization on any ship class would satisfy most players' desire to show some extra personality, attitude or allegiance.proposed solution:1. logos- every ship hull will feature two prominent spaces for their alliance (or empire) logo.- every ship hull will further feature two smaller spaces for their corporation logo.- ship holder decides for each logo to be displayed or not.- display of logos can be globally switched on or off client-wise.- loading of logos has lowest priority - they load last, and not at all if a node is under strain.2. colour schemes:- ship manufacturers can choose from a small (3 to 5) selection of 2-colour schemes to produce their ships with at no extra cost.- each of the two colours can further be determined from an 8-bit palette.- ship owners could re-colour ships at station services for a fee.- ship colour scheme/colours ('colour template') can be saved and traded similar to setups to create alliance/corporation/individual look.- display of non-default ship colours can be switched on or off globally by every player client-wise.- colour information has lowest priority - it loads last, or not at all if node is under any strain.3. info tab extension- info tab shows manufacturer (individual + corp + alliance at the time of production)advantages:- need for self-expression in space is satisfied.- solution is resource-friendly, needing only 15bit of information per ship from the server.- colour schemes prevent horrible eyesores by limiting creativity sensibly and leaving shaders/normal maps/etc. (representing hull structure/material) intact.- alliances can sport uniform fleets.- manufacturers can leave a stamp (of quality, hopefully) on their products.disadvantages:- alliance logos are not currently up to date.- tranquility will need to save and process a small amount of extra information.- logo placement, colour schemes, colouring interface need to be designed.- some players may find some customizations unpleasant/offensive/not as good as the originals.- some t2/faction ships only differ from their t1 counterparts by colour scheme. differentiation must remain possible visually. (ty fille)- daring colourists will find themselves ridiculed by the pvp elite for being little girls playing dress-up with spaceships.- manufacturers' stamps will only work for contracts, not for sale on general market, as items there must be identical for every type. (ty ausser)- metadata/'magic bits' will probably still blow up database load for colour scheme information more than intended. (ty ausser)"
6/28/2009,convincing arguments.
6/28/2009,repost... this has been suggested many many many times already. no need for another post for this.
6/28/2009,"not at all. previous proposals have not been successful. maybe they were not good enough to garner sufficient support. i see no use raising any from their graves.my proposal is hopefully more well-considered, balanced, eloquent, detailed and clear. if it isn't, it'll be drowned by torrents of equally unfortunate suggestions in no time and swept from your dismissing gaze to page 27 of this section."
6/28/2009,eos is suck. it needs love. supported.
6/28/2009,"eos is as sucky in a similar way than other similar purpose command ships like vulture, damnation, claymore. they're not meant to be pwnmobiles dps wise.information warfare bonus is just seemingly -a bit- less useful than other link bonuses. shield, armor and speed bonuses are easy to utilize in a way but not many ships get notable information warfare bonus. maybe eos could have links for increasing drone hp, range, tracking etc. damage bonus is big no no in my opinion though, drones already do enough damage."
6/28/2009,this needs to be looked into - not being able to see what is outside due to change mechanics on now how un-docking works...anyone with a warp ubble and a few friends can ruin your day when you can't do a thing about it.

6/28/2009,"i agree.. also some stations have stupidly huge ducking radius, people can just play docking games as much as they whant, and you would have to smash them with mwd bs a few times to get get them out of range, not sure if even thatwould help."

6/28/2009,i think that's a great idea! i would leave the balancing to ccp however.
6/28/2009,of course. this is just a draft idea.
6/28/2009,"no, if you want to shoot other capitals and towers more effectively get a dread. carriers already have enough roles, they don't need more."
6/28/2009,"pretty much this. i'd be cool with other types of fighter drones, if people had good ideas for them, but anti-capital is a field that's already got a capital class tasked to it."
6/28/2009,"supported for the following reason:cruisers were once the biggest ship in eve, then came battle ships, then came caps, then came super caps and now triple doomsdaying is far from unheard of. what next, mega caps that fire hac's as ammo?"
6/28/2009,no to anti-capital fighters but yes to new breeds (possibly).the anti-capital role is already fielded by so many ships a few battleships take out a carrier easily and with a dread it becomes even simpler. the carriers are support platforms and by no means damage platforms.new breeds of fighters would be nice but it comes to mind that pretty much every role is covered. maybe things such as logistical fighters could be a nice addition to add towards the logistical platform role.
6/28/2009,"they should not be as effective as dread, but more effective then current fighters."
6/28/2009,"there might be a point in giving them a solid anti capital ship angle, and only allowing motherships to be able to field them."

6/28/2009,"recently, ccp introduced a new set of faction cruisers to the game so that there would be a faction tier 1 and tier 2 cruiser for every race. while that's fine, there are issues when comparing slot layout. caracal navy issue:low slots: 4med slots: 5high slots: 6total slots: 15osprey navy issue: low slots: 3med slots: 5high slots: 4total slots: 12vexor navy issue:low slots: 6med slots: 3high slots: 5total slots: 14exequror navy issue:low slots: 5med slots: 3high slots: 4total slots: 12omen navy issue:low slots: 7med slots: 3high slots: 6total slots: 16augoror navy issue:low slots: 7med slots: 3high slots: 5total slots: 15stabber fleet issue:low slots: 6med slots: 4high slots: 5total slots: 15scythe fleet issue:low slots: 3med slots: 4high slots: 6total slots: 13as you can see, there are discrepancies between the slots of the various ships. when it comes to battleships, all tier 1s have the same number of slots (except for the dominix, because drone boats always get one less slot than other ships in their category). the same is true for tier 2s and tier 3s. if you look at battlecruisers, you see the same thing: tier 1s have the same slots at other tier 1s, etc. the same holds true for t2 ships: interceptors, afs, hacs, etc. so why does this category of ship get to be different, especially when it unbalances the ships. certain ships, such as the nexequror and the nosprey have as many as 3 slots less than their counterpart, the naugoror. the scythe, while still worse off than the naugoror, at least is a slot up on the other two. those are all the tier 1 faction cruisers. the same issue can be seen in the tier 2s. all have 15 slots except for the nomen (and the nexor, but that's because it's a drone ship). so why do some ships get more than others? how is that fair?my proposal is make all faction cruisers have the same number of total slots as their counterparts. i vote giving the nexequror another mid, the nosprey another high, keep the scythe how it is and remove a low and a high from the naugoror, giving all tier 1 faction cruisers 13 slots. for tier 2s, i vote keeping them all with 15 slots. that means only the nomen need be changed, losing that excess high slot. many people argue that slot layout isn't a means of balancing ships. and that's somewhat true. but if you homogenized the number of slots in each ship class, i think you'd find a natural balance coming through. but maybe not. i can't totally tell if that would balance them or not, but preliminary evidence suggests that it would go a long way."
6/28/2009,"on the surface i have to agree, but i havent messed around with any of the navy cruisers, so i dont know firsthand how balanced toward each other they may be. your argument makes sense, but i wont agree right away cause i would like to hear from some more folks who have used the ships."
6/28/2009,"balancing ships by pure counting of slots seems...sketchy. there may well be a problem here, but making your argument purely on slot count is unconvincing."
6/28/2009,"slot number and slot layout alone mean nothing.slot number, slot layout and ship bonuses in connection to ship type, tanking type, weapon system and base stats means something. so if you want to make a serious point, research all that and try to make a comparison."
6/28/2009,"why do you want to nerf faction cruisers? wtf? navy omen has the same slot layout like the old navy auguror, but diffrent to it, it is usefull(was intreduced in emperian age). simply since it can match a zealot but got another focus(more flexiblity for solo and close range combat because of the extra high slot and the drones while the zealot is still superior at range).the main problem is that all tier 1 faction cruisers are preaty mutch pointless atm since they lost her superior nano aspect.navy exequeror needs another med, a bit more powergrid for a large shield extender or 800mm plate and doubled structure hp(no you didn<U+FFFD>t read wrong, not armor, not shield, structure, since the only real job this ships performs halve deacend is something like a cruiser sized taranis).navy vexor needs one more med and some more grid so you can make it more ganky at close range than a ishtar(what is allready possible in a glas cannon setup). also 50m<U+FFFD> spare drones would make it more interesting."
6/28/2009,what made them **** is their price. cruisers costs from 3m to 8m current prices. navy version is around 100m? a price range of 20m-30m would be sufficient as entry level before battlecruisers.
6/28/2009,"alright, let me talk about balance. i'll go into the tier 1s at the moment, because those are the only ones that seem remarkably out-of-whack. nosprey:the nosprey sounds great. it's fast and agile, capable of pulling more than 2km/s. it sounds like a badass kiter--the cruiser version of a crow. but its grid is so horrible that you can only barely fit a mwd and a full rack of launchers, leaving no grid for tank or a cap booster. this is assuming that you're fitting 2 bcus in the lows so that your damage can compare to that of a similarly fit caracal. and the damage is respectable--about 340 with max skills and faction missiles--but this leaves the ship itself horribly fragile. even if you fit it with 3 field extenders, an invul ii and a medium shield extender (the only kind that will fit), you only get 13k ehp. aside from the kite fit, you could try a tank. but even if you devote every slot to running a tank (aside from one for the speed mod and one for the point), you still only end up with tanking a little more than 200 dps. and the kicker? you can't fit a full rack of launchers if you fit the cap booster necessary to run the tank. nexequror:this is an interesting ship on the surface. it's slightly faster than the nosprey and a bit more agile. and yet it has no real role; you can try using it like a thorax, but it's out-performed in almost every way--the rax is tougher, has better cap, and matches the nexequror's damage. alternatively, you can utilize its massive speed for a kiter fit, but its uses even then are limited as you have to use rails. your natural speed destroys your tracking, and so you can't actually use a ""speed tank""--it's more of a range tank, but more and more ships these days are fitting for range. if you fit a mwd and a full rack of guns, you no longer have the grid for anything remotely resebling a tank, which means any minmatar ship larger than a destroyer will be able to put significant damage onto you from your desired range with barrage, most amarr ships will be able to hit you effectively with scorch and all caldari ships (except a few frigates) will be able to hit you wherever you are. that means the only race of ships you can usually beat is gallente, and even then you run into problems with light drones (because you can't outrun them and you can't shoot them). yes, you can get a respectable 350 dps at that range, but only when you aren't using your mwd. also, just to put this in perspective, the nexequror setup that i use has 6k ehp. scythe fleet issue: (there's no way to shorten that)the scythe can only be used to kite. it's actually faster still than the nexequror, and it uses projectiles and missiles, neither of which run into trouble when tracking at high speeds. but like the nexequror, this ship is remarkably fragile--while it can fit a lse ii, it also needs to fit a pdu so that it can fit the falloff rigs necessary to push its range far enough to be meaningful. unlike its cousins, the scythe has a large drone bay (comparatively) and so can get the standard 350 dps without a damage mod. this means you're free to fit overdrives or nanos in the lows, leading to a very fast ship. out of all the kiting faction cruisers (well, tier 1 cruisers; the nomen and fleet stabber are different stories) the scythe is actually the most effective, though it does have the same cap problems as the other two. it can fit a cap booster in place of the lse, though it then becomes even more fragile than the nexequror. however, due to its fourth mid, it can fit support mods such as a web (so that it can kill drones) or a tracking disruptor. the scythe functions because it has the extra slot--it has the highs to deal damage equivalent to its counterparts while having the freedom (and grid, mind you) to fit support. the nexequror could do this, too, if it had a fourth mid and the nosprey could do it with a fifth high."
6/28/2009,"(continued)naugoror:the naugoror is not a kiter. can it kite? sure. it has the lows to be able to fit nanos/overdrives as well as heat sinks and the grid to fit a full rack of heavy pulse iis along with those heat sinks. if you want to kite with it, you can get a fit that goes 2km/s, hits at 25km for 310 dps, and--here's the kicker--has almost four times the ehp of the scythe and three times the ehp of the nexequror. but it's still slower and less damaging than the nosprey, so we can see that it's not a kiter. but it can tank. it's not the best damage dealer around, but if fit for an active tank, it can tank 400 dps with 30k ehp while dealing 210 dps and fitting tackle and a speed mod. none of the other ships in its class can even come close to these numbers. the nexequror can approach the ehp by devoting all its low slots to it, but if it does so, it nerfs its dps down to that of the naugoror fit here--essentially, you end up with a naugoror that has no active tank. moreover, if you fit for a purely passive buffer on the naugoror, you can get more than 130k ehp while still fitting a speed mod, tackle, and dealing 200 dps. again, none of the ships in its class can come close to these numbers. it seems to me that the extra slots are what unbalances this ship, as losing either 2 lows or a low and a high would mean, respectively, that 1) it still tanks harder than the other ships in its class but doesn't come near the bizarre numbers shown above or 2) it tanks significantly harder than its counterparts but loses more damage to compensate. as it is, this ship outperforms all the other in almost every way."
6/28/2009,"the day they announced the new faction cruisers, i was discussing this issue with corpmates. the navy omen is like a gift to the amarr from the benevolent dev-gods, while the navy exequror is like a slap in the face.navy exequror's damage and rate of fire bonus, but only 4 turrets and tiny drone bay ensure the dps will be mediocre no matter how you fit it. it can't tank, it can dps a bit, and it can't remote rep, which at least the non-faction variation can do. why bring it over a thorax?i see tons of navy omens around, and even in the alliance tourny, which makes sense. navy omen's a great ship. i think i've seen only 1 navy exequror, ever. turn the navy exequror into a navy thorax with decent stats please?"
6/28/2009,this.
6/28/2009,yup :)
6/28/2009,this post actually changed my mind on the subject. pointed out exploits and issues that i didnt see at first. good post.
6/28/2009,"ok. where is the problem here? if you meet me you will meet extreme specialization. do you honestly believe that and people will comply? so is this the fault of sp remap or the players being ******ed? no player with a sense of brain would remap to fotm. they would remap to what they want to fly. of course some will remap to fotm but that is their problem and not the system.that is where you are wrong. attributes are pretty much the same catagory. there is the same amount of whines for sp that there is for attributes. the choice of attributes too, is considered development process and the choice you make is the consequence you live with. but with attiributes remap you can just role over. no different from sp remap."
6/28/2009,"this would change the economy a lot... fotm and an instant increase in market competition with wasted sp put into industry/science... you train what you need. i would support a different kind of sp redistribution though: if a skill is less than 10% completed, you can put the sp into another skill... those few thousand sp that are lying around in useless/currently useless skills, with limitless uses, and maybe a 10% penalty. ofc the sp would have to be recalculated based on the time needed to train the skill (sp/min) (would keep people from training a specific skill for which they have good attributes and putting the sp into another skill)"
6/28/2009,no.
6/28/2009,"there is no valid reason why you should be able to spend skillpoints again, if you trained some useless skills then that be it.redistributing skillpoints towards skills you don't have is:a) not fair towards others who have trained the skills and are happy with the way they are and have no skillpoints they want to redistribute.b) not fair towards new players as they as well just like you will have to train the skills to actually get something while your taking the shortcut. your time in eve should not mean you get an horrendous advantage over the new guys (as seen with exponential skill training times).sure you will spend a few sp in a few skills you never use but this shouldn't be millions otherwise it is your own damn fault.let's drop the idea of matrix-style skill injection now please."
6/28/2009,"this ^^. scrams turning off mwd's actually made ab's worth using in pvp. and as it is, lots of people still think that ab's are a lolfit."
6/28/2009,"the whole great speed nerf patch was a horrible design change. i still have trouble understanding how that monstrosity was allowed to go through. and considering that it has, i don't believe there's any hope left in talking sense into ccp. it's over, we lost"
6/28/2009,"yep, no positives came with this change.afterburners are are still lolfits 99% of the time."
6/28/2009,"the speed nerf had a lot of dumb parts, but this was one of the good ones. scrams used to be lolfits, now there's actually a decision to be made. this proposal is not bad, per se, but it's unnecessary, and i dislike tiny changes, just because they're hard for players to keep up with."
6/28/2009,"so, what's the difference in terms of speed between an old 90% web and a warp scrambler?"
6/28/2009,did you fail first grade? read the thread. quoting what should've been obvious:
6/28/2009,wouldn't the better solution here be to boost abs such that they're not unusable on ships other than frigates?
6/28/2009,needed
6/28/2009,"the only party that is effectively and efficiently able to stop macros is ccp.unless they decide to really do so, it will not work without breaking the game.so instead of suggesting and debating means that don't fit the ends, you should run a campaign to make the csm put pressure on the issue on part of ccp. even though ccp usually wants suggestions from the csm that include a clear solution, this is one of the issues where the only thing that has to be done is to tell ccp that it is their frelling responsibility to fix it.i don't think they will do so, however. they make too much money from the macros, which makes the decision to remain inactive quite understandable from an economic point of view."
6/28/2009,"everyone with more than 3 active brain cells can understand that ccp is losing alot if money due to macro's. without macro's rmt'ing, all those isk buyers have to use gtcs, which results in more profit for ccp."
6/28/2009,more time to sink somewhere else
6/28/2009,topic is apparently raised from the dead.should be implemented like this.
6/28/2009,"that idea, i like a lot."
6/28/2009,"good idea, supported."
6/28/2009,you were given a rorqual and orca to fufill this
6/28/2009,lol you ignorant.
6/28/2009,#NAME?
6/28/2009,definetly supported.
6/28/2009,"definite support, removal of chance based invention would reduce pain, even if datacore requirement went up in proportion."
6/28/2009,"there is no such thing as an autopilot-to-0km-hackthe only trick i know is this one:1. set your autopilot settings to stop at each waypoint2. set a destination of your choice3. right-click the yellow gate in the overview and warp to 0km4. right-click the yellow gate in the overview and ""add as first waypoint""5. activate autopilot6. as you come out of warp on the gate, the autopilot jumps for you automatically7. as you come out of the jump, the autopilot stops (deactivates)8. repeat steps 3-7 until you reach your destinationthis in a covert ops ship fitted with a covert ops cloaking device is a way to travel pretty much undetected anywhere. just activate your cloak asap after step 3 (as soon as your ship starts moving), and again after step 5.you still have to be in front of your screen the whole way though, so this is not autopiloting."
6/28/2009,"not true. there is an executable that appears to manipulate eves memory to change the warp to 15km command to 0km.i'd like to use it, but i don't cheat..... others can use it, with no fear of being caught, because they want to.level playing field would be neat.... like i said, just something to discuss.only idea i've come across so far that doesn't break the current time-sink is a ""warp to 0 + jump on contact"" button, or the ability to tell it to jump mid-warp. means you're through the gate and 15km away from safety, but in low-sec to high-sec boundaries it would allow someone to go afk for that warp, knowing they'd be in highsec or a home system at the end. might just add some usability without making a fully automated ap to 0. not perfect but another tool that might work.as said above, afk is afk regardless of how auto-pilot works.edit: btw i really like the 5 click ""solution"" posted above lol.this isn't about ""a way to travel undetected"" or ""i want it to be easy"" it's about some people having autopilot to 0 while others don't.how to fix. how to level playing field."
6/28/2009,"i totally don't support this. yeah sure it would make sense for an advanced autopilot to warp to 0, but it would break the game as we know it. suddenly 20 jumps is not far anymore. freighters arrive at their destination an hour earlier than now, which would cause markets to level (aka destroying local markets), which would be terrible annoying for the thousands of people who earn their isk with that. low sec? ah what the hell, let's just auto pilot through it while watching a movie on one screen and eve on the other. no!"
6/28/2009,"no this is about you making ridiculous claims based on hearsay or not based on anything at all. you just had a revelation and now can see how half of eve is using a modified executable to update their autopilot.have you reported that mythical exploit to cpp? because that's what you do, not spawn yet another thread in assembly hall."
6/28/2009,"i'm sorry but reality does not require your belief.the exe exists, is in somewhat wide-spread use, and functions very well.i'm simply posting a thread so that possible solutions to re-leveling the playing field can be discussed.as for reporting it, i'm sure the devs are aware. i'm not here to take this tool away from anyone. i think it's a good feature and for some it might be critical to their accessibility of the game. i choose not to use it but have no problem with those who do, as said above, afk is still afk.yes i am a bit sick of what i've seen from the csm and have been trolling it up as i found the serious approach to be a bit of a joke around here. so you can take that personally if you like. that can be your problem."
6/28/2009,"so they're doing that now using this exploit.......looking for a solution (or a balance for non-exploiters) to that, not a cause."
6/28/2009,not supported. this would make hauling in hi sec even more easier than it already is.although op has a good point. it is probably pretty easy to automate warp to 0 route with macros and bookmarks :p i would not be suprised if some people had been using it from 2003 or so already :p
6/28/2009,if by ''hack'' you mean the old trick of assigning your mwd to f1 and putting a weight on f1 with autopilot on
6/28/2009,"well, i just did a quick search on google for ""eve online autopilot bot"" and surprisingly found a lot of results. i'm not going to test any of them because i don't need such a thing, but some seem like they are in deed working, or were working until recently. i'm sure ccp is well aware of those however."
6/28/2009,"no, no, and no. actually fly your ship if you want to wtz."
6/28/2009,"i would also like this, as long as you come out at 15km from the station (same as for stargates).i do see one problem with this change though which could make it more complicated. for now, the autopilot waypoint system only takes system id's and not station id's. this means they would have to allow stations as a final destination.don't get me wrong, i'd love to see this happen, but i don't think it will be high in their priorities."
6/28/2009,no support. afk ease is not eve.
6/28/2009,agreed. not supported.
6/28/2009,which is stupid.if you want to make a point compare it with dualweb.
6/28/2009,"might be interesting, but it seems unnecessary."
6/28/2009,"it sounds like something that the thorax/deimos should have... i don't fly them, but it seems that the people who do adapted themselves very good. wasting a low slot for a +1 mwd sounds ok, but then people just fit dual scram.edit: can you stick to one thread for each proposal please? i got another one at"
6/28/2009,"the suggestion is simple, and resembles the ""send to"" context menu in windows for the ones who know what i'm talking about.basically, the context menu would allow you to move items from your cargo to your personal or corporation hangar without having to open both containers side by side and drag-droping the item.this would be especially useful for haulers or when you want to quickly offload something in the corporation hangar.for the corporation hangar, the context menu would show all available tabs.possible destinations would be:- cargo hold (current ship)- personal hangar- corporation hangar > hangar tabs"
6/28/2009,oh... and i support myself. woot!
6/28/2009,"as part of the overhaul to context menus, this could work, yes."
6/28/2009,"[x] the ninja salvager should be aggro'd to the mission runner after the first wreck is salvaged, because the mission runner owns the wrecks, and i feel that ccp needs to change the current dynamic.ccp - please take this situation seriously, i play with many mission runners and the current rules cause them and me a lot of greif we all think its unfair. i am sorry to say, that this is one thing about eve that i hate.to the salvage ninjas, stop being carebares and hiding behind concord. at least mission runners take the time and risk their considerably more expensive ships running missions, and it is not so you can freely and safly steal our hard earned salvage. the bring up bogus reasons why you should be allowd to continue. if you want to excursize your criminal sides there are plenty of low sec systems... oh wait, thats right all ninja salvagers are lazy cowards. last thing, any one who is opposed to this is a salvage ninja or dose not understand what we are taking about. i cannot not wait until this injusttice is fixed."
6/28/2009,this is quite true and for this reason if for none of the others the suggestion to increase times is a valid one - personally i'd go for 3 minutes and make gates the same. i think this will result in a lot more corpies hiding in next system shenanigans but so be it.. docking games - especially with capitals could do with a shake up and this is a great sugestion.
6/29/2009,"supported what about using the old effect but have the capital slide outta the worm hole effect, like it fly threw it, not formed the worm hole around it."

(bs and above i consider pos warfare tools ) agreed, there are faction ships which do ok. faction bs for our mission carebears. navy caracal and fleet stabber do a pretty good job in pvp, as well as the phantasm. but what about the rest?cynabal? 160m right now, less dps, slower, less effective hp, less drones and med slots than a vaga making it less versatile ... actually, it does nothing better than a vagabond, all at the same time. it just looks better vigilant? just some sort of black deimos with crappy statsgila? totaly uselessnot to mention all the faction and pirate faction frigs. i would ask the csm to support a review of these faction ships, to make them actually viable for pvp. to be clear. i'm not saying those faction or pirate faction vessels should match t2. but if they don't and somebody would say (for some odd reason) they were went to be between t1 and t2, then rebalance them by adjusting bpc drop rates to get a lower price tag according to their power."

[as an aside i think a drone bonus on the gila is a horrible idea, but primarily for immersion reasons.]"
6/29/2009,"yes pls, it's about time!"
6/29/2009,"the csm's job is not game balance, that's held by the qa people at ccp. the most they could do is ask them what the story is on these ships. as they are rare drops by commanders, the only real way to change anything about the cost is to have more commanders drop them, but then you get into market saturation and such.i'm sure the qa guys have their hands full with the strategic cruisers right now, but the csm could advance this issue still. perhaps in one of the csm/ccp q&a sessions. while i support this measure, don't expect a quick response, as ccp has their hands full already."
6/29/2009,"they are available from the relevant lp stores. the gila is acquired from the guristas just as the navy caracal can be acquired from the state... excluding the vastly increased risk of mission-running in npc 0.0 that is. same applies to all of them.[edit: they are also dropped by certain npc's so your not wrong there, though commanders aren't the only ones to drop the bpcs]"
6/29/2009,"while i agree with bunyip, i also like the overall idea of making the faction ships more viable. making them fully insurable could be a way.they are pretty, they are cool, they are tied to the world of new eden. aren't factions supposed to be important, eh?now all those sexy ships are mostly gathering dust. subsequent changes in mechanics (nos for example) and the introduction of t2 and new modules warrants a closer look at faction ships. let's leave the specifics to ccp but imo they should put this on a 'todo' list at least."
6/29/2009,"relevant to our interests: linkagelooks like the devs intend to look into the issue but it's on the distant horizon, so long as the price/performance ratio works out better in the end i don't mind which side of scale is tipped, though i'm still of the opinion a bit of both would be ideal.i still support this issue as i don't think the devs realize just how long many players have been waiting for a full review of these ships, nor the importance they have for those representing the outlaw factions."
6/29/2009,"yes indeed. i thought i was the only one thinking this. on another note, i also think faction gear needs a revamp. as it stands, they're only expensive toys for mission runners, and the same goes for the faction ships.i say, remove the artificial price tag barrier in the lp store (no isk for bpc's), and let the players decide the price tag. increase the drop rates as well. after all, this is a pvp game no? then shouldn't the best gear/ships also be geared towards pvp?/support with additionsps: btw, battleships are pvp. rr bs gang anyone? foty anyone?"
6/29/2009,"god bless you! yes, and yes again."
6/29/2009,"fully supported, although i doubt that the ccp will do it."
6/29/2009,"you should be pushing for is a string of player editable commands that would allow players to modify colors, font, font size, and font color, and other minor things like that. it should not include skinning of in game objects, creation of executable commands, or changing of in game sounds. you should stay away from using ""players to create addons for the game interface"" because it sounds like you want to allow players to create custom ui's rather then modifying ccp's by using ccp's own scripting environment you expect them to create. ccp sees the entire client as a ui to the database server that actually runs the game."
6/29/2009,"this is very much like my ""commercial"" cynos and jumpdrive idea for the jump freighters, which you can read if you check my sig below."
6/29/2009,"on one hand, it's pretty much the same as when they changed cov cyno's to be usable in cynojammed systems, so there's no reason not to support it. it has nothing to do with the ships themselves, it doesn't change anything about black ops at all. all it does is allow the ships to be used in an area where they cannot be utilized currently, just like the change to allow them in cynojammed space allowed their use in sov 0.0 regions with const sov/prevalent cynojammed space. it allows a subset of players (empire war dec corps) access to a ship class that they currently lack (along with their unique tactics/abilities), and opens up another subset of players (highsec carebears who get wardec'd) to being victims of a whole new world of griefing/ganking tactics.on the other hand, do corps who run around decing highsec corps full of carebears/newbies/casuals really need/deserve any new toys? especially ones which can be utilized to such devastating effect in an environment like empire vs the types of unsuspecting targets that inhabit highsec? do they really need even more advantages? i mean come on, you're seal clubbing...baby seal clubbing at that. the hardest part of empire wars is finding targets who will undock during a wardec at all, which is why i understand why'd you be interested in adding black ops to your toolbox, they enable so many options and enable you to exploit opportunities for kills that you couldn't accomplish otherwise. but that's kind of the problem.if they allow covert cyno's to be used in highsec space, the first war dec corp that actually uses them properly is going to create so much drama and result in such a massive amount of carebear tears/forum whines to the point that eventually ccp will have to change something, and ccp's method of balancing something is to nerf it and everything associated with it into the stone age. then on top of that, they also do the simple, minor change like ""whoops, ok lets roll that back, you can't use cov cyno's in highsec any more"", ya know the thing that would have solved the problem alone, without destroying several entire ship line ups in the process? but by that point you're left with a ship that has 3 highslots, a 1ly jump range with jdc v, that requires 500m3 worth of fuel to jump itself to a ""covert"" cyno which lasts 5 minutes, now pulses an ecm burst every 20 seconds jamming everyone on grid, can only be lit by blockade runners (who can no longer fit a covert ops cloak), which also broadcasts it's location in the local chat of every system in the constellation every 3 seconds to remind everyone what you're doing and where. then ccp will say ""ok highsec carebears stop crying we fixed it, the bad men can't light covert cyno's in high sec anymore"" to which everyone responds ""gee thanks, but if you didn't notice, with all the other nerfs, why would anyone ever bother to fly a black ops, or light a covert cyno anywhere, much less in high sec?"" which ccp will respond ""well see there you go, why did we waste those man hours implementing these changes when the problem solved itself anyway? we can't justify allocating any more dev/review time on this until winter expansion 2012, and by 2012, we of course mean 2014, which is when we'll actually get around to adding the fuel bay we've been promising we'd add for the last 4 expansions in a row."""
6/29/2009,"i find this highly intriguing, but i think one relevant point has been missed, drug running. those blue and red pills would be super easy to get into hi sec now. not sure if that should be made easy. i will reserve my option to support or not support until somebody addresses this possible issue."
6/29/2009,if you fly enough strategic ships that this is a problem...you need to rethink your strategy.no support. i'm glad they added this feature.--isaac
6/29/2009,"yep, useless feature that adds nothing to the game. less meaningless timesinks and horrible ""features."""
6/29/2009,"actually i like the proposal. i've always been a fan of the idea of being able to color all or part of our ship hulls, and i definitely like the idea of corp and alliance logos on them.your proposal to have these colors and logos load last under load is sensible - this keeps large fleet battles from lagging (more than they do already). to this i would add the suggestion that logos cache so they don't have to be reloaded if the client already has them."
6/29/2009,supported. i for one would like a bit more personality in ships.
6/29/2009,+1 from me.
6/29/2009,ok
6/29/2009,i'd like it if you could opt as to which logo went where (corp in the 'big' slot and the like) a lot of people associate more with their corp then a larger entity.*edit*forgot my thumb.
6/29/2009,"nay.as much as the server hardware for this game have been very impressively stable thus far, i'm not going to support any initiative that is going to strive towards putting more stress and strain on the network and hardware.i am also, speaking from the perspective of a roleplayer who may have the most reason, and/or cause to support something like this. but for the greater interest, no thanks.furthermore, for all practical purposes, when i want to shoot at someone, it's mostly zoomed out anyway. all manner of noticed 'personalisation' is a) your name b) your shiptype c) your relative veolicty d) your loot and fittings.i'm not going to be impressed with how you're going to express your sexual orientation with how pink your ship is.so, once more. nay.edit: furthermore, endorsing your own proposal = fail. it doesn't speak well for your confidence in what you proposed."
6/29/2009,"i heartily endorse this product and/or service.i would like to see this opt-in only, that would reduce the strain quite a bit. under high loads the server and client should neglect the extra information, prioritizing the normal information.regardless, this addition would take a substantial amount of effort to implement and i would sooner like to see ambulation take off."
6/29/2009,"as i see this, the main problem will be loading the textures. and the man hours put into accually finding them places for the logos. don't discurage, i think this idea is totaly awesome =)someone mentioned that throwing the logos into the client. this is a rather smart idea, as it would also let ccp control when the logos is realeased/approving them. ccp does regular patches, they could be realeased with these patches. however, i think there should be some costs added since this will take manhours away from ccp.another issue is the logo it self. most gallente ships are gray/some greenish colour and the minmatarian are red/rust to blakish. should a logo accually be glued onto the ship with epoxy? point is, that a logo sitting on gallente ship x&y, just may not accually fit on minmatar x&y. i'd like to see this id<U+FFFD>a introduced. damn, i can almost sign my self up to work the graphics to make this work!"
6/29/2009,"since you get uncloaked as soon as you come within 2000 meters of another object, it would be a good thing if we could see cloaked ships that are in our corp or fleet as if they were not cloaked (or with a limited transparency) and that they show on the overview as well.this would make stealth bomber operations a little easier.just try to coordinate a wing of stealth bomber to get in position in order to alpha-strike the same target, without risking coming too close from your own wingmates... it can be a little tricky if you can't even see them!we should at least be able to see their bracket in space and in the overview!"
6/29/2009,what he said.
6/29/2009,"i concur. having never flown a cloaked ship, i didn't realize this was a problem, but it seems like a huge liability to me. if you need an rp backstory call it computer overlay based on fleet transponder positioning or something."
6/29/2009,"this would be a great addition, and really help coordinate sbs and recon ships.even if just the bracket appeared, and the ship remained cloaked it would be usable."
6/29/2009,"no thank you. i can just see the mittinanni whispering into his mic, ""go left brosef no harder left, idjut you went past him!!!"""
6/29/2009,i'm a fan of cloaking. i think cloaking is already nicely balanced. no change needed. no support.
6/29/2009,why do you have friendlies on your pvp overview?
6/29/2009,"i'm fine with a redesign/rebuff of info war in general as a stealth eos bonus, but something needs to change.probe strength bonus, drone speed/tracking/range, improve the % increase for the sensor strength link (or broaden it to include targeting range/speed and tracking speed/rang), etc etc. there's a lot of ways to go about it"
6/29/2009,"fully support giving this ship a bump. increase the drone bandwidth for a full compliment of heavies, balance by not giving drone bonuses. give it a self bonus to sensor strength and the game finally has a counter to the ecm recons. people might actually fly this ship again. right now the only sub capital ships i see flown by gallente are vex, domi, mega, myrm and ishtar. we need more than five ships. gallente command and recon ships are total fail. everything else is merely ""toyed with"" while training to get into one of the five."
6/29/2009,i am not flying the eos until it has been fixed. +1.
6/29/2009,"either the eos, or information warfare, or possibly both need some adjustments."
6/29/2009,its be nice
6/29/2009,support. =)
6/29/2009,i support this as a guardian pilot....
6/29/2009,great idea.. needs to be done soonest.
6/29/2009,great idea.
6/29/2009,as a basilisk and a onerios pilot wholly supported.
6/29/2009,"good idea, more logistics means longer battles .. im up for that"

6/29/2009,i agree completely. would make me want to actually be a logistics pilot.

6/29/2009,agreed.assists and logistics need to be counted.
6/29/2009,+1 for this
6/29/2009,"i support this, credit to the pilots who were good enough to fill the logistic role!"
6/29/2009,/agreed
6/29/2009,what about giving these to motherships to give them a better defined role? curious as to how others feel about this before i cast my vote.*edit* seems the poster above me had the same idea.
6/29/2009,"hi, i'd like to propose that a neutral logistics ship be flagged with the same combat agression mechanics that prevent docking when remote repping targets involved in a war (factional, empire whatever).cheers."
6/29/2009,i think this was proposed recently. it received a lot of support. not sure where the topic went.
6/29/2009,"supported. changing to a hybrid bonus rather than a medium hybrid bonus: it wouldn't affect existing medium users and allow a slight boost to small hybrids, very minimal. i dont think you can fit a large hybrid so no issue there."
6/29/2009,"op; how about proposing that it be changed to something, rather than just leaving it open ended? i see a disturbing trend happening in this section, where someone will point out a problem, but not pose a real solution to it, and people will blindly support it.for this forum to work, there has to be proposed fixes as well as pointing out problems.so, change the bonus to what, exactly?it's not like either of the ships are exactly in need of a buff. both perform quite well when compared to their peers.not supported.edit - also, changing the bonuses to all hybrid turrets would mean that the vexor hull was the only hull in the gallente lineup to receive a bonus to all hybrid turret damages, instead of being size specific like every other gallente ship. i think that any ship that isn't limited to its size of turret/bay should possibly be looked at."
6/29/2009,"you don't need to forward a solution to believe there's a problem.since the job of the csm is to put issues before ccp often having no solution may be better as people might agree that there is a problem but not agree on the solution and so not support the issue.there's nothing wrong with either approach in my view, nor with an op with multiple possible solutions or an op that calls on the community to suggest solutions. we don't all feel we have all the answers."
6/29/2009,"no support. there are enough foolproof, forgiving children's game. let us have one for ourselves. :)"
6/29/2009,"i like to see pre-pay new clone body. make clone is for 100k or so, just add column for buying bigger version there. when you buying new clone you can buy bigger one at once."
6/29/2009,no. eve has risk. real risk associated with some of it. welcome to it. embrace it. it's not like it's a difficult task to update your clone every third month or so.no. count me as one who does not wish to partake in your auto-clone-updatey-thing.
6/29/2009,"all i had to read was the topic, i agree =d"
6/29/2009,"inspired a bit by this threaddrone hijacking. a ship or module specifically used for hacking into an enemy's drone signal. the success rate would have to be very low (like 25% tops? i dunno, i pulled that number out of my ass), long cycle time, limited by ship bandwidth, **** concord off, and fighters should be immune.lets say i fly into a fight against a domi that has some hateful ogre iis tearing into a corpy of mine. i start up my little drone pilfering module up on my drone pilfering ship, and get to work trying to take over the domi's drones. first cycle fails. second cycle fails - dammit. third cycle nabs one of the bastards. sweet. now i set this drone against the owner. being a domi, of course, he just launches another and blows his former drone to pieces.in my little drone pilfering ship i can hijack drones that are outside of my skillset (honestly, the skillset for this should be very high, so theoretically i should be able to fly all drones anyway), but i can't launch them if they aren't in my skillset. in otherwords, i would only be able to use the drones i steal in the one fight. if i warp off, i lose control of the drone. if i collect the drone, i can't launch it because i don't have the skills.maybe have the counter be some kind of drone link encryption module that works like eccm, except the part where eccm doesn't work. this should not be a wtfpwn against drone boats and as such, it should be a total pain in the ass to pull off, but i think it would add another interesting layer to small gang fights. this is just a rough idea. if there is interest, i'll flesh it out. this is also in the ""new feature"" category, therefor is not as high a priority as the ""fixin ****"" category."
6/29/2009,supporting my awesometacular idea.
6/29/2009,"this is useless, because it is useless.if you can fly a special ship with any decency that is able to snatch a few drones every once in a while, you would do much more good if you'd be flying even the crappiest destroyer in the region and simply shot at those drones directly."
6/29/2009,why would anyone bother with this?
6/29/2009,"i have a cool idea too. how about a module that lets you disable a pilots guns with a low chance of success (only 99%), and a long cycle time (2 seconds). this would clearly be balanced because i say so."
6/29/2009,"well i am not real sure why i should give you sensitive business information as to how i and my corpm8s pay for our nice shiny toys. or rather those interesting arrangements of 0's and 1's that look really cool on my monitor. either way i'm just curious as to wether any of you have managed to locate any noob corps that we have ""griefed"". i rather doubt it as all those who have recieved a successful visitation from us are probably not going to talk about it. i also know that i really don't want any competitors in our business, figure out your own way of making isk please."
6/29/2009,"well is that supposed to say ""dossier with news that will""? oh man was i tempted to stick a z in there."
6/29/2009,"i have a navy exequror because i collect ships. it would be nice if i could actually fly it without looking making an idiot of myself.however, i still think that fixing these things is more complex than slot layout. the ship bonuses and stats also need to be reviewed."
6/29/2009,"unless i am mistaken the reasons ccp gave some time ago for not reviewing and adding faction ships was ""only a few people use them, so we are dedicating our work to more important matters""naturally as long as the faction ship are mostly overpriced and inefficient showpieces the will not be used. and so they will not be changed.and not used.and so on. i am for a generalized reexamination of all the faction ships so that they become really a useful intermediate step between t1 and t2."
6/29/2009,the fact that all pirate ships are incredibly shi tty is a clear sign that everything is fu cked. make them better than tier 1 ships please. fix minmater.
6/29/2009,"i'm no longer making this all about slot layout, because that's sparking too much debate. here's what i'm looking for: balance. all i want is faction cruisers to be reviewed and balanced. i personally think that changing the slots as i've laid out above will go a long way toward doing that. does that mean ship bonuses shouldn't be reviewed too? not at all."
6/29/2009,"or maybe a penalty is added whereby the cost is 2 to 1, i.e. you lose 50% of the sp you want to redistribute.either way don't believe i could support this"
6/29/2009,"this way it can be supported, and tbh had the same idea not too long ago. with really ""useless"" skills that 50% loss is not that much, while the boost of it is still nice, but that will gonna stop people just switching their complete skill tables every day. 30+% is enough imo, but 50% sounds just as good.so: conditional support from me (sp loss!!!)"
6/29/2009,"also, no."
6/29/2009,"i want to be able to unlearn mining lvl1, trade 3, etc. i don't even care about the sp, i just don't want an ugly skillsheet. have a 2 day waiting period like the 1 day for character deletion to protect hacked accounts etc.this ability would be quite similar to real life, i often get incredibly drunk and forget how to do things."
6/29/2009,"yes, because you consciously devoted real time to train skills to 5. i'd love getting hit by that maxed dps. people who didn't train those skills shouldn't be just as good.real-time training is the only measure of dedication in eve. thank god it's not grinding or playtime per week. let's not take that away. it's happening in so many different mmos. just look at world of warcraft and the 'required specialization' drama. when respecialization (resetting the talent build) was available freely, people were forced to play a specific role or not be allowed into guilds at all. not all guilds did that but the majority of the best ones? yup. and it worked on so many unhappy people. blizzard did their best to remove that problem but wow has different ways of player progression which eve lacks.players being ******ed is the reason behind sp remaps. worst case, you put all the attribute points into charisma and want to train gunnery. you always have the option of implants and learnings to boost your other attributes. and you can work to train your dream ships anyway. attributes were never choosing one thing over the other, they were a matter of preference. and the world of new eden makes it plain that 'attributes' can be manipulated by in-game in-character means.skill training on the other hand is a final choice. you can never, ever train two skills in the same amount of real time. it's exclusive and retains 'story' and unique traits of a character. completely reassigning skills would make us play faceless, irrelevant chars like in a typical fps where each character can use any gun."
6/29/2009,"(seems i might have posted this in the wrong channel, this one looks better =d) something i would really like to see in an upcoming patch would be the ability to manually move your ship. double-clicking in space is getting annoying considering its a bit glitchy and slow to respond. perhaps a game mechanic that would allow you to hold the right mouse button or hold a certain key down and point your cursor in any direction and your ship will go that way. this would be extremely useful for speed tanked ships (most of minmitar, much luv =d) as it would allow them more maneuverability around the grid. this would allow speed tanked ships more ease of use considering their only option is to orbit in a battle, which can be easily countered."
6/29/2009,"this has been proposed several times, and it always comes down to the same thing: it would create too much network traffic and most probably severely contribute to lag.i would love this as well though, but i think it's wishful thinking.maybe a csm can still bring it up and get an official response from ccp, but i think there's higher priorities than this. maybe they would, however, have a way of implementing this so it doesn't cause problems, you never know."
6/29/2009,"no, i mean it would be nice for maneuvering in asteroid belts, as aligning can be a pain when there's an asteroid in your way, but i don't think its really needed"
6/29/2009,you're comparing a single modules effect (90% web) to 2 modules effects (scram + 60% web). if you want to compare apples to apples then you should have 2 x 90% webs in your first example.
6/29/2009,i completely endorse this new feature of warp scramblers. i don't think it undermines gallente blaster boats at all. this is a whole new way to deal with nano f4gs and the arazu/lachesis now make an excellent tackler in this sense.i also agree that the person who stated the difference from before and after with webs/scrams was comparing 2 mods against 1. you do in fact need to consider that you've got 2 propulsion jamming mods there.
6/29/2009,"here's a more detailed comparison regarding the scram/web changes. mind you a battleship is the worst example to use a) because they're not fast enough to worry about decreasing their speed that much, using multiple propulsion reduction modules is usually used vs smaller ships which are fast enough to either run away or evade damage otherwise, battleships aren't going anywhere; and b) because the impact of the changes primarily impact engagements between ships of different size classes, ie it allows smaller ships to fight inside 10km of larger ships without exploding the moment they are webbed, and to check that, the next step up from a battleship is a dreadnought. alas:dual 1600 plated, triple trimarked megathron (ehp total also includes dc ii, 2xeanm ii's)technically max mwd speed was higher pre-patch but i don't feel like looking it up, besides it's not relevant when measuring the impact of the scram/web changesmax mwd speed: 822m/s, sig radius: 2400m2 pre-patch2x 90% webbed speed: 18m/s, sig radius: 2400m2impact on mobility: 2% of max mwd speedimpact on tracking: ion siege blaster cannons from a sieged moros @ 7.5km range from the megathron each have an 84.5% chance to hit, 3xions deal 36.5k raw damage per volley (every 6.5 seconds) before hit quality is factored in (actual damage increases ~35% when chance to hit is around 85%). factoring in hit chance and hit quality, the 125k ehp (vs dmg profile of faction am xl) megathron explodes in 13 seconds on the 3rd turret volley. the mwd cycle itself lasts for 10 seconds, so depending on when during the mwd cycle the megathron was webbed, unless he was able to deactivate the mwd in time, it's possible the megathron explodes before he can do anything about it. engagements where your ship explodes within moments of being webbed to a couple of turret volleys is better known as ""what happens when you fly a frigate within 10km of anything, pre-qr"", and the mega is just as helpless vs the sieged dread as a rifter would of been had it been dual webbed within 10km of the mega. this is simply from turrets btw, it does not include the 1k+ drone dps from the moros.post-patchscrambled + 60% webbed speed: 46m/s, sig radius 400m2impact on mobility: 5.5% of max mwd speedimpact on tracking: ion siege blaster cannons from a sieged moros @ 7.5km range from the megathron each have a 6.6x10^-18... basicallly 0% chance to hit. vs the same moros out of siege, ion siege blasters have an 80% chance to hit, dealing ~750 dps after factoring in hit chance and hit quality, which is less turret dps than the megathron. the megathron explodes after 2 minutes & 41 seconds (again ignoring drone dps) allowing plenty of time for the mega to fly out of scram/web range of the moros if he so chooses.note: this ignores the massive impact that webs have on a ship's inertia and ability to turn, change directions, etc."
6/29/2009,"in short: not only did ships move slower while dual-webbed pre-patch, they also did it with a signature the size of a whole planet.webs, scrams, mwds and afterburners became a lot more interesting post-patch."
6/29/2009,the issue is really that warp scrambler is overpowered in the way that it immediatly shuts down the mwd. a more balanced effect would be for it to disable re-activation of the mwd instead; giving the pilot at least minor chance to get out depending on how long he is into his activation.
6/29/2009,agreed
6/29/2009,this sounds like an interesting idea.
6/29/2009,"this shouldn't be a skill.this should be automatic. when you disconnect, you should be able to reconnect to your drones on re-entry. during the time you're disconnected, they should be susceptible to the usual pilfering and getting shot at. while this issue needs looking at, creating a new skill for it is the wrong way to go about it. /not supported."
6/29/2009,"you shouldn't need to train a skill or use a module to compensate for an out of game issue (disconencting).what next, training isk laundering to level 5 and gm's won't ban you for selling it on ebay?it should be an existing game mechanic... if you dc, you're drones warp back to the dronebay or at least go inert and drop agro so that the pve'ers can catch a break."
6/29/2009,"fully supported. why cant we reconnect like the probers can to their probes within a set time? i can launch a bunch of probes, leave the system, return and connect/collect my probes. why not give drones the same functionality. one would think that drones are nothing more than larger, attack versions of probes..."

6/29/2009,"something i would really like to see in an upcoming patch would be the ability to manually move your ship. double-clicking in space is getting annoying considering its a bit glitchy and slow to respond. perhaps a game mechanic that would allow you to hold the right mouse button or hold a certain key down and point your cursor in any direction and your ship will go that way. this would be extremely useful for speed tanked ships (most of minmitar, much luv =d) as it would allow them more maneuverability around the grid. this would allow speed tanked ships more ease of use considering their only option is to orbit in a battle, which can be easily countered."
6/29/2009,no one got an opinion on this ? :(
6/29/2009,wonderful idea. start a fight and you have to actually finish it.perhaps modify the time to re-dock by standings (better standings = faster while negative standings would be longer). more immersive that way.
6/29/2009,"docking games really need to be fixed especially where capitols are concerned, a set three minute timer is a bad idea because it would have negative effect on pvp in general as you cannot have a fight and leave a system or kill a gangs light tackle on a gate and warp to the next gate. not being able to dock without leaving the grid first or waiting out a longer time that resets once you leave the grid sounds good but there is a slight potential problem as grids can be manipulated and there could be some funky situations involving 800km grids or mini grids within grids.maybe a hard fixed limit of 20-50km outside the docking radius would be less exploitable using grid manipulation, so once a ship aggresses it either has to fight it out or try to escape by leaving the area or evade its attacker until it can leave the area and re-approach."

6/30/2009,"no to this. i use my thrasher in optimal virtually all the time, and having the bonus changed would do severe damage to arty thrashers. worse quality hits, worse damage at range."
6/30/2009,"supported, but only in the general sense that destroyers need some serious attention. they were fine when the only t2 ship was the intercepter. these days they are coffins unless flown extremely carefully (ie, warping out after shooting once or twice).major issues include:1) sig to ehp ratio is waaay off when compared to frigates and cruisers, let alone bc. 2) dps is too low to kill a t2 frigate quickly (even if you spend as much on your destroyer as that frigate costs), yet speed and slots do not permit tackling your target. alpha is only acceptable on the thrasher, due to arties with damage bonus, and this is the reason that ship is popular. 3) you cannot afford to use a mwd to counteract point #2, and tackle/dps at close range, because it blows your sig up to bs size and you are quickly instapopped. once you realize you're locked by an enemy hac/bs and about to be vaporized, your agility is too low to abort your run and escape--you just die.4) your range, even with double small-gun range, is insufficient to play escort to larger ships. it takes enormous work to make any destroyer other than the cormorant shoot out to 30km. the rails, which are used with longer-range ammo for the cormorant to accomplish this, can be tanked by an interceptor at that range. 30km is the ""magic number"", because that's the normal, un-overheated point range for the tackling interceptor line. 5) the -25% rof penalty is supposed to make the ships into ""alpha"" creatures, but that doesn't work anymore unless you're using small artillery (which do alpha rather well against frigate-sized targets) with a damage bonus. the penalty accomplishes this by trading cost (more guns) for that alpha. but since most ships have more hp now than when the destroyers were first introduced, and the proliferation of t2 ships and equipment render the destroyer so fragile, it just doesn't work and needs to be re-thought.6) following some deep thinking about how to accomplish the purpose of the destroyer class, there needs to be another hull model (or at least another ship) introduced for each race. destroyer is the only t1 class that has one (1) ship in its category. even haulers have 2 or more t1 ships (using different models), though the differences are often too small to matter to pilots!comments on specific destroyers:a) coercer -- i love this ship. it's sexy-looking, uses lasers, and you can actually sqeeze some dps (but not alpha) out of it if you make it a complete ""glass-cannon"". you used to be able to get 30km range from it if you rigged it into a 40-mil ship (which i did), and really surprise arrogant inti pilots, but the locus nerf killed that. coercer does not need another mid-slot. it needs a 60m sig radius, removal of the rof penalty, reduction of turrets to 6, and movement of one high slot to lows. could also use about 30 more cpu, but dropping the number of guns would help with this.b) cormorant -- good in its role, which is (very) light sniper. it cannot do anything else, however, and rail alpha at range is a joke. if you attempt to tank it, you sacrifice range and damage and become completely irrelevent, except as 20 seconds of distraction for one (1) enemy cruiser. cormorant also needs 60m sig radius, removal of the rof penalty, 6 turrets, and movement of one high slot to low. fitting should be reviewed. c) catalyst -- you can actually get a small amount of damage out of this ship as well, if you go with the ""glass cannon"" approach. it's actually almost as well-regarded in some circles for this as the thrasher, because you can mwd, point, and pray. that can get you a kill on a t2 frigate, before someone notices and vaporizes you. this ship needs, again, 60m sig radius, removal of the rof penalty, 6 guns, movement of 1 high slot to low, and switching of the falloff bonus for a rof or damage bonus. (really... falloff for hybrids? wtf?)<continued>"
6/30/2009,"<continued>d) thrasher -- universally regarded as the best destroyer out there because of the damage bonus, slot layout, artillery alpha, and speed + smaller sig radius. in other words, almost everything. this ship needs little help. what should be done is to harmonize with the other changes without nerfing it, or namely: decrease sig radius to 55m, drop the rof penalty, reduce turrets to 6, and move one high slot to low. review the fitting stats accordingly. the thrasher alpha would actually decrease, unfortunately, even with adding another gyrostabilizer, but it would more than benefit from increased dps.----in other points, the destroyer class as a whole needs a dedicated, t2 anti-light support ship capable of keeping af and interceptors off larger bc and bs. it needs to be gun-based, not missile (unlike the interdictors--excepting the minmatar one, again!), and it needs to be a new class--not an ""interdictor"". interdictors die instantly because of their super-dangerous role (bubbling) to an enemy fleet. an actual anti-support ship does not need to be saddled with that burden.--krum"
6/30/2009,destroyers need love indeed. a lot!it says enough that 99% of the new players are advised to skip the destroyers and to skill towards cruisers instead.edit to check the support-box
6/30/2009,"they need either there dps increased, so in the short amount of time they do survive they actually do some damage, or effective hp increase. since the ships are cheap, i think making them high-dps boats with paper armour would be interesting, therefore i support the idea of getting rid of rof penalty. catalysts and comorant do need more powergreed, all other ships can fit all high-caliber guns, includiong coercer and thrasher (another destroyers), so why are catalysts and comorant so handicapped? there fore support here as well.extra slot would make them more effective.therefore full support. that's my question as well, i also don't get that.yon krum- most of your ideas correspond with that of the topicks author, except for the author whants to make all destroyers glass canons with high-dps, and you try to adjust there slot layout so that they actually survive for a while, but reduce there dps by reducing guns. those are 2 different directions, but whichever is chosen would solve the current situation."
6/30/2009,"not quite correct, actually: the coercer needs substantial fitting mods in order to fit either medium pulse lasers or medium beam lasers (the high-caliber small guns, not the cruiser-sized ones). mostly it lacks cpu to fit them, though if you use a mwd you run out of grid as well... but if you're fitting a mwd you last a maximum of 30 seconds, so why do it? the thrasher, otoh, can fit a set of 6x 280mm artillery cannons and still have enough cpu/grid for decent sniping mods (and two salvagers). its damage when you do this is slightly superior to the smaller-caliber cannons.i love for the destroyers to be able to make use of the more powerful tier of small guns--would make sense, after all, since they're supposedly so much larger than frigates! that tier of guns, by the way, is generally only usable by cruisers down-gunning (looking at you, thorax!), or t2 ships. destroyers really need both. they should be terrifying ship to frigates, and last long enough to cruisers to be able to warp out unless tackled. as it is, they don't.my suggestions are a bit more subtle... dropping the sig radius to an average of 60 would reduce damage from larger guns by 25%, dispensing with the rof penalty is a 25% dps bonus, which only offsets the lost damage of reducing guns to 6. but! moving a high slot to a low on each ship enables them to either devote that to a damage mod, or a tanking mod (cormorant could go with a dcu). it's more flexibility, frankly.i don't, honestly, think the game needs more glass cannons at the small scale. destroyers however are so underused and useless that they make the old stealth bombers looks like flavor-of-the-month ships! so, if a change did make them decent cannons, i'd not refuse it--because i love them so.... but i'd hope a t2 space-superiority version would add more survivability along with that firepower.--krum"
6/30/2009,"fully endorsed.i love destroyers of all races except the lackluster catalyst (lol, falloff bonus???). unfortunately they're easily outclassed by a t1 frigate (i get kills regularly against thrashers using a plated rifter).signature far too large.hitpoints far too low.rof nerf reduces dps to frig levels.for the coercer... need 1 more mid, at the very least. they're the highest raw dps destroyer going but can't pin anything in place with only 1 mid. thus... get almost no kills without being in a blob."
6/30/2009,"supported.i think it's more important that the slots be fixed to be honest, especially the coercer and cormorants mid and low slots respectively. the only ships in the game to be restricted to a single slot in any category are a handful of the really light t1 frigates, so it's frankly ridiculous that ships a whole class heavier than frigates have such strict limits. the coercer especially can't even fit an ab and a warp disruptor at the same time, while at the moment the cormorant has to use its sole low slot for a micro auxiliary power core if you want to fit any decent weapons on it."
6/30/2009,destroyers are awesome already.non-minmatar interdictors however...
6/30/2009,destroyer costs 4 times the price of a rifterin many intances it can loose to a rifter.it gets instapoped by anything bigger then a frigate. sure they are fine.
6/30/2009,good ideas.
6/30/2009,"yah, i got that on my mind, too. if third-forces were to have a big enough impact, then of course the fw enemy would be wanting to utilise their allies... and should be able to.aside from that, looks great. edit: forgot the thumb-button"
6/30/2009,fail
6/30/2009,"what you don't get is that ccp has continuously enhanced the problem of blobbing. now for most ship classes, this is bad, but not impossible to work against. for motherships especially, it is.inside of a cyno jammed system, motherships do fine in their intended use. outside of that, they cannot hold up well at all. unlike titans, mom's don't have a dd saving grace. they are an on field tool if you want their full effect. the problem with that is, 10 dreads focused fire can pop a mom quite fast. 20 dreads can break it fast even if it's receiving significant remote reps. 30 or more dreads and you're talking 30 second death.yes, it's a problem with blobing.but more to the point, for a mom, it's also a show of it's flaws. titans to a lesser extent unless they forgo the proposed changes in which case they'll be just as suceptable. moms cannot hold up at all on the front lines outside of very isolated situations. they are far from useful in any capital engagements, and they're just a joke when used outside of a jammed system.now i differ from most. i hate remote repair, especially on carriers with their huge range boost. i think spider tanking is a shameful cry for why people choose to blob in cap warfare. i would rather mom's get a significant bonus to personal tanking to make up for their lacking atm."
6/30/2009,"yes guys, battle bestowers to the front lines, moms to the back.i always spend 15-40 bil on a ship so that it can pos park. get a fricking clue dude, all ships have a huge issue with hp and blobbing, moms just get the ass end of it. so you can either petition here for ccp to revamp their entire failure of a combat and 0.0 system immediately, or you can ask for a mom/titan revamp... i think the latter is more reasonable baby step."

6/30/2009,"agreed.i'd like to have audit log giant secures as well.also, the ability to repackage station hangars without that stupid '3 week old' log crap getting in the way after i've emptied them. just give me a warning: repackaging the station [whatever] will displace all items into the [corporate hangar with the least access rights] or your personal hangar.also: ""this container contains items that have been locked down. please unlock these items to repackage the station [whatever]"". if a person can unlock the items, they can steal them anyway once they access the container."

6/30/2009,"it is possible to make more isk in the safety of empire by grinding l4's than ratting and ""helping concord"" in 0.0. i always tought eve was a game of ""risk and reward"". the more risk u take the more u get out of it. why isnt this applied on the npc's in 0.0? it is time to increase the bounties in certain area's."
6/30/2009,yes.
6/30/2009,yes
6/30/2009,"no.empire 'rats' in missions already have their bounties 'nerfed' considerably, by upwards of 50%. on the up side you can, in relative safety, loot and salvage all of your wrecks while that is not always possible or feasible in nullsec. so, if you loot & salvage your nullsec wrecks you still make more on ratting alone than an empire carebear.and no, i don't rely on missions for income... i might run 1 or 2 a month for some faction ammo."
6/30/2009,"-1.0 true sec space is fine, -0.01 not. in general ccp should make all high true sec 0.0 better."
6/30/2009,"some regions have entire consellations that are between -0.01 and -0.15 sec. belt ratting makes about 12 mil per hour of bounties. some would say well go mining then, but thats also impossible. the other solution is plexing. there aint enough around since wormholes were invented. so basicly its wasted space that nobody can use or its used out of boredom, and a waste of time from a economic point of view"
6/30/2009,"0.0 ratting need improvement. less stupid grinding more fun. also too many wrecks to salvage/loot for solo. npc's should be more intelligent these days too, we're living 2009. furthermore chaining is stupid profit should stay same but rats should spawn more intelligently. and yeah also make ratting in ""low"" 0.0 more profitable.i support general idea of making ratting more interesting."
6/30/2009,"right problem, wrong solution.isk inflation in the game is already a huge problem - while i agree that l4 highsec missions paying more than 0.0 ratting doesn't make sense on the risk-reward scale, this is not the answer.nerf missions - don't boost ratting."
6/30/2009,"well since there are bs rats in low sec i see no other option than boosting ratting. im not sure but i think the lower 0.0 sec sytems (-0.01/-0.15) are as good as the good low sec (0.1 sec ) systems. maybe both options will be a good idea. boosting 0.0 bounties and nerfing l4's bounties. lets get the ""risk vs reward"" more inline with each other"
6/30/2009,"who sayd inflation is a problem? i have never seen ccp saying that. we suggest features, and point out imbalance, ccp makes them real and solves problems where it can and deems nessesary. i stopped ratting in null-sec because i make more money on lvl 4 missions, don't have to do 20 jumps to get to the place and back at the end of the day, and it absolutely safe, in addition i get standing and loyality points that i can spend on alot of interesting stuff.ratting needs a boots.when you kill pirats, you recieve loyality points towards concord. give them something interesting in lp stores, something exclusive. (look at concord bs for example) make pirats drop more loot, like guns, that will be supply of meta lvl items for null-sec.increase bounties.i always salvage them, i use murm with mwd, 4 close-range guns, dual repp tank.my drones do more then half of dps.i have a tractor beam and a salvager.i salvage bs and bc wrecks. i still make less then in missions, not even taking lp into account. so yes, in needs a boost. on the other hand you need a well-fitted bs to do lvl 4's well.you can do ratting in a speed tanked crouser. (bc is perfect) so i suggest making the rats in null-sec tougher, increasing amount of high-bounty balleships, make them smarter- not sure if we whant them to be as smart as sleepers, but they should be smarter for sure. my personal opinion is that every ai should be as smart as sleepers, they just should shoot drones less. (with t2 drones it's expencive)"
6/30/2009,i would welcome this. some ships could use a lil flare.. as for the logos i do not think they are needed. many ships already have their faction logo on them if you look hard enough.. i know my hyper and legion do. the idea to give a choice of color schemes whould be nice though.

6/30/2009,supported for this very reason!
6/30/2009,"how about a tickbox option to show yourself or not to show yourself (to fleet only) instead? itd be like ""broadcast signal to fleet"" or something so you'd show up as an empty purple bracket."
6/30/2009,"that'd be great, but that's only one way to do it. seriously people, i really don't see how this would break balance.it just makes no sense to me that you can't even see (not visually, not on scanner, not in the overview) cloaked ships that are on your own side (in your corp or in your fleet). there's just no way to maneuver a gang of cloaked ships properly if you can't even see them!"
6/30/2009,quoted for truth.
6/30/2009,"if fleet members can see them, they must be broadcasting something. if they are broadcasting something, it makes sense that ships not in the friendly fleet could also find them. cloaking is currently balanced. it doesn't need boosted, it doesn't need nerfed."
6/30/2009,"it's neither a nerf nor a buff, it's common sense.you could say that cloaking fields all have a coded frequency, and that your fleet has the key to see through it. you don't have to broadcast anything."
6/30/2009,how is adding an ability that isn't currently available not a buff?perhaps we're working with different definitions of the word buff...
6/30/2009,so improving visual appearence of lasers would be a buff to energy weapon? how is making it comfortable a buff? it's like saying that if they make it so refining window does not lagg it's a buff to refining.
6/30/2009,"it's not a buff because it doesn't add any advantage. it's only practical and logical to do it.stealth bombers wouldn't be able to deal more damage or cloak longer that way. it doesn't change any of their attributes either. so this is not a buff.it's like calling an option to hide all cans in space a ""container nerf"". come on. think about it for more than one second..."
6/30/2009,i've never had an issue with this and would rather my fleet mates didn't see where i was. i've been able to effectively coordinate stealth ops with good communication.
6/30/2009,"why wouldn't you want your fleet to see where you are anyway? how would this change your gameplay?it's one thing to vote a suggestion down because it would break your own gameplay somehow, but it's another to vote it down just because you personally wouldn't benefit from it or wouldn't use it."
6/30/2009,"if cloaked fleet members not seeing each other's location is a disadvantage, the removal of that disadvantage is adding an advantage. not all buffs are pure numbers. the ability to know where cloaked fleet members are could be a significant tactical advantage for a recon, black-ops, stealth bomber group. it's a buff and it's not needed."
6/30/2009,"if you want to do something in this vein, say that the reason for the decloak is sensor emissions from the object you're near being too strong to evade, and since cloaked ships don't do the sensor emissions thing, cloaked ships don't detarget each other. it'd also mean you could finally remove the asinine gas-cloud decloaks. seeing each other on overview, though, seems kind of silly."
6/30/2009,i guess you do not get the idea of spies in your fleet compromising your position.you want to have the ability to see your cloaked mate for your fleet ops so you can coordinate a sb strike? ok stop step back and think about it. you have spies in fleet. most of the time anyway. ok always. now what stops the spies from outing the cloakers. answer me that. what prevents the cloaker to be compromised?no absolutely not.
6/30/2009,"if you always have spies in your fleet, then your corporation really has a problem. spying is part of the game, and having this feature or not wouldn't change it in any way. there's a ton of ways to counter spying (for example, force every member in your corp to give their api key so you can list any alt not in your corp). i don't think this is a valid argument, sorry.besides, if you would only see cloaked ships in your own fleet, then all you'd have to do if you want to move without being ""stooled"" by a spy is to not be in a fleet, get in range of your target, and fleet in the last second if you fleet needs to warp on you or something."

6/30/2009,"they've got a tough balance they have to hit.while i definitely agree that they need to worry about bug fixes first, if they don't continually introduce new mechanics/features, they start to see subscription numbers fall off. people (especially on eve-o) are gonna pitch fits about how things aren't working the right way no matter what, so if you give them shiney things to distract them, they're easier to deal with. that's my speculation anyhow."

6/30/2009,supported on both counts.
6/30/2009,supported..... but i also rather like treelox's idea...
6/30/2009,"agree on the reconnect to drones.absolutely disagree on the drone stealing part. there needs to be some repurcussions for leaving in the middle of a mission and/or fight. it also provides a level of opportunism for other players and drones are not that expensive. what it seems like you wanna do is afk mission without consequence and that's not acceptable.slightly disagree with damage reporting for drones. i don't believe drones were ever intended to be a primary damage source, but more of a supplementary damage source. i have nothing to back that up, and am pretty sure it's something i heard somewhere at some time that i can't remember, so don't take that as fact. the more legitimate reason is that drones fire every 2 seconds - the notices that 5 drones would flash across the screen (even grouped as salvos) would be quite a bit to process and make it difficult to read the already-too-fast turret notices. while it would be nice to see how much damage they're doing, you can test that with a corpie - annoying, but not that hard to do. if there was a way to do this more passively (i.e. just show in logs with no notice), i'd be a bit more inclined to agree./not supported. trying to do too much in one ticket."
6/30/2009,reconnect to drones is exelent feature.
6/30/2009,"seeing that the bug where the drones sometime aren't damaging the structures because they orbit too near and (probably) inside the structure and we have no way to know if the same is happening when we are fighting other ships, knowing what damage the drones are doing is mandatory. plus: rate of fire has been halved, making it 1 attack every 4 seconds, several months ago. at the same time damage has been doubled. sadly drone damage is mostly theorycraft as it can be calculated but not verified in real combat situations. seeing how they have a lot of bugs and they are a primary weapon for several ships hoping that they are working right is not the way to go."
6/30/2009,i like the idea of reporting drone information. my argument is that eve tends to be information overload quite a bit and this wouldn't help the problem. a configuration option in the journal or something would help.missed this - thanks for bringing it to my attention.

6/30/2009,"good idea, somehow ccp could modify the current coding to record a logistics repairing a friend in combat and on a kill mail, the same as if you assigned your drones to assist a friend in combat, and got on the kill mail. granted, assisting with drones does damage to the enemy, applying the same code used on the drones to the repairing module may be the easiest shortcut."

6/30/2009,"my proposal is this.give the roqual an additional role, the ability to fit and use a capital moon harvester module when in industrial mode.restrict its use to a region around the warp in point of a moon, big enough away that it can be outside of the range of a death star but still be on grid for easy detection.the roqual would have the ability to do standard moon mining, and in the presence of a hostile pos it would cut off all material being gathered by a tower harvester, as it will be harvesting that material for itself. the objective of this proposal is as follows:allow smaller entities a slice of the moon harvesting pie which has been currently snapped up by larger entities and secured with death star poss.provide a more active mechanic for gathering moon material and requiring an alliance to actively patrol the moon pos empire to ensure nobody is stealing from them.make low sec and npc space more difficult for an alliance to guarantee a passive high profit income. ie far easier for a smaller group to secure access to a moon for a short period of time, multiple times dependant on their time zones.add a new tool to 0.0 warfare, and bring attrition back into play.get more caps out into the field and in harms way.ideas to toy with:make the industrial reconfiguration time could increase when the harvester is online. ie from 10 mins to 30 mins or more, meaning that the roqual reduces the fuel it consumes but more importantly increases its risk substantially. give a roqual based harvester a higher efficiency than a pos module meaning that an alliance may choose to deploy a roqual outside their towers to increase yields with the risk that roaming ops may catch a roqual outside shields. (or better yet multiple roquals on the same moon to increase the yield) allow an industrial configured roqual to be spider repped, meaning you might have a carrier escort (i dear say most roqual only go in to industrial mode inside pos shields currently so i dont know if they can already be remote repped in industrial mode.)with the requested changes to make moons deplete and generate new veins of ore, using a fleet of roquals to force a quicker depletion of a hostiles moon resource will make an interesting situation."

6/30/2009,"mining revampthe overall concept here is to remove the very passive game play nature of mining for a more hands on approach. i realize this will ruffle more than a few feathers. the general approach here is to reduce the quantity of rocks and belts in a star system for a more realistic and more thoughtful approach to mining and resource farming. rather than have 500 rocks in a system of various types, instead you might have 10-20 asteriods or comets in a close proximity to mine, each containing various levels of all resources.how do we do this? ive never understood the need to have 50 veldspar roids in a belt and 10 belts in a system. not only do asteroid belts not fit in realistically with how a solar system works, functionally they are terrible and boring and overly passive approach to gaming. especially when we look at high sec, we see that mining is very much a set it and forget it part of this game. most of the work in mining comes from gamers hauling ores rather than actually mining them, and lets be honest, hauling isnt the epitome of fun in game.so the idea is to condense mining into much larger, more complex rocks. added to this is a real drilling technique where mining almost becomes a puzzle of maximum utility. rocks of different types would have different density and pockets of any or all types of ores. your own approach to mining that rock determines the actual value and resources you derive from it. 2 different approaches to how to mine the rock can easily result in totally different outcomes. whats even more fascinating about this style of mining is that it could be a great reason to create temporary wars of resources much like and unlike moon mining today. imagine finding a rock or concentration of rocks of unimaginable wealth hidden away in one small corner of space. they wont last forever, so the first and fastest to this area will be the largest benefactors. in this new format, there would be 2 basic kinds of rocks similar to real asteroid belts. 1 type of rock would be the standard, dense, solid rock we see today. but its design would be that of quadrants and layers. i leave it up to the game designers to form the actual system, but essentially, you choose to mining a spot of the rock. as you deplete that spot, you go deeper into the rock uncovering more and varied types of ores. obviously with mining, theres waste, so as you choose the path to mining the rock, it affects what is wasted. the 2nd type of rock would be a cluster of smaller rocks. in this scenario, theres less waste and in a lot of ways less skill required to mine through the asteroid as its already broken into small chunks held together by gravity only. theres also the higher likelihood of more mixed minerals within the conglomerate of rocks. the trick with these rocks is not so much about waste as it is about time. how do you remove the junk rocks fast to get to the higher value. in either type of rock, there has to be waste. waste would essentially be junk dirt, ice, or whatever that cannot be effectively refined or salvaged and would therefore be discarded. pockets of waste would play into just how fast areas could be mined.this same idea could be translated into comets and/or ice harvesting."
6/30/2009,"miningso we know how the rocks are setup and the basic premise to mining, but what does this actually mean for the guy training to be a miner. well skills are very important part of mining. right now, all skills really do is increase quantity mined and reprocessed. they really do nothing to enhance your actual talent at mining much like accuracy, falloff, orbital velocity and ship speeds affect missiles and turrets. so the new concept is to have skills help with scanning and breaking down the new rocks. astrogeology for instance my help you more accurately scan densities in a rock to get a better determination for what is in it. mining might help you break down the rock into smaller portions so as to help you speed up mining and path creation. advanced mining skills might help to improve time or gain from x, y, or z type of ore in the rock.. t2 miners might help you focus on areas of the rock better so as to not disturb surrounding ore and waste as much. strip miners might very high speed, but with wrecking consequences to the surrounding ores in a rock. etc. ultimately, what youd see is short and long durations of mining. sometimes it might be 10 seconds; sometimes it might be 5 minutes. it would be up to both the player and the rock to determine the exact nature of the mine.this idea would also help transcend this game into system wide asteroid belts, and more defined industry talent. it would also add to mining a level of experience over skillpoints. it wouldnt be about maxing characters skills to net the greatest amount of harvest, instead it would be as much about his understanding of his trade. very generic simplified rock scan.overall tldr:remove the redundancy and repetitive nature of mining. no more waiting 1 or 3 minutes til a beam finishes only to repeat. no more fields of tons of the same rock, but rather fewer rocks and more technique on how to harvest the goodies. by the very nature of this, rather than have ore types be the determinant between empire and 0.0, i'd rather see asteriod size be a more relevant factor. smaller size, lower quantity due to high mining fatigue in empire, more size, more complexity, more reward in 0.0."
6/30/2009,"well, you were right about one thing, this is going to ruffle some feathers.i agree that mining needs a change, but i am not sure this is that change. i am withholding an opinion until i see some more discussion at the moment.one point to consider though. you cannot make mining too skill intensive or too hard to learn to do effectively, or you'll lose a lot of new players that want to try it early on. as it stands right now, if i can fly a frigate and have mining 1, i can mine. which means that with most characters, i can mine right after the starter tutorials. whatever changes happen to mining need to leave that intact so that brand new characters have a chance to make a start for themselves without shooting at things, if that's what they want."
6/30/2009,"anyone can mine with lvl 1 skills in this system too. the only real difference is how the rock is mined for a new guy. he might take a little longer to get through a pocket, he might waste more. but at the same time, he can learn how to increase his load even with lvl 1 skills by planning out how to mine a rock, how to map concentrations in the rock.i mean, what's the real difference b/t a thorax mining currently, and one mining in this new system when it comes to take. ultimately, you're going to mine, it's more about efficiency and competition.imagine 5-10 guys mining the same rock rather than the same belt. it would be more strategy based how to mine said rock b/c their actions would ultimately dictate yours.i mean, how is that idea not more fun and interesting than sitting in a field and waiting 9 minutes for a hulk to fill up."
6/30/2009,"an interesting proposal, but it might be a little bit too much of a minigame. remember what the targeting system in eve looks like - it's slow, clunky, generic, and has a craptastic ui attached. you're trying to turn it into something out of red faction, which sounds really cool, but i'm not sure the game can handle it well. if the game can do it(and do it in such a way that it doesn't freak out the newbies) i'm all for it, but i don't think it can."

6/30/2009,"i currently do fly a hurricane for level 3 missions, and so far i haven't met a mission i can't tank. i literally fly into the middle of the mission space, and start destroying enemy ships one after another while they try and get close enough to shoot back. i get close to 260 dps from it (which is probably be a little low, but i tend to overtank), and i agree, it's really quite an effective ship the way it is."
6/30/2009,no. hurricanes are pretty badass as is.
6/30/2009,"outdamaged by the brutix and harbinger.outtanked by the drake.the small speed increase and ""versatility"" from split weapons do not make a good ship.adding a 7th turret would bring it in line with the other tier 2 bc and the brutix"
6/30/2009,it is outdamaged by britux because that's highest dps bc in game.drake is the tankiest bc in game.hurricane has reasonable tank and reasonable dps. drake has good tank but it has **** dps.britux has good dps but **** tank.hurricane is in the middle. and it speedtanks bs's better then any other bs
6/30/2009,"dude... if you're looking for damage and have tackling support, go for 6 turrets, 2 launchers, a shield buffer and 3 gyros. the hurricane is like the dominix, it's extremely versatile, it can be anything you want... just fit it decently"

6/30/2009,"what are your dps-drake and tank-brutix fits? so far as i can tell, the drake is a brick that occasionally annoys you with missiles, and the brutix is a glass cannon, and i've never seen a fit for either that does much to fix their holes without throwing away all the advantages of using that hull in the first place."
6/30/2009,dps drake does shy 700dps.
6/30/2009,"i know that part of being a good pilot is to be able to recognize the class of a ship just by its type name, but practically, i don't think anyone here knows every single ship type by heart.there are 30 ship classes in the game (if i counted correctly), some which are further divided into roles. however, all we have to differentiate them in the overview is the overview icon and the type column. the icon consists of a white bracket of different sizes for player ships, and red/gray crosses of different sizes for npc ships, and only give a hint on the size of the ship, not its class or role.you can also enable the ""type"" column, but since it's showing the whole string, it takes more space and most people choose not to show it at all because of that. you can also see the type of a ship by hovering your mouse on its target box itself, but you have to do it one by one and then remember which one was which.for new pilots, this can be a nightmare. this system was fine when the game started in 2003 since there was much less classes of ships (frigate, cruiser, battleship, industrial and shuttle. that was pretty much it).what i'm proposing is a new overview column that would display an abbreviation of the class/role of the ship in uppercase.for example:+---+----------+-------+-----------+----------------------------+|ic | distance | class | type | name |+---+----------+-------+-----------+----------------------------+|[ ]| 50 km | bc | hurricane | player 1 |+---+----------+-------+-----------+----------------------------+|[ ]| 51 km | bs | typhoon | player 2 |+---+----------+-------+-----------+----------------------------+|[] | 100 km | sb | hound | player 3 |+---+----------+-------+-----------+----------------------------+|[] | 121 km | frg | rifter | player 4 |+---+----------+-------+-----------+----------------------------+|[ ]| 134 km | int | claw | player 5 |+---+----------+-------+-----------+----------------------------+(note: i added the type column just so you can see which type each class matches with in my example.)hovering your mouse on one of the type would show a tooltip with the full class name. in addition, that same abbreviation could be overlaid on top of the target ico, or even completely replace the picture of the target.i'm sure some of you will argue that this would break game balance in some way, but i have yet to see how."
6/30/2009,i like candy.
6/30/2009,"ahh, you already have that with the icon. one glance and you know the hull class you're facing: frig/dessy, cruiser/bc, bs/capital, industrial.granted, they can modify the icons *slightly* to make destroyers distinct from frigs, ect... but please, not another damnable column. the overview already takes up 30% of the screenspace or more."
6/30/2009,useless
6/30/2009,"not a bad idea, but this. that and i can't tell you how long me and the corpies have been going back and forth on the designation for battleships. the military folks still call 'em bbs rather than bss. damn blackbirds are messin it up for 'em."
6/30/2009,"the icons are not different enough, and they don't tell you the class of the ship, only the hull size, and without a base for comparison you can't tell what size it is (i.e. someone mostly playing in high sec will have a hard time differentiating a battleship from a carrier if he never saw one). especially for player ships, it looks all the same to me, and i'm sure i'm not the only one. knowing the hull size alone is pointless when there are over 40 different player ships in the game. a t1 frigate will show the same icon as a t2 frigate, but the t2 one might rip you apart in seconds while the t1 one barely scratches you.as for the ""screenspace"", well, every column in the overview is optional, so if you don't want it, just don't check it.well, if ccp makes an official legend for all classes, that would settle it wouldn't it? there would be only one official naming convention for all classes.but calling battleships bb's is wrong regardless. where's the second b coming from anyway?what is? your comment? absolutely!"
6/30/2009,"yet another feature that makes me want a moddable ui. that said, yeah, if they can do this without too much difficulty, i'm all for it. wouldn't use it myself, since i've got pretty much every class memorized, but i remember the days when i didn't and would have loved this feature."
6/30/2009,"actually, me and many others do know what shiptype all the shipnames are connected with, aswell as a general idea of the capabilities and usual fighting style for it.i still can't see any reason for this not be there though, shouldn't be hard to implement, and doesn't hurt anyone, so it still gets a thumbs up from me."
6/30/2009,ishtar as many other gallente ships needs only some more cpu.bonuses are good.
6/30/2009,the ishtar should get more damage bonus to the drones instead of turret bonus. currenty with good skills u can get 450 dps out your drones. that is not high enough for a hac if it would be its role.

6/30/2009,"at one time the various pirate factions enjoyed a substantial technological edge over the empire forces, which allowed them to maintain their factions in the lawlessness of nullsec with such strength that they could continually send frigate groups deep into empire space.unfortunately, that time has passed.the blood raiders have seen their cutting edge technical advantages supplanted by the introduction of force recons; huginn/rapier & web range, and the curse in capacitor denial range.it is time for the raiders to re-think their core technologies, as the sansha did years ago with considerable success. rather than competing with the min & amarr recon ships, it is time for them to re-think their entire approach.in what ways? there could be many options, but many are already covered by existing capsuleteer technologies.one idea:remove nos/neut ammount/range for a cloaked velocity bonus (using standard cloaks, not covert ops) of 30% per base racial ship skill level.remove web range bonus for laser bonuses: +7.5% rof to all lasers per base racial ship skill.base hull bonuses:+25% laser tracking, -50% to laser energy use20% resistance bonus to armor, bonus to armor amount.example (cruor)high: 5 (4/1)mid: 2low: 4velocity: 475sig rad: 27this is only an example of the many possible technologies that the blood raiders may approach. with the advent of t3 and the awakening of the talocan they might even embrace some of this new ... deadly power in their hull lines.but admit it, the blood raider faction ships are pretty poor with the advent of recons, except maybe for the bhaal with a fully faction/officer fit."
6/30/2009,i fail to see the reasoning for making a criminal organization that lives on the fringes of society more technologically advanced then the empire governments.
6/30/2009,or to nerf recons because they're more powerful than their faction counterparts. that doesn't make any sense. what would be interesting is if faction boats were a bit more prolific so that prices dropped.
6/30/2009,"i agree that blood ships(and also guristas) are in need of some major work, but i don't think that this proposal is how to go about it. the problem with the blood ships is that the bonuses just don't work together at all, and force you to go in three different directions at once. it needs a set of bonuses that let you build a single ship while still using all of them and not having a weird frankenstein knockoff come out the other end. how about something like this?role bonus: +150% stasis webifier rangeamarr: +10% energy vampire/neutralizer transfer amount per levelminmatar: +10% stasis webifier effect per levelew support, with kronos webs, up-sized neuts, and everything hitting a 25km range off t2 gear. or if you want to get really crazy, you could try this:role bonus: energy vampires ignore target's current capacitor levelamarr: +5% (size) energy turret damage per levelminmatar: +5% (size) energy turret rate of fire per levelit's a bit wacky, but it gives us a bit of retro coolness on ships expensive enough that people won't exploit it to death like they did before, and it manages to justify why anyone would ever put lasers and nos/neut on the same ship. give each ship 2 utility highs(i'm thinking bhaalgorn gets 6 turrets, ashimmu gets 4, and cruor gets 2), and go to town. you can also replace the amarr bonus with armor resists just as easily. in any case, keep it faithful to how the faction normally does things(which in the blood's case is defined by energy drains), but make it a cohesive whole, instead of a grab bag."
6/30/2009,oh.. so there is a price level that automatically makes customer service viable? dude.. you may only pay 15 bucks a month but some of us have 3 and 4 accounts.. and have played since 2003 and 2004. i can tell you this... responding to your customers in a reasonable amount of time is not a strategy successful companies ignore.there might be a reason that for a long time there was alway over 40k logged in and now i see less than 25k more often than not.
6/30/2009,"same here, out of like 10 petitions i had only 1 where i had to wait ""long"", don't remember how much, but it was under a week. i did not encounter any problems. responce time depends on also how you fill it in. no support."
6/30/2009,"last petition took 6 days. the ones before that were as long if not longer (i think the longest was 8) before they were even looked at. i had a toon with a petition that i submitted in late 2007 that didn't get a reply for more than 4 months (don't know if i ever did, closed the account)."
6/30/2009,"hm, same here. i don't think there's a lot that csm can do about this either. its kind of a staffing issue at ccp, rather then a game issue"
6/30/2009,do it ccp.
6/30/2009,"logical, and a good idea overall."
6/30/2009,"supported, easy and efficent fix."
6/30/2009,can you please seperate the analyze button from the rest of the buttons please. it is the most used and it is very annoying when you press recover all probes by accident.thx
6/30/2009,"it happened to me once, and i learned from my mistake. now i'm more careful.the window is wide enough as it is, so this is a no for me."
6/30/2009,i would propose to change the color of the probes bubble center (you know the cube with the arrow) or at least put a border line to make it more visible when the background has the same colors. the area where my char lives has the same colors and makes them invisible.
6/30/2009,world of warcraft players coming to eve trying to impose and force their easymode and casual mindset on everyone of us = no.
6/30/2009,no.
6/30/2009,"warning: lots of words in this post. beware of hurf.let me preface this by saying i've never lost sp to a non-upgraded clone, although i've had some close calls, so this should be interpreted as a criticism rather than whining:the clone/sp system is a terrible, bad, terribad, horrible, horribad, horriterribad, violates-the-first-thing-they-teach-you-in-game-design-courses mechanic that serves no purpose except to act as a disproportionately punishing ""gotcha"" for players that forget to click two buttons on the way out of the station.let's pretend that eve introduced a new feature where you had to go through a start-up sequence every time you undocked, and if you forgot to activate a module during that sequence, it's non-functional until you re-dock or activate it in-flight (one by one due to the capacitor cost). sure it might be more ""atmospheric"" and add more rp or world-building or whatever, but in practice it's nothing but frustration with no plausible positive effect on the gameplay experience.but, you say, other things in eve cause frustration too, like losing your hulk or bpo-carrying shuttle to a suicide ganker in empire. we don't eliminate those things, why eliminate this? the answer is that those are actions taken by other players, which means that while you might be dissatisfied with the result, there's another player somewhere who is proportionately satsified and having fun, whereas the clone mechanic benefits no one in any way shape or form. the other player doesn't know you forgot to upgrade your clone, so they get no satisfaction out of it (as opposed to knowing you lost umpty billion isk in mods and cargo from the killmail).the fact that you forgot to upgrade your clone makes your game experience frustrating while providing no tangible or intangible benefit to anyone. in addition, the penalty for a non-upgraded clone is sometimes weeks of training time. that's an entirely disproportionate mechanic for something so easily forgotten.in conclusion, this is probably one of the least defensible game design decisions up there with pos mechanics and doomsdays, and the only muppets who could conceivably support it are those who blindly reject any and every possible change without any critical thought."
6/30/2009,by this logic any mistake that causes a loss in pve is a terrible mechanic that causes nothing but frustration and it should be removed from the game. forgot to activate your tanking mods while those rats attacked you? well.. no other player got the fun or benefit from it so it's a pointless loss and a terrible game mechanic! right?!?!?wrong. it's also wrong when applied to clone renewals.
6/30/2009,"aargh, something went wrong here"
6/30/2009,"please tell me more about these ""effects"" you speak of."
6/30/2009,they have those already. they're called target disruptors. cause you can't shoot what you can't lock.
6/30/2009,"as much as i like this idea, the amount of server load it would create in even small fleet fights would be overwhelming. this works for smaller games like freelancer because fights tend to occur in way smaller numbers, whereas in eve, numbers are- well, big."
6/30/2009,i like this idea. i think servers could handle it we are not living in 90.there are plenty of mmo who support this and they dont have so much trouble. and most of the eve lag issues are bind to completly different things.
6/30/2009,"please look into a re-examination of t2 ammo nerfs, particularly on projectile ammunition types.in relation to the overpriced, overabundant faction ammo (which is overpriced due mostly to lp reward requirements make it rather expensive) t2 utterly fails.original thread: balance t2 ammoalso:considering the latest dev blog from ccp diagoras and the ensuing flame fest concerning minmatar ships, a stronger emphasis should be placed on examining minmatar battleships specifically and minmatar ships as a whole.destroyers should also be examined. currently they are too large (sig radius) lack effective hp to fulfill their role (anti-frigate. a plated frigate can out tank & out-dps them). some have very pointless bonuses (catalyst), or too few slots (coercer) to be useful in anything other than a blob. cormorant lacks the pg/cpu to fit the weapon class usable by all other destroyers (largest variant frigate weapon... i.e. 150mm rail). likewise the 25% reduction in rof renders having so many guns pointless against the hull's primary target (frigates).re-examine split-weapon systems, especially on ships where only one weapon receives a bonus. typhoon split-weapon & lack of focused defense type makes it a poor overall ship. many faction ships likewise suffer a half & half weapon system where only one weapon is given any bonus and neither weapon is the ship's focal specialization. example: 2 turret, 2 missile and receiving only a turret bonus."
6/30/2009,"[x] the ninja salvager should be aggro'd to the mission runner after the first wreck is salvaged, because the mission runner owns the wrecks, and i feel that ccp needs to change the current dynamic.i may as well join the great debate, not that my vote here will change anything... ninja salvaging is too much reward for too little risk. ninja salvaging is the closest thing eve has to an automatic ""i win"" button; therefore, it sucks. (the second closest is l4 missions, but that's another topic. )"
6/30/2009,"while an interesting idea, it seems like a lot of development effort for only a visual gain. i'm all for prettier visuals but especially since you dont have as much manual fighting/dogfighting in eve as in some of those examples, i think the overall effect wont be quite as grand.plus, i think ccp is already working on upgrading pew pew graphics."
6/30/2009,"i *do* like the idea of the station docking comptroller having a brown stain in his pants when he sees ships exchanging high energy at the discharge end of his catapult... and saying ""hell no you can't dock here!""forcing station huggers who undock to plink at someone and then redock to warp to another station is the ultimate ""it's fixed!"", especially if stargates do the same... no more jumping, shooting, and running back to the gate to jump out after the timer rolls over.if you want to chicken out, tank and dock/jump. otherwise shoot and hope you can get off the station before the blob that just jumped in warps to you."
