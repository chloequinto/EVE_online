6/1/2014,i thought use of macros was banned by the eula.. isn't this player macroing his goons via this multi boxing application??
6/1/2014,if it's automated then it's banned. if it requires physical player input that it's ok.
6/1/2014,the philosophical difference is that the player is directly controlling all of those characters. no in-game action is being automated.
6/1/2014,"this. technically, he is within the letter of the eula, since the actions being transmitted have to be initiated by a human element. there is no program making any decision of what to do when."
6/1/2014,i remember those photos. ah the good old days.
6/1/2014,"so you are saying that would be jumping at a gate all of his alts one by one. my understanding of is boxer is that you click jump on one, all the other windows receive the same command, so they all jump through as one, which is an accelerated rate compared to the ordinary as per the eula...the eula says:""you may not use your own or any third-party software, macros or other stored rapid keystrokes or other patterns of play that facilitate acquisition of items, currency, objects, character attributes, rank or status at an accelerated rate when compared with ordinary game play. you may not rewrite or modify the user interface or otherwise manipulate data in any way to acquire items, currency.""obviously he also uses the multiple boxes to accelerate the rate of his mining...how is this legal?"
6/1/2014,"because of the thing i just said and more importantly, because ccp have repeatedly publically confirmed that it is allowed. since it's their game and their interpretation of the rules is the authoritative one, it is ipso facto game-legal."
6/1/2014,just a thought. i would like to see eve manufacturers and merchants given access to eve convoy transport system. this will do a few things. 1. it will give an outlet for excess isk in the game. 2. a more secured shipping for eve merchants and manufactures.3. another target for eve pirates. 4. help players move to system when they have large amounts of property. 5. get low and null security sectors markets better equipt.6. open up low and null security sectors to traders and manufacturers. 7. did i say give pirates a lucrative target if they can take it down. 8. more insurance could be sold to players for their property to be shipped. the possibilities are limitless on what the game designers could come up with. this was just a quick list.

6/1/2014,"so at the moment, with the introduction of yet more clothing options to the new eden store (previously nex store), numerous threads on avatars (and things you could do with them, and an almost two year old thread (that was recently closed) on the exploration prototype, i would like to request that the csm ask ccp for a state of play on the feature.the main questions that come to mind are. will it be anything more than a display cabinet for clothing purchases? is project legion meant to satisfy players wanting meaningful avatar gameplay? what does ccp see as the future of this feature (hopefully more than a micro transaction display cabinet). i'm sure other players have their own questions.there is certainly interest in the expansion of this feature. it would be appreciated if the csm could at least ask the question of ccp. i have no expectation as to when they deliver the feature. but it does seem that the new development cadence should allow at least for something (other than clothes)."

6/2/2014,"as said in the title, multiboxing only really works for mining and possible missions if you know what you are doing, however it presents a huge problem when one player can eat an entire belt singlehandedly in high-sec with minimal risk, often in or near newbie systems, depriving new players of a reliable source of income in the first few minutes of the game.if all multiboxers were forced to stay in a player corp then it would assist in letting older players help in stopping people with money ruining the ""mining experience"" for new players."
6/2/2014,"this is actually a pretty good idea, and only helps with temporary dps while still having a trade off. i support it, though i kinda would like to see the role bonus also incresed to 7.5% per level, to let it have the dps/tank bonus for a little longer."
6/2/2014,"to clarify, ccp took the interpretation of ""at an accelerated rate"" to be a by account basis, so an automation that allowed you to automatically stop your strip miners when a roid was dead and swap to a new one, would be an accelerated rate, since no human could achieve that accuracy/efficiency, however having all your accounts target the same roid and begin mining doesnt get you the ore any faster per account, so each account is still earning money at the same rate as if it was being controlled alone."
6/2/2014,"ah ok, thanks for this clarification then.. this is the piece i was missing to understand the interpretation for is boxer..."
6/2/2014,"actually i believe their most recent stance was 'we aren't saying it's 100% ok, but it's not something we ban over'.which while it's basically the same thing as 'it's legal' leaves them wriggle room to come back on it later and say they've reviewed ban policy and this is now included so cease & desist."
6/2/2014,"whatever hairsplitting makes you happy v0vthe op asked if it was ""legal"", not for a discussion about whether it is ""right"" or ""good game balance"" or ""will be legal 5 years from now"" or anything else. it's not forbidden; ccp have repeatedly refused opportunities to forbid it, ergo as far as they are concerned it is currently legal."

6/5/2014,"2) add new, more interactive type of missions to the game, with following features:a) should be offered after completion of a few typical missions based on new mechanics described in 1) (they could become some sort of ""fleet storyline missions"" with, perhaps, equivalent frequency of appearing; moreover, it, or its derivatives could be used in final pockets of high level combat sites or wh complexes)b) can't be possibly completed singlehandedly (""in one window"")c) highly resistable to multiboxing, botting and legitimate scripts' using due to higher level of interactivity they offer and due to the necessity to perform large number of different operations in different ""windows"" simultaneously; so it requires cooperation of several human playersd) offer significant level of challenge accompained by substantional increase in rewards per participant.e) profits from such missions must scale only proportionally to number of gang's/fleet's members which are in the same corp as that who took the mission from agent, but difficulty should scale proportionally to the whole number of group members, so it's much more profitable to form group with corpmates only to run this kind of missions.appendix: why we need something like that while there are already incursions in the game.1) incursions are still a high end pve content; moreover, to participate in it currently you don't have to be a member of any corp at all. while proposed new mission type designed specifically with corporation activity in mind (it will offer additional income only to groups consisting of members of the same corp), what should serve as incentive to create long-living social groups even in highsecs (incursions don't do the trick, you could sometimes take a part in it without saying more than a couple of words)2) profits from those new missions still somehow lesser. but they always readily available from your agent and more familiar to those accustomed to old-fashioned mission-runing.3) offer new, unique, challenging content due to introduction of new interactive ""fleet storyline missions""4) many people just run missions, lets just take it for given. they provide the game's economy with influx of fresh isks and full the market with lp store gear. they often are forced to run them solo due to substantional drop in profits in terms of isk/hour and additional risks coming with running them in group/while being a member of player owned corp. this impoverishs their game experience and could be one of the reason why many new players drop the game on first months of playing.5) some variety and ability to choose have never hurt anybody. in case of forms of group pve activities in highsecs there is no such thing currently: it's either incursions or soloing."
6/5/2014,"further i'll outline several schematic and quite crude examples of such ""new interactive fleet storyline missions"", simply to convey approach to their design i want to propose. as before, suggestons on other similar mission types, as well as argumented criticism, are welcomed.1) ""hostile takeover""on warping into mission grid the first phase begins, in which a bunch of slowly moving assault barges must be protected at any cost. the main source of danger to them are ""cloacked"" turrets/bombing vessels (they are just spawn randomly around barges), which have enough ehp to hold even focused fire of a group and able quickly wreck a havoc with barges; so the best approach would be first jam them or supress their locking range, and only after destroy them. but there is one peculiarity with those turrets/vessels - they won't appear in overview at all. some hint to their whereabouts displayed in form of arrow pointing to the closest border of the game's screen, and player must rotate camera to find a very noticeable marker in space designating it, then lock onto it using this marker. some voice notification about new threat appearing would be useful too.at the same time endless waves of tackling vessels warp into close range to barges and try to slow down their advance, ewar vessels try to deny you ability to protect barges, and damagers meantime try do destroy them .if assault party made it in one piece, they switch off station's protection field and second phase begin. you have to split your team in 2(3, 4 and more, this could scale up depending of real number of participants) and each team must follow to their designated destination and try to stop a swarm of little unarmed fast moving vessels, intending to crash onto station to demolish it. the distances between said spots chosen so wisely, that they all can't be covered by fleet of sniper bs at once from certain position no matter what, so splitting up a team is a must. moreover, it's very hard to hit those vessels from a distance and best approach would be to webify them and deal with them in close. if you won't stop at less several vessels at each spot, you will fail the mission for certain. even if you'll cover all spots, you still have to stop most of incoming threats to complete it. each one you won't be able to stop will reduce mission rewards.2) ""artillery bombardment with a spotter""to complete it you'll need one to many bs/bc fitted for long range sniping, and coverig group. covering group protects arty group from endless waves of ewar vessels and damage dealers, and keeps some undestructable ewar structures constantly jammed/damped to prevent all this threats from interfering with bss/bss mission. said ewar structures keep switching off and on alternately and can be locked on to only while powered up. they also won't appear in overview exaclty how it was described for similar threats in previous model.arty group granted with instalock ability (like, they are assisted by designated spotter), and some region of space wide enough assigned to them. this location can't be reached by any other means (separated by clouds of overheated plasma and/or mine fields and/or threat of certain death resulting from enemy's opportunity fire (scripted events etc)) and it's swarmed with different objects, including moving ones. any of this object at any time can be designeted as a target by a spotter (randomly chosen by a game engine).targets are assigned to each bs/bc individually (aside from times when coordinated fire mission on sequence of targets is requested and all group must hit them with least possible delays between shots, simultaneously) by combination of huge rectangular frame, encircling some group of objects large enough, and a text message, concretizing the actual target ""by landmarks"". text should be as much various as possible (so, the same object could be specified as ""fast moving dull coloured vessel"", or ""frigate moving to 3 hours from the abandoned laboratory"", or ""unknown vessel between asteroid and drednought's remains""). moreover, those targets can appear simultaneously and be of different types (designated by said frame's colour), differing by their priority. some will require immideate attention, other will wait, and some of them will be able to introduce a change into the waves of attackers on spot if left unattended. those targets won't appear in overview as well. most of them require a single accurate shot.missed (or incorrectly guessed) targets will reduce mission rewards and can lead to its failure."
6/5/2014,"3) ""assault of automatic line of defence""you'll need at leat 2 bs/bc fitted as snipers.it's a dead space pocket and so mwds aren't available. on warping in you find yourself in the middle of a passage going through higly hazardous cloud (plasma, energy radiation, mine fields etc), intersected with rows of defense drones at each 120-150km. you see first row at around 120km ahead, and its control node much further away (can't be even locked on from here, or even if it can be, you won't be able to break its tank from that distance; additionally, it's protected from rush tactics by overpowered light missiles' launcher arrays). protection field generators are scattered along the passage at about 20-30km from each other (some defensive turrets were dislocated there before, but now they are powered off), and you have access to them already.the moment you reach the closest of those fields, first row of defense becomes active. all control systems have been already breached and shuted down, so it reverted to primitive emergency logics. it chooses its targets simply: a) initial one will be chosen randomly and fired upon untill it destructed (drones will prefer targets unprotected by fields, though) b) if fired upon, defense will return fire to last attacker untill his destruction. those fields effectively stop drones' fire, but accumulate damage over time and will switch off eventually. you still can engage them from under the field without damaging it (much like ship's shield works)the focused alfa and dps of those lines are so enormous, that it will obliterate even most hardened hulls/fits that can be granted access to the mission by a couple of hits.drones those lines are composed of won't appear in overwiew, either. moreover, different drones could represent targets of different priorities (some will unlish devastating rain of fire if not handled quick, others will be grouped together and will trigger massive drone spawn if not taken out all at once by coordinated fire, and some may even shift their fire to moving party after some time), to make sniping part of gameplay more exciting.you have 2 main tasks: a) engage drones with your covering sniper group, striving to reduce their numbers to lessen dps been poured into protection field (new will indefinetly warp in to substitute for destroyed ones, but there is a delay to their appearance) b) send part of you group (which must contain at least one sniper bs/bc too) ahead to the next field while other part are drawing to itself and trying to reduce incoming fire, while staying under the field (has to be mentioned, that moving party can't help covering one with their task - the moment they engage the line of defense it will switch to its new attacker and definetly will blow him up to shreds). upon reaching next field, moving party becomes covering one and waits until group reunites again; then the sequence will repeat itself. if field is breached before it happens, covering party will perish for certain.all the time both parties are staying under attack of inceasing swarms of ewar equiped small/medium vessels, warping in close range to them, which try to jam/dampen/slow them down and need help of those who can deal with such threats.after you advanced close enough to the line, you finally will be able to target and/or destroy its control node, switching all the systems at once. but several of such lines can still wait ahead, each harder than previous one."

6/8/2014,"most agree that the current sovereignty system is awful. sovereignty has the potential to be a huge conflict driver, but in its current state it is more of an inhibiter. my own idea is influenced by others that i have read about and is driven by what i feel sovereignty means.tl;dr in the simplest terms, sovereignty is about control: control of what happens within the borders of the sovereign territory. if you can control a system militarily, guard it against hostiles, exploit its resources, and live in it, you will gain sovereignty over it. if you abandon it, or fail to protect it from harrassment, that sovereignty will be compromised.overviewall claimable systems in new eden are in one of two states: claimed or unclaimed. when a system is in the unclaimed state, alliances competing for sovereignty over it build up sovereignty points (sp) which are gained via a variety of activities. once one of these alliances gains a specified amount of sp, they will achieve level 1 sovereignty over the system, the name of their alliance will be displayed as the owner of the space, and the state of the system will become claimed. when a system is in the claimed state, only the sovereign alliance has sp for that system. the sovereign<U+FFFD>s sp decreases at a steady hourly rate depending on which level of sovereignty they have, beginning 24 hours after levelling up. there are five levels of sovereignty, each requiring an increasing amount of sp to reach in a similar, though less extreme, version of the five skill levels. if the sp ever reaches the maximum amount, the passive decrease ceases. incursions and sp related activities performed by rivals count against the sovereign<U+FFFD>s sp. if the sovereign<U+FFFD>s sp ever decreases below the minimum specified amount required to gain sovereignty over an unclaimed system, it will be flagged as disputed. the alliance still has sovereignty over the system, and their name is still listed as the owner, but the disputed status is listed with it. there is no passive sp loss at this level of sovereignty, but all other sp losses and gains count double their normal values. if the sovereign<U+FFFD>s sp ever reaches zero, the system will revert to the unclaimed state.sovereignty pointssp are earned by residing in, using, and controlling a system. most activities have an sp value related to them. sp

of these values are just preliminary. it<U+FFFD>s important that most if not all activities yield sp, and that they are carefully balanced to ensure the total sp an alliance has truly reflects their control of the system, or lack thereof. control primarily means military control which is why pvp combat is weighted quite heavily.sovereignty levelsan alliance needs to be the first to earn 500,000 sp in a system when it is in the unclaimed state in order to gain level 1 sovereignty over it. the total number of sp needed to gain higher levels, and the passive sp loss at each level is as follows. as mentioned, the passive sp loss begins 24 hours after the last level up.level -> minimum sp required -> passive sp loss per hour[/b]disputed -> 1 -> 01 -> 500,000 -> 4,5022 -> 1,224,745 -> 11,0263

that alliance to gain more sp. the benefit of having more sp is that it becomes more difficult and more time consuming for an enemy to conquer the system. it also allows longer periods of low or total inactivity in the system. the passive sp loss per hour values have been chosen such that an alliance which abandons its system entirely will lose a level of sovereignty per week (unless other hostile entities move in, in which case they will lose it faster). maintaining maximum sovereignty will require every hostile element to be eliminated immediately."
6/8/2014,"public standings and hostile activityanother important element of this system is in defining hostile sp-related activity in a claimed system. in order to do this effectively, a new type of standings is required in addition to the current one <U+FFFD> public standings. these are identical to the current standings, except they are made public for all to see. public standings can be different to actual standings. all pvp kills count for or against the sovereign entity regardless of public standings. other sp-related activities performed by non-alliance members within a sovereign<U+FFFD>s territory only decreases its sp if the entity is classed as hostile. an entity is classed as hostile if either the sovereign<U+FFFD>s public standings towards that entity are negative, or the entity<U+FFFD>s public standings towards the sovereign are negative. all other activities performed by entities with which the alliance holder has mutually positive or neutral public standings do not have any effect on sp whatsoever (but if they are trading with sovereign entities, the taxes and fees paid by the sovereign will have a positive effect).improving spacei am personally not a fan of <U+FFFD>improving<U+FFFD> space. i think that space should be what it is and that the only benefits of sovereignty should be those listed above and bragging rights. isn<U+FFFD>t building an empire and having your alliance<U+FFFD>s name written all over it reward enough? i also think that the limitations placed on the building and deployment of certain structures, e.g. capital ship assembly arrays, are arbitrary, unnecessary and remove potential conflict drivers. anyone should be able to build anything in claimable space, whether it is claimed by their alliance or not. if an alliance doesn<U+FFFD>t want a player to build capital ships in their space, then they need to enforce that.if, as i suspect they do, most players disagree with me on the upgrading of space, it can be easily incorporated into the new system. sp earned in the pve combat category count towards the security index (renamed from military index), sp earned in the industry category count towards the industry index of the system. the other categories could count towards their own indices (with pvp combat counting towards the military index) which could have different affects, but i haven<U+FFFD>t fully considered what they could be. i like the idea, however, of a high security index improving the quality of mining, while a high industry index improves the quality and quantity of rats that spawn as mentioned here"
6/8/2014,"one of the biggest reasons why people control as much space as they do is because to acquire any reasonable amount of resources, you have to. even the best ratting systems only support a few ratters at a time. alliance level income sources such as moons are spread far and wide and are actually worth relatively little isk when you look at their value in any reasonable way. this provides an incentive to spread out and gobble up as much space as possible, everything else - sov mechanics, power projection, etc - merely provide the means.in other words, your idea seems very focused on the fact that big empires do exist, and shrinking their holdings down, with no regard for how or why that's the case in the first place. in fact, you seem to go completely the opposite. holding space should be about establishing your domain, and turning that domain into a place you want to live in and use and defend - you seem to be under the absurd notion that it ought to be all about name on the map, who cares if it's worth living there you can make money elsewhere.there's nothing wrong with the high level ""how and how much you use your space determines your control over it"" concept, necessarily. your specific implementation just misses the mark on several problems."
6/8/2014,"it seems you are talking about the value of space which is not something i am trying to address. population density is something which can be adjusted by fiddling with the numbers i have given in my proposal. if space is not valuable enough for a given system to support a certain number of players then that is an issue that needs to be dealt with separately. sovereignty is more about war and politics. it should be stand off-ish enough to allow for varying and inventive tactics and strategies. there is no agenda here to favour one alliance size over another or to shrink down big empires, though that may be a necessary consequence - i honestly don't know. the current sovereignty mechanics do favour a particular size of alliance - very big ones - because they require great numbers, not only to grind down the huge numbers of hit points on sov structures, but to counter the massive fleet that will be waiting to meet you at the arranged time. this restriction on game play styles is what needs to be addressed.perhaps you have misunderstood what i have written, or maybe you are seeing something in my op that i myself am missing, because i completely agree that holding space should be about laying roots and building a home; an empire that is worth defending, something to be proud of. when i wrote about name on the map what i was really getting at was that sovereignty should be a consequence of your actions and of the reality on the gro- out in space, not a means in and of itself. in fact, it is the current system that makes it more about just your name being on the map, since all you have to do is plonk down a structure, and then leave - as you say, you can make money elsewhere. under my proposal if you leave it you risk losing it.that may be the case but other than the value of space, what am i missing?"
6/8/2014,"well, as this topic fails to attract interest of english-speaking community (for what i probably have to blame, inter alia, my crude language skills, and i'm very sorry for that ), i'll at least will do my best to translate snippets of ongoing discussion on russian speaking boards for those who will [may be] read it later.what this proposal actually pursuits is a creation of generic pve framework, which will be able to dynamically (""on the fly"") create mission the moment you receive it from an agent or warp to the complex's gate, based on some initial parameters, like ""power index"" and composition of your fleet, proportion between your overall numbers and numbers of those belonging to the same corp as that who received it from the agent, mobs' npc faction, type of space mission complex are in, name of mission (so ""worlds collide"" will have some distinguishing features, while within their bounds it will be randomized each time you will receive it) - like it is done in many roguelike games out there, where world/dungeon is created anew each time you start new game session. comparing to implementing and supporting a huge amount of static pve content (like it's being done currently, and like it's being done in wow and other similar them-park mmos), this is (as it appears to me) a significantly less tedious approach, and still it will offer very diverse, fun and challenging pve content to game's playerbase.some missions could be more static than others, to make them offer somewhat more unique experience - like ""fleet story missions"" proposed above. but even those can benefit from randomization to some extent.the question remains is that possible for dev team to create such framework in the first place, of course."
6/8/2014,"while i agree that the transport industry in eve needs some help, most certainly for less than redfrog sized jobs, this activity should be done by players.some of the reasons it is not, margins are already very narrow for many goods, anyone can get into an industrial for relatively little cost, collateral risk is high for the players who would be most attracted to relatively low effort, low sp and consequently low reward game play."

6/9/2014,so...how do you actually take sov if the holder doesn't undock?
6/9/2014,"they are essentially handing control over to you, so sovereignty will flip eventually. rather than fly over to their system for a fight that you won't get, a good way to take sov would be to organise an invasion and occupation force. the invasion force will keep them besieged, preventing them from maintaining their sovereignty level and keeping up with their passive sp loss. it can also destroy any ships that try to pass through, and destroy infrastructure if it has the ships, numbers and inclination. the occupation force will be industrial and pve players who will set up pos'es, build, mine, rat, run anomalies, etc. in the scenario where a small alliance wants to take sov from another small alliance in a different time zone who also docks up and doesn't want to fight, the above is still relevant, but further strategies will need to be employed to speed up the take over. off the top of my head:- have spies infiltrate their alliance, observe their behaviour and habits so that their normal operations can be disrupted, point out key infrastructure to be destroyed, capitalise on weakness, generally wreak havoc- recruit a small corp into your alliance from the relevant time zone to disrupt their play- hire mercenaries to do the abovethe best way to defend your space is to defend it militarily. there may come a point where an alliance realises that they are losing, and just runs. they can stay in system and slow the takeover down at that point, but they are merely delaying the inevitable, unless they have a plan in place to launch a second defensive.edit: to clarify what is happening on the mechanical level when a sov holder won't defend its space, and you do the above:- minimal sp gain for passive industry, pos/poco presence, docked in station presence (this is 1 sp/hour)- passive sp loss- sp loss for presence of hostile ships in space- sp loss for non-sov passers-by or friendlies being destroyed- sp loss if any infrastructure is destroyed- sp loss for hostile industry and pve activities- sp loss for hostile pos/poco's presencei think it is also important to note that any alliance that simply docks up when trouble comes knocking is unlikely to have much of a presence in the system to begin with, meaning their sov level is unlikely to be higher than 2, which means taking sov from them should be relatively easy. if they are a large alliance waiting for reinforcements from some distance away, they will have to keep those reinforcements there to defend their space or else they will have to keep running backwards and forwards to counter you every time you launch an incursion."

6/10/2014,"hopefully this has not been thought of yet because it seems like a very easy thing to implement and thus should have been done already.my corpies and i were joking about the usefulness of the cq tonight while we were getting camped in station. one of the guys mentioned, ""you would think in the future there would be a damn port hole on the station to look out."" good point. it is thousands of years in the future and we can't tell or look outside a station through a window?it got me thinking and thus why i propose here: why doesn't ccp do just that?the idea is that in order to see outside the station, you have to enter the cq - thus actually adding functionality and reason for the cq and also adding a neat (should be realistic beyond belief) edge to the game to counter campers versus the not so fair undock and redock quick method. it is a good counterbalance to station camping and not 110% skewed towards the defender (the guy hiding in the station) either due to cloaks and lag (from the time it takes you to look to undock in your pod).simple to implement as using this cq tool would just look like what you would see outside the station in a ship but say with a fixed perspective camera from on top the station. you chose the tool and you are absorbed into the outside view. when done, the cq reloads and you chose to undock or stay in.i can't think of a flaw csm - and i hope you read this idea and at least respond.otherwise - flame on forum warriors./aliath"

6/11/2014,"unfortunatly, some people are harder to educate than others on such a straight forward issue. its kinda like marriage equality or pot legalisation; its a good idea, but its hard to pass."
6/11/2014,"having more space obviously generates more income, but your use of the word 'reasonable' doesn't seem very... reasonable. it's a completely subjective term, who knows, maybe you're talking about an income of several trillion per second, maybe you're talking about 100k per year? it seems strange to base your argument around some people's perspective on what you want vs what you need.what is 'reasonable' doesn't change the issue that it's far too easy for big alliances to hold a lot of space they don't actually use. in the current system, whoever has the biggest fleet almost automatically can hold however much space they want as the effort required to defend space you already have only lies in the logistics of getting a fleet together. cyno alts, jump bridges and titans completely trivialized travel as well. of course there are breaking points - the reason one entity doesn't own all of eve - but the problem remains in that the current sov implementation doesn't require anything to maintain. it even prevents pvp up to a certain point, as sov level warfare is an all-or-nothing affair where you either have enough supercaps to kill your enemy or you don't.following this, the current sov system creates the very need for wealth you mention, where it becomes obvious that in actuality it's just a viscious circle perpetuating itself. the link has to be broken somewhere and the sov system the op proposes seems like an as good a place as any. it's nowhere near perfect obviously, but a sov system based on activity is still far better than a sov system based on relative inactivity.edit: forgot to mention: you also note that the sov system should be about creating a place you want to live in. the proposed system does exactly that - even rewarding you for living in a system, whereas the current does not as it promotes passive activities far more than active ones. you don't 'live' in a system when you only ever go there to refuel a pos and take some cargo from it.edit: i did miss the point about supporting a population as far as the available possibilities in systems go, but with a system which rewards activity i don't see a problem with giving higher sov levels access to more or better ratting spots, to name an example. as far as moon mining goes, imho it's overdue for a complete overhaul anyway. it's outside of the scope of this particular topic, but i'd suggest moons deplete like asteroids do (without them dissappearing of course) and replenish afterwards, though with a different resource. moons have to be 100% depleted before the refresh can begin (so people can't just mine down to 1 tech and let it grow again), after which the resource will be queued to appear in another random moon, or it can replace a current moon at 100% which has not been mined for an x amount of time (50% chance of both). this makes moon scanning relevant again, as well as incite more fights over precious moons (or even just to scan). it also adds another layer to information warfare as it's not 100% clear who has what resource anymore. the available resources per moon would have to go up of course, to accomodate the loss of mining time when the resource is depleted and a new moon has to be found. it could even create an entirely new layer of economic warfare if done right..."
6/11/2014,"i firmly believe that sov should generally switch hands via pvp actions. that being said, i also believe that system vulnerability should be based on how much the system is utilized. on the one extreme, an unused system should have no rf timers on any of their sov structures, so any small entity can come in and destroy all claims on that system anytime they want. on the other extreme, a heavily utilized system should require significant effort to conquer, with many rf timers and perhaps other defensive bonuses. i don't have a particular standard to measure system activity, but i like how your sp system attempts to quantify this with both pvp and pve aspects."
6/11/2014,"how about hiring npc's to guard your claim. these npc's could exist in a variety of plexes and would have to be destroyed in order to take sov. massive fleets could come in and hit massive plexes, small fleets could hit smaller plexes, and small frigates could be used against various ""support"" npc's, essentially well tanked haulers. unlike faction warfare the only timers involved would be on the spawn timer of plexes which would give the sov owners a chance to build a counteroffensive.an alliance would have to bring in their own fleet to counter it and/or pay to replace losses. this would also make a fantastic isk sink.i could see how concerns would arise about the profitability of null being harmed, but with the extra cost involved you would likely see a rise in the cost of moon goo and the bpc's that drop from the rats.that's my guess for a solution."
6/11/2014,"agreed. that is exactly what i have aimed to do here. if you want to defend or take sov, you need to pvp. do you think my system fails to do that? if so, where, how? what could be changed to improve it?the problem i have with sov structures is that they are totally arbitrary; a little like putting a flag down and saying ""this is mine!"" with the sp system, if a solar system is not used it is automatically vulnerable, because total sp will be low, perhaps even low enough to have the system flagged as disputed. an alliance who wants to take sov in such a system should be able to do so easily, because there is little or no opposition. if the opposition is elsewhere and is willing to defend their system from the aggressors, they have the opportunity to do so by sending in reinforcements. the required response time of this task force will depend on how low their sp was and the nature and organisation of the invasion/occupation force, but i estimate that it will be at least a few days even for disputed systems to revert to unclaimed status without pvp. if instead, low sp equated to no/low rf timers on the sov-holders' ""flags"", you are forcing the attacker to bore themselves destroying structures that don't really have any relevance whether the defenders are willing to fight for what they have or not.the opposite is true for a heavily utilised system. sp will be high, so an attacker will need to blow up a lot of big ships and (relevant) structures with rf timers without losing as many in return. in addition, because the system is so heavily utilised, there will always be plenty of players ready to defend it from hostiles. thank you. i know there are definitely things that could be added, taken away and/or changed to make it better."
6/11/2014,"i don't see a lot of concrete objectives to complete when taking an enemy system: prevent pve by harassment. destroy pos's if deployed. attack outpost if it exists. but these objectives aren't present in every system. furthermore, in a well-utilized star system, you really need some critical objectives that can reasonably be defended (like ihubs with rf timers). while fw certainly has it's problems, it does some things very well. there are very concrete take/defend objectives that even a solo pilot can accomplish. i'm kinda rambling now, but i feel like claiming sov should entail more than just system activity, and i'm a big fan of investing to improve your space."
6/11/2014,"agreed. the addition of sp boosting stuctures that are necessary to move forward (or keep from sliding backward) as far as the sov level is concerned would be a nice way to add conflict, and would be a good balancing point for ccp to be able to track and change sp gains/losses."
6/11/2014,"i think you're underestimating the scope of this. by doing this you're provoking fights of all shapes and sizes. a good alliance would respond to an attack on miners/ratters/explorers by sending in ships to defend them. any such engagement has the potential for escalation. then there is the influence system which makes things much more complex. in border wars, what happens in one system has an effect on nearby systems so alliance leaders and fc's need to set their own strategic objectives based on what they think will tip the war in their favour. choose the wrong objective, focus on the wrong area, neglect areas of weakness, and you risk losing ground.having said that, head-shotting a large alliance's core sov level 5 solar system is difficult under this system. all there is to do is hit the outpost though these types of attacks could lead to massive fleet battles, thanks to rf timers. for objectives in a single solar system, i think part of the answer is in changing poses and outposts so that they can be improved and destroyed piece by piece, but that is a discussion for another thread.as for allowing solo players to be able to achieve sov objectives, i'm not sure they should be able to do much more than annoy. taking space is something that should only be accessible to groups unless a given solar system is so undesirable that only single players would ever be interested in using it."
6/11/2014,"overall this is a fantastic idea. activity based sovereignty is what i have been advocating in a recent thread and, in my opinion, is just what 0.0 space needs. as far as needing to spread out and claim region-wide space in order to maintain alliance level income (moon goo) this is simply a matter o ccp reworking the way moon mining and the like work. it again seems arbitrary that only a single structure can be placed at a moon and only that structure can pull out moon goo. the simple fix for this is to revamp moon mining to resemble pi, and moreover have efficiency of the new mi (moon interaction) tied in some way to system sov."
6/11/2014,"that is a very interesting idea. i'd prefer them to have additional uses though, so they are not purely sov structures. player owned stargates (of limited range) and gate guns are the first things that come to mind."
6/11/2014,"or perhaps they facilitate the next better way to gain sp from the various sources you listed in the op. they would make the gaining of sp easier, so their destruction would make the loss of sp easier as well. again, they would be targets of opportunity for guerrilla warfare, but not absolutely necessary to destroy. perhaps ownership of them could even be transferred to the new sov holder and that group would want to protect them to speed up the sp gains"
6/11/2014,"so i am in fw while being outaw. in average i am agressed once every roam from a friendly noob who didn't have the ov set up ""correctly"". i simply don't want to explain them every single time how to fix it (after usually contracting their stuff from the wreck back). it makes me feel bad for having to kill them, it makes them feel bad after they realized that the first thing they did after joining fw was to shoot at a friendly. it wastes everybodies time.the ov default is horrible. the priorities are simple wrong (not only the sec status settings). if ccp cares about npe give noobs a proper overview default. and don't tell me that everybody has his overview completely different. i bet that 90% of all in pvp involved players have the ov priorities sorted very similarly. you can even see it from the fact how popular those overview packs are. since they work for almost everyone.such fixes improve npe more than freaking tooltips. its not rocket science."
6/11/2014,"there is no right or wrong, only awesome or crap depending on what you're doing. for example, i have 14 different overview setups because there is no one size fits all."
6/11/2014,"well i disagree. i think you can find a setting which is a good default for most use cases. if you are a fc or in a fleet with 400 others you will modify it of course, if you are mining you will add rocks. the current setting is wrong, not bad, the priorities how it sorts standings, sec status, militia highlighting and crimewatch flags does not make sense. if all you do is flying around in nullsec you won't see most of it since you don't even have crimewatch, but noobs are not spawned in null.not to mention that you have 1 priority setting how players are highlighted in your overview, not 14. you might have different bracket profiles or tabs, but thats not even the point of my post.the first thing what people told you as you joined goons was probably to fix your overview with a link to a guide."

recall the decreasing point accumulation for ""low-class"" activities. in such a case, point totals would not get a multiplier. for example, a class 3 activity in a class 4 system would only net the native point value, with no multiplier.furthermore, sov level should definitely be based on the absolute value of system security, in that the lowest security systems should have need to accumulate more points than higher security systems. as an example:b = base number of sov points needed to claim a system.b = absolute value of system security level x 1000so a system with sec. of -1.0 would require 1000 points to claim sov., a -0.1 system would need 100 points.and the following equation would describe how many points are needed to attain the next sov. levelpoints req. for next level = b x ((10b)current sov. level^(current sov. level +1))that equals:10m sp to go from sov 1 to sov 280m for sov 2 to 3810m for sov 3 to 4and 102.4b (with a b) for sov 4 to 5assuming a 6th sov level 1.563t (with a t) points would be neededso the investment in higher sov systems would require a significant investment of time, players resources and logistics to accomplish. in other words, activity will get you sovereignty, but you have to be willing/able to pay for it and defend it.another point to make here would be in regards to the number of structures that could be placed. in this scheme, there is no hard limit on the number of discrete deployable structures that are tied to point multipliers. each individual could launch an independent structure to gain himself points. corps could do the same to gain points for their members, and alliances as well. each bigger structure would only yield better defenses on the structure and would cost an exponentially larger amount to produce and maintain, but not give any improved point multiplier. this gives opportunity for smaller scale attacks on less organized groups, and the opportunity for large scale attacks for larger groups.attacking structures will follow the same multiplication bonus (in other words, if the attack is worth 100 points, those points are multiplied by the sov*structure multiplier and subtracted from the point pool), this could allow for guerilla tactics on the part of the attacker to steal points from the sov. holder.in regards to moon mining:in this scheme, a moon containing valuable materials can still be mined, however at different efficiencies based on mining structure (which would be based on system sov level). any number of mining structures could be anchored to the moon in question, however, there would also be a pi-like effect diminishing returns if the density of miners becomes too high.finally, in regards to sovereignty needs in the current game: super capitals and titans would still have a place in this scheme, only the production of these beasts would come at a much higher cost. the story-line can be written however one wants, but the mechanic would be that only a level 5 system could possibly house all of the logistics and materials needed to build a titan, and a level 4 system for a supercarrier. dreads would be level 3, carriers level 2, all other ships (including capital industrials) would be level 1. thank you for reading, and please comment below!"
6/12/2014,"no, i literally have 14 different overview setups which can be switched in & out with a couple of button presses. i only use 3 seperate bracket profiles. the overview is far more customizable than you seem to be willing to believe & i stand by my original point of there being no single correct setup."
6/12/2014,this thread is not about finding the correct setup its about a good default. nobody wants to take your 14 profiles from your client.
6/12/2014,"ok, instead of saying 'proper overview setup', you could perhaps provide an example of a proper setup for ccp to look at. i'm sure out of the limitless variations that you can find at least one proper setup that caters to anything a new player might find themselves doing.what i'd actually like to see is a tutorial module that describes how the overview can be modified to suit peoples needs."
6/12/2014,"suspect, criminal, low sec status, outlaw should all have lower priority than in your corporation/alliance, militia etcpilot set custom positive standings should be above outlaw/suspect/criminal/low sec status but below letpilot set custom negative standings should be below outlaw/suspect/criminalthose are just a few examples after looking at a fresh char on the test server. and its only the priority setting on the appearance tab.velocity for example is a column which would not hurt to ad as default. since for a new player its hard enough to see what is moving and what is not.and eve has/had a tutorial section which explained the overview and even forced you to add a tab and a mission object to the overview. i could imagine its no longer there to increase the new player retention of the first 20mins. configuring the settings of a table is not what you want to do when you are new to a spaceship game. if you play it for a month you might want to customize it, but you should not be given bad defaults when you start. typical new player activities like trying out fw should not start with you firering at friendlies because the game displays them in blinking red."
6/12/2014,"the problem itself lay with the way the tutorial is presented in the first place. instead of shoving the whole thing in someones face, perhaps it could show the very basic principles of moving around in the game & allow people to choose extra modules of their own free will.as for the standings priorities, i respectfully disagree that the ones you have laid out are the only correct ones."
6/12/2014,"your corpmates/fw mates should not display as outlaws just to pick one issue of the current default. since thats not what you care about. crimewatch should not overwrite positive standings otherwise you will shoot friendlies earlier or later while let should stay at top priority. and keep in mind there are distinct settings for the background and for the icon. so in controversal cases you could have different settings for both. the default has identical setting for both.and if you disagree then please say why. noobs don't know what those flags are, not to mention when they occur. for that exact reason good default are needed till they know what they are doing."
6/12/2014,"the overhead module is used in a very few set ups, by very few i mean one that i know of. i like the idea i don't know if maybe just adding a 5% bonus to weapon damage when over heating, per level would also make this sub useful."

6/13/2014,yeah exactly. esp since it is not much work for ccp to tweak the default setting and it has good potential to spare noobs a lot of trouble in the beginning.

6/16/2014,"ok folks, anyone who has had a pos thrown into reinforced knows that they instantly become a slave to the reinforcement timer. how many times have you tried to get your corp mates up at 3am to start the logistics needed to get your pos shields back up to 50% so you can actually do something with it again?proposal 1: early exit. there is really no reason whatsoever that the person who puts pos fuel in the reactor, should not also be able to remove the unburned strontium from the strontium bay, which means that the pos exits reinforced mode at the next 1 hour fuel inject cycle. this allows the defending corp the option to exit reinforced mode early and start the logistics at a time of their own choosing instead of being a slave to a fixed public timer that is screaming out ""come back and kill me in 1 day and 16 hours"".i mean really folks - if ccp is going to give a time option on when to exit reinforced mode for the owner of a poco - the owners of a pos deserve the same consideration for their hard spent isk. this allows the defenders to start the logistics and then work on their pos when their corp is online instead of trying to get everybody up at some godawful hour. the attackers, if they are watching (and who have the responsibility to watch since they are the ones besieging the place) can always show up in a huge fleet and go to work on the pos as normal if they are so inclined.proposal 2: reinforced timer. lets discuss the fixed public timer for a moment. is there really a reason why my pos is broadcasting to the universe the exact minutes and seconds remaining until it runs out of strontium? you would think that ""exactly how long we can maintain the emergency defense shield"" would be a carefully guarded military secret. i am not saying that the attackers should not have some indication, but a minute and second timer is ridiculous. i don't have that precision fueling the pos, so why should an attacker have that precision when trying to bash it?i suggest that that exact minute and second timer be replaced by a percentage power indicator - start off at ""100% reinforced"" and drop by 5% increments as the strontium fuel bay is consumed. attackers can still figure out when to come back if they watch, and when the thing gets down to ""10% reinforced"" you know you are in that last 4 hours of that 41 hour reinforced timer on a medium pos and can act accordingly. if you do 5% increments then the exit can be timed to a two hour window, same as a poco."
6/16/2014,"so, basically, you didn't time your pos right, so now you want ccp to make it virtually impossible to kill the things?"
6/16/2014,"no - i did not time it wrong, i am just damn tired of getting up at 3am to jerk around with this.with all the tools available (watch lists, alts in system, etc.) do you really think the attacker won't know what you are doing?the only benefit the defender gets is to actually have his corp online when the pos comes out of reinforced. allowing the selection of reinforced exit on pocos sure has not made them ""indestructible"".this becomes even more critical with the pos changes coming in crius. ccp - do you really expect people to lay out billions of isk on all those arrays and a pos just to watch it get popped by pos looters 5 time zones ahead who will be there at 8am while your corp mates are asleep at 3am??good luck with that."
6/16/2014,"you can already time your pos to come out when you want it to. being able to push a button, have it come out and rep it up before the guys attempting to take it down can scramble a fleet to stop you is not the same at all. your idea gives the defender every advantage, and hell, ensures no-one is going to take an r64 from a coalition ever again. (before you say that never happens, go ask mordus angels, black legion and the guys who live in npc fountain/delve what they get up to.)not only that, but it gives csaas a truly stupendous buff, making them a hell of a lot harder to kill and thus making supercap production even easier."
6/16/2014,"the main reason i wanted to add an extra gun is because of how overheating and heat-spill works. by making extra highs (that aren't necessarily used for weapons mind you) you increase this configurations versatility a bit and also stretch the risks of chronic overheating further out.5% per level is very reasonable but not for this sub i think. based on my research in to caldari missile boats they typically fall short on gross damage put down field and this is before looking at other missile intracacies like being speed tanked or having missiles out-run. the additional high slot and the loss of a low for examplemeans you can lose a nano or dcu ii (which in the configuration i run is nearly 40k ehp lost) or otherwise find it harder to run away. however it does mean that i can volley pesky frigates/destroyers off me a bit faster. to drive that second point home i invite you to run a couple of exploration sites or level 3 missions with rlml and see just how bad this weapon is for that kind of environment. while i understand that ac/blasters and to some degree pulse lasers are mostly balanced around pvp (ie <24km) combat the cruiser missile systems are not and are affected very heavily by even the basic speed of the target. it's not unreasonable to assume a frigate might be dual-prop and sit at 20km orbiting you at 1200m/s which places them far outside of web range. otoh maybe the oher sub could instead of granting an extra high or raw damage or whatever, it increases the oh bonus from modules (similar to new t2 transports) which covers quite effectively the need for more damage and doesn't necessarily change any current balancing as far as slot layout is concerned.i personally still favour the extra high-slot to bring the damage output up to spec especially for a tengu but perhaps an almagimation of our two ideas could be appropriate as well."
6/16/2014,
6/16/2014,
6/17/2014,"no, what you can do is take a guess and put in an odd amount of strontium in the bay and hope that you miss the attackers peak time when it comes out of reinforced - not really the same thing at all. being able to remove strontium from a tower in reinforced is not all that different except that you are guaranteed to be able to pick your peak time within an hour or two. again - you take the pos out of reinforced, the defender then has to rep it - which is not done at the push of a button. yes, the buff is to the defender but it is a needed buff, and will not stop a determined foe who can keep coming back to put it in reinforced again, camp the system, post cloaked scouts, etc."
6/17/2014,"op, do you not understand the advantages your proposal gives to defenders? it takes 6 chimera's one 5-minute triage cycle to repair a pos. that is 10 minutes for 3 carriers, which isn't all that hard to come by. i point this out to show you that repairing a pos can be done within minutes of a pos exiting rf. now, you might wonder why a big alliance ever loses pos's then, especially those with supercapitals building. a 100b isk titan is certainly worth enough to sacrifice half a dozen carriers! the only reason these pos's are destroyed is because the attackers can reach the field first, and prevent the carriers from repping the tower. with your proposal, the attackers no longer know when the tower exits. this means they have to monitor the tower for the next 40 hours and instantly form a fleet to stop someone ninja-repping it. when we are talking alliances and coalitions with 20k members each, the only balanced manner for pos defense to work is for the defenders to ""set the rf exit time"", and for the attackers to be told when that rf time is, allowing both fleets the opportunity dominate at the tower. if you find tuning the pos rf timer by controlling the amount of stront in the tower is inadequate, a much more logical and balanced approach is request ccp alter pos rf mechanics to mimic poco or station rf timers: with those structures, you get to designate an ""exit window"" like 0100-0300, and the structure will exit rf around or during that time window. there will still be a countdown, and everyone and their mother can show up at the publicly broadcasted exit time, you just have to micro-manage the pos less to get your desired exit time."

6/19/2014,+ 1cant find any fault with this idea. everyone wins \o/
6/19/2014,"while it is well understood that highsec sovereignty is notionally held by the empires, practical control is often held by other entities. this is similar to rl where a particular ""hood"" might technically fall under a city municipality, but local power is practically concentrated in a gang, family, club or social network.sovereign nullsec and lowsec faction warfare zones already have mechanics for recognising this. it's time for highsec to join in.i propose that highsec constellations and/or regions display some indicator of the alliance that wields control there, be that through monthly player kill numbers, player kill values or some other meaningful measure of force projection. this need not convey any game mechanic benefits to the controlling alliance, although the designers may wish to consider that. even just the status of practical ownership would drive emergent content for everyone, and limiting it to player alliances would help drive players out of npc corps.i feel this would be very useful, as code and the new order of highsec are regularly subjected to complaints about our not holding sov in highsec, when we do hold it for all practical purposes. it causes a lot of confusion, and could be fairly simply rectified.thank you!"
6/19/2014,"this is a *wonderful* idea.there's a hell of a lot more to controlling space then just nullsec sov, and this would offer some fun positive feedback to corporations and alliances that spend a lot of time pvping in non-nullsec regions.a good side effect would be a ""warning"" system for the risk adverse, perhaps some miners would think twice about afk mining in a system that lists ""code. alliance"" as the top power projector in that area.anyway, wonderful idea! 315 to you, op!"
6/19/2014,"first, lets not call it power projection. power projection is a different thing than system control. next, having a highsec ""influence"" map to identify the most influential corps within a highsec system sounds pretty awesome, but i'm not sure the best manner to measure this. it could be kills in a system. the corp with the most kills... however, this is only one of the measures of system activity and dominance. we could measure industry in system, or mining, or missioning, or market volume, or ..."
6/19/2014,"i think having recognition at corp level devalues alliance membership. in my own example, it doesn't matter if the recognised power is the conference elite or experimental fun times reloaded corp, what matters is they are both members of code. the lower the level, the more easily outlying events can affect the result. similarly, individual systems are not so important and recognising at that level would increase exposure to irrelevant outliers - better at constellation or region level. these reward concerted effort and cooperation.i agree there are many measures of dominance, but running industry jobs and shooting red crosses and rocks are not among them. let the criteria be pvp related. pve aficionados are in it for isk, not for metagame dominance, and recognising particularly efficient multiboxing ratters as ""dominating"" an area would be meaningless."
6/19/2014,you only want it to be pvp shooting ships related cause you would be butthurt otherwise when your alliance didn't have there name anywhere. if its based off anything it should be market pvp lots more of that happens then ship pvp
6/19/2014,"why not all of them? take an average of all of the events, pvp, trading, mining industry, movement, categorized them into a 100 point scale for each (treating data points that occur between corp members such as corp members trading with eachother or shooting at eachother as non-indicators, they arent counted). that way ""practical control"" is equally possible to any corp regardless of style.the 100 point scale and where you fall on it would be based on averages for your region, so each constellation is based on regional averages, average across all corps active in a region will be a score of 50, someone whos 10x that in say, trade volume, will be 100 within their constellation in control points. (of course the exact number scale and number ratios are completely arbitrary and for theoretical purposes). this way even a corp who only station trades could have ""practical control"" over a constellation against even a pvp corp, if theyre relative station trading amount is vastly disproportional to the relative pvp of the pvp corp. aswell a corp that does everything averagely could steal control from a corp that only does one or 2 things if they're overall points add up."
6/19/2014,"this is a serious thread ma'am, please don't bring your barely literate trolling here. nobody could seriously believe that ""market pvp"" could be a measure of player control."
6/19/2014,"primarily because most of those things have no effect on any player other than those who are doing the activity, and are thus not a measure of dominance. nullsec sov and faction warfare control aren't determined by who afks the most veldspar, why should highsec be any different?"
6/19/2014,"because it does, its providing market material. an activity countered by pvping, if you dont want their dominance, pvp more then they mine or just plain kill them. why should highsec only cater to pvp play styles for recognition? low and nullsec doesnt, low rewards semi-afk farmers and null rewards people willing to pay for space."
6/19/2014,"ma'am, you are using strawman fallacies. at no point have i said that highsec should only cater to pvp playstyles. players are welcome to conduct any code-compliant activity in highsec, and of course the same activities occur in null and lowsec. but - and here's the important part - those activities aren't tied to control, because they aren't a measure of control.you are welcome to start an assembly hall post about recognising industry and bot-aspirancy in highsec, but this thread is about recognising power and dominance.here's an example: let's say i'm an adorable newbie flying through lonetrek in my plex-purchased providence full of red frog contracts. is it more useful to me to know that there is a highly efficient afk multiboxing ice miner resident in the region, or that code is actively targeting non code-compliant pilots?"

6/20/2014,"being able to distinguish between similarly named channels would be really nice.for example, the channels alliance blues and alliance intel are right next to each other when grouped in a box. it'd be nice to have their tabs colored either red or blue depending on preference."
6/20/2014,"i think you need a measure of the ""different"" activities in each area. the prominent missioning corp in osmon may have a direct influence on the value of sister's lp. the prominent mining corp in constellation xyz may have a direct influence on the value and availability of ores in the area. the prominent pvp'ers in aufah may have a direct influence on freighter services through the system. the prominent industrialists in itamo may have a direct influence on the s&i lines available, or, in the next release, the ""teams"" available within system. now, you could say it doesn't matter influence, that control is something different. blowing up a freighter that enters aufay prevents the freighter from freighting. perhaps mining all the roids in a system prevents another player from mining in that system, but that's not direct interference. my counter to this is, i don't care about control as much as i care about influence. that's because your control is very limited, so much so that i can still mine in code ice belts, i can successfully send a freighter through aufay, and more. you don't control **** in highsec, but only yield various degrees of influence."
6/20/2014,"sir, you are posting about oranges in a thread about apples. please create your own thread if you would like to propose recognition of bot-aspirant activities. you are detracting from the purpose of the csm.furthermore, this is not the place for chestbeating about your opinion of code. you could try c&p for that. and i look forward to seeing your freighter in aufay."
6/20/2014,"i was using code as an example, not attempting to chest beat about the organization. i just used them because of their name in the thread immediately brought their examples to mind. non-code example, i know pilots that ran courier missions through jita all weekend during burn jita events. my point is that ""control"" in highsec is a misnomer, as the game mechanics provide lots of tools and workarounds to circumvent control. this is especially true in highsec. to quote you: ""this is similar to rl where a particular ""hood"" might technically fall under a city municipality, but local power is practically concentrated in a gang, family, club or social network.""in ""civilized"" areas, the local power wields control not by combat, but by other means. a politician might deny building permits, the business monopoly might undermine other businesses attempting to form. in eve, the local industrial power might use all the mfg slots in the area. another group may control towers on all the moons. someone else may own all the poco's. another group might mine all the roids every morning. suicide ganking freighters and miners is simply one aspect of this. to put it another way.... you might suicide gank 10 freighters a day in aufay, but redfrog sends 500 more successfully through during that time frame (against your desires). who is winning the control race there? if you only measure it by pvp, your ""dominating"" redfrog, but perhaps their business is successful enough that they can write off those freighters as a business expense, and will continue to operate without difficulties (or perhaps you don't successfully gank redfrog freights because they circumvent your ganks using web-to-warp). if all you want is a pvp-activity map, that's fine, but it is nothing like fw or nullsec sov influence."
6/20/2014,"personally i side with the 'all activities count' camp. but overall? no. concord still holds control of hisec. they would not advertise their ever more tenuous grasp of that control by recognizing their competition. you want to mark your territory? do what the gangs do, tag the walls (drop some cans).not to mention the fact that if i were a mining operation i would not want my name up in lights no more than . . .well this"
6/20/2014,"sorry op but this man is winning the thread. that's not even counting your blatant admission of self interest or the condescending faux-polite rp nonsense you're using to deflect attempts at debate; neither earn you points, and both made me struggle to care despite the fact that your concept, at least, is somewhat interesting."
6/20/2014,"damn - that is a fast pos rep! too bad it is not available in hisec, where a pos rep typically takes us all damn day with basilisks. maybe that is why hisec is littered with the abandoned small and medium towers of the small 5-10 man corps. ok - now i understand that big objection from nullsec - with a 10-minute rep, nobody would ever lose a pos. this is definitely needed in hisec tho - the exit window approach would be better than nothing. the hi-sec war dec pos bash for profit business is doing quite well and running out all the small corps with poses. even with this approach, i think we are going to need some kind of hi-sec pos shield repper that is a serious cut above the old basilisk - i'll have to do the math as to how much pos you can rep in a 2 hour window using hisec equipment only.would the ""exit window"" approach radically change nullsec / lowsec? would the change be bad??"
6/20/2014,yes. towers would never die.
6/20/2014,"i wouldn't say that if both the attacker and defender know when it comes out of reinforced. it will make the battle harder as you are coming in on the defender with his guard up this time, but aren't we all interested in having those huge epic big-fleet battles? i thought that was the reason you folks all spent all that time building capitals and supercapitals - so that you could use them to blow up the other guys capitals and supercapitals. giving us an exit window for poses reinforced in hisec is the least they could do - if it is good enough for a stinking poco it is good enough for a $2b isk dread guristas pos."

6/23/2014,simple stuff.
6/23/2014,"how would you expect them to enforce it? short of not allowing more than one client to open from any given ip address at a time (which is another nightmare due to shared ip's), how are expecting them to stop people from multi-boxing? remember, isboxer was against the eula, until some inventive chappie demonstrated a totally hardware way of doing the same thing.isboxer became ""legal"" simply because there's no way for ccp to tell when people are using it versus when they're not.inh otherwords, op, please demonstrate how to tell when someone is using isboxer versus a couple of these."
6/23/2014,no.
6/23/2014,simple. #1: client can check to see if the isboxer program is installed or running.#2: automatically flag ips that have 5+ simultaneous accounts coming from them and ban them until they can prove that they are using hardware methods.
6/23/2014,"for every complex problem, there is a solution that is simple, neat, and wrong. -- h. l. mencken#1 is troublesome - wow's own warden (anti-cheating) program often gets false positives, and frankly, this is pretty easy to circumvent for anyone with half a second to do some googling. edit: circumventing this is as simple as wrapping the isboxer process with an innocuous or mandatory appearing process name - you just need one that a large majority of the player base are likely to have running (chrome.exe *32 or svchost.exe for example)#2 is just ridiculous - you'd essentially just ban every major university (for example) out there, since they pretty much use proxies, so it might look like a hundred or so accounts coming from one ip. not to mention the de facto banning of your customers on a guilty until proven innocent basis is probably not a sound business strategy.and the simple fact is - you're mad at the program, not the results - your own response shows that. how is using isboxer any different than using a hardware method of achieving the exact same result? your suggestion treats the symptom not the (supposed) disease, and so would, in the long run, be a waste of time, and cost ccp customer loyalty and goodwill to boot."
6/23/2014,"my question would be why? for most activities in the game, having 10 individuals controlling 10 characters is far more effective than having 10 one individual controlling 10 characters. these are some exceptions. these are the reasons i could think of: 1.) isboxers artificially bump the population engaging in an activity. for something like mining, which is a quasi-finite resource, this means more focused competition. in the classic example of highsec ice belts, gathering ice before someone else gathers it is basically a race, and the bump in competing characters diminishes the gains of an individual player. 2.) isboxer allows several characters to coordinate some actions far more effectively than 10 non-isboxer players could achieve. this has been utilized for mining ice, bombing runs, suicide ganking, and even running incursions. however, this is also a major weakness of isboxer, especially when they game mechanics encourage spreading targets out. the benefits of isboxer are: a.) more accounts which results in more money for ccp. b.) ""emergent gameplay"" that keeps niche players playing the game. i feel like i'm missing some pro's and cons. i honestly don't care all that much about isboxers, mainly because the areas of game play they impact the most are the areas of game play that bother me the least. that being said, i do occasionally mine ore and ice, but the local isboxer just doesn't bother me."
6/23/2014,why?
6/23/2014,"q) why ban multiboxing software? a) because, as far as i am concerned it is violation of the eula which as players we are supposed to abide by.a) because, however you see it, it is having an effect on the in game economy which affects everyone.q) why has ccp not banned it?a) because they are making money from it, albeit indirectly."
6/23/2014,"so you are going to ban tens of thousands of people because you want a lazy mans ""solution"". i'm sure ccp's customer support would love the huge influx of support tickets. i'm also sure that players will love waiting weeks for responses about any problem in game.also my solution for your ""solution"" is to use a proxy for each machine. a little added ms doesn't matter a lot in eve.edit : universities is just the beginning of the problem. apartment complexes condos isps with certain nas setups all kinds of areas have many people under one ip from the point of view of ccp."
6/23/2014,"multiboxing works in all parts of the game, i multibox myself but i refuse to use third party software to facilitate this as that is nothing more than botting,controlling one char and relying on third party software to control 'x' amount of chars is basically against eula and has an effect on the in game economy which affects everyone in game.will ccp ban multiboxing software?no because they are making money from it."
6/23/2014,"i'm not really concerned about winning forum threads ms mynnna, in the end the real winners will hopefully be the citizens of highsec :) i do appreciate the opportunity to participate in the political process though, and was a little thrilled to receive replies from csms, especially two for whom i voted. it's almost like shaking hands with obama! please accept my apologies if you feel i have wasted your time, i do know you are both very busy with csm matters as well as your own ingame responsibilities."
6/23/2014,"you could also run with this, and have ""civilized"" groups who have the power project/control to put pressure on the ""hood or gang element"" to maybe have there docking rights removed in that system. then follow it up with a sort of ""pub watch"" idea where if your naughty in one system fighting illegally, the ""civilized"" people ban you from docking in all the systems they have control of."
6/23/2014,"when ""winning the thread"" is shorthand for ""convincing anyone to champion your idea"", you should be concerned."
6/23/2014,
6/23/2014,
6/24/2014,"luckily, ccp's interpretation of their eula, which they wrote and police, is the only interpretation that matters."
6/24/2014,no.i'd rather ccp look at common uses for isboxer and come up with inventive ways to reward individual players or individual players working cooperatively.
6/24/2014,"your concerns are irrelevant. as far as ccp is concerned, it's not a violation of the eula and they have very clearly said so many many times. furthermore, there is nothing in the eula that even remotely suggests that it would be a violation to control multiple clients at once. as for your second answer, so what? a single person doing a single thing with a single account affects the economy <U+FFFD> should he be banned too because of it? what's so bad about isboxers affecting the economy (same as everyone else) that makes it particularly heinous?so again, why? why should they ban something that very clearly does not violate any of their rules?so laughably incorrect that it borders on the absurd.they haven't banned it because it doesn't do anything that is ban-worthy.the idea that they don't ban because the number of accounts a person has is instantly proven 100% idiotic by looking at how they treat botters."
6/24/2014,"firstly, i have no problem with multiboxers, i am one.what i have a problem with is someone using third party software to control ingame events, which is tantamount to botting. and btw, if you are using multiboxing software, you are not multiboxing, because you are controlling one character and relying on the third party software to control the 'x' amount of characters.secondly, under the terms and conditions of the eula, ccp state that ""you may not use third party software to change how the game is being played."" and also ""you may not use third party software to gain ingame currency or items at an accelerated rate."". whatever you think of multiboxing software, it is in violation of both of these and if ccp doesn't think that, then i think they have been taking too much of their own blue pill and crash :)simply put, if ccp want people to take the eula seriously then they should rethink and rewrite large parts of it."
6/24/2014,"unfortunately (for you anyway) ccp doesn't agree. and frankly, since their interpretation of the matter is the only one that actually has any impact on the situation, i'd say you're probably sol.i will ask my question again:how is using is boxer any different than using a hardware solution that has the same results?until you can come up with a legitamate answer to that question, we're pretty much done here."
6/24/2014,"i'm just seeing ""but ccp says its legal!"" over and over. anyone mind trying to explain why its actually beneficial to the game? op isn't doing a good job of justifying why it should be banned but its proponents aren't defending it very well either."
6/24/2014,"maybe because we don't feel the need to. honestly, i'm not for or against it - i could care less either way, but as with suicide ganking and afk cloaking, ccp has repeatedly, constantly, and directly said it's not against the rules of the game and therefore is ok to do.in the case of is boxer, they even specifically made it ""legal"" - it used to be bannable offense. how much more clear do they need to be?"
6/24/2014,"just because ccp says it's legal, doesn't make it the correct decision. it's a shame that so many people actually take the side of cheaters."
6/24/2014,"does it mention anything about using hardware to gain any form of advantage in the eula? because it does mention third party software.the big problem with this is that it is open to interpretation and if the eula is ""legal"" as ccp says, then it should clearly state what is acceptable and what isn't.that is why there are so many posts regarding this, because the way it is worded is open to interpretation.if you want to play the game with blinkers on and agree to something that we are told is ""legal"" without fully understanding it, that my trusting friend is up to you."
6/24/2014,"cheaters get banned. it happens all the time, so how is ccp taking their side, exactly?take your time, i'll wait.so the method matters more to you than the actual results?and yes, eula's are open to interpretation - they have to be, or they would be so specific as to be unusable. just like modern day legal codes, eula's are as vague or as specific as they need to be to get the job done. some things they're very specific on (though shalt not reverse engineer thy client). others, not so much (asshattery shall be punished). but who defines asshattery? ccp does. they serve as judge, jury, and appeals court in their own little legal enforcement zone, otherwise known as the game environment.and let us not forget, isboxer is (i'll say it again) legal now because that process works. someone appealed it being bannable, and ccp agreed with that, specifically allowing it be used because in their opinion, it doesn't violate that clause of the eula you keep quoting.editi realize that i am either preaching to the converted or i am spitting in the ocean depending on which side of this particular topic you're on. i don't expect to change anyone's mind. but it's important to me that we (a) have all the facts presented, and (b) get people to realize this is not a new discussion - it's been hashed over (repeatedly) and ruled on by ccp (repeatedly). at least i have company while i'm tilting at windmills."
6/24/2014,"because isbox is cheating, regardless of what ccp claims. ccp might allow it because it makes them money, but it is still cheating."
6/24/2014,yeah just like buying plex is cheating. cause like it totally gives you an unfair advantage!!! pay to win !! at it's most basic!!also apparently owning more then one account is cheating. having pi alts on one account is cheating. reading about the game and using that knowledge to make more isk then the complainers in this thread is also cheating..
6/24/2014,"really? by that logic ccp would not be banning botters (who i suspect run far, far more accounts than isboxers) which they clearly are."
6/24/2014,"multiboxerrs are ebil thread # 2,907,876,802,987,421.this must be the whine of the week - all i see are these threads."
6/24/2014,"you are never completely safe anywhere in eve, and will never be. this would just create an easy dodge to war decs. the whole corp would then just hide out for a week in .8 or higher system. most corps i look at haven't had a war in nearly a year. it should be impossible to drop corp during a war dec. don't want to deal with the unsafeness of eve stay docked up."
6/24/2014,
6/24/2014,
6/25/2014,"this argument again? i'm not even going to restate my opinion on this. instead, i'll quote from ccp's policy on client modification since no one ever bothers to quote or link to the appropriate policies and rules.after quoting section 6a2, section 6a3, and section 9c of the eula, the policy concludes:the sections i've highlighted i think are usable by both sides of the argument, although i'm not hopeful the discussion will get any better."
6/25/2014,"i dunno about banning multi-boxing software, especially without stats on how prevalent it is.i'd rather that pressure be put on ccp to come up with fun gameplay that rewards playing with other humans (rather than by yourself with multiple clients).the loot scatter thing was one attempt that failed, so they need to keep trying."
6/25/2014,"not even pointing out the one glaring fault in his arguement?it is literally ccp's game, they determine what is cheating. its like your best friend bobby inviting you to play bobby-ball, if the goal fo the game is to hold the ball as long as possible, but any redheads or girls who touch it are disqualified, and hes the only not-ginger dude playing, they are still his rules and you either have to follow them or not play. hell, its like going into a casino and saying the dealer is cheating because he isnt playing by the same rules as you, well no crap, he plays by the house's rules, which are different from the betters rules, because its their game."
6/25/2014,"um, no. ccp decides what cheating is within the context of this game, not you. you may choose to accept their rulings, appeal their rulings, or stop giving them their money - but you don't get to define what constitutes cheating, ""regardless of what ccp claims""if you want to make a rational argument of how is boxer actively harms the game environment and puts other people at a disadvantage in a way that is different from or worse than using any other method of acheiving the same results, then by all means, please do so.until then, your argument is basically ""i don't like it, and that makes it wrong."" this argument cannot get better because it is exactly that, an argument. there's no discussion, there's no debate, and the few people who try and point out reasonable points are lost in the frothing sea of whinging."
6/25/2014,"it's so blatantly obvious that i didn't feel the need to even try to argue that angle. i just took their arguments to the logical conclusion. figured that might have more of an effect then ""ccp says it's legal deal with it"".."
6/25/2014,"probably because wildstar basically banned isboxer, just like guild wars 2 did. then again, wow allows isboxer"
6/25/2014,"watchlisting is one of the most used and easy intel assets at the moment.people just have to put you on watchlist and provide free and easy instant intel.there are alliances that have every single super and titan-pilot watchlisted and it makes it almost impossible nowadays to log in a super or titan pilot without the enemy instantly knowing it.this makes boring gameplay and prevents covert capital operations.this will also generate big-bloc power projection since nobody wants to fly his super or titan with smaller alliances because they know that big blocs like pandemic legion have them watchlisted and will hunt them down as soon as they log in.so there is only one choice left and that is to join a big bloc or loose your super to them because they have you watchlisted.i propose that people can only watchlist you if you accept it. in other words:if somebody wants to watchlist you, you get a message wich asks you if you agree to have that person watchlist you.this way people will actually have to do more active scouting and less metagaming in station.and it will provide more capital action since people will be less scared to log in their capital ships without having the danger of being ganked by big alliances with lots of capital ships that are waiting for you to log in and see you on their watchlist."
6/25/2014,"i may not agree with the reasoning, but i don't see the harm in having watchlisting being an opt-in thing. for that matter, make it a general setting so i can just auto-reject watchlist requests like i do dueling requests."
6/25/2014,"i think that's an interesting argument, that people may not log in supers because of a watchlist. i think it's preferable that someone'd feel comfortable logging in without feeling that basic act'd get them killed. but i also wonder if it'd be too difficult to catch a super without a watchlist? it's silly to expect someone to camp a logoff point for months. big news stories in mainstream media come out of having supers be tracked for months, and it's a playstyle a notable number of people enjoy.should supers be 'caught' with watchlist games or should they be dying in battle? (e: a big fight) would a restricted watchlist cause more people to log on their supers? would it result in people having more fun in their supers, more supers in fights? is that a good thing or a bad thing? who'd it benefit and who'd it restrict? i've seen less supers in space than i have fingers, haven't been in a fight with more than two hundred people, and barely log on, so i've no bloody idea."
6/25/2014,"supers should absolutely be dying in battle. the real issue is there's no pressing reason to risk them, and even if you do, pl will hot drop on them like a fat kid dropping on a toffee eclair. super carriers are seeing a limited resurgence thanks to the drone changes (specifically drone upgrades affecting fighters/bombers), but titans are glorified mobile jump gates, and they have been for a long time. there's just no reason to put a a couple hundred billion isk in hull, fittings, and implants at risk, and that actually sucks in terms of eve's end game state for those players. it's one reason i refuse to tie myself to a super at this point - i have the skills for a nyx, but once i strap into my metal coffin then what? why would i fork over that kind of isk for a ship i will never (or rarely ever) use when i have a lot more fun in ishtars and bombers?"
6/25/2014,"the intention was to make farming plexes harder for people only interested in farming. however ccp threw the baby out with the bath water and now plexing is so difficult and pays so little for the amount of time it takes, that finding fights is harder than it used to be.here's my suggestions:* make a plex rat spawn when a hostile ship warps in to a plex and there isn't already a plex rat there, not every minute or so. this way gunless farmers have no way to offensively plex, but a 10 minute plex can actually be completed in 10 minutes if unopposed. this also rewards people for staying on field when a pvper shows up to try and force them out. if you regularly run from fights, then you will have to kill more rats.* ease up on the dps check the rats have, for the sake of condors and newbros everywhere.* double the amount of lp all forms of plexing yield. this stops missions from being the obvious best choice for making isk."
6/25/2014,nope.nope.noooooooooooooooo.
6/25/2014,"why not? i'm interested in changes that would increase the amount of content for everyone in faction war, so i'm very curious about the perspective the opposing militia has on these changes. so i'd really appreciate it if you went into detail.also i know that you've probably been running a lot of missions lately. wouldn't you agree that they're kind of boring and that plexing is more interesting?"

6/26/2014,"the mistake in your approach being, of course, the thought that the might respond to logic. as epictetus said, ""you cannot teach a man what he thinks he already knows."" they're convinced is boxer is bad, wrong, and should be banned without really examining the logic of the situtation, or being able to provide a logical reason why it should be banned other than the fact that they feel like it shouldn't be allowed."
6/26/2014,"well, as you already said it: supers should die in a fight, and not die because pl has every single supercap pilot watchlisted and as soon as they log in, they run a locater on them. and no it is indeed silly to have an alt logged of in the system, like i said they use locaters after they noticed it log in. this is way to easy intel.+1 for the idea"
6/26/2014,"ok lets face it messing with sov or challenging it is a pain and for anyone small basicly undoable. so here is my idea all the sov upgrade mods the entrapment arrays and so on are pulled from the ihub or tcu which ever its pluged into. now what you do is take 1 mod say entrapment array that using ie doing sites and such upgrades lvl 2 3 4 and 5 are mods you plug into 1. now damaging it will be easy this say doing some dmg into armor disables it meaning its like its not even there. now this forces people to undock and fight to defend it(also they cant be out around pos has to be some random spot in system ill let them be probable not just automaticly show up like the tcu does. the damaged unit keeps its lvl so if its 5 it stays 5 you just have to come repair it, but and this is a big but if the fleet has the dps and time the entire thing is destroyable no reinforce basicly so you as a sov owner have to defend your space. now some ideas on them they are not targetable by capitals or higher this stop people from just being dicks with capitals and isn't needed anyways if you go for the sov and claim the tcu the old system upgrades auto destruct so they don't need to be targetable by capitals anyways. the idea for the changes comes from as it stands small group[s cant do jack against sov nor can you expect to get fights a lot if you roam through renters and so on can and do just dock up since a small group cant threaten them."
6/26/2014,"price of tags is dictated by players. it is like moon goo. why r64 are so expensive, people should be selling it cheaper."
6/26/2014,read the thread properly.i said tag sources have been nerfed while lp store costs are too high.thanks for playing.

6/27/2014,"i vote for option #2, it makes good sense to have that type of tutorial balance and the chance also once again to start improving standings in enemy faction territory in what seems a quicker route than what there is presently."
6/27/2014,ok so i'll attack this from a pvp perspective. how is one guy with 100 domi's fair to the 1 guy with 1 domi? ccp changed how drone assignment works for a reason. isboxer is one way to circumvent that change.
6/27/2014,that's a ridiculous argument. 1 domi against 100 of them is going to get fubar'd in short order regardless of how many people are controlling the 100 domis.
6/27/2014,outside of their main purpose in game - capital ship tackle - lets up the anty .....make it so a heavy dictor bubbles stop interdiction nullifiers and intys.
6/27/2014,you are rightand at the moment it gets even worse:people are watching the forums to see who buys a super or titan and then puts them on watchlist.as soon as the char logs in they will run a locater on them and send an alt there to wait until the super/titan is sold.you read it almost every week on evenews or tmc that a freshly bought titan got killed by this metagaming.and losing ships in eve because you bought it on the forum and people can watchlist you is bad for this game.+1 for this idea
6/27/2014,my question 'should supers die in watchlist games or in battle' in my previous post is very poorly worded as it suggests that these two things ('dying in watchlist games' and 'dying in battle') are opposed to each other. i see no reason to assume that reducing one would lead to an increase in the other. i think it's called a false dilemma. i'm sorry for asking such a bad question. i'd like to stress that these are actual questions and not questions designed to convey a message - i am almost completely ignorant regarding supercap meta and am not qualified to comment
6/27/2014,"it's easy to mitigate that risk, if you aren't terrible at eve. we have alts for :reasons:.1. buy titan on alt through forums.2. log alt in in jita for hours at a time.3. have 3rd party transfer titan to actual pilot who does not post in that forum thread."

6/28/2014,"still going? since the only people who are going to read this are the couple of people posting, forum mods, and the csm, i'll drop in a pro-ban argument.one argument for banning isboxer is that people in pvp don't like losing to software. the number of accounts owned by unhappy people could start to outnumber the number of accounts running isboxer. that could be a bad thing for ccp's profits. but can a person use isboxer in pvp and get better performance that then same amount of individual players? in some cases, yes. on csm representative xander phoena's website crossing zebras, pl member forlorn wongraven argued back in january that gangs of isboxing stealth bombers are bad for the game:one of the things that makes isboxer so effective in making bombing runs is the coordination between the bombers in an isboxer fleet compared to 6 individuals in forlorn's example is the ability to broadcast the same command to 6 different ships simultaneously. a human fleet, no matter how good, can obtain that level of performance.(just as a side note. i thought the rule was that one keystroke or mouse click could perform one action in one client. it sounds like the people using isboxer aren't following the eula. some might even call that ""cheating"", but ccp currently allows that, so i guess it isn't.)one could argue the effectiveness of isboxer gangs of stealth bombers is due to poor mechanics. stealth bombers used to decloak each other if they got too close to each other before crucible. if ccp allows cloaked ships to decloak each other again, that problem is solved. no more one-man stealth bomber camps and all the isboxer users get to keep their software.i guess i should add the thoughts of our csm representative xander expressed in the thread of the article i linked to on crossing zebras."
6/28/2014,"had to kill two friendlies today and spent after that 30minutes explaining them how to fix the overview since the ccp given defaults are unusable. its all unnecessary and not fun for anybody involved, esp the noob."
6/28/2014,so we would use non-targeted interdiction to counter the counter to non-targeted interdiction.
6/28/2014,"sounds like he has it all worked out de'veldrin.if only ccp could makes those mods sort of changeable. you know, with a sort of script, like those pesky sensor thingies. we could then carry it and make it so it becomes a targeted interdiction. destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
6/28/2014,"and this is exactly why i like the op's proposal, it will reduce metagaming that is ruining this game.you shouldnt be able to get kills through easy metagaming.as i recall ccp is removing api-pulling for wormhole data for the exact same reason.people can see how many npc's are killed in each wormhole by an api pull. they are removing this because it is too easy intel.and in my opinion the watchlist is just as gamebreaking to supers and titans"
6/29/2014,have you ever actually tried to fly stealth bombers with isboxer? it's incredibly difficult and infuriating. you need save spots and such to even get aligned properly and if the people you're bombing move at all you're screwed. the issue is each client de-synchs quickly so you can't just click in space to move to line up things. god help you if they figure out the main character (which can be easy if you know what to look for). the problems with pvping with isboxer is so numerous i don't really feel like listing them all right now. the biggest though is damage being switched and having your main character blown up. once they blow up your main character generally you're screwed.i'd much rather face an ixboxer fleet over a multiplayer fleet in pvp... there's been isboxers in the alliance tourney and they get beat for a reason..
6/29/2014,"ashley, that was an interesting response. let's see if i can address your points. since i live in lowsec, i don't have any experience with bombing runs, so i'll have to take your word on the difficulty of setting up a bombing run using isboxer. so, if i understand correctly, your argument is that the difficulty of setting up a bombing run offsets (or more than offsets) the increased coordination between the bombers in an isboxer fleet when releasing the bombs compared to individual pilots conducting a bombing run, thus the use of isboxer does not give the isboxer user an advantage. that still doesn't address the point that isboxer's ability to broadcast commands to multiple clients simultaneously seems to violate the one keystroke/mouse click performs one action in one client rule, thus violating the eula. but if ccp doesn't care, then meh.from what i know about isboxer, except in some specific circumstances, the person running isboxer, if not part of a larger fleet, should get pwned. that's why in an earlier post i wrote ""some cases"". since my last post i found another source that extolled the virtues of isboxer for another use case: ganking.some may not consider ganking ""real"" pvp, but that isn't going to stop the carebear who was ganked from complaining about someone ""cheating"" by using software to kill him. as i posted before, people don't like losing to software. if that carebear (and his 3-6 accounts) then decides to not only quit, but then go around and post on forums and the comments of articles about eve about how people use software cheats, that could hurt potential sales. especially when other mmo companies like arenanet and carbine ban the use of that type of software. in a stand-up fight, you're probably correct. i'm pretty sure that you are referring to the isboxer team in the second new eden open and not the alliance tournament, but your point is the same. but does the alliance tournament really reflect the reality of pvp on tranquility? i'm pretty sure that anyone using isboxer to pvp on tranquility will only engage a foe in favorable circumstances. like in a gate camp with stealth bombers or tornadoes (if that's still a thing).but your reference to the use of isboxer in a ccp-sponsored tournament does highlight one thing. ccp doesn't see anything wrong with isboxer, including its ability to broadcast commands to multiple clients using one keystroke or mouse click, so it's not ""cheating"" because ccp makes the rules. even if the written rules in the eula seem to indicate otherwise."
6/29/2014,i would use such a function.
6/29/2014,if the measure is to be player ships destroyed then wouldn't influence actually be concord ?as they destroy more player ships in a suicide ganking system.
6/29/2014,man that would be awesome mag's. we could put those scripts in there and use it like a warp scrambler. but with a super long range.
6/29/2014,"i think we may have stumbled upon an idea, that ccp may implement.so at least this thread wasn't a waste. destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
6/29/2014,
6/30/2014,i love people who take thing too literally. the point is that the program can be used to circumvent game mechanics that ccp has implemented. the example was greatly exaggerated to demonstrate how it is an unfair advantage not just for miners but for the pvp community as well.
6/30/2014,"to clarify the point, what you are suggesting is that isboxer is a way to circumvent the game mechanics that only allows a player to control 50 drones at one time. what an enterprising fleet commander can do is form up a fleet with 50 domis and then have 5 fast-locking ships controlled by someone running isboxer. the fleet then lands on grid and drops sentries, assigning its drones to each of the fast-locking ships according to a pre-arranged plan. as a result, 250 drones are under the control of one player, who can then use one keystroke/mouseclick to send the command to 5 clients to focus fire on a target. that focused fire would be more coordinated than that done by 5 individual players or someone multi-boxing 5 ships without the benefit of isboxer.originally, ccp was going to remove the drone assist mechanic totally. csm 8 convinced ccp to instead reduce the number of drones that a single player could control down to 50 due to the effect that a total removal of the mechanic would have on incursion runners. but if the meta turns to fcs or a member of a fleet having to run isboxer in order to act as a drone bunny, i can see ccp going ahead and removing the drone assist mechanic. after all, does ccp effectively want players to feel they are forced to spend real world money (an inner space subscription costs $15 / 3 months or $50 / year) in order to compete in pvp?of course, if ccp does remove the drone assist mechanic, then there is no issue and one less objection to people running isboxer."
6/30/2014,you're making up rules.i could do the same thing as isboxer with some simple electrical work. since i can do it purely with hardware you'd have absolutely no way of detecting it. hell i could make isboxer impossible to detect even. just look at all the creative ways botters/hackers got around warden.i can run +7 gank accounts fine without isboxer. i mean come on it's ganking...frankly someone that is going to be that big of a crybaby will complain the first time they get ganked by a blob anyway. it won't matter to them if it's one person or one person per account. so it doesn't matter at all.well then that doesn't matter because isboxer or not only engaging in a favorable circumstance always gives you an advantage. in real pvp an isboxer is at a disadvantage if the numbers and such are the same.i don't remember which tourney it was but i used to chat with the blatant one at the time. the drone assist comment is a good point though. i don't see that happening at all so i hadn't thought about it. do you know people who are actually doing that?
6/30/2014,"and i love it when people miss the point - that whooshing sound as it zips past them makes me giggle.when you exagerate an example too much, it ceases to be an effective example, and becomes ridiculous. a 1 v 100 fight (or even a 5 or 10 v 100 fight) is so lopsided, it wouldn't matter if one side was using isboxer or black magic to run their clients - numerical superiority at that level has one result, assuming the numerically superior side aren't complete and utter tools. hell 100 noobships against a dominix is probably a pretty forgone conclusion.a better example would be - for instance:side a has 100 domis, all run by one pilot. side b has 100 domis, all run by individual pilots. all ships have the same fitting. since side a can acheive perfect fire control on their applied dps (instead of the odd wandering target), the is boxer fleet has an advantage in the application of dps in this situation.of course, in this case,if you headshot the ""fc"" of the isboxer fleet, you've essentially killed all 100 ships, instead of just one, i argue that isboxer actually has some severe limitations in the fleet warfare department. also because your ships all respond in the same way every time, it's hard to bring a flexible fleet and spread our things like points and ewar (a la eff-you fleet)."
6/30/2014,"its cheating plain and simple it copies commands to multiple clients. if i do that with any other software its cheating but isboxers is ok? they can detect it, they decided not to ban people for it, a mistake on their part since there are plenty of bots that run on isboxer only. if its not giving u a huge advantage multiboxing why are you using it? i tried it out with my 10 accounts for about 5 days and decided it was cheating and got rid of it cuz i expected it to be ban worthy by now. if you cant multibox w/o isboxer you got too many clients simple as that. 1 command per client. that is the way a game is ment to be played. you take away all the disadvantages of multiboxing when you automate the most annoying part (having to actually command individual windows). if you dont see how perfectly coordinating 10+ accounts is an advantage go fight a multi boxed bomber fleet or arty. just let me know one way or another cuz if its not cheating its gonna be pretty much required software for multibox pvp. thats the kind of advantage it gives. drone assist lol you dont assist drones in isboxer you hit f and it has all your drone boats attack that target no matter if your flying 1 or 50......totally no advantage there over someone not chea....i mean using software to play for them."
6/30/2014,how long do you think it will be before we get accused of being each other's alts?
6/30/2014,"you may have a point there, although it's far from being an insult. destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
6/30/2014,"true, true.do you think we have spun this thread far enough off topic that it can be ignored now?"
6/30/2014,"oh yes. i believe we have pull victory, from the jaws of defeat. destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
