4/1/2010,"i really cant see a powergrid buff necessary for the nighthawk. it already functions as the most powerful in the group. every fit demonstrated by people who complain about the nighthawk either want both gank and tank and try and jam a warfare mod on it. im sorry, even though it gets a bonus to fitting the warfare mod, doesnt mean you should fit it; it doesnt get a effectiveness bonus so use something else in the highslot. furthermore, if you arent willing to sacrifice a bit of tank to stuff on your heavy assault missiles, just fit regular heavy missiles instead (for which it was balanced around) because it fits just fine that way.kinda tough to root for this one. in its current role its just a crazier, slower, more expensive, and more damaging die-most. good for some people, bad if the battle doesnt end in less than 2 minutes. its true, its not any more valuable than a standard brutix. a seventh low-slot would benefit it greatly, giving it a power mod for neutrons. furthermore, changing its falloff bonus to an optimal bonus would help keep it in range a bit better which is problematic with the new webs.dunno if it would be good to swap it to the myrm. eos is made by creodron, and as said before, it needs its own hot droney love boost. make the astarte the pre-eos-nerf eos? that would be pretty sick with 5x ogre iis with drone bonus plus neutron blaster face-raping. i always liked the brutix hull however: looks like you are punching someone in the face with a giant fist attached to rocket engines.absolution and sleipnir... i guess they are ok. the damage from the absolution is extremely underwhelming, even after the laser buff and scorch and gets way outclassed by the harby. it needs to be the ehp god of laser buzzsaws that the zealot isnt. the sleipnir is good, but i havent flown it and seen it flown even less so i have no comment.maybe the biggest problem with these ships, aside from their bonuses, is their cost! if ccp were to lighten the material load in order to build these ships, they would be a ton more useful. it currently costs 170 - 190 mil to purchase one? i havent checked in a while but it couldnt have gotten any better. for a ship that typically dies in a blaze of glory, making it cheaper would certainly be a gigantic boost."
4/1/2010,"it doesn't - if fact, you may think it fits fine cause you have a weird 7|5|5 layout, which kinda suggests you using a fitting mode. but that's just a fuzzy logic, nothing else. slots are usually there to give you some advantage, not to remedy design faults. that's an outstanding case, prolly just eagle has the same issue being a railboat with a clear lack of pg to fit rails.i can understand 8|5|5 on sleip - it can utilize those new fancy tracking enhancers and its base resists on the shield are all more or less even all across the board, while nh has got that pathetic 0% in em (ok, 25% if you count in the resist bonus - but since it's a bonus, i personally wouldn't), so by all means it takes more slots for nighthawk to set up a decent tank.basically atm you can have just 2 setups which won't require you using a fugly fitting mode - 1 lse buffer tank or medium shield booster'ed active one. and that's without any ganglinks or - god forbids! - hams. no need to say, that's just not enough. it definitely should be 2 lse and large booster instead.anything else will most likely result in you creating yet another abomination without mwd or with some other major fault of that sort."

4/1/2010,yes i like it. but i would like for a pop up window to give you the cost that comes up for each set of items. so 6 guns at once. also it should always give you the lowest price in your station.
4/1/2010,"if it cascades ""buy"" windows for each item, this would be an excellent idea."
4/1/2010,"yes, those comments are fair and as long as the difference in acceleration and decceleration times was balanced properly you wouldn't have any need to adjust warp speeds.looks like everyone agrees with this point so far, now to get someone who can make a change to pay attention"
4/1/2010,"because you cannot look out a window to see outside stations, someone is forced to undock (despite all the sparkly windows on the station models). if there was a button beside/above/below the ""undock"" button to the effect of ""look outside"" that would load the station grid with the overview centered on the station, no modules, no scanner... this would probably be easier on the server than ships undocking/docking constantly to see if anyone is outside (as well as being a more logical way to check what is outside the station).edit - timer changes only if aggressed.with that change should come a significantly longer redock timer if you are aggressed (similar to the longer timer if you logoff after being attacked). if you are not aggressed, then you have the normal timer (just as if you are not aggressed you have a normal logoff timer), so people can redock if they forgot something in the station.the combination of these two changes should fix the cause and problems associated with station hugging games.to answer those who say ""no will undock anymore"" before they ask: people know the station is camped already with the current mechanics. station camps would have meaning and options with these changes. one option is to stick a cloaky/ceptor on station and ships aligned to it but offgrid (or in a different system) if you are trying to catch someone. now there is the possibility of a break out and people will be more likely to try and when they try, they are committed to fighting if they fail. both would have a fighting chance, so there would be more fights."
4/1/2010,i prefer station windows and scramblers preventing docking if only because it will br a pita to wait a minute or more docking timer when i just forget something
4/1/2010,"good point. what if the docking timer functioned like the logoffski timer, in that if you are aggressed, your timer increases?csm has brought some fixes to ccp on the issue of docking games. this is a suggestion for further changes that can help to reduce this."
4/1/2010,"kinda cool but as above stated, not awesome enough. soz no props, maybe the walking in stations update will include this indirectly :)"
4/1/2010,how about if your target has so many target painters on them it make them too big to fit in the docking chute.

4/1/2010,"i've seen a lot of posts about possible improvements to the neglected destroyer class. i love a lot of the ideas that have come forward(removing the rof penalty, smaller sig radius, etc). in addition to these though, there's another direction i think destroyers could go.i would propose that the destroyer gain the ability to mount ganglink mods and maybe even receive a bonus to those mods. it seems to me that the popular frigate gang doesn't currently really have an option for gang link bonuses while maintaining the full mobility that's really their strength. while they are of course free to bring along a battle cruiser, it seems unlikely that a gang composed of frigates would sacrifice that mobility for the sake of a gang link. being as it is a smaller ship the destroyer could fulfill this role. obviously, this buff is not mutually exclusive of any of the other proposals for improvement and should be taken as an addition rather than an alternative to any of them.-jk"

4/2/2010,"you should see the fugly brutix/astarte shield buffer fits ive seen (that actually work strangely enough!) while i do not believe in a powergrid boost, i cannot argue that with a simple slot adjustment to a 7/6/4 like its cohort the vulture would be ok. the only issue i see with this is the nighthawk becoming the god of passive shield tanking (current is around 1.1k dps) since it will easily out damage the drake (although it probably should, but not with that crazy tank in play).i suppose the big thing is that the nighthawk gets the whine because they have to fit an rcu. it has an excess of cpu so if you want that grid you have to pay for it. that seems balanced to me: i cant have an astarte with a decent buffer without downgrading to ions or electrons (nor will i be able to catch anything with the crap speed either). if you gave it the grid, you need to gimp it elsewhere to keep it balanced; that said i dont see any people willing to give up anything for it."
4/2/2010,"why the hell does anyone insist on this ******ed passive tanking? it's one of those things i will never get. only the most stupid farmers ever consider passive tanking a nighthawk. i personally don't give a crap at what's the recharge rate of my shields - heck, ccp might reduce it to a mom's level and i'll still be happy as long as they fix other issues with it (pg, slot layout and stupid explosion velocity bonus. sig radius one is a lot more handy since the day they changed missile damage formula).i don't see any problem with adjusting the recharge rate if that's your main concern.also, comparing nh with astarte is a bit misleading. how about we compare nh's fittings with drake's? surely it has some cpu problems, but that's ok for a tech1 ship. on the other hand fugly drakes have no issues grid-wise while fitting 2 lse, mwd and heavies."
4/2/2010,"i highly doubt that if this were implemented that the cost would scale indy : freighter :: carrier : ship freighterthe cost would be more like that of a jump freighter and may not have as much space as originally suggested...hell 5 battleships would be awesome.....but remember a carrier also has its own normal cargo hold, fuel hanger, and a massive drone bay...whats to say that a ship the same size if all of the space was allocated to this purpose couldn't hold a few assembled battleships? :p"

4/2/2010,"logoffski should be fixed. if you are in a pvp fight with aggression and stuff like that, you should definately not be able to take advantage of the safing mechanics. very few people actually use it legit, it is too heavily abused.in all other circumstances, such as fights with npcs or just in normal space. it should still apply. there really is no easy way to approach the problem."
4/2/2010,actually the rules contradict each other and rule 17 doesn't apply in oope it was the change of rule 5 which used to state that rule 17 didn't apply in oope and we could discuss other games now rule 5 states we can't discuss other games in oope.but yes definately supported it's total nonsense that one day you have mods and devs joining in on discussions of other games and then the next day it's completely banned

4/2/2010,"i agree. there should be a regularly updated list somewhere of proposal ideas that are submitted by the csm and looked at by ccp at least briefly to decide what they will do with the idea.idea's should be logically broken down into 3 categories.-accepted: idea is either easy to understand/impliment or is very good despite complexity-taken to consideration: idea is not accepted/rejected due to too complex to be quickly decided upon.-rejected: ccp knows they will not impliment something like this. some issues like ninja salvaging fixes can be put her immediately.of course, a short description (even a few sentances would suffice) as to why the ideas are accepted/rejected are nessisary or people will keep demanding to know why their supercoolawesome suggestion didn't cut it.this would be incredibly beneficial to helping eve members keep up to date with where ccp stands with these ideas and can cut back on dull repeat threads."
4/2/2010,makes sense we want feed back.
4/2/2010,you honestly think the csm will want to bridge the gap between what ccp tells them and what csm graciously allows us to know. this proposal even with over 9000 thumbs up wont see the light of day when csm chooses which proposals to bring to the attention ccp.i truely hope i am wrong though.
4/2/2010,"let me start of by saying there are ways to get characters with high sp for one you can get them from the character bazaar. this is a proposal to allow players to perhaps only once per year buy a x amount of double training time. as i for one can not say what would be appropriate i can only make suggestions as to what i think is fair.a small example would be for $20 you would get one month of double training time,following the same rules as the double training time when you first started ie if your training time would take you over the end date of your double training time the last ability qued does not receive double training time as it's end point would be outside of the granted double training time dates.maybe the limitations should be something to the following1. can only utilize it once per year per account2. can only utilize it if the account has so many months on it?benefits1. many pilots would utilize this generating more income for ccp2. double training time for skills 3. less waiting time to be able to use that shiny new shipdownsides1. newer pilots can end up with a higher sp and not know what they are doing"

4/2/2010,"charater wrap sheet proposaldefined: a charater wrap sheet would show up in the charater's info page. when a charater leaves or is kicked from your corporation a director or ceo can add a blurb to his wrap sheet. the charter could also rebuttal the blurb tho.reason: i am a recruitment director for my alliance and it becomes nearly impossible to check every applicants api, background, eve-mail ex-ceo's and asking about the player's background, check the name against the eve forum's known griefter's page, check there standing's, and bio. so a charater wrap sheet would be a big help in seeing how the player's ex-corp's rated them. and a big help in aiding recruitment for corporation's and alliances. as a corp or alliance you put alot on the line letting someone new into your group. i.e. pos position, member activity, log ontime's, ships you fly, opening your door to jihadist, ect. in real life this is like a job resume or military record it follows you for the rest of your life.suggestion: the blurb that ceo's and dirctior's can choose should be predefind to make it standerdized and to limit harrasment, time, obsenity's,ect. the pilot should also be aloud to rebuttal.example:i. corp options. 1. how active was the pilot compared to the rest of the corp? 1-10 ten being very active. 2. how would you best define the player? choose up to three from the list. outstanding pilot fair pilot poor pilot, good moral's drunk at the controls of space vechicals griefter spie jihadist mission runner miner pvper explorer fleet commander capital pilot manufactur resercher pos operator valued corporate member 0.0 pilot has bad personable skills, ect. 3. would you re-hire this person to the corp? yes/maybe/noii. player options. 1. you may hide one of the three items discribing you from your last corp if you wish. 2. was there discription of you fair? yes/no. 3. rate the corp overall on a 1-10 scale ten being the best and one the worst.what this would accomplish: this whole procces would allow a history of eve players and of corportations. it would help players choose corporations as you could look up what players asid about there corps. and it would help recruters a ton too.(please if you do like this idea keep it short and simple i don't want to make eve a job, i would like to make it easyer tho to find good players and corps tho.)"
4/2/2010,"i assume by wrap you mean rap? which you might be interested to note stands for record of arrests and prosecutions. the reason i bring this up is that the relationship with a corp is not analogous to that of a criminals with the legal system. the corp history is more then enough to gather the intel you want if you're so concerned about it. you could easily contact any of the still active corps and get references. if the job of handling recruitment has become to big for one person to handle, then the obvious solution is to find others who can help, not change the game to make it easy pie (and so obviously open to abuse and exploit)."

4/2/2010,"in light of the upcoming elections, which i may or may not take part in, i was wondering what people thought of the following ideas for future developements that the csm might bring forth in the future if they choose to, or if i'm one of them.impeachment:with the csm term expanding, and members being able to run practically forever, it seems we might benefit from an impeachment mechanic. so far i'd say the general idea would be that players can vote once each term for a csm member they might want to impeach. if the number of votes reaches a certain threshhold, the member is impeached. vote tallies are reset each term.ingame reward for voting:given the extremely low participation in the voting process of past csm elections, it might be usefull to give players a reward for participating. this reward should not be drastic, and there are issues that can arrise like random voting in order to get the reward, but there are also methods to reduce this, like having to fill in a small questionaire to check if you actually know anything about the person you voted for. (this might be usefull regardless)veto:i'd like the csm and the players to get a seperate veto right towards upcoming features or changes. ccp allready has a veto of it's own, they have final say in everything. but if the players can veto by popular vote, and so can the csm, then not one body can do something that another body is strongly against. for the csm to veto something, they need to agree unanimously though. expand exploration:during my last campaign i did a bunch of surveys which showed (amongst other things) that new ships and expanded exploration where highest on the player's wishlist. nothing has been done with this by the current csm (to my knowlage) and therefor i'd like to bring forth the issue again for this term, even if i don't run.tell me what you think of these issues, and if you're a current or running csm member, would you adopt these aswell or not?"
4/2/2010,no offence but half that stuff seems pointless on opi mean afk button really? seems a waist of time tbh sure people sit afk and if you are looking to kil someone but hes afk and you don't know and spend ages finding them then its a waist of time but that waist of time some times leads to killing something else or him coming back in the time :dnumber 1 and 6 sound most important which is really worring me to ask is the csm doing anythin latly? :p

4/3/2010,"recently i read that the csm and ccp had been discussing a proposal to prevent people from docking if they were warp scrambled.while i can see the reasoning behind the idea and agree that some nerf is needed for docking games i think that that particular proposal is overpowered for three reasons:one: with the change to mwds warp scramblers are already a powerful and popular module. they do not need further buffs.two: station games can (in some cases) be fun and while it needs adjusting is one of the few ways that smaller gangs can engage larger ones.three: being camped into a station is already boring. being able to undock and at least try and escape is an important option to keep.a complete block on docking based on being warp scrambled seems far too harsh to me. however i also agree that at the moment it can be too easy to dock, a compromise solution somewhere between the current options is needed.suggestion one:what i propose instead is that docking at a station be changed to take a certain amount of time.without any negative effects that time would be nothing, or perhaps one second.certain effects would hinder the docking process. for example each point of warp jamming, each stasis webifier, potentially each target painter too.aggression timers would work in the same way they currently do. once the aggression timer is cleared the new system would kick in.naturally all numbers are examples only and are subject to playtesting/tweaking/etc.possibility one:each of these would add 5 seconds to the docking time.so for example if you undocked and were warp scrambled and webbed by one ship then when you hit ""dock"" was up it would say ""docking request accepted, attempting to get docking beam lock"". you would then need to wait 15 seconds (5 per point of warp disruption, 5 per web. if another ship got more points on you during that time the timer would extend further.possibility two (anti-blob):the first negative effect would delay docking by 30 seconds. each negative effect after that would delay by 50% less (i.e. 15 seconds, 7.5 seconds, etc - so maximum docking delay is about a minute). so the scram+web would give you about a 50second docking delay, but further effects would only add to it in a minimal way.suggestion two:an entirely different option would be to not use docking timers at all. (keep aggression timers of course). this proposal involves more fundamental changes in the way people dock and warp to stations though so could well be more work to implement.in this proposal 6 points on each station would be defined as docking points, with each docking point being a 5km radius sphere.when you warp to the station you would automatically warp to the docking point facing you.when undocking the undock point would be a docking sphere but you would by flying out of it as currently happens on stations.by massively shrinking the available docking/undocking area you open out much more possibilities for flying and bumping to come into things - people have to actually be in the right (and fairly small) area of space in order to dock which makes it much harder both for a big blog to hug the undock and for people to bail in a fight without being bumped/etc.i much prefer this option to the timer one as it comes back down to pilot skill - however i can see the timer being much easier to implement and think either of these solutions is much better than either the current situation or just having a blanket block on docking when scrambled."
4/3/2010,"i'm not really sure about your implementation(s), but it's definitely better then the suggested scrambler/disruptor fully preventing you from docking (which makes undocking a complete and utter gamble unless you have a instaundock for every station or local is clear).docking games are hardly a issue unless we talk about capitals or maybe rrbs gangs, and both problems are much easier to solve."
4/3/2010,"i had thought of this, and come up with this solution:as it stands now, there is a 1 minute timer whenever you aggress before you can dock/jump gates. ccp have said things like ""this is cause scotty doesn't like it when you come in with guns hot"". alright, that's fair.make warp scramblers prevent guns from cooling off: basically, if you aggress outside a station, you better expect to finish the fight. if you just undock, you can redock. if you warp to a station (as long as you aren't under the one minute aggression timer), you can dock without being scrambled."
4/3/2010,"agreed. supporting this because csm's suggestion is utterly ridiculous and stupid, and i don't even ever play undock games..."
4/3/2010,whats to stop me from rotating various negative effect modules to keep stacking more time?your idea is swiss cheesed a few areas.
4/3/2010,"i often seem to struggle with a lot of channels designed for specific gangs/fleets or intel where fleet invites get posted. having talked to some people suffering an abundance of not often used but necessary channels i came up with a solution.fleet subscriptionsthe principle is very simple, have a feature added to the fleet tab which allows you to subscribe to certain preset fleets. by doing this you will have access to a bulletin board with all needed information posted there and you will be alerted every time the fleet coupled to your subscriptions starts up including a preset timer which will alert the users subscribed every x minutes until the start time has been reached.the people who can alert and start up fleets i have named administrators for now, there should be multiple administrators which can be picked by the subscriptions creators. they will be displayed next to the subscription.a small graphic example of the menu:please visit your user settings to re-enable images.and a graphic example of the alert:please visit your user settings to re-enable images.to clear things up here is a list of the features i'd personally like to see implemented in such a feauture:- preset fleets and subscriptions- bulletis for these fleets, chosen by a dropdown menu or sorts- several ""administrators"" which can manage and start up fleets- a countdown timer which will alert the subscriber how much time is left till the fleet starts in the form of a pop up balloon every x minutes.- a pop up balloon which alerts the user when the fleet is started up.- a pop up balloon which alerts you when bulletins are changed.so to break it down in a tl;dradd fleet subscriptionsall support, comments and ideas are welcome."

4/3/2010,"for those who are unaware, a recent mod ruling has effectively encouraged scamming by ruling that securities offerings be presented on sell orders (with an optional discussion thread on market discussions). previously, the offering itself would be handled on the much less active md forum, wherein the same folks who are generally invested in these sorts of offers could discuss the often complicated and risk-laden opportunities. this is a common grounds for scammers, including both small-time scams of a ""mere"" 1 billion isk and large scams - for example, curzon dax ran an investment opportunity that turned out to be a scam, for a purported take of well over 100 billion isk.with the crossposting idea, ipo/bond auction threads are much more difficult to find in the (much more active) sell orders forum, and the lack of discussion means that scamming opportunities are vastly improved.it is my opinion (and i believe the opinion of others who frequent the market discussions forum) that due to the complex and extremely risky nature of an initial public offering or bond, that the current ruling by the mods be reversed and the selling of investment opportunities (securities) be allowed on the market discussion forum, therein allowing discussion within the same thread and the opportunity to reference information relevant to the op.edit:"
4/3/2010,supporting my own post.
4/3/2010,the intention here is for ccp to provide blanket protection to scammers and disallow any discussion by placing this in sell orders.while this is good for scammers it is encouraging extensive cross posting just to make each thread exponentially more difficult to read. the posting style that appears to be encouraged as the same as the rping subforum. that format is horrible and a good reason to keep rpers located away from the rest of the playerbase.
4/3/2010,"the type of sells in md are nothing like what happens in sell orders and need all the attention they can get. putting them in the sell orders forum where calling out a scammer or pointing out inconsistencies is not allowed makes no sense, neither does crossposting which is required to match the discussion with the sale so that scammers don't get a carte blanche."

4/3/2010,"ummm, all i see is one questionable thread by shar that was not moved to sell orders but instead the mod wanted the auction part to be done in the sell orders forum. if you read that thread by shar it sounds like a service thread (a ridiculously long thread for such a simple idea btw). service threads not involving shares/stocks go into the sell orders forums. discussing a service in md and then linking the auction to the sell orders forum is the correct way to do it. shar is fine with it and so am i.i do not see ipo/bond/securities offerings being thrown into sell orders forums at all. i do not see ipo/bond/securities threads being told to link to a separate thread specifically for selling shares. you guys are overreacting and looking rather foolish."
4/3/2010,"in light of the problem that 0.0 can be very hard to get into because of the bottlenecks that lead into it, i was looking for a way to circumvent this.and what i came up with would be a player-run station with the sole perpose of jumping players straight from empire into deep 0.0. these stations need resources ofcourse, not to mention the right charters because you're running it in high-sec.also, it could be a one-way trip, or a 2-way trip, depending on what you guys think of it.a couple of rules to keep it from becoming too powerfull:1. no jumping to systems that allready have been claimed, or introduce a way for souvereinty holders to block incoming extreme-range jumps.2. there is a natural cap on shipsize to use these jumps because the starting point is high-sec space where capital ships aren't allowed, exept for freighters.3. it might be beneficiary to introduce a timer after a jump has been made, ensuring that a ship can't jump again too quickly after having made a jump. (if you jump to 0.0, you might be stuck there for a week)thoughts anyone?"

4/3/2010,top that off that your making it too easy to get to 0.0 with that kind of crap going on as you implied.it's all to easy to use various jb networks across 0.0 to get from point a to point b provided you know the right people and have the right standings.in all honesty the difficulty in getting into 0.0 is total bull####.the real difficulty is just moving your @$$ into 0.0 space by sheer will power... not so much the action of doing so.the real challenge is diplomacy... established alliances aren't keen on letting you waltz in... however i've seen very large roaming gangs who fly right on by without as so much a challenge if they go for the right spots at the right time... such gangs are not always 0.0 alliances.that and just getting past lowsec and gatecamps that are set up to prevent such things.whs also makes it very easy to bypass such things.all in all you have no bloody idea what your talking about. i suggest you get some actual 0.0 experience before making assumptions that such things are needed because its very obvious you don't know enough to make such statements.also what was said about the avoidance of the lag and blobs has a lot to do with it but the bulk is just pure fear itself. eve is meant to be dangerous/challenge.. take the challenge out... you become a part of the problem... not the solution.
4/3/2010,"i think you are mistaken here. the goal is not to get more people to 0.0 by eliminating risks, never been and hopefully never be. may as well declare all galaxy 1.0 sec zone."
4/3/2010,"pretty much this. 0.0 is easy with a little experience, even without a lot of diplomacy and alliance ties. hell, figuring out how to run the gauntlet of the choke points and utilizing good scouting techniques to outsmart and outmaneuver hostiles is part of the fun."
4/3/2010,"interesting, on the one hand you have people saying 0.0 is right the way it is and it shouldn't be changed, let alone making it less risky to get in there. on the other hand you have people saying 0.0 sucks regardless of being able to get in there or not.i wonder if the first group is the same group who wants to get all the mission level 4 runners out of high-sec. to complete the irony, the second group would be said mission runners..."
4/3/2010,that's not irony... that's a sure sign of your ignorance.the groups you pointed out are 2 entirely different independent groups.the people in high sec won't leave due to the fear of crossing low sec let alone losing there iskies and pretty toys.the people who live in 0.0 who think high sec sucks ass... are tired of the list you just saw displayed earlier.course the main issue in 0.0 is just the matter of mechanics which are being refined yet still.so instead of trying to grasp shadows with tweezers to prop up your argument.. why don't you go live in 0.0 for a bit and maybe... just maybe you'll figure out why the things said here are so.this problem is only one of many...and not all of them are the same.they just happen to contradict each other... yes more people need to go to 0.0... but there's a few issues ccp needs to work out to make it a little easier to have 1000 vs 1000 fights. 8-)
4/3/2010,"you're saying roughly the same thing i just did: there are two camps of people who disagree about the nature of 0.0, but not all of the people who are interested in 0.0 are so because of 1000 vs. 1000 fights. not everyone wants to be part of the large alliances, and those people would benefit from the jump from empire space straight into deep 0.0. to the group of people saying 0.0 shouldn't be made less risky to get into i'd like to ask how they suffer from it being made easier to enter 0.0. doesn't it give you more turkies to shoot?"
4/3/2010,step 1: go get an ihub with ugprades.step 2: grab a freighter (as they won't fit in a jump freighter)step 3: go use this fangdangeled extremely long ranged deep space jump bridge to the nearest location.step 4: show up in blob fleet to escort freighter to destination via titan jump bridge and or allied jump bridge and or in fraction of the distance in slow boat but in range of jump radius of backup.step 5: ???step 6: profit!tldr - right now 0.0 alliances are forced to take freighters to carry items too large to put in any ship other than a freighter.... which means they can't use safe routes... and risk losing said ships either in whs or in lowsec/0.0 traversing.your idea would break that mechanic to hell and back.that's just the tip of the iceberg.your idea also nerfs low sec even more. (paging pirates!)ps: my math might be off but our alliance has had to resort to the above method to get our goods in... jf's are too small or not cost effective in this case.
4/3/2010,"...just...noits easy enough to get into 0.0 at the moment (approach gate -> click jump buttan). if you're not stupid, its not that difficult to base yourself out of a 0.0 npc region.besides, whats to stop someone from just camping the 0.0 end? defeats the purpose tbqfh"
4/3/2010,"you obviously haven't thought this through very well. a jump bridge from high-sec to deep null-sec essentially makes whatever null-sec system you're living in 100% safe. all you have to do is jump back to high-sec when hostiles show up and you're dandy. if your corp/alliance doesn't have a strong pvp front, then you don't belong there. making 0.0 more accessible isn't giving people the ability to get around gatecamps. gatecamps aren't what make 0.0 inaccessible. try again, carebear."
4/3/2010,if you want to pay $20 for ur training to take twice as long i'm all for it
4/3/2010,"at present, any time anyone enters or leaves jita, each client in system must be notified so that the local list can be updated. with as many as 1,500 people in jita, that's a minimum of a 3000 network packets transmitted every time there's a change in the local population. using wormhole-style local chat would significantly alleviate the network overhead.the population of jita is large enough that searching through the local chat for an individual isn't really feasible anyway, so there's little to be gained by using the current mechanism.a wormhole-style local seems like it would significantly improved performance. at ccp's discretion, i feel this would be in the best interests of everyone involved.perhaps this could also be considered for any system with a population over 500, which could help with lag concerns. if effect on 0.0 intelligence information is a concern, it could be limited to hisec systems.if indeed i'm incorrect and ccp has implemented some mechanism to address this (such as buffering entry/exit notifications), then this is of course moot."
4/3/2010,war-dec much ?
4/3/2010,the problem with jita is the people who refuse to go somewhere else.markets are created by pilots and perpetuated by pilots.all people need to do is make a market somewhere else.whine all you want... its the truth.
4/3/2010,"well, sure, we could whine about it, or go to a different trade hub......or we could make small, nondisruptive changes to let the market develop naturally? if people are avoiding jita because of lag, doesn't it make sense to fix the lag?forgive me, but i don't understand the connection.edit:oops, sorry. wrong character. this is the op."
4/3/2010,did you even read what i said?stop ignoring... start reading.the markets are player driven... you can't change the market it to make the players do what you want them to do.it starts with the players.that's like saying lets change the stock market to fix the economy... ain't gonna happen.if your going to change the system... make incentives to start markets elsewhere.perhaps increase the taxation of buying/selling dependent on traffic. forcing markets to roam/shift/change to low traffic areas where taxation is less.that's certainly better than what your proposing.
4/3/2010,"searching through local for an individual is infeasible, yes, but searching through local for red stars and green boxes (war target and address book icons) is not. this is a dumb idea. no thank you."
4/3/2010,"not a glitch, nor new. one of ammo types you have have been already loaded previously. so in order to load same type again you are supposed to use ""reload"" option. as a consequence, it not appears on drop down list itself.to make that logic more clear, try loading with more than 2 types in cargo."
4/3/2010,the only glitch i'm aware of is when you group laser cannons together and use faction ammo/tech 2 ammo in them.the ammo degrades at different rates... and when one shatters... it will not reload the gun until you completely unload all guns and then reload all guns.which is hazardous as certain ammo types do things like suck your shields dry.that and you get humorous error messages when attempting to work around it.apparently there are many out there who never see this as a problem or know of it.
4/3/2010,"was discussed at the last meeting. turns out csm 2 already proposed something similar and its 'on the backlog', but thanks for your support any way."
4/3/2010,an overhaul would be nice but this is a good simple fix that could be added to the shortcuts or even an alteration of the engage enemy. simple and something the poor miners could know and love. the downside would be that this woujld make macromining simpler.m
4/3/2010,"in general one of the things i do not agree with are most changes that involve hp increases, and having sov markers which have a lot of hp in the first place. it increase the barrier to entry for combat. huge blobs are directly tied to this- if you have below a certain number of people, no matter how terrible your enemy is at deterring you, simply hitting the structures is going to take hours. even if you speed up the time with dreads, the simple fact that you risk so many assets necessitates having more people just to defend yourself from opportunistic attackers. those ""small gang objective"" station services and outside-the-pos-modules that were implemented a couple of years ago are a joke if you think of it in terms of that purpose. the hp is simply way too high.small gang pvp issues are tied with a lot of other issues of 0.0. one is the fact that vast amounts of it are empty. this is mostly because people do not have much reason to be there, but it's also because people find it prohibitively difficult to get there in the first place. i think a rather simple issue to move in the right direction is the addition of many more entries to 0.0, and ensure that all systems have at least a certain number of belts, with a certain quality of npcs and ore. another is making 0.0 more financially attractive. that is going to be difficult to change, because so much of the playerbase is simply not willing to risk it in 0.0 under any circumstance, it becomes an issue of possibly messing with subscription numbers. perhaps a highsec lv4 nerf is too upsetting to a large segment of the population, but a big 0.0 belt ratting/missioning boost might be acceptable. both of these things we talked about during the last csm meeting but nothing came of it. i plan to keep pushing issues such as this, especially in light of the big loot changes they just announced.another issue is that of either isk farmers or just people who use tools to alert them when someone comes into local. you can ban the isk farmers, but for people who simply use these automated tools, it's hard to find a solution that does not also make life unlivable for regular 0.0 ratters. i also think it's a terrible idea to straight up implement anti-cheat programs. one of the best things about eve is that it doesn't use crap like that."
4/3/2010,ahhh... who could have predicted this?
4/3/2010,"mazz: you complain that sov structures have too much hp and force blob warfare. do you believe that there should be game mechanics designed to encourage massive fights at least sometimes, and if so, what should they be? that's a completely unfair assessment of what happened. she was an equal-opportunity vote-seller, from all i saw - the ""one plex for one issue"" deal was open to everybody, not just <-10.0> folks. and she managed the true measure of an honest politician, and stayed bought."
4/3/2010,"may gief vote because istr you making a good proposal about making macro-haulers worth ganking.what happened to that proposal, by the by?"
4/3/2010,"it wasnt even brought up in iceland, i think because some csm guy decided to roll it into another larger issue (like ""consolidated mission changes"" or whatever). it's one of the things i plan to re-push because i like that idea a lot too! not all the participants really enjoy 1000 person fights. i know it's big numbers that ccp can wave their **** about later, but to the actual people in it, they're sitting in craptons of lag, probably playing flash games in the other window. losing ships for wholly unsatisfying reasons. they still do it just because if they don't, they will lose some big valuable thing. it's a fear-based drive, not a fun-based drive to go out and do this sort of thing. eventually one side or the other gets burned out and loses the alliance war- that is because it's work, not play! ccp also has to spend a lot of money to buy new hardware and programming time to solve problems caused by this. i'd like to see big alliance warfare be more based on a consistent presence and ability to outsmart, rather than outnumber the enemy. i think big fights will end up naturally occurring by accident, but just in general i think the node-breaking sorts of fights are a negative aspect of the game. lag becomes too much of a deciding factor in who wins. also the plex thing was a joke/troll :d i didnt really have enough time left in my term then to really do much with that. i think if i kept at that during my term other csm's would start undercutting me."
4/3/2010,"weren't you the ""thanks for my free trip to iceland"" girl that came stumbling onto the podium hung-over halfway through the fanfest session you were supposed to attend to qualify for your free ticket?can you list your contributions to csm3, besides not showing up on meetings?"
4/3/2010,"dont you keep up with the csm meetings and who raised what issueif you actually look at the numbers ive raised as many issues as the other csms have, your premise that i dont do anything starts to look pretty sillyalso that meeting wasn't to qualify for anything. nobody even asked any interesting questions and the ccp people didnt care that i was late but i remember that, i was pretty sick hahai heard you were running for csm too, we could run smear campaigns against each other. the internet males would go wild to see two girls fighting and we would probably both win."
4/3/2010,"of course i'm going to run. not that i am in any way supporting this stupid lifting of the term limit as i'm still extremely sceptical as it only encourages free-trip-to-iceland-slackers to keep seats occupied.people that vote for me know what they get:* someone that treats the trips to iceland as work, not a free vacation* someone that brings a notepad to fanfest to write down player concerns, remains sober, and doesn't hide in the pub all day* 95%+ csm meeting attendence* a real csm issue track record with issues such as the skill queue, fw fixes, suicide ganking, drone bugs/implants/mods, overview settings im/exporting, and a whole lot more"
4/3/2010,"i also brought a notebook too, but i mostly drew dinosaurs in it. i actually have a pretty good record for attendance too, actually only missing one meeting without prior notification(at fanfest, haha). and as for my proven track record, my term limits issue was one of the first major changes proposed by the csm implemented into the game. i think that's pretty impressive! anyways i posted a pretty big list in the op of stuff that made it into the game. it's pretty hard to argue against that.and i don't think sober is a major selling point to the eve fanbase! probably the most likely reason is because many player concerns are voiced at pubs. in fact part of my platform is that i promise to get very drunk! and possibly wild!"
4/3/2010,"so you messing up the term limits is your biggest accomplishment? it's an entirely selfish issue and serves no purpose for the eve players, in fact, had an overwhelming negative player feedback.my question still stands, how many things on that list have been raised by you, and not someone else or some previous csm?"
4/3/2010,"hm, tl;dr but what my small eyes and brain picked up on was adoption.this is a serious decision which should not be taken lightly as young ferrets are a lively bunch.best of luck with your little ferret!"
4/3/2010,"what fantastic logic you have there. seriously, i have not enough intellect to counter such powerfull arguments. you must be a genius, seriously.p.s. ferrets rule!"
4/3/2010,"thank you, few real people see us ferrets as real pod pilots.the small claws, short sight and constant compulsion to bite things make pod piloting tricky. so far i have succeeded. happy to have you as my candidate to csm!(edit, small paws make typing hard)"
4/4/2010,even an idustriallist like me can see this need support
4/4/2010,trained rockets v years ago....would be kinda cool to actually fire them...lol.
4/4/2010,great ideai hate it when my ogres chase a frig and my hobs try to kill a bs
4/4/2010,/sign
4/4/2010,"i support the idea partially.first of all i don't understand why to experiment this on the live server and why just with one faction, it's unfair and discriminatory.yet i decided to give it a try, just to see how much faction standing you get out of it.the mission i got offered was about the destruction of some hulks in caldari space and it came after i completed 16 level 2 missions. (just as a reminder, each level has a separete counter, so if you do 10 level 2s and 6 level 1s you ain't getting offered a storyline). i had to face two spawns, maybe more but i can't tell since i didn't clear the second. the first spawn had 3 cruiser and 3 frigates, the second... something around that. the mission was over when i blew up one of the two npc hulks i had there.with this piece of cake (done in a ishkur) i went from 2.87 gallente standing to 3.11. if you have two accounts and you can use a pod to scout the way i find it defiantely worth it (i had to travel 5 jumps).the idea imho should be fixed. first of all remove the 35+ jumps missions cause they are clearly a bug; if you are too far from fw territory keep the low sec idea but change enemy, a pirate faction perhaps.most important of all, allow pilots to chose between two storylines: one of these and a carebear one. forcing an industrialist to take over this kind of challenge is pointless cause he probably wants to raise his standings for r&d or refining purposes. (i say force on purpose, because it's true, no1 is sitting behind you with a gun on your head asking you to accept it, but if your goal is to raise your faction standing your only other option is to change faction)."
4/4/2010,your forgeting with the scramber doing this comes with the overview being available while docked...that said. i wont support i personally want more than 1 exit pr station... but that's just me. and will prolly never happen
4/4/2010,"i think the bonus to medium hybrid turrets bonus should be changed to a 7.5% bonus to drone mwd speed per level . in pvp or pve, no one fits medium hybrid guns on the ishtar because fitting utility, autos or smaller guns is simply much more effective.gallente deserve a ship that is a 100% drone boat, including all bonuses to drones.edit: specified it applies to the drone mwd speed, not orbit."
4/4/2010,i lub drones!
4/4/2010,"supported.sound idea, i would like to hear what the devs have to say about his."
4/4/2010,"i like the basic idea, but is there not a risk that this bonus would interfere with tracking?"
4/4/2010,"5% to speed and tracking bonus then? not sure, might be over the top."
4/4/2010,imho tracking bonus would make it a bit overpowered with sentries.
4/4/2010,i feel the same way. gonna stick with the original 7.5% to drone speed per level.thoughts?
4/4/2010,"i entirely agree, the current bonus is useless, the ishtar has no cpu/grid to fit those guns anyway."
4/4/2010,supported
4/4/2010,the lp store window is terrible and needs a lot of fixing but that would be a great start.
4/4/2010,"i supported matting's thread regarding this same topic, and therefore support this one too."
4/4/2010,"frankly it's getting silly.the rules are becoming more and more draconian every time they're revised, to the point now where you can't even discuss other games you enjoy on the our of pod forums that are designed for chat about subjects outside of eve.i can appreciate rules against political and religious discussion, but frankly the recent changes to stop people talking about various perfectly valid subjects are ridiculous, and the moderation team are behaving completely unfairly and with extremely heavy hands.it's causing the end of a lot of valid and interesting out of pod discussions, and making the forum look a total mess with all the pointlessly locked threads.if anything i'd like the csm to take a look at the community team's moderation practices, and the rules for posting on the forums with a view to rolling them back to the point where people can have perfectly reasonable, civil and valid discussions about the things they enjoy out of game without being moderated to hell and back."

4/4/2010,"doubt ccp will let the csm touch moderation policy, but who knows."
4/4/2010,supported.something i don't understand is why they didn't just delete rule #5 in oope instead of editing it. i mean the original purpose of oope #5 was to overwrite general #17 in that section. now both of them say the same thing making #5 redundant.

4/4/2010,"supported. ccp's community manager is doing a very poor job. this kind of moderation, causes unneeded frustration in the playerbase and alienates the community from the developers and their company."

4/4/2010,"i can see verone's point, and the point of ccp's ""rules"".oddly, i support both...however i do not support the method that ccp appears to be taking with regards to communicating their grand vision for the forums (no, this is not sarcastic, but a kudos to holding a business goal in mind).with this said, i lend my support to verone. good post"
4/4/2010,"supported. the eve playerbase is as diverse as you can find, but the one thing that we all have in common is that we are all gamers, and thus we enjoy talking and sharing experiences and opinions about videogames. these new rules and/or the way they are being enforced are not only preposterous, but go against the very core of why we are here after all."
4/4/2010,"i support this. i understand that there are times when threads need to be locked for possible legal issues like when everyone is bashing another game or games company, but when there is a valid discussion about a game or games they should be left open.edit: forgot to click the thumbs up thingey"

4/4/2010,"agreed, though i suspect the current policies are a product of the dreaded legal department. so fire the legal department?"
4/4/2010,"supported.i can understand how ccp perhaps sees the eve forums as a part of eve, where only eve is relevant. the current situation however, is ridiculous. this xenophobia, in the end, can only lead to more people leaving the game because they feel stifled. heavy moderation does not lead to a healthy community, it leads to a dead one.i'd also like to ask people posting in this thread to stop the comparisons with national socialism. it's not constructive, and you're invoking godwin's law."
4/4/2010,totally supported. the fact that i've seen people willing to quit eve altogether due to ridiculous forum moderation (nothing to actually do with the game) should be more than enough of a reason to end the tyrannical censorship.
4/4/2010,support!!

4/4/2010,my proposal is to improve the jumpbridges. currently every jumpbridge has a fixed range. my proposal is to make the range variable. lets say somewhere between 0 and 30 lightyears. this will come with a new fuel formula that is based on the range of the bridge. this saves alot of jb posses/ fuel efforts and other time consuming efforts. discuss!
4/4/2010,no. jumpbridges do not need a boost.

4/4/2010,"yup, that rule was the straw that broke the camel's back. take it off."
4/4/2010,"the fact that the grandfather clause is being invoked in this current surge of oope censorship shows that it is not really an act to prevent litigation from other developers. if it was they would just go ahead, exert their right to censor their forums, and lock all threads involving other games.the fact that oope is still in existence shows that it is not really an issue of ccp worrying about losing our log in time. if it was all threads not relating to eve would be a threat, thus justifying the closer of oope.therefore, this is just looking like a power trip by some forum mods.slade"
4/4/2010,"supporting this one as well.it should be pointed out that until recently, mentions of other games in forum sections other than oope were also not modded. often, other games are used as a point of comparison in discussions about eve. these mentionings are now also being modded, while they are, in fact, about eve."

4/4/2010,"the devblog, the circle of life stated: i propose that this loot table review is used as an opportunity to fix the issue of a chronic shortage of low level criminal tags and the over abundance of high level tags. you only have to look at the market where copper and bronze tags of all criminal factions sell for millions and are beyond the reach of newbies they but higher level criminal tags sell for a few (tens) thousand isk. getting tags for data center agents is a standing joke, (pun intended)."
4/4/2010,i dont think the tags are going to be the same. my guess is that they invent new criminal tags.
4/4/2010,"the reason for this 'chronic shortage' is two-fold.first, people could run level 1s and get the occasional copper/bronze tag drop, or they could run level 4s and make a ton more money, getting the occasional electrum or other tag drops. this will continue to be a problem in light of issue number 2.second, most tags are used for a 'quick boost' to standings for people with low standings to the chosen faction. since low standings mean you need the lower-level tags, those are in higher demand. once your standings get higher, the boost is minimized, meaning that few others will bother with the tag missions.there is a bottleneck apparent in the system, and that's pretty much working as it should. modifying any loot table will cause massive repercussions in the market, and i'm quite sure ccp did their homework for this. we'll have to see how things progress once tyrannis comes out.not supported."

4/4/2010,"see this is not a valid argument to make, just because you raise something doesn't mean you deserve all sorts of glory for it. i know you are taking credit for big stuff like the skill queue, but it's been talked about since ages ago and if it wasn't you that raised the issue, someone else would have done it. that's the whole point of gauging player interest, you raise the issues that are popular and/or improve the game. you don't deserve the credit or the glory for raising something. so i'm not going to accept that simply raising an issue is actually an accomplishment. if they were your original idea that ended up catching on and getting implemented, then maybe we can talk. the real work that you do, and what you really contribute as a csm member is arguing to ccp that the player's ideas are actually valid. framing it in such a way that they are most likely to implement it, and picking your fights- picking issues that are most likely to make it and not wasting your time on things that won't. i remember the ""guns automatically reloading"" issue ended up surprisingly controversial in iceland because some dev guy didn't think it was a good idea. but we beat them down and they implemented it. stuff like that isn't something you can easily credit to any one person, because you are often arguing for the merit of ""other people's"" ideas. the real victory with the skill queue was not raising it but by beating down ccp until they capitulatedhere's a list of issues that i raised though! i might as well put it here while we're on the subject. there were other issues too but they got rolled into consolidated issue threads like ""ui improvements"" and such. i often tried to focus on original ideas rather than popular ones- knowing full well that the top handful of issues in the assembly hall are going to get picked by somebody anyways.stuff about character transfers and problems caused by it (maz)make guns continue firing at previous target after reload (maz)container idea (maz)client modification (maz)corp interface overhaul (dv + maz)account security proposal (maz)semi permanently show pilots name in space (maz)larger hud bracket for caps and supercaps (maz)add character transfer and portrait change tokens just like plex (maz)csm term limits (maz)fix plex keys (maz)add login history in your account managment (maz)scan timer (dv & mazz)csm information release (mazz)character lock no resale possible (mazz)"
4/4/2010,"that's exactly what happened though, the first time the skill queue was brought up (was csm issue #1 for a reason), ccp said ""nah, we don't want that, we want players to log in and play the game!""the part where i contributed was listening to all of ccps arguments why they wouldn't want it, and re-raising the issue the next term, along with a list of why their arguments and assumptions are not valid (such as players not picking skills they want to train, but training skills that end at a conventient time, and players never going to play at 4 in the morning just because their skill ended)okay, seems you're good for something after all sorry, your iceland appearance really made me go ""wtf, and this is a csm?"", and the thanks-for-my-free-trip thingie really stuck. apparantly csm3 and 4 have been a lot more productive than 1 and 2 which had their fair bunch of meetings being cancelled due to slackers not showing up *cough pattern clarc and the like cough*.erik sent me a text message because neither the csm nor ccp had a clue how a certain fw mechanic worked. that's why the bloody text message was read aloud, in the first place, lol. cause a question was asked which no-one in the room knew the answer to.and the 'puppet' thing is funny too. we're all take care representatives who represent the players, not someone's personal agenda. none of the issues i raised benefitted me directly in any way. there was a medal issue that did, and i immediately informed the csm and ccp that i had a personal interest in that, and that issue didn't get raised anyway.that's why the selfish ""i want infinite csm terms!"" issue should never have been passed."
4/4/2010,"what can i say. i like to make people cry over nothing. my memory is fuzzy but i think the csm3 was never unable to reach a quorum every meeting, even if a bit late. so that makes it the best csm so far in attendance right? i think as a group we really worked together well actually. every single member pulled their weight, even larkonis did before he got kicked(free larkonis), and issler did despite having a half term. i found every single member also to be very agreeable in general. every member deserves some credit for each issue that was raised and put into the game."
4/4/2010,"did you raise some issues? sure.the list you gave above all your ideas that was never brought up before by another csm or an eve player on the forums? no.face is mazziliu, your legacy during your term as a csm member was a half hearted attempt to be a person for the eve community, and the other half trolling the eve community. perhaps if you had taken the csm position more seriously instead of treating it like a side show.you will forever be known as the former csm member who was voted in based on having boobs and throwing it in the face of eve players that you never took your job seriously, with your drunken show at fan fest with the statement:""thanks for the free trip to fan fest."""

(or using the more snide eve:ism of ""we didn't want those players anyway"")."
4/5/2010,"no it should not. the idea that you will have ships which require a blob to kill them is just stupid.it's tell-tale that many gallente ships (hi brutix) right now are better shieldfit, since shield fit meshes better with large dps and better speed for getting in your optimal range in the first place, both things which gallente need.removing repair bonuses in favour of something which is weapon related is the best way to deal with everything but possibly the battleships.for instance, a myrmidon with 125m3, -1 turret slot, removed repair bonus in favour of +25m3 dronebay per level would be just perfect; a ganky (if you fit it like that) full-blooded droneboat.brutix with falloff bonus to enable it to better project its dps in scram range? sounds way more useful then repair bonus on a ship which is supposed to be a gankboat but has so limited lowslots (and fitting which imo needs love anyway).other then that, yes, gallente need a buff, most of their ships (and the guns) now are considerably sub-par really."
4/5/2010,"you are confusing ""doesn't do what i want"" with ""doesn't do what it should"". case in point: the brutix and myrmidon. both very good ships(though the brutix does suffer from ""tieroneitis""). they do not need boosts to be longer range, or have more longevity(seriously, -1 turret for 50 cubes of bandwidth? ridiculous). racial balance in eve is not and has never been ""every race should do everything"" but rather ""every race should have a thing that it does well at"". rather than examining what gallente do well and where the issues lie, these threads have devolved into foolish requests for more dps and range without understanding what those things really mean and how that changes the game. (the lack of respect for ehp in the rail thread is hilarious for instance)your requests not only ignore these aspects of balance in favor of utterly ridiculous general buffs, but ignore even the basic mechanics of how bonuses are calculated (for instance, a 10% bonus to sensor dampeners is entirely overpowered), ignore racial paradigms regarding tanking(and how this can be seen as a general problem rather than anything gallente specific), flat out mis-represent the strength of ships, and take singular issues and apply them to a gallente framework.is the hyperion a bad ship? no. its actually quite good at what it does, especially compared to the minmitar, amarr, and caldari equivalents. is there instead a problem with the strength of torpedo's? good lord, very likely. is there a problem with the speed penalty on armor rigs(probably).are these gallente issues? only so much as they affect gallente ships disproportionately. does this mean that boosting gallente is the way to fix these problems? unlikely.now, this does not mean there are not problems with gallente. the more solo-oriented ships are the more versatile they need to be (see; the tempest, hurricane, rupture). but if they do not have that versatility they need to have secondary characteristics enough to make them have more ability the fewer players are on the field. which is to say that they need to lock faster, be faster, and have and have a smaller signature radius. very few of the gallente ships have this advantage over their more specialized compatriots. this reduces their effectiveness."
4/5/2010,"actually increasing dps [of blasters] looks like less painful. increasing optimal makes them look-alike of lasers, increasing falloff makes them similar to ac. very close range is gallente ""racial paradigm"". but after 90% web nerf it is much more difficult to approach at optimal faster. gallente ships are not the fastest in the game. and armor tanking does not add agility and speed. gallente should use mwd to reach optimal. during approach they receive damage. they need to compensate received damage when reach long range target. for example mega pulse do 85% damage of blaster damage at 300% range of blaster range (comparing scorch vs null it is 85% damage at 400% range). rails is separate issue.how to buff gallente without braking ""gallente paradigm"" less painful p.s. gallente drones (racial advantage) - some times good only in eft. they are destroyable and can be slower then target."
4/5/2010,"i think that when i first started to support this thread i had a sad on with blasters.now that i've calmed down and thought about it alot i can more clearly see better solutions to the problems gallente face1) blasters. we can't hide from this. blasters need an improvement in damage output. but not tracking.2) speed. gallente ships are predominantly armour tanked ships. armour makes you slow. i think an increase of gallente ships base speed but a decrease in their agility can fix this. give them good straight line speed but very large turning circles. this means you can charge into range but can easily be out manouvered by some clever piloting.3) active tanking. i think active tanking needs a boost across the board. i also think that there is a massive disparity between an active tank bonus vs a resist bonus. resist bonused ships can use their bonus effectivly as an active tank as good as an active tanked ship. it also helps towards buffer tanks and helps out rr'ing. the active tank bonus doesn't carry like the resist bonus does. so like proposed elsewhere, make the active tank bonus x% (i like the figure 9% instead of 7.5%) per level to ammount repaired and remote repair recieved4) rsd's could use a very minor buff5) gallente gang links are information warfare links. i mean c'mon! this is not the gallente way. a new warfare link and skill set needs to be introduced. i suggest the ""assault warfare"" set. the skill and gang links would effect weapon performance. needs to be heavily looked into though. information warfare would not be lost. there needs to be a new ship class. special ops command. used in cov ops fleets to boost ewar etc.just throwing my ideas out there."
4/5/2010,"you've misread the problem. the problem has never been application of damage(for instance, mf does not do 85% of the damage that am does, it does less. raw =/= real) but always getting to the point where it can happen/applying it in gangs that are not small. the second part of that we have agreed is not an issue as it ought to be a problem with blasters. the first part is not fixed by adding dps.for instance, many of the typical ""stealth nerfs"" that have supposedly hurt gallente have actually boosted them. many people claim that rigs and hp boosts have hurt gallente. this is patently the opposite (except with regards to the speed penalty on armor rigs). as hit points increase, the time it takes to close distances is decreased relative to the time of the entire fight. this means that as hit points are increased, the strength of longer ranged weapons is reduced. as repping strength is increased, the strength of active repair is increased, fight time is increased, and the value of extra damage increases(e.g. 1000 dps against a 900 dps tank is 100 dps real, 1100 dps is 200 dps real, +10% dmg actual = +100% dmg real). gallente not only have the hardest active remote repair tanks(on ships that can actually do damage) but also the most dps up close where those can be expected to work. both rigs and overloading have increased tanks further than damage and the damage that is increased is increased more against those harder tanks by blasters more than any other weapon system. and again, as fight time is increased, the liklihood that they devolve into shorter ranges is increased.so why are gallente so bad? part of it has been a shift towards larger combats. the rest of it is ignorance of roles besides damage dealing, how to tank efficiently in small engagements and how to pilot ships. examine what the ships do objectively. the dominix is one of, if not the best rr bs in the game. the megathron is a decent sniper(train rokhs, they're much better, but eh, the training time here isn't much) and the hyperion is beast in either plate/rep or dual rep mode. the thorax is the second best combat cruiser the the brutix and myrmidon are just peachy(brutix suffers from ""tieroneitis"" though). the deimos isn't very good because the brutix is better, the ishtar is a wonderful little machine for fast gangs. the arazu is an great member of any fast gang (hey, oh long scrambler) as is the lachesis if you can deal without the cloak. the frigates aren't to great, but no frigates are great compared to the rifter and vigil. the taranis is very good and the ares is one of the best tackle inties (malediction would hold this if it had a lock range that extended beyond its own nose...i mean, when it really gets down to it, the complaints are that the deimos(and thorax imo) doesn't do what it should well enough, the brutix was designed to compete with the prophecy and cyclone and the hyperion was introduced as the age of the solo blaterboat was waning and people simply haven't caught on to what it does (and that torp boost)."
4/5/2010,"aha, which massively helps vs cloaked ships, and so on and on.besides, it really means undocking is a complete gamble as soon as there is someone else docked in station with you. yay! you can now station camp from within if you want.what fun gameplay.plus with the awesome part how stations don't really decide to dock you right away all the time, but sometimes decide to randomly wait for a few seconds, really awesome."

4/5/2010,"supported, definitely.can the csm also suggest that the moderator who seems to be the main instigator of this be given a new career path? i mean, -another- new career path. since we're talking about the new moderator."

4/5/2010,give shadow a promotion.give adida an extended vacation.
4/5/2010,supported. the rampant locking has ccp looking paranoid or like it has some massive inferiority complex.
4/5/2010,3 pages and there's been only one post that didn't support (and i think because they had already supported).does that not give some sort of an indication that something is very wrong?
4/5/2010,"seriously, the ccp kingpin behind all of this should have at least minimally done a short blog on new implementation of moderation rules, before the order gets carried out by the usual serfs. it is a reasonable expectation since the eve community plays the part of a stakeholder for this game (and anything that revolves around it, forum inclusive.) you're (i.e. ccp) basically antagonizing the community with ""please file a petition"" when it's fairly clear there are several inconsistencies that need to be addressed with the rules.hiding behind walls/serfs won't help make things better."

4/5/2010,"[note on editing] i intend to update this post regularly so people can see key points without reading pages and pages of debate. if i miss something that should be here please contact me in game.by voting for this proposal you are endorsing the implementation of a new mechanic intended to facilitate the creation of safe spots that are in locations that would not be otherwise accessible. that is, not between celestial objects and out of range of directional scanners.when considering weather or not to support this proposal you should take into account that ccp game designers will have the final say on how and if this feature is implemented. if you trust ccp then you should know that this feature won't break the game and will probably be implemented in a fair and balanced way. that, rebalanced or removed. thus when arguing against this proposal your argument should be against the entire idea and not some superficial, insignificant, alterable or balancable component of it. (woo i made up a word!)***some reasons for:****there have been several methods of creating these kinds of safe spots in the past and there are many such bookmarks of these in existence. these methods have over time been removed from the game as they were considered exploits. with the coming of some recent patch one of the two renaming ways has been removed and the other currently no longer works on singularity. thus an unfair advantage is created for those that hold deep safe bookmarks. if a new method of creating them is not implemented then currently existing bookmarks should be removed (i will link a counterproposal outlining a fair method for removing them which you should support if you do not support this proposal).*these safe spots allow for some interesting, engaging tactics in eve and the removal of this capability would be removing an element of the sandbox; putting limits on what can be done in said sandbox.*if anyone were able to create such safe spots then there would be no need to remove currently existing ones.*maybe another use for training anchoring to v :p***some reasons against and rebuttal against these reasons:****nothing yet.***some proposals for balancing this mechanic:****only works on black ops ships. (make them more useful!)*limit the distance from a given celestial object that it is possible to get to in order to create one of these bm (within scan range of deep space probes)*make the creation of these spots take a significant amount of time (very low warp speed, anchored module like cargo can required)*make the creator these spots vulnerable for a given amount of time (long warm up or cool down time and/or forced immobility for whatever module is used)*make the process for creating these safe spots complex and intensive (not dissimilar the current scanning system, perhaps have it be a probe or module that you muct launch and it goes to a random location in space and you must scan it down and hope its a good spot)*make creating these spots require multiple pilots online (teamwork)*have a high skill requirement for the module or item required to create these safe spots. (finally another use for anchoring v!)"
4/5/2010,"supporting my own proposal, if you don't like it you should support: remove bookmarks of deep safe spots"
4/5/2010,"supported.how about allowing players to create them in a way similar to how they are made currently?give covert-ops frigates a module that allows them to drop out of warp instantly when activated.use normal flight physics to declerate the ship after dropping from warp.after activation the warp drive could require ""cool down"" time to prevent warping for a period. this owuld preserve the current time sink involving in logging off, on, and waiting for emergency warps to complete. this could also be implemented by requirring the module to be reloaded or repaired after each activation."
4/5/2010,personally the mechanic i would suggest is a module that when activated drains your cap to 0 and puts you into warp in the direction your facing for whatever distance your cap could support. if necessary there could be a pre-warp delay during which you are vulnerable. perhaps the same amount of time as the warp itself would take.
4/5/2010,"what about killing two birds with one stone? a module that only fits on black ops ship that allows the ship to warp to a non-bookmarkable would give the balck ops more strategic importance and would keep deep safe spots from being overused or exploitededit: deputy dope's idea, but for black ops ships"
4/5/2010,"by voting for this proposal you are endorsing the removal of any bookmarks that are not <15au from any celestial object within the confines of all celestial objects in a system.this proposal is a counterproposal to the impliementation of a feature allowing any pilot to create safe spots that do not fall within the aforementioned rules.if this were to take place i think bookmarks to deep safe spots which have something within 1000km (can, ship, drone and such) should be excluded. and should automatically be deleted once something is not on that grid.if you are against this proposal you should vote for this other proposal: implement a mechanic to allow creation of deep safe spots"
4/5/2010,like it
4/5/2010,yes please
4/5/2010,"i had a thought the other day, that skillbooks, after a certain skill is trained, another copy of the book can be bought and used as an implant. the book would affect the skill only bonuswise. in other words, it only gives the percentage bonuses, and would not cause a certain skill to be actually complete, and no skillpoints would be earned using the book as such. the book, once implanted, would give a +1 to that skill. for example, if i had advanced weapon upgrades 4, but wanted the extra bonus 5 provides without skilltraining it, i could increase it to 5 by buying another copy of the book and 'implanting' it. however, this only would give up to the maximum, so if a skill is already maxed, i couldn't implant the book and raise it to 6. it also cannot be used to obtain access to other tiers of skills via this method. i propose maybe allotting books to appropriate implant slots, or adding maybe 1-2 more slots specifically for books. i'm pretty sure this would not be overpowered, and it would merely give another dimension to skillbooks that are usually only used once on a character and never bought again."
4/5/2010,as you have noticed it ... for many skill we already have matching hardwirings. you just need to buy them. just saying ...
4/5/2010,so you just want to get a lvl 5 without having to wait for it.no. eve's skill system is already user friendly enough. if you don't want to grind long skill trains are the price.
4/5/2010,"no, not exactly. it wouldn't open up any new tiers of skilltraining, just pretty much a 'top off' of one or two of your skills. many implants do this, so those books could be ommitted, as well as certain other skills as deemed necessary. right now its just an open idea of mine, not exactly refined."
4/5/2010,"congrats. now everyone has hac 5, cs 5, etc."
4/5/2010,"the skillbook would still need to be bought again (60m or so), and if it was ever removed, it would be destroyed. and if only 1 or 2 were allowed at a time, this would be decently balanced. however, if its not, ship skillbooks do not have to be added as a possibility to be implants. if this idea was ever seriously looked at, the devs would need to determine what is op and what is not."
4/5/2010,"yes, but people pay far more for a 5% hardwiring that does less - if you arent really into drones, or just young, paying 500k for level 5 drone int is nothing.. even 'basic' skills can be huge if you just plug in the skill - core capacitor skills can save you 3 weeks, and getting them to level 5 is virtually useless in terms of pre-reqs."
4/5/2010,"that's why you'd only be allowed 1 or 2 slots. it would only eliminate a few weeks of training at the most. also, the prices would probably rebalance if this happened. i.e. certain normal implants might drop in price, and some books might be seeded/traded at higher prices."
4/5/2010,"doubtful. even with 2-3 slots, drone int 5, frigate 5 are around 30 days combined training - for a noob who just picked up, say, a faction frig with 20% damage/level and drones.. thats a good deal of extra damage."
4/5/2010,lets not forget cybernetics 5 could be required to utilize this. effectively keeps newer players from getting this too early.
4/5/2010,cybernetics 5 is a small price to pay to have many other skills at 5 as you wish..
4/5/2010,they're saying that with the thermodynamics skill too. being able to train that quickly as a new player adds a good advantage. but its still no more than what the next player can achieve.
4/5/2010,"yes, but thermodynamics used to require skills to 5. now it doesnt how long until your proposal becomes cybernetics 4?"
4/5/2010,then this thread belongs in features and ideas discussion.not supported.
4/5/2010,pointless idea... training is what eve is all about.
4/5/2010,"i will say here what i said in the other thread:censorship is a slippery slope. first it will be discussion about other games... next it might be discussion about this game. the question is, where does it stop?supported."
4/5/2010,rule 17 is dumb
4/5/2010,"this rule change shows a pathetic level of insecurity. it's not like oope was getting spammed with advertithreads for other games.ccp wont be winning ""community of the year"" awards in future with decisions like this."
4/5/2010,"sounds more like something china would do, actually. google wouldn't stand for it and neither will i. supported."
4/5/2010,oope as a whole violates rule #17.so eighter the dedicated oope rules are useless.or the mods can change them anytime they like and are just being ****s.

4/5/2010,"as mentioned in one of the other support threads, the problem with #17 (and specifically with ccp adida's interpretation of it) is that it prohibits us from discussing aspects of eve as well, which is patently silly on an eve forum."
4/5/2010,do it.
4/5/2010,edited to tick support checkbox.i would support this on my normal forum posting character (you all know who) but she got banned precicely for objecting to this issue; so i'm forced to support this on an alt. the lack of consistency or courtesy from ccp moderators is very disappointing. ccp adida should certainly consider a change of attitude.

4/5/2010,"i support, but quite frankly, their only route they are allowing is ""file a petition"", and we all know you can't have transparency and discussion on a petition, when just to have that petition seen will take weeks."

4/5/2010,"the current bounty mechanics don't really work as intended, because anyone who gets a bounty of significant value, will jumpclone to an empty pod, have a corp-mate pop him, and collect that bounty. this way, your attempt to frustrate criminal piracy in fact goes towards funding it, and as a result, bounties are generally reduced to the lol factor, or a small bounty serves as a warning to others.my proposal: 1. remove the public bounty display. continue to show that there is a bounty on a player, but not how much.2. introduce new low-sec bounty hunter agents. (or incarna agents) you would need a positive sec status to be able to use them, such as +5. these agents would give out kill missions, requiring you to find and kill (pod) a specific person, within a time limit.3. mission rewards would be composed primarily of the bounty on that player, plus possibly a multiplier time bonus or based on concord standings or something.4. the missions could be given out via a public board (available through the agent, so only to those who can do the missions of course) this gives better choice, but is still open to some abuse. alternatively it could be random, based on recent or nearby crimes, or some other automatic ""assignment"" system. this would be less open to abuse, but could have other advantages/disadvantages depending on the mechanic used."
4/5/2010,supporting my own idea!
4/5/2010,supporting the proposal for more meaningful information.
4/5/2010,"if there's one thing that bugs me about the ships in eve, it's how rigidly and inflexibly they're designed. while it makes sense that the different races' ships would be constructed along similar broad guidelines, i think these are far too strictly applied, to the extent that there is very little real variety in ships and certain races just get plain screwed (which buggers up anyone who doesn't want to invest large amounts of time in cross-race training). what i think we need is for the empires to put a bit of effort into creating some new ships by thinking outside the box a bit.so firstly, the races' ship attributes as they stand:caldari:*dedicated missile race, also use some hybrids but ships optimized for railguns rather than blasters.*absolutely suck with drones.*racial ewar is ecm, hands down the best.*only other ewar they get is target painter bonus on golem.*ships have most mid slots, least low slots.*universally slowest ships.*universally weakest armour and hull.*universally best shields.amarr:*laser race. handful of missile ships, mostly underpowered.*average drone space with a small handful of droneboats.*racial ewar is tracking disruptor, generally the weakest.*get nos/neut bonuses. also web velocity bonus on paladin.*ships have least mid slots, most low slots.*ships tend to be slow, but faster than caldari.*universally strongest armour. strong hull.*universally weakest shields.gallente:*drone race. universally best drone bays, only race to consistently get droneboats at different size levels.*heavy use of hybrids, optimized for blasters. almost no missiles except for lachesis and eris which are split weapons systems (and nemesis which is special case).*racial ewar is sensor damp, situationally useful but not nearly as good as ecm.*secondary ewar is warp disruptor, which falls under the category of tackle. kronos also has same web velocity bonus as paladin.*ship have second least mid slots.*ships have second most low slots.*ships tend to be fast, but slower than minmatar.*second strongest armour. strongest hull.*second weakest shields.minmatar:*projectile weapon race. have no dedicated missile boats, but several ships designed to use split weapon systems and many turret ships have spare high slots to add unbonussed missiles for extra punch.*no dedicated droneboats, but ships incline towards above-average size drone bays.*racial ewar is target painting, only ewar used to benefit you and your allies rather than handicap your opponents.*secondary ewar is stasis webifier; again counting as tackle.*ships usually have second most mid slots.*ships usually have second least low slots.*universally fastest ships.*ships split between armour and shield tanking.so anyway, although minmatar are better than most, empire ships construction is built along far too strict guidelines. caldari ships are always the slowest, minmatar always the fastest. only amarr can use lasers to their optimum, only minmatar get the most out of projectiles, neither would use hybrids and ""missile specialist"" is completely synonymous with ""caldari"". caldari really do go out of their way to suck at drones- they can't use 5 drones simultaneously until you get to battlecruiser, don't get a ship with 125 mbit of drone bandwidth until the dreadnought and have the only battleship with less than 75m3 of drone bay space. and the ewar divide is even more absurd.my complaint here is basically that this is unrealistic, not to mention annoying. why are the amarr, minmatar and gallente shipbuilders so averse to using ecm when it's clearly the best ewar? why aren't there any speed-tanking caldari ships, or dedicated amarr shield tankers? where's the caldari droneboat? i'd like to see something like a speed-tanking gallente missile boat with a target painter bonus. why not see if boundless creation, roden shipyards, kaalakiota or khanid innovations can surprise us in the future?"
4/5/2010,"not supported, i like the racial distinctions.also, amarr have the fastest interceptor for some reason."
4/5/2010,"your proposal wouldn't lead to more varied ships, it would lead to everyone flying the same ship.not supported.side note: if you like to mix and match, crosstrain and fly some of the pirate faction stuff."

4/6/2010,"this is incorrect. if ehp does not matter, dps cannot matter. if ehp does not matter, volley damage cannot matter. dps is required to go through ehp. if adding more ehp does not matter then adding more dps does not matter. similar with volley. the reason for these truisms is simple. gangs do not fight simple bags of hit points that explode, but rather, bags of hit points that shoot back. if an opponent has more ehp, it takes more volley damage to kill him. if i have more ehp it takes more volley damage to kill me.it is ironic that you are attacking my apoc fit compared to yours. lets examine how they do, volley for volley.ignoring resistances, the 8 tachyon setup requires 32.78 ships to volley the 7 megabeam setup. the 7 megabeam setup requires 30.22 ships to volley the 8 tachyon setup. if you add resistances into the picture, since we're shooting armor tanked ships with em/thermal damage and the megabeam ship has significantly more armor than the tachyon ship, the megabeam ship advances further.this means that, in pure volley damage, a fleet of apocs set like i have, against a fleet of apocs, set like you have will require less ships to volley one of yours. 4.31 seconds later it will do it again. the tachyons will land their second volley at 7.61 and i will land my third at 8.61. all the while, each volley of mine destroys more ships that each volley of yours.which is exactly what was done. each ship was fit optimally for fighting at the desired range.it takes 49 rokhs to volley one of my apocs. it takes 61 of my apocs to volley 1 rokh. all of this is fighting at the desired range and accounting for the resistances of each ship. it takes 37 of your apoc's to volley one rokh it takes 26 rokhs. to compress. in volley damage vs ehp only for my fit, 1.2 apocs equal about 1 rokh. for you its about 1.42 apocs to the rokh.regardless of how good you think your tacklers are, how good you think your pilots are at warping out, how good you think you gang is compared to the other. at those ranges; the rokh is at least as good a ship as the apoc.if that is true(and it is) then there cannot be any problem with rails. so medium rails are a problem because they are not good on the deimos... the blaster ship. but are good on the brutix and the eagle and the ferox and the moa. they might not do what you want, but they certainly are not weak. and you've somehow never heard of a railranis.1. price has never been a means to justify anything in this game.2. that rokh, the one that we see above, by strict volley damage dominating the apoc. yea, it costs a whopping 500k isk more by current market prices than my apoc.oops, there goes that argument, not that it was an argument against railguns anyway..."
4/6/2010,"actually its pilot race preference of the previous term. the reasons that people do not go into rokhs is quite simple, they're content with flying megathrons and don't want to train another race to have a sniper bs.this is enhanced by communal issues regarding the payoff of flying fleet snipers(which is to say, its very little personal payoff compared to training small ships). this is also why you did not see a lot of minmatar players train caldari (that and the locus bug)this thread is evidence enough of that.in addition to this, a lot of players also simply do not know how to play the game effectively."
4/6/2010,"since you want to base the comparison on ehp first and foremost, let's compare armor tanked ships, shall we?since you are relying on the buffer, that means you got logistic support, and that means guardians/oneiros pretty much, so you need to armor tank.[rokh, sniper]magnetic field stabilizer iimagnetic field stabilizer iireactor control unit iidamage control ii1600mm reinforced rolled tungsten plates i100mn microwarpdrive iisensor booster ii, targeting rangesensor booster iitracking computer ii, tracking speedtracking computer ii, tracking speedlarge capacitor battery ii425mm railgun ii, spike l425mm railgun ii, spike l425mm railgun ii, spike l425mm railgun ii, spike l425mm railgun ii, spike l425mm railgun ii, spike l425mm railgun ii, spike l425mm railgun ii, spike l[empty rig slot][empty rig slot][empty rig slot]ehp: 73,622 / armor: 14,000 / dps: 287 / tracking: 0.00493[apocalypse, sniper]heat sink iiheat sink iitracking enhancer iidamage control ii1600mm reinforced rolled tungsten plates ireactor control unit iadaptive nano plating iiquad lif fueled i booster rocketssensor booster ii, targeting rangesensor booster ii, targeting rangetracking computer ii, optimal rangemega beam laser ii, aurora lmega beam laser ii, aurora lmega beam laser ii, aurora lmega beam laser ii, aurora lmega beam laser ii, aurora lmega beam laser ii, aurora lmega beam laser ii, aurora lmega beam laser ii, aurora l[empty rig slot][empty rig slot][empty rig slot]ehp: 64,459 / armor: 14,625 / dps: 331 / tracking: 0.00524[megathron, sniper]adaptive nano plating iidamage control ii1600mm reinforced rolled tungsten plates itracking enhancer iitracking enhancer iimagnetic field stabilizer iimagnetic field stabilizer ii100mn microwarpdrive iisensor booster ii, targeting rangesensor booster ii, targeting rangetracking computer ii, optimal range425mm railgun ii, spike l425mm railgun ii, spike l425mm railgun ii, spike l425mm railgun ii, spike l425mm railgun ii, spike l425mm railgun ii, spike l425mm railgun ii, spike l[empty high slot][empty rig slot][empty rig slot][empty rig slot]ehp: 64,907 / armor: 13,551 / dps: 312 / tracking: 0.0049now do you realise why people fly the mega instead of the rokh?columns below: range_modifier dps ehp isk (ehp*dps*range_modifier)/isk normalized index over apocapoc 1 331 64539 128588672 0.166129789 1rokh 1 287 73622 170640952 0.123824403 0.745347378mega 0.85 312 64907 125610684 0.1370372 0.824880356a 0.85 range_modifier is used to correct the mega dps for falloff. if you don't want to include it, you have to explain why, since at apoc's optimal, the mega is already in 1/2 falloff.so we see that:1 rokh= 0.745 apoc1 mega= 0.825 apocp.s. i want see the math you used to reach the conclusion that 170 mil (fully t2 fitted rokh)= 130 mil (fully t2 fitted apoc).p.p.s.how many times do i need to show you how to properly fit a ship?"
4/6/2010,"1. there was no comparison ""first and foremost"" of ehp. it was always dps x ehp @ range2. why in the world would you armor tank a fleet sniper? an rr battleship yes, but these are not rr battleships. rr won't matter one lick in these types of fights and if you do have it there is no reason for it to be guardians over scimitarsnow, there is a reason for guardians over scimitars for a short range gang, that is so your battleships can field tackle and utility in the med slots(rather than bringing support). but not as a sniping gang.this goes back to my original point about you being terrible.rigs cost money. so does ammo.(which actually makes the rokh cheaper. insurance matters)"
4/6/2010,"see, that's the problem here, your lack of context and sniperbs experience.you don't consider logistics in a sniper gang, you don't understand that rigs are not the best option in a disposable fleet sniper, you don't realise that spike is an expensive t2 ammo (and is more cumbersome to haul around than anything else), you talk about tackle on bs when we are discussing fleet snipers and you consider me terrible? wake up call dude, you need to pull your head out of the sand (or wherever else you got it shoved in) and realise that you do suck at fitting ships. it's ok, you need more practice, but you'll get there if you listen to other people.just let go of that arrogance you seem to carry around and the tendency to behave like a goon all the time (i understand you are a goon, but try to fight it, ok?). i am saying this to you specifically failbong, since each time you tried to counter my arguments about fittings, you just proposed a non-optimal solution and irrelevant drivel. let me just say that you prove each time that you don't understand the matter at hand, you are stuck in thinking about rrbs and sbs when we are talking about fleet snipers and sniperhacs here.----------------------------------------------------on armor/ shield logistics and their roles. they are of course related to the kind of gang you are running. for example, a sniperhac/bc/ machariel gang will run with scimis or pairs of basllisks, since they will field shield buffers relying on mobility to gain advantage and control the tactical situation.a heavy rrbs gang, on the other hand, will of course favor big armor buffer and logistic support from each other or dedicated logistics ships (guardian/ oneiros), not caring about mobility but about survivability.sniper fleets are relying on tactical situation control, exchanging mobility with range, in order to eliminate incoming enemy firepower. however, they are reliant on ranged support (hacs/bcs) to keep tackle off them. even if support is doing its job properly, there are still elements of the opponent's fleet that can project firepower out to the fleet snipers (enemy snipers/ sbs). therefore you need to fit properly to counter those threats as well. and that's why you need armor buffer and logistics.--------------------------------------------------------- see the issue, you don't understand the reasons so you consider the effects illogical, even if they are absolutely justified.please, try to learn from this thread, you might get a bit better at this game and become a bit more relevant."
4/6/2010,"this is hilarious coming from you.sniper fleets are not disposable. i did not say that there would be tackle on sniper bs (i said that is why you armor rr when going for [i]short range[/])if you're in a sniper gang. and the enemy has dps low enough that you have time to get reps on then it doesn't matter what type of ships you're using, you're going to **** them. you expect the enemy gang to have enough dps to volley entire ships. rr doesn't matter at that point, but ehp still does.in a sniper gang, you tank by warping out(and warping back in). the fast majority of logistics will be off grid(and if its not, there is no preference towards armor logi)"
4/6/2010,"actually, the reason people fly mega's in fleet is due to the armor tanking. i'm a caldari hybrid pilot who cross-trained to gallente so i could get logistics and rr love in fleets.i love the rokh, but due to the rest of the eve universe flying armor tanked ships, i had to crosstrain."
4/6/2010,"it's ok dude, no need to be butthurt for proven wrong time and time again. don't get agitated. let's all be friends.you need to try a bit harder though, where is that vaunted troll mastery displayed by goons?anyhow, please continue to provide us with the reasons you don't understand why there is an discrepancy. i hope you do understand that every and each of your posts just help demonstrate:1) that you don't know jack about sniper fleets.2) that you still haven't learned how to fit ships. 3) that there is a disparity between railguns and other turrets. sure, keep saying that to yourself. in the same line of thought, there is no lag and everyone in the fleet is always aligned, the logistics have locks on you all the time, there are no enemy sbs, the minerals to build ships are free, sov bills don't need to be payed...etc. if it makes you happy...just quoting this proves my point how little you know about sniper fleets. thank you. really, i can't show more clearly how plain ignorant you really are, unless you do it yourself.warping out is an absolutely valid tactic and it is being used, however denying armor buffer is the primary tactical decision for fleets that are in use today is totally out of the question.as far as logistics being off grid and a preference for armor tanks and guardians not being there...let me try to make you understand this: rokh would be a good enough ship iff the ehp*(dps @ range)/isk index for it was such that it justified bringing shield tanked ships and switching to shield logistics. at the moment, not only that is not the case, but the overwhelming evidence is that there is no reason to fly a rokh over any other bs in a sniper fleet, unless it's the only one you can bring.prove me wrong by getting your corp/ alliance to fight exclusively in rokhs, otherwise just admit you are trying to troll me and fail to do so, so we can ignore you. once more."
4/6/2010,"ehp doesn't matter in large fleets because there is no possible way to create a bs that can tank 250 bs alpha strikes, so your ""tank"" is warping out. that is an issue of reaction time, not ehp.no it isn't. your megabeam does more damage, but can't shoot as far. for the same reason we aren't talking about ac fits or blaster fits, we're talking about ultra-long-range fits here, not simple sniper fits. if railguns are supposed to have a niche of ""long range"" showing that other ships do more damage at longer range than rail ships is required. unless the apoc being targeted warps out before all 250 ships fire at them (far more than the 32.78 volleys, which makes for a rather small fleet). notice how all of the ships die if a fleet shoots 1 volley at them? so do most people who fly in a large fleet. that's why everyone is active aligned and warp out when they start getting targeted.and then a fleet of 250 people shoot at both pilots who think their ships don't need to warp out. poof. this weekend, i was in a fleet of almost 400 against a fleet of about 500. you don't try to tank that. it doesn't work.let me stop you right there and ask if you can fit a moa, ferox, or brutix to be out of range of a medium beam gang. the eagle can warp at 100km when the rest of the fleet warps at 50-70km. this is why the eagle is functional. none of the other ships has this ability. they don't have the bonuses stacked on bonuses stacked on bonuses of the eagle.so you advocate everyone showing up in navy ships? maybe pirate faction ships? if price doesn't matter, why doesn't everyone fit office modules? if you are talking about efficiency without taking into account cost... i'm at a loss for words. i can understand why you haven't made it into sniggerdly yet though.i'm not sure how you accomplished that. the rokh has more module slots and has a higher hull price. since i can't find these fittings, i'm just going to say ""fail fit""."
4/6/2010,right. you just explained why ehp doesn't matter at all.you know where to find u'k and gc. lets see how well your fleet fits work in real fleet fights. they're happening several times a day right now in the north.
4/6/2010,hehe goumindong tries to troll this thread too.he has prooven many time he doesnt have a slightest idea how sniper battles work.and then these weak arguments he brings are so flawled...
4/6/2010,"i'm familiar with the meme that goons are bad at this game... but damn, now i get to see it."
4/6/2010,"now look what you did, you managed to admit what we're all saying, sometimes ehp doesn't matter, namely cases with significant logistics around or where there isn't significant return fire. even more so though even your own situation doesn't emphasize ehp as much as dps as the enemy fleet doesn't know the ehp of your fleet, contrarily you will know the dps your own ships are doing and at best will be able to form groups based on how many of your ships are required to volley the highest reasonably expected ehp, even if your opponent brings ships with significantly less ehp then you'd guessed the potential losses in efficiency in trying to figure out the sweet spot aren't worth it, especially if you're encountering varying fits and ehp numbers. put simply your assumption that ehp = more time to kill assumes perfectly efficient usage of damage which is the exact opposite of what you'd encounter when 1-volleying the enemy, a situation where overkill pays of many times better then underestimating.oh and that reminds me, if we're talking about 1-volleying enemies then we should point out the absolutely abysmal alpha that rails have making them worth less then half an apoc on the field since higher rate of fire isn't particularly useful when you have to add locking time to every shot."
4/6/2010,"in which case the volley damage and dps of the enemy fleet don't matter, since they volley a ship no matter how you're fit and no matter how their fit the sole determiner of a sniper battleships strength would be its range. you don't expect me to believe that do you?if you're warping out when you get locked there are still going to be some ships that get hit with volleys, and not all locks will land at the same time and not all reactions times are the same. your proposition only works when ships never get shot. but clearly this is not the case.dps x ehp @ range. not just dps. you can extend the range of the beams to the same as your tachyons if you want, its still better. ditto the rokh.no, but faction ships/modules are not justified by price(rather, justified by scarcity). but yea, price really isn't a big dealyou should try looking on the market."
4/6/2010,"carriers are already very capable at repairing ships due to capital remote repair systems and triage mode, a boost to this system is not needed.carriers are supposed to be the logistical backbone of a fleet, they can maintain their fleet yet have no capability to repair their weapons easily, which all ships can due to nanite paste. carrier pilots are the only ship classes of which the weapons can be destroyed due to the effort of others yet they have no viable way to repair them, that is why i proposed this system."
4/6/2010,supported
4/6/2010,sounds good
4/6/2010,works for me. i like it.
4/6/2010,"price is an issue with these ships but only because of the tier 2 bcs. a field command is only 150-200m isk iirc and a hac is around 100-120m so it's not that much more expensive.if you look at the ships with the compare tool you'll find that the field command ships are basically the same as their t1 counterparts with +1 slot, t2 resists and a turret or two strapped on.field commands need basically what the op stated, more hp, more speed/agility, more sensor str, more scan resolution, +1 slot."
4/6/2010,"completely agree on all accounts, especially the bit about field commands being very poor bang for the buck.i loved flying sleipnirs (on another character), but after a while it just became silly to keep flying them because they are just big, expensive primary target bait and this far outweighs any enjoyment or benefit one gets from flying them. the nighthawk would never be my first (or even second) choice in pvp missile boats and i've never bothered owning a vulture. my absolution hasn't seen the light of day in years. my astarte fell to painball's blasterthron in late 2007 and i haven't purchased another one since. i have a buddy with an eos bpo but have never bothered to hit him up for one...heheh.i'm always shocked when anyone says the nighthawk is fine as-is. pve, yeah...and even then, it's fitting-challenged."
4/6/2010,i disagree that the ship be a t2 variant. that's very expensive and leaves out the small and even medium corps from competitive ship building and or corp movement. the price tag is overwhelming. suggest that current freighters have a module space made available and a module be made available on market. the module will add a bay for ship transfers only. an easy fix.
4/6/2010,"why not just give freighters/jump freighters 1 low slot that can only be fitted with a cargo bay or ship maintaince bay? seems to solve it without need of new models, skills, or whatnot."
4/6/2010,"so, you want a ship with freighter characteristics that costs a few billion isk and carries 5 assembled bs? you realize this would be an indirect nerf to carriers, right?why are you hauling bs? how far are you moving bs? would this not be faster if you just threw nano in the low slots and zipped back and forth a few times?what happens to the ships inside when it gets ganked? i assume you want them to pop to try to decrease the value of the ship as a gank target. i'm going to point out that ccp went out of their way to get freighters to drop loot to increase the incentive to people to pop them for a reason.also, fyi:fuel bay 3,000 m3corp hangar 10,000 m3cargo hold 870 m3drone bay 80,000 m3ship bay 1,000,000 m3carrier total = 1,093,870 m3 (800+m isk)freighter = ~ 1,000,000 m3 (700m isk)paul's-uber-ship-hauler (5 bs) = 2,500,000 m3paul's-uber-ship-hauler (20 bs) = 10,000,000 m3 (original proposal)"

4/6/2010,i support this idea in everyway imaginable. at least let us get fonts up to 18 or 20.
4/6/2010,"totally support this, in every possible variant that ccp could make the fonts bigger."

4/6/2010,"you should try like... shooting at ships (where it will matter whether or not you're using different weapons. i.e. fights you're going to win, or going to lose aren't much help) and getting some estimations based on those.i'll give you a hint. for solo/small gang battleships you're largely going to shoot armor(when it matters) with the exception of the raven"
4/6/2010,"oh really?! cool. let me advise this to engineers and constructors that make tones of schemas, projects, calculations before implementing models into real objects. let me just say them they waste their time. it is better to build a airplane and try will it fly or not. it is better to build a bridge first to see is it durable enough or they should build new one?i will give you a hint also. there is a solo pvp in eve. it is also very interesting. when i fit solo pvp ship. i do not know who is my enemy. it can be shield ship. it can be armor ship. it can be shield ship with photon field. it can be armor ship with explosive hardener. i do not know.p.s. doctor aibolit is my ""jita alt"""

4/6/2010,"except that is not what you suggested. nor is it what has been suggested.(and frankly, its what gallente already do)""when it matters"" is a very important point. as is ""why flying battleships"" (harb/brutix is an unfair comparison given the ""tieroneitis"" of the brutix)figure of speech. what i advised you do to was examine expected tolerances and determine those. just as bridge builders are typically interested in maximum sustained windspeed and gust windspeed but not too interested in 5 mile per hour winds, you should go examine your tolerances where they matter."
4/6/2010,perhaps you should make a proposal with a list of ships that need attention?
4/6/2010,"that would be more a collection of ""i want to fit all the best things without compromises""."
4/6/2010,i agree.on one condition.remove 3 high slots and spank the grid.no other ships in eve have 5 utility slots.
4/6/2010,the dominix has even 6 utility high slots. :p *scnr*
4/6/2010,"i accept your condition to remove the high slots. however, i must protest the ""spank the grid"" part. it's hard enough fitting the ishtar as it is."
4/6/2010,i think cpu is the bigger issue on the ishtar. not so much the pg.
4/6/2010,bout time tbfh
4/6/2010,"i agree with changing the hybrid gun damage bonus, but drone speed as replacement sux about the same tbh. if drone tracking bonus is too powerful, why not something else like a resist bonus?"

4/6/2010,"meh, i'll support it, but a damage mod for highs with perhaps a bandwidth increase is better imo. less lag and less attention needed. as for damage boost on the ishkur, i dont think its nescessary. it already is a dps powerhouse of a frig. that being said, i cant shoot the guns off someones ship, but they can shoot my domi's drones. so, thats more reason to rebalance in drones favor."
4/6/2010,"it appears ccp put a fair bit of effort into balancing max warp speed for different ships, fits and skills. but its all meaningless with the current setup."
4/6/2010,precisely.
4/6/2010,i support this idea/product/service.
4/6/2010,totally agree... theres hardwiring for everything else! thats just racial discrimntation against gellente!
4/6/2010,"i agree with this, give me an implant that makes my drones turn unto self detonating nuclear bombs.or give me a 5% bosst to damage.(i prefer the first)"
4/6/2010,"personally, i would rather see all of them beyond 20 au from the planetary plane removed from the game. however, since ccp has never saw fit to remove items from the game that were created by exploiting in this manner when they fixed the last two methods, i support this to give the new residents of a system at least something resembling the abilities of the old ones."
4/6/2010,"as opposed to getting in a cap stable ceptor (or dramiel) and flying in one direction for a few hours? you can't stop people from making deep safes this way without ""bouncing"" ships in some silly way when they reach ""the edge"" of the solar system.an emergency warp system is kinda meh. i would be more worried about what would happen when a titan hit the button. they'd be in warp for hours between their cap size and their warp speed.also, what you are asking for is a more immediate version of a logoffski, which is absolutely unacceptable. because the logical extension of this is ""emergency warp"" then logoff. sending you out of quick probe range and removing your ship from space a minute later). i mean this would be 50x more effective than the classic logoff/login/logoff/login that ccp fixed recently.edit: for emphasis."
4/6/2010,what is suggested here is a module with shiptype limitations i.e. blackops only. this would not allow any other ships to drop out of warp like logoffski does because they would be incapable of fitting the module. i think the ideas are good so i support this.if you think all ships in the game should be catchable 100% of the time then what are we doing with t3s and interdiciton nullifiers?
4/6/2010,interdiction nullifiers don't prevent warp scramming/disruption... just bubbling.but you knew that already. (just making a point that tech 3 ships aren't as invincible as they seem)
4/6/2010,"im getting fed up with the fact that everywere u can read that eve is such a masssive mmorpg where u can get fleet battles up to 1000+ people. however they do not announce the fact that nodes die every hour, u get a decync every half a hour and get insame amounts of lag. even in reinforced nodes the problem still occours. my proposal is to stop ccp announcing eve is a mmorpg where u can get fleet battles with 1000's of people. this is not the case anymore.troll away"
4/6/2010,i had a very nice fleet battle with 700+ people in local. guns were laggy but playable (network monitor ftw).i can just guess you are in nc and still try to jump hundreds of people onto an already filled grid?anyway ... if you want to help fixing the issue instead of useless whine ... join the next mass testing events.
4/6/2010,"700 is not over 1000. that is not the point. the point is that ccp is making false statements as to the current state of large fleet warfare. that's like saying you can fit 17 people in a vw beetle. and btw, i haven't heard about nc losing major stuff to grid lately...i've been there many times now.finally, this is one of multiple things ccp is misrepresenting in the marketing for eve."
4/6/2010,so basically you want the csm to start changing the way ccp does business?lost cause is lost.
4/6/2010,has no baby bottle will cry?
4/6/2010,"... or you could ask ccp to keep working of decreasing the issues with large fleets.also, in before the lock."
4/6/2010,"that is correct, ps: fixed your post"
4/6/2010,"i noticed your ""fix"" didn't change the conclusion."
4/6/2010,"recently, an issue of a real problem to many players was brought forward on this forum to the csm. in this issue, the posters were told they were not allowed to discuss the issue and an action was taken. please allow us to freely discuss issues and bring issues forward to the csm that we feel need to be addressed. for those who know what the issue is, please don't mention the name of the issue or you may be told your not allowed to speak of the issue."
4/6/2010,supporting the ability to bring issues to the csm.
4/6/2010,what issue would that have been?
4/6/2010,"there's more than one issue which gets censored as soon as it is brought up, but i know which you are talking about.supported wholeheartedly. if the assembly hall cannot be used as a free podium to pitch issues to csm, it should be moved to a platform outside of ccp's control"
4/6/2010,"fully supported.ccp rejecting an issue brought forth by csm is one thing, but not being allowed to bring up certain issues kind of defeats the purpose of csm imho."
4/6/2010,"this. while it's apparent the members of mm are intimately acquainted with the topic at hand, garnering support from the rest of us might require fuller disclosure."
4/6/2010,we'll push to allow you discuss freely when you actually learn how to communicate.
4/6/2010,"for those asking what this could be about, look for a locked topic in assembly hall. it's one of the taboo issues."
4/6/2010,i was actually wondering that it took them 3-4 days to lock that topic. :)
4/6/2010,"seriously...i think can understand ccp's point of view to a certain degree, but i think things have gone way overboard."
4/6/2010,it appears that this issue has already been resolved.
4/6/2010,the csm was created in the wake of the t20 incident to bridge the gap between the company and the playerbase. it was to have transparency in policy and internal auditing. it was a conduit to raise concerns to the company.as such locking an assembly hall thread regarding an issue such as moderation is against what the csm was created for.
4/6/2010,yay for incompetent mods censoring the forums!
4/6/2010,contexti believe the issue verone brought up was resolved?
4/6/2010,"there is already a separate, far more direct, conduit for raising issues with forum moderation to the attention of the powers that be at ccp. using the right tool for the job will (generally) yield superior results."
4/6/2010,so direct that they actually come out and say what the issue is specifically and everything!and it got results too!
4/6/2010,"this issue is not about forum rules regarding oope, but simply the ability to freely bring an issue to csm. this is also not a morsus mihi issue, but an eve online subscriber issue."
4/6/2010,the point .you
4/6/2010,"what is this... ""lets post vague threads and insult people day""?still no one has come out and said what the problem is...and all your doing is giving worse vague hints... this isn't charades... this isn't supposed to be 20 questions... put up or shut the heck up please."
4/6/2010,"the problem is simple.there is an issue with forum moderation. a thread was created in this forum to raise this issue for the csm. it was then locked by a mod, practically preventing an issue to be raised with the csm because the mod doesn't like it.the assembly hall should be a forum for raising issues. if a part of the playerbase is unhappy with the way forums are being moderated, it should be possible to raise that issue. it currently isn't - a mod will just lock it."
4/6/2010,see thread.see another thread made.see ccp respond in one thread.see ccp make a post about it in the forum in question.see verone's thread locked - people were still posting in it after the issue was resolved.see people make a new thread to continue complaining about something that was already fixed (this thread).see countdown to this thread getting locked because people keep posting in it like sheep.
4/6/2010,see how stupid you are..
4/6/2010,well he doesnt jump whole fleets into overloaded system and then cries on the forums.
4/6/2010,please explain what you want ccp to do to take care of your grievance. am i correct in stating that they already took care of your grievance? do you want to do away with the petition system and use assembly hall in its place?
4/6/2010,#edit#you know what...never mind.i'm just going to report every stupid little post that is a total and utter waste of time because this thread is full of epic fail.
4/6/2010,"off topic posts about fleets jumping into overloaded grids aside, i know what the point is - verone's thread about the forum moderation got locked, and you lot don't like it. so instead of taking up the discussion in the ccp sanctioned way (i.e. filing a petition or 20 depending on how much actual support you have), you lot decided ""we'll start another thread! they can't lock them all!""i have news for you - yes, they can.off topic comment removed. navigator"
4/6/2010,"well sorry, but he asked for being trolled."
4/6/2010,"so many bad posts in this thread...this is what the issue is: a mod went ahead and locked a thread for discussing moderation. (note i didn't mention oope...) why is this a problem? because it defeats the purpose of the csm. the point of assembly hall and the csm is to raise issues about eve for ccp's attention. if one of those issues happens to be improper moderation it should be permitted to be presented, as long as it is respectful and non-inflammatory. needless censorship on this forum is a slap to the face of the entire philosophy behind the csm. that is what this thread is about.supported"
4/6/2010,see.. that's what i meant by being direct... concise... and straight forward.not being a damned idiot and assuming everyone knows what the hell your talking about is a entirely different and insulting matter needless to say.if the op had started off on that note (as tobias pointed out)... it would be a different story.

4/6/2010,"hello everyone,i'd like to see an option on overview settings to move a specific item type to the top of the overview (e.g. a specific ship type, stargates, kernite asteroid, npc ships, etc).it doesn't matter what is the way you sort your overview, there is always something with higher priority which is not listed where you would like to see it.the idea is to have a check box to mark items with the ""move to top"" option, forcing the specified items to always stay on the top of the overview list.does someone have more ideas on how to improve this? do you believe it would cause too much lag? would it improve combat, running missions, mining or even hauling?"

4/6/2010,"my thoughts exactly. i made an earlier post in this forum about one of the most supported ideas proposed in assembly hall, at least during this term, and wondering if it was ever even raised by csm. (ghost data core production) we get no response.now ccp springs a horrible idea that will boost blobs camping stations, that has never even been discussed by players and that idea gets a stamp of approval?? im starting to wonder, what is the point of assembly hall?but dont get me wrong, i am quite happy with this csm. im just a little concerned about whether the csm is ignoring players and views expressed by players."

4/6/2010,"unfortunately this would make the system very easy to 'game'. certain power bloc's have large numbers of members that could very easily be organized to remove people from csm on a whim. i don't have a problem with the philosophy behind it, just the mechanic of achieving it would need to be worked out.as long as the rewards were not game breaking (maybe a medal or something, ankhe likes medals) csm has already done this in the past. the combat simulator is one casualty that i can think of of the top of my head.unfortunately for surveys, the results depend on your target pool. base don my own polling, i've found most people want a industry/science ui revamp more than anything else. exploration does need expanding (imho), but whether it should be done at teh expense of everything else is another discussion.and yes, i've nominated myself to run again"

4/7/2010,"still failing, goumibong. (especially if you are buying fleet snipers off the market). or fitting expensive rigs to disposable ships.but since you are not in a competent 0.0 alliance, that's what you do, right? to understand what i am talking about, you need to look at the 2 ships' bpos and calculate the added costs incurred to the rokh owner due to the difference in material requirements (i won't even include the opportunity costs).oh, wai... i am trying to explain economics to a goon... stuff like, i don't know...bills? i wonder if you can really grasp the issue goumi. i'll remind you, once more: efficiency. now be a good boy and eat your cheerios. don't worry about the smell."
4/7/2010,"markets do pretty good jobs of aggregating costs. and when they're at least semi-competitive(perfect competition is more than we can hope for outside of jita) then the price of a good will track pretty well with its marginal cost (which is to say, the opportunity cost of producing the good). since you are examining the costs associated with two goods being produced by roughly the same market(whether that market is internal or external) the price of the good is a good enough approximation of the relative costs. after all, that is the economic definition of market equilibrium price and its implications(we can abstract away from the individual production and consumption functions).adding transaction and transportation costs don't make a lot of sense in this regard since they're not uniform or systematic. you could, if you wanted, assign some cost to the minerals that are imported over the minerals that are not. but really, these costs are marginal when you're importing significant quantities and will be aggregated into the costs for the goods within your internal market anyway. at least, that is what the economics says.it again is ironic that you say this, because it is exactly an economic explanation that proves that maximizing dps x ehp is best for your fleet. (protip: look at the marginal benefit of each from the perspective of your gang). and its exactly an economic explanation that describes why you are unable to see what the truth is (the action of flying rokhs and increasing ehp does not have its primary effect on the pilot himself. rather the pilot only see the benefit of dps[higher on killmails*], and very little of the benefit of his ehp [this is especially true if a particular pilot does not get shot] or in rigs while they often realize the entire cost of the action)if you've completed a basic 101 course, you ought to know that positive externalities like the ones explained above will reduce the incidence of purchase (or in this case choosing to fly the ship) relative to the ""societal optimal position"" which is to say ""what is best for your alliance"".note: this point gets a bit too complicated for this forum. but once you get to a point, as an organization, where you have chosen to fly the sub-optimal ship, choosing to fly a more optimal ship can actually be a detriment to the fleet as a whole as an individual choice.*there is also a behavioral explanation, but i will be kind and not assume that you're being systematically irrational. ushra'khan"
4/7/2010,"do you realise that minerals are not free, transportation and manufacturing time is not free, training time is not free, salvage is not free, and how all this adds up?do you understand why this makes the rokh inefficient?on marginal effects. occam's razor holds true here as well, your model will be good enough with less, not with more.do the multivariate analysis, you will see how important dps is.while we are discussing market behavior, eve is a very good market simulator, even if there are limitations to it, when the data from this simulation suggest a pattern, you better pay attention. you keep ignoring the existing data, over your pet theories and furthermore, you seem to disregard that we are dealing with a deterministic model, which allows us to calculate the exact performance of each system in comparison, relying only on the field data for the cost. let's see the costs:rokhapocalypsemegathronnow add up each fittings cost and you'll see how the ships compare.once more, repeat after me: expensive rigs are bad in disposable ships, isk matters, time and other resources are limited.as long as you fail to grasp these premises, you just fail.survival of the fittest. count rokhs flown over apocs, you will see which one has won that contest. i don't assume anything, however, you are being systematically irrational, because you do have a personal conflict (specifically with me) and cannot stand the fact that you have been proven wrong on all occasions.you need to stop being so consumed by your ire and look at the data. you don't seem to be able to translate tactical experience into proper fits,that could be either due to lack of said experience or lack in problem solving capacity. from your attitude and demeanor, i'd say it's the second one.einstein once said: to repeat the exact course of actions and expect different results each time is the definition of insanity.when everyone that contributes to the discussion tells you that you are wrong and gives you the exact same reasoning based on facts, how do you call your behavior?you are being tiresome, obstinate and frankly you are wasting my time. you don't want to understand.if you want to prove me wrong, just build a corporation/ alliance that flies exclusively rokhs, fights and survives vs any other one with the same numbers. anyhow, repeating the analysis you try to disregard:ushra'khanfounded november 25th, 2004status active"

4/7/2010,"leaving that pointless discussion with goum aside, i don't see how the rokh would be fixed with your proposal. the mega would still be way better. loading up with antimatter and shooting your way out of a bubble: mega wins. replacement costs: mega wins. sniping at spike range: draw."
4/7/2010,"yeah thats why ships should get their own ""boost"" fixes."
4/7/2010,"although i'd love railguns to have more damage i can't agree. i still think the problem lies in the distribution range between the weapons. however this is very difficult to balance as ship bonus' throw base stats all over. we also have the problem of finite locking range which cannot be increased over 249km. beams are overpowered. they hit too hard, track far far too well, and their range envelope is too large. this is why rails appear to fail. its because their range advantage is so slim and in some aspects (rails fitted to gallente ships) its almost impossible to see any advantage.blob warfare is also an issue. (yes tagami, i do not do null sec nor have i participated in v.large fleet action but i can still see a problem in blob warfare) there have been some good suggestions on how to move away from blobage on the forums (i'd have to dig the one i like out best which was causing some kind of stacking penalty to dps) but getting insta popped in a bs simply because there are 300 bs's shooting at you can't be fun."
4/7/2010,"do you understand that i just told you how to count all of that stuff? that is the economics of it. that is how market prices are determined. they aren't random.occam's razor does not apply. first of all occam's razor is not a method to judge between theories. second of all, it requires that the validity of both be determined the same(i.e. either both true, or both questioned). the validity of your statement is not in question, its false.which is what was done. and when it was done it was found that the rokh is perfectly fine.i had literally just explained how the deterministic part of the model makes rokhs less used than they ought to be. this is basic economics based on the characteristics of the good.do you have any argument other than ad hominem?it was not disregarded. it was a bad analysis (because you're armor tanking a rokh, and still not taking modules into account[whether or not they are different for each ship in favor of the rokh, they will bring those ratios closer together])you still don't get it do you?"
4/7/2010,"i hate to get involved in this horrific wreck of a thread, but, tagami, please repost the sniper bs fits that you're using to argue that the rokh is inadequate."
4/7/2010,"you still don't get it, do you? survival of the fittest, maybe? occam's razoryou really need to start reading up. in a bit you'll deny that mass has inertia or start saying that things happen for no reason (it's magic!). then we'll just have to tell you to gb2wow.if your math tells you 110mil=80mil=75mil, then ok, rokh is fine, sure, whatever the doctor's orders are, don't forget to take the frog pills, etc...ad hominem.false premises...(110mil=80mil=75mil), they do skew your view goumi, don't they? is it the fact that you fly amarr that makes you see any action that threatens their relative performance as hostile to you and you act so spasmodically?you need to realise that when you are doing an analysis on data, you need to leave excess baggage at the door, stuff like pet theories, preconceptions, personal feelings towards the other person in the discussion, personal bias due to conflict of interest, etc.as you said, rokhs are being used less than they should be, due to their characteristics. that fact proves that there is a need to make the rokh more attractive in the context of the game. (if we want balance of course. otherwise, if someone wants amarr to be the best and the others to trail them, then he'd fight the proposal.)after the analysis of the metrics available, the conclusion that was reached was that the one attribute that would make the ship more attractive to the end user, with the least changes, was a slightly increased damage output. the same analysis was done on megathron, and the rest of the railgun boats and it became apparent that there is a discrepancy in all of them, namely their damage output is less than their competitors (other types of turrets) when used on ships with relevant bonuses. a 15% damage increase would move railboats at least in the same ballpark with other turrets.true, his ranting is kind of pointless, apart from the fact he is providing me with more ammunition to show that there really is an issue (i hadn't explored the economics of the matter as extensively as he did, his only issue is that he can't fit a ship properly and that skews his analysis).on the mega-rokh comparison:that's why i included the 10% pg boost for caldari railboats in the proposal, in order to balance them vs the gallente ones.a 10% boost in pg would allow a rokh to fit 3x magstabs, a 1600mm plate and a dcu ii in the lows, matching the mega's performance at short range (megas usually sport 2x magstabs and 2x tes). at the same time, taking spike down to 70% optimal bonus makes the mega less op at range (due to it's tracking bonus) by forcing it to fight in falloff, like the pest."

(remember, i am talking about railguns here, not ships).what you just said is that when using railguns even if [you rig a ship] and [use faction ammo] and [more range modules] that ship cannot do as well in its dedicated role as the equivalent ones using other turrets.thank you gypsio for pointing this out."
4/7/2010,"no you didn't, you'd like to think you have i'm sure but you've completely sacrificed range by abandoning t2 ammo and you haven't gotten significant damage in exchange, moreso you've made the squishiest rokh i've seen in a long time, arrador actually posted a good shield tanked rokh fit so look at that if you want to see what direction you'd like to go in for the rokh if not for the context of armor tanking being heavily preffered, which tagami's fit works as well as can be expected."
4/7/2010,having two separate ships to save on rigs seems like being penny wise and pound foolish...
4/7/2010,"that is why its funny. you should read that link that you just put out there.you will notice that the theoretical principle relies on there being no necessary reason for the complication.but we have a necessary reason. dps does not entirely explain the dynamic at play. and it cannot because dps gets applied to a ships ehp (in any situation where that ship might be at risk of dying)you do not do a lot of insuring for ships that you consider ""disposable""i have backed up my position with reason, logic, and explanation. you have not. you may believe that i have excess baggage or that i am ""personally invested"" in this, but its not true(well, only so much that i am interested in a balanced game). it is a classic ad hominem. you are claiming that the argument is wrong not because of any aspect of the argument but because of the qualities of the individual making it. you bringing this up only serves to distance the argument away from the fact of the matter.and the fact of the matter is that the rokh is a good sniper and that there is nothing wrong with rails.a boost to ecm would also make the ship more attractive to the end user as would a boost to the damage and tank of logistics ships or to the strength of gang mods. as would a boost to dictors. all of these things are underused based on their current utility to the gang. but that does not mean that we should boost them. their current utility to the gang is perfectly fine where it is and the fact that players do not choose them does not make them underpowered.it is actually quite good for the game that there are hidden choices that are optimal that most people will not see, or will under-utilize even if they see it. these are the things that allow smart players and organizations to outperform those who are not willing or able to do the analysis."
4/7/2010,and that is why he got laughed off of a certain other forum about it.

4/7/2010,"i don't think it's needed, but it should be equal."
4/7/2010,"i support this. for less isk/skill/etc. you can field a battleship or battlecruiser that competes or beats it in capability.secondly, i cannot aggree more that the nighthawk needs another mid and more pg. while the nighthawk is based off the ferox hull, its obvious that it is really the t2 drake, which for some reason gets better fitting setup. the nighthawk is great, but the drake can fit more hams, lse iis, and what not with no issues while the nighthawk struggles with a set of hms and 2 lse. it seems to me that if it is supposed to be better, ergo tech 2, it should be able to be fit better.as for the possible massive passive tank boost, who cares? its not like it will make a difference in either pvp or pve. the days of 1v1 pvp are long gone, so having enough tank to beat anyones dps is pointless. you'll just end up blobbed. as for pve, it can already tank any level 4 easily and do the tanking for a level 5, its not making a difference. even if it makes tanking a level 5 solo easy, the setup in no way could even do a level 5 solo with its dps."
4/7/2010,"actually, my problem with field command ships is that they're not ""command ships"" at all- they're habs (heavy assault battlecruisers). they get exactly no bonuses to fleet boosting that a normal t1 battlecruiser doesn't get- their advantages over the t1 variants are pretty much the same as a hac's advantages over a t1 cruiser. so they'd damn well better be as proportionately stronger than their t1 counterparts as the hacs are. currently they're just lousy (or at least inadequately worthwhile) value for money."
4/7/2010,this is one of the most awesome proposals on page 1 =p
4/7/2010,"first off, you are an idiot. there isn't a single freighter that can carry 1,000,000m3. yes, it is around that, but when it is too small, it's just too small. i wouldn't mind if it was 1,000,000m3, because then you can haul two assembled bbs. that would resolve the issue to a degree. with the current sizes, you can only carry one bb. that's the problem.second off, the carrier has a myriad of other options other than just hauling. why is there no outrage that a freighter has a bigger cargo bay than a dread? i mean, omg, the nag has 2900m3 cargo bay, while the freighter has 700,000m3+ as a base! dear lord, the freighter should cost 70b isk by your logic!third off, some people change regions they operate in. i went from gallente to caldari recently. a total of 26 jumps one direction. since i'm moving all of my assets down there because my corp's new alliance is stationed there and wants us in the area for pvp ops and defending our fairly significant low-sec holdings, it means a lot of stuff to haul, not the least of which are a rigged navy domi, a rigged navy mega, a rigged tyhoon, a rigger maelstrom, two rigged domis (one is pvp-rigged, the other is pve), a rigged hyperion, three rigged myrms, a rigged cane, and a rigged drake. these are the ships i have been accumulating for the past couple of years in that area. i could sell them if i wanted, but that's not what i want, i wouldn't get their full value, if i did sell them, and the point is, i want my ships close by so they can be used for things. flying them all down there was a task that took me two weeks to finish, as i wasn't able to play 24/7, and i also had had to make a half dozen freighter trips with modules, pos parts, and the smaller ships that fit easily into the freighter's cargohold once in a courier contract. i know, people like you don't keep ships long enough to accumulate them, as you readily suicide on freighters trying to get rich quick (thankfully the cost will be adjusted in tyrannis so you won't be able to have your ship paid for by insurance 100%)fourth off, your point about suicide prevention wouldn't really be relevant as long as the ships had a high resist (t2 resists) and a good amount of hitpoints. would they be juicy targets still? yes. would it be unfair to the ones hauling the ships? no. you'd still have to get a group of disposable bbs to crack one, and not guaranteed a good return on the investment, but the hauler wouldn't be immune to ganking either.fifth off, back to the carrier situation, you have a carrier that costs 700m isk and holds 1000km3, then you have a ""ship hauler"" which according to the post you quoted, would be around the jf price-range. that's around 4.8-5m isk, which is, *dromroll* six to seven times the cost of the carrier! so hauling 5 bbs at a cost of 6x the cost doesn't seem like a nerf to the carrier at all!"
4/7/2010,"i have lived in low-sek for most of my eve experiences and i have to say that if all the ideas that were outlined in the first post of this thread is implemented, the risk to reward ratio would balance out! personally, low-sek needs to be the place for corp's and alliance to prove if they have what it takes for 0.0; not npc 0.0 space (ex syndicate). fighting over space should have a gradation to it. as it stands now, there is less npc 0.0 space(the learning grounds of eve) then true 0.0 making it a huge barrier for new eve organizations to break out into 0.0 (this is why, you mostly see just the big alliance blocks and their pets controlling null sek space instead of no name, up and coming organizations)thanks for low-sek re-balance proposal rico.cheers,zen"
4/7/2010,"i like the ideas.would like to see more lowsec content added, more smuggling, pirate factions, black market sounds like nice ideas.i would also like to see an actual tone-down in high-sec missionreward. make the highsec missionrats drop 30% less loot and 30% less bounty. i think that reducing missionrewards for highsec missions, would place more emphesis on the risk vs reward factor. it'd also help miners earn more!another thing i would like to see, although it has been mentioned 32490723423x in this thread already, are lowsec exclusive minerals.edit: forgot to check support!"
4/7/2010,i liked all ideas
4/7/2010,supported
4/7/2010,makes sense
4/7/2010,"i don't actually agree with this part, unless there is some type of grace period. there have been two times while i was out of town for a couple of days that i have let my account lapse for 1-3 days. as soon as i got back home, i reactivated the account, although i had lost a couple of days worth of training. if you immediately revoked all market orders, contracts, etc, then not only would i be out sp, but i would also have lost tens of millions of isk just from the fees associated with setting those orders up. if there was a grace period, then i would support this idea."
4/7/2010,"there is a difference between datacore production and market orders etc. ""ghost"" production creates new assets from thin air whilst having isk and goods tied up in the market doesn't create anything, it just moves them around. thus i don't see it as the same problem.as far as the proposal goes it will be raised to address datacore production only."
4/7/2010,"it's quiet simple, gun users get to see the damage their guns do, i'd like to know when my drones are being effective by number rather than trying to judge how much a small red bar has moved which gets even harder to do if there's more than one person applying dps.currently you can see damage done to you by drones so the log entry is already there, it just needs to be given to the aggressor too."
4/7/2010,"yeah, that's right"
4/7/2010,"not a huge issue, but i have wondered abut it too."
4/7/2010,"strongly support! especially when you are using something like sentries, being able to see if you are hitting, or the target is too small/fast and you are missing is very useful, especially if you're a drone boat."
4/7/2010,k mayt
4/7/2010,i fully support this thread
4/7/2010,totally supportered!
4/7/2010,"yes please, good idea."
4/7/2010,i support this should ov bin done ages ago
4/7/2010,"supported,also with the addendum: unpackaged drones in the drone bay should show an updated damage modifier to reflect their skills and ship bonus."
4/7/2010,"fully supported, a great idea"
4/7/2010,definitly something that would be nice to have added
4/7/2010,"i'd rather see stations that kick you out to a random distance of 10-50km when you undock. or multiple ingress/egress ports depending on the station type. and/or stations that require you to navigate around to within 5km of a docking beacon before you dock.different stations could have different layouts, with inbound ports being in different locations then outbound ports."
4/7/2010,"there is no real problem with the current setup. if you don't like docking games don't camp stations. it takes two parties to play docking games. from my perspective it would be nice if ccp would spend time making sure that your ship actually docks when you click dock. or that your ship warps when you click warp etc. at least for me, i do amarr fw. we are about 3/4 the size of our opposing milita, the minmatar. so if this gets changed it will mean i will never log off in a station. if i do the next time i log in i may find i am camped and be unlikely to get enough people in a reasonable amount of time to help bail me out. which just means no eve for me that day.so ok i have to log off in space all the time. i usually don't do this now. i'm not sure of the log-offski mechanics, like how long after i log off can someone who may have probed my ship come and kill me? but i suppose that will become required reading.that said there may be some pluses to this. it may lead to good fights on stations and add to the strategy of eve by giving strategic benefits to holding npc stations. station fights will definitely become a much larger part of eve pvp if this change is made."
4/7/2010,"your ship dissapears in 1 minute if you have no aggro prior to logging off, or 15 minutes if you do, so logging off without aggro in something with a reasonable amount of ehp is generally ok (you're unlikely to get probed and jumped that fast after all) and safe if you're more or less alone in system or doing it in a deep safe.logging off with aggro, of course, is a huge gamble.i am not sure if shooting something which belongs to you (a can) still gives you aggro however."
4/7/2010,"we used to have an interesting alternative solution to docking games: nano ship bumpingbefore the great nano nerf, a 7km/s mach could eject aggro'ed ships out of dock range even on fairly large stations. it was pretty tricky and the defender could avoid direct hit with various maneuvers. sometimes, even carriers could be inched a few km from dock range.but now all that is pretty much gone and we are stuck with more limited boring game. why not bring it back?"
4/7/2010,machariels are still nice for bumping stuff out of docking range.also cyclones/fleet stabber with 100mn mwds ;)
4/7/2010,"sounds good, i hate useless bonuses on ships."
4/7/2010,supported
4/7/2010,no one? wrong. i fit 3 t2 medium rails with no problem at all. i run a capstable t2 repper still. i don't get your point here. the guns up my damage and aggro the ships.not supported!
4/7/2010,"i dont think the op has mission running in mind, i dont think most of the people who supported the idea do either."
4/7/2010,bump!
4/7/2010,"it's certainly an interesting concept, and i would make use of a feature like this. i wouldn't call it a high priority however."
4/7/2010,agreed. supporting this though
4/7/2010,"not supported. the current 10s accel. + 20s decel. periods are there to make sure you can't load grid and warp to a gate in less than 30 seconds. if this happened, you'd have to wait for the session change timer.the timer is there for pretty fundamental reasons, so getting rid of it or even just reducing it from 30s is not an option at this stage afaik.another approach to this aspect of balancing would be to increase align times, by requiring that certain classes of ships reach a higher % of top speed to get into warp."
4/7/2010,"thats crap.there are plenty of short warps where you arrive within 30 seconds. yes with this proposal it would happen more often for the very fast warping ships, big deal. then they wait a bit longer before they warp from their starting location, or they warp first to a safe spot. but there is no hard limit right now that makes it take at least 30 seconds. speed during acceleration and deacceleration should simply scale with max warp speed."
4/7/2010,supported. make a red/orange flame for mwd icons
4/7/2010,"supporting this to be done not only about icons but on the actual ship aswell. a few expansions ago ccp gave most of the mods some visual effects upon activating, and by this made pvp a little more interesting. in all mmos i've played so far there is always some kind of recognizable visual indication when your opponent activate an item or initiate an attack, thus enabling you to make counter move, switch strategy and overall be more actively involved not just playing in ""click and watch"" mode. this is a little step to make pvp more fun, especially in a ""point and click"" type game like eve."
4/7/2010,this thread was erroneously locked and has been reopened.
4/7/2010,"ccp fallout, i bow down to you in awe."
4/7/2010,thanks for reopening this thread. fully supporting this.
4/7/2010,i support this issue. moderation is definitely not being doled out in moderation...
4/7/2010,drone hardwirings ftw!i want my +5% to drone damage implant.
4/7/2010,i'd support it. drones need love too.
4/7/2010,assuming 20km a second it would take about 3 months to go a single au.emergency warp system is not required for this proposal.thus all your arguments against my proposal are null and void.care to try again? do you wan't some help understanding the concepts discussed here. i would like to hear what your opinions about this proposal and the issues surrounding it once you actually understand what you are talking about.
4/7/2010,"i like the idea of utilizing the massive amounts of empty space in the solar systems but my issue is this:deep safes are at present rare and coveted. rare because they're increasingly hard to make and coveted because they're effectively impossible to break. if you are going to take away the rarity, there needs to be a balancing on their ability to be found. a multi-player mechanic which requires a high degree of skill and creativity to create these safes is a good idea. but something like a review of deep space scan probes or the introduction of a multi player mechanic requiring a high degree of skill and creativity to break these safes should come along with it."
4/7/2010,"considering that they're soon to become not hard but impossible to make (unless someone finds another method), making them easier to probe out is the very least ccp could do to mantain a semblance of balance in the game.but really, they should either be deleted or made possible to create without exploits.i like the suggeestion of a special cov ops module to make deep safes. while it's true that it would create a logoffsky-like situation for cov ops, even now a cov ops is pretty much completely safe once it enters warp.on the other hand i don't like the idea of giving this role to black ops. i don't want to spend months of training for something that is currently doable with a nearly unskilled alt (cov ops make the process faster, but a t1 frigate can create deep safes just fine)"
4/7/2010,having a session timer after being bridged in should be removed. it allows too many game mechanics to be exploited.
4/7/2010,you really think that timer is just there for fun?it is actually a session change for the game.
4/7/2010,hmm this is quite a interesting topic. perhaps ccp should look into this and see about correcting these issues that so many people take advantage of. then again i've never heard of this problem before......wait are you trolling me?
4/7/2010,fix this game!
4/7/2010,"i'm interested in learning more about those ""exploits"". can you describe them? i'm sure it's nothing that gms would ban people for, right?"
4/7/2010,"this is intended to address two problems.while a large pos can accommodated 30 or more arrays and labs, looking after them is a nightmare. each one has to be stocked with blueprints and datacores and construction materials. it is very tedious opening every array in turn and moving stuff around. the second problem is the untidy appearance  its not a station its a collection of potting sheds.the result is that while in theory manufacturing at a pos would give an industrial corp the advantages of not having to compete for station slots and a faster production time. in practice it is not worth the hassle (except maybe in 0.0) its much easier to open a second corp office and manufacture from there too.my solution would be ring modules which fit around the control tower  they could be, but wouldnt have to be attatched to the control tower by spokes. a simple toriod would do. the ring wouldnt have any production or lab slots or any capactity. there would be a new option add to ring for labs, arrays and corporate hangers when anchoring. all the added modules would add their capacity and slots to the ring. so the ring becomes more like a station with a corp hanger, and slots, it is treated as one entity  no need to choose between labs or arrays.the arrays and labs can be mounted around the ring, either with the ring going through the modules or attach the modules with spokes.it would still be possible to anchor mods in the old way.the rings can come in 3 sizes large (could take 36 mods if you had the grid/cpu) medium (18 max) and small (9). other types of ring mounted above or below could be used for moon mining and reactors, or for defensive mods (hardeners and ecm).now we have proper space station and if it rotated and played the blue danube that would be perfect."
4/7/2010,"i like this, but i wouldn't say it needs to be a priority though. while moving my blueprints and materials to assembly arrays is a hassle, its not so much of a hassle that i'd like ccp to drop work on other things to add this.no support for the above reason."
4/7/2010,"a simpler/interim solution would be to add large labs/arrays. simply double the slots, capacity and cpu/grid useage. less modules to clutter up the place and easier to maintain"
4/7/2010,"what you detail is only the tip of the iceberg (ok a very f'ing large tip but still).in all honesty the proposed idea of scrapping pos's all together in favor of a modularized pos that's been detailed in that ""beating a dead horse"" thread that continues to crop up from time to time is far better than making a duplicate idea albeit focused on the labs.so yes i support this... but your idea is/has already been declared for all intents and purposes.as to when ccp will do anything about it? i think they treat it like that nightmare that don't quite want to face at this time....more than just ignoring it.hopefully with the advent of tyranis... things will change for pos's for the better."
4/7/2010,"i agree, but i dont think it should be limited to just labs and i dont think a ring isnescessary. i would like to see one definitive control for all modules. flying to different pos structures has always been a hassel, especially when you can't name your hangars. perhaps just a new menu that will do ship maintainence arrays, corporate hangars, arrays and what not on the tower all in one."
4/7/2010,"i already posted in support of your other thread, but really i think that whether or not ccp chooses to implement a way to create deep safespots, all the currently existing ones should be deleted. if they do ""legalize"" deep safes, this will mantain the balance in the years (yes, i do expect it would take years :p) it'll take them to create an alternative method, if they don't, i think the reason why the old ones shouldn't exist is self-evident.however, i don't really belive ccp will do anything about it, so i just hope that someone will find a new ""exploit"" to make deep safes soon :("
4/7/2010,15au is not deep. try >260au for a meaningfully deep safe spot.
4/7/2010,"i am looking but i prolly need some /0-0\where do i find the 'support this topic' action?never mind, it's in the reply itself lol"
4/7/2010,"no offense intended, darius."
4/7/2010,"this man phraised it better then i did and i would like to thank him for that, however i wish to make 1 thing very clear. this thread is not about the oope in any way, it is about the ability to raise issues to the csm, reguardless of the issue, for reasonable discussion. my alliance also has no bearing on the issue just as your alliance does not either. this is not a thread discussing anything that happened in any conflict or region or system or with any parties. this is an issue of being able to bring forth issues to the csm panel for discussion with out members of ccp disagreeing with the issue and taking actions to prevent the csm from being able to read it or the players from being able to discuss it. if after all this, you are still not able to understand what this thread is about then i fear you are reading the wrong section of the forum.edit: spelling"
4/7/2010,the only things you've made quite clear are as follows -1: you don't care about anything but what you think.2: you assume everyone knows what your talking about and refuse to tell us what it is (that or you think we are all psychic)3: your ultra paranoid about ccp's moderators. (utterly childish)4: your immaturity when it comes to having a discussion by answering everyone with insults considering you have refused to communicate like the other proposals in this board that at least make sense.how do you expect anyone to take you seriously in light of the above?maybe you should hire tobias to speak for you... i suggest you pay him lots of isk as he's certainly better at it than you are.
4/7/2010,"as flattering as this is, can we stop with the personal attacks and return to the topic? finger pointing amongst the players here gets us nowhere in regards to the issue."
4/7/2010,"well, it appears the problem that started this thread has been resolved, the thread is no longer locked."
4/7/2010,bumping for good cause.
4/7/2010,"don't worry, i'm sure it will happen soon enough."
4/7/2010,"agreed! pos gunners need e-peen enlargement, too."
4/7/2010,"you suggest it's more realistic rather then 'magical', that can's and other deployables selfdestruct after x without explosives? i bet you don't doubt the 'magic' of 'changed ownership' when you see my wallet lost on the pavement"
4/7/2010,i support with some reservations...i just think that with the massive changes to 0.0 sovereignty and upcoming planetary conquest low sec needs to be revisited and rethought out. its seems to static to me. low sec to me needs to be more dynamic and unpredictable.
4/7/2010,"meh, i can't agree on the topic! however i feel the fleets in lowsec are becomming larger. even larger than i'd espect to show up in null-sec. to top it off i ran into this neat fleet on 30 ships with a tri-guardian setup!"
4/7/2010,"can't have been amarr militia, not enough guardians"
4/7/2010,sometimes when you use the system scanner there is a bug where your ship has a green dot in it (like an anomaly). i find that thing very helpful when i am hunting with the directional scanner and don't have to press alt. it is good when im seeing another ship and want to see exactly where i am.i would like to propose a button to activate it or not :)
4/7/2010,not supported. if frig/cruiser ganks can just shoot all they want on gates what separates low sec from null sec besides taking a sec status hit and no bubbles?
4/7/2010,"not supported. u wanna waste hours just catching that 1-day old rookie ship pilot and blow him up for ""lulz"", work for it. as i recall, that's why heavy interdictors were created in the first place anyway."
4/7/2010,already have missles. can't bomb in low/hi sec.i think what i've described here is drones. but that's just my opinion. (oh wait...i'm the op)
4/7/2010,it is on my list for the next meeting.
4/8/2010,long live the pos flogging thread!
4/8/2010,"i wasn't sure if i should just start a new thread, or continue this one, since this is an alternative proposal, but since thus topic generates enough hate i thought i would just stay in this thread. here are some initial points:1) limiting suicide ganks actually hurts (some) carebears - most people can't seem to see past the end of their nose when it comes to long term game design. limiting the frequency of suicide ganks will increase the amount of inter-regional trading. this increase would even out inter-regional price differences much more rapidly than is currently done. more level inter-regional prices would cut out a lot of income from many traders and haulers.2) dont act like you don't don't avoid pvp too - how many of the people talking about carebears tears use alt scouts to dodge gate camps or for all sorts of other pvp metagming?anyways. i have nothing against suicide ganking, but i don't think that it's current form makes sense. here's my proposal.-allow insurance payouts for gankers. the insurance system already makes about as much business sense as an aig 5 year plan, and i see no reason why suicide gankers should be treated any different from players that loose ships every other day from pvp. moreover, the potential affects on the mineral market are confusing at best, and really we don't need any more confounding issues there. finally i don't think it would make any real difference, as the profitability of suicide ganking vastly outstrips the losses to be had from ganking, insurance or no.-remove the profitability: what kind of police force sees someone get shot, then shows up and kills the murderer only to see someone else come and pick his pocket, doing nothing? whatever remains after a suicide gank should have a reasonable chance of ending up in the original owners pockets. how this is done doesn't really matter.suicide ganks should be truly suicidal, nothing is gained except the destruction of your enemy. it would still be viable as a way to harass traders, but would be governed by mercenary contracts instead of profitability to the ganker. the trader would still see massive losses, so there would still be reasons to do it, but it would truly be a suicide attack.by the way, does anyone know if people have bombed jita gates before? i simply love that idea. oh yeah and this system should see jita become less of the ridiculous trade hub it is due to increased hauling, which would be good for server stability and sanity, and maybe trade in general."
4/8/2010,you should fight it but when your last post contained the word 'rails' once and most of it was dedicated to going after tagami i start to wonder if you're about facts or rhetoric.
4/8/2010,"the number of times ""rails"" is said does not make a post on or off topic. he attacked me as a way to attack my argument. i explained why that was invalid. that is not ""off-topic"" unless his attacks were.unless you are referring to the part of the post that would not fit due to character limits"
4/8/2010,"do not support.after spending afair bit of time plugging in numbers to a spreadsheet i made several years ago i have decided that a straight 15% boost in dmg to all railguns is not the right path.in comparison to a megabeam (lolwut)apoc the mega is comparable once resists are considered. the rokh (something like arrador's fit) is actually quite nice in a 1v1 situation vs a the megabeam apoc. lets just say that i ran the numbers twice because i too found it counter intuitive, and contra to what i always thought. one you get into the tachypoc this drastically changes in favor of the apoc...but i consider this more of a problem with the synergy between the ship and t2ammo (see below for my take on the apoc)that being said...the biggest problem, in my opinion, is the way in which combat scales. lets face it...1v1's between snipe bs just dont freakin happen enough to matter. once you start dealing with large numbers what is important changes. unfortunately balancing to large fleets only creates problems of over/under powered ships in small engagements... in regards to the rokh:unfortunately to make this ship more acceptable in fleet engagments it requires a fundamental change in the way fleets fit (armor)or making it pretty freaking op in order to compensate. i dont see the former happeneing anytime soon, and the latter just makes everyone fly the rokh. unless ccp changes the core design of the rokh, train something else tbqfh.in regards to the apoc:nerfing the range bonus of this ship would be a step in the right direction (dons marshmellow suit in preperation for the flames)to giving rails a ""niche"". but messing with ship bonuses (or making weapon changes) without an eye to the ammo used and the enviroments involved is just setting yourself up for disaster in terms of balance.soooooo...i propose that ccp take a long hard look at ammo (t2 in particular) first. get a good foundation for what changes need to be made and then work out more subtle changes to specific ships to create a balanced whole. i know some of you think this will take too much time. your entitled to your opinion, but personally i would rather have changes come slowly than blindly.p.s. if a change like this went through i would not complain, however. i would very much enjoy some of the repurcussions and areas where gallente can shine again."
4/8/2010,"goumi and gypsio, you have both admitted that you don't know anything about fleet combat but you keep cluttering the thread with drivel. before you comment on sniperbs flying, shouldn't you go out and fly one? just saying, all the theory in the world will not save you in the face of cold hard facts.--------------------------------------------------------mimiru:would you suggest then that all lasers (all sizes) are nerfed in order to create such a niche for railguns? what would be the acceptable optimal range for laser that would make railguns attractive?i am not hurt if such a nerf came into effect, but i do know that others would be. and it would create such whining in the forums, that the nano-whine would pale in comparison.by the way, if railguns were boosted how would the mega be op in comparison to the apoc (megabeam apoc,it's not fair to amarr to use tachapoc in the comparison)? did your calculations take into consideration the spike optimal decrease that is part of the proposal? how does the rokh become op when it would not exceed the current damage output of an apoc, without being a total glass canon?did you run your spreadsheets for hacs and sniperbcs as well? did you compare eagle and deimos to the zealot and munnin? would you mind sharing your findings?"
4/8/2010,"tagami, do you really want to make this about your record and experience flying a fleet battleship compared to mine(or fleet ships in general)? you should probably think about that one before replying."
4/8/2010,"they were just as off-topic as far as i'm concerned, i'd really like to actually see something come of this and not have it degrade to name calling. this is only true if you ignore shields entirely and we shouldn't ignore the very signifigant damage advantage lasers get on shields, if for no other reason then being more efficient at tearing through the bit of buffer before the armor tank, yes i ran the numbers, read the thread to find them.based on my analysis of what we're proposing, 15% improvement to damage and some addressing of the cap usage problems, solution dependant on how damage is increased, the rokh certainly won't be op after all this, simply passable and useful enough to enjoy flying in spite of being a black sheep in your fleet.yes.i've mentioned it a few times through this thread that t2 ammo has to be looked at hard to fix the dynamics of sniping and provide a purpose at closer ranges, if i were to post a thread regarding this could i count on your feedback/discussion/bumping to insure that it sees attention?"
4/8/2010,i will give a more thorough post tomorrow that addresses several misunderstandings/miscommunications between myself and tag+altiaca. at the moment i am too tired to be very cogent.however i want to make sure that when you say 15% increase to railgun dmg mod. (as per the bold part on the first page) you really mean the dmg mod and not a 15% overall increase in dps....or 15% increase in volley but increasing the rof to keep dps the same.
4/8/2010,"if we're going to mess with rof the opposite of what happened to projectiles needs to occur. rails are low damage low alpha hi rof extreme range weapons. thats the design. its not useful for how ships are being deployed at the minute because of the extreme advantage beams hold, which is virtually all of them. beams need their tracking and range reduced to create a bigger gap in range envelope between lasers and rails. i understand what you want tagami but beams and lasers will become too alike. solving the rohk being the ""black sheep"" is difficult because of the heavier use of armour tanking over shield."
4/8/2010,"rails are not balanced...please read the thread in s&m, linked at the beginning of this thread. rails are power hungry, cap hungry, fixed damage type, long reloads and anemic dps/alpha. they are far outclassed by projectiles and lasers and fail in their role as long range guns. tachs easily hit the range of rails. there is only 1 ship that outclasses all other guns when accounting for range, and thats the rokh. however, we are all aware of how well a rokh fits into a huge fleet where 3/4 of all logistics and other ships are armor... i've been in multiple fleets where we cannot break the rr tank of a ship. we usually look for the first rokh in range, and melt him.rails have lost their niche. hybrids have lost their niche. give us a niche back please, let us compete on a dps level with lasers, and allow us to actually fit the largest t2 rails on caldari snipers boats (looking most specifically at the moa + ferox and their t2 variants)"
4/8/2010,"the question of the weapons strength is not based on its individual characteristics but rather the strength of the ships that use them. this is why, when people were whining about lasers, the more prudent members of the board said ""hey, its probably not all lasers, because only the maller, omen, punisher, prophecy(/w caveat), and apoc are terrible"".the brutix, rokh, and eagle are just fine as rail ships, they perform admirably compared to their counterparts. if that is true, then it cannot be true that there is a problem with rails. no matter what you claim relating to the weapons base attributes, if the final product is fine, the weapons must be fine. anecdata is not the entire composition of evidence. fighting a gang that you would not win against does not mean that the ship is bad, it means they had you beat. if you are having trouble killing rr ships then your gang isn't big enough for a sniping fleet. you should be volleying entirely through their hit point buffer, their reps should mean nothing.(and there should never be a rokh in range unless they have just pounced)i mean look, if i took an anti-support zealot out as a solo ship because ""these things destroy frigates"" and then got killed by the first frigate that i ran into there would be no question that this was a foolish endeavor and no reason to boost the zealot. this is what is happening, you have chosen the wrong ship for what you want to do. rather than asking yourself ""what was it that i want to do, i will train for that ship"" you asked ""what race do i like?"" and then you fit it for what you wanted to do. you can fit the largest tech 2 variants of rails on the caldari sniper boats as easily as you can fit any large tech 2 long range gun on any boat. it takes a single rcu i to fit t2 rails on a ferox with an mwd. this is the same that it takes to fit heavy beams to a harbinger. the ferox is one of the better tier 1 battlecruisers (its the only one that has had a boost ""recently"" and the only one that fills a niche that another bc or cruiser does not fill)fake edit: one of the things holding back sniping fleets at the moment has been the fleet lag as of the last patches. this has prevented the very large engagements from happening and these engagements are where those ships are best."
4/8/2010,"3 ships out of 2 races that use hybrids are the savior of rails?ah yes, because with lag (have you participated in a huge fleet post dominion?) everyone fires at the same time, battleships are vaporized, and people don't warp out when they are yellow-boxed by the entire enemy fleet. with your attitude towards fleet fights, i would think you'd join the nc. we never fight unless we have ~superior numbers~.i'd say you you fail fitted your zealot, not that there is a problem with the zealot. or you're using the wrong ship for the job. actually, i'm trying to use hybrids for long range fleet engagement. i've cross trained from caldari to gallente so i fit in large armor gangs. i'm currently cross training minmatar, as they have a niche with capless weapons and massive alpha strikes."
4/8/2010,"again, you are trying to claim that tank is purely a function of ehp. your tank in a fleet fight is warping before enough people alpha you. this is more a function of reaction time.there are several kinds of tanks in eve:1. active local tank - each ship for itself. best tank for solo or really small gangs.2. buffer tank - aka meat shield, take the hits and hope you can kill them before they kill you.3. rr spider tank - least complicated of the fleet tanks. 1 rr on everyone is greater than local reps.4. speed tank - fly too fast for guns to track or missiles to catch you.5. range tank - in some cases, if you know the range of an enemy fleet, you can attempt to maintain a longer range.6. buffer-warp tank - warp out if you are taking damage, forcing the enemy to cycle locks and prevent them from focusing fire. this requires a buffer large enough to tank the first several hits.the calculations you keep using are for a one-on-one situation. very few people solo in a sniper ship any more.the context you used some of those words is wrong. either you don't know the definitions of some of those terms or you are throwing terms around in hopes of intimidating people into not arguing with what you are saying. it doesn't work if people are equally or better educated in the subject. i gave you wiki links. not perfect, but i can't exactly hand you a textbook through the internet, now can i?if the ships are in a 1v1, ehp*dps is a good function, but snipers aren't used for 1v1 fights."
4/8/2010,"the op asks for a 15% increase in the damage modifier of the guns. most of the people posting here have different ideas as to how to properly fix railguns. we are only unified on the premise that railguns are underpowered and lack a functional niche in game. regardless of the op, the debate has been focused on whether railguns are balanced or need to be fixed. much the same as the debate had been against projectiles and projectile ships being fixed.when railgun advocates provide proof that railguns do not have a niche by fitting other ships to do the same thing railgun ships do, but better, people complain about the fits. when people argue that railguns are underpowered and show fits to prove that, people complain that the railguns have a niche of longer range."
4/8/2010,"well, to be precise the answer to the question lies on the premise of how do you want to affect blasters:1) leave blasters alone: increase by 15% the damage modifier of the turrets themselves, it will effectively mean a 15% increase to dps/alpha output.2) change blaster damage as well: increase the damage output of the hybrid ammo. maybe fiddle with its stratification for ranges a bit.whichever of the two options would in the end satisfy and address the issue railguns have.p.s. goumi"
4/8/2010,"my stance has been that any changes that result in an overall increase in damage by about 15% and a reduction in cap usage would serve well in addressing the viability of rails, tagami takes a slightly different stance i believe.so that's why people who fly these ships are cross training for apoc/zealot? you may be of the opinion that these ships preform admirably but since you've yet to conclusively prove such we'll be quite happy to think otherwise and think that rails are at the heart of the problem."
4/8/2010,"that is true. but you forgot to realize that if your tank in a fleet fight is warping before enough people alpha you, then so your dps is hitting before the enemy clicks warps. each one, since it depends on both the volley of each enemy ship and your ehp is always relative to both each ships ehp and each ships dpsthis means that the effects that reduce the strength of ehp also reduce by the exact same amount the strength of volley damage and dps. when this is the case(and it is the case), the maximizing solution again becomes maximizing dps x ehp.no, not in the least. the calculations that i have done are very large gangs. its why we have relative volley damage calculated(i.e. how many ships does it take to volley the other ship) and its why passive regeneration is not figured and its why the tanks are not fit with active repair units or tackling gear or rr.in very large situations, the maximizing solution of dxt (damage times time it takes you to die) reduces to damage x ehp @ range(where range is the specified engagement range the gang wishes to engage at)no, but you could do to read the one you have. you see, the basic concepts that you have listed there form relationships when you're discussing production(and consumption). in perfect competition, the price is the marginal cost of the good(both to producer and consumer). this is because producers will produce until their marginal cost is equal to their marginal revenue(which is the price) and so will consumers purchase until their marginal revenue is equal to their marginal cost(the price).the opportunity cost is also the price. to illustrate this easily, lets assume you have 5 dollars and can buy a sandwich. if you did not spend that 5 dollars on the sandwich you would have 5 dollars to spend on the ""next best thing"" of which, you would get 5 dollars. next we make the logical assumption that you always purchase in a maximizing method and when maximizing you will purchase items in quantities until mr(1)/mc(1) = mr(2)/mc(2) [for lack of a better notation on this board]. or, until the profit from purchasing each is equal to doing that of the other.because of this we can actually affix an opportunity cost to the 5 dollars you spent on the sandwich. which would be 5 dollars, since the marginal revenue would have to be just to the point of equivalency(or higher) or you would have bought something else.now if we aggregate that into all the costs and purchase decisions in a market we will find that the marginal cost to a producer to produce something is its price in the market and that is also its opportunity cost of making the goodnow, i said that we don't have to have perfect competition. which is a specific set of circumstances as it relates to a market. if you've been following market games and the literature surrounding them you would find that there does not need to be a large amount of people to quickly make the strategy in a market game for people to bid at the margin. which is to say to set the price to their opportunity cost which is to say that the price in the market is going to be equal to the opportunity cost.of course, none of this is dead 100% perfect. there are certainly welfare gains that occur and sometimes people will realize rents, but for the most part these are unimportant at the market level, even if that market level is relatively small. and even it it wasn't that would not change the socially optimal level of production/consumption."
4/8/2010,:p)
4/8/2010,i can't support changing the bonus this dramatically. at the very most give the ships that have the kinetic bonus a 2% bonus to the other missiles damage (similar to the hookbill but not 20% and 10%) would this suffice?
4/8/2010,"christ, is this thread still going on?hey, everyone? drop it. just drop it.yes, caldari missile boats need fixing. no it's not going to happen, no matter how much sense we make or what fixes we suggest. ccp regularly don't even fix complaints that get overwhelming support (for example, rockets, which still suck) and with this thread going on as long and being fought as bitterly as it has been, they wouldn't touch this issue with a ten-foot pole.it just ain't gonna happen, so it's honestly not worth arguing over any more. besides, no-one's going to convince anyone to see things their way- this is the internet. if you really feel you have to ""win the argument"" on principal then take it to ships and modules or some other forum. let the issue here die.peace all."

4/8/2010,"doomsdays in low-sec worked shortly after the release of dominion, ccp then stealth removed it without saying anything in the patch notes or in a dev-blog stating why it got removed.we all assumed it got removed to protect the old motherships (without the hp buffer) a little, since one got 2 shot by 2 titans in low-sec.since the old motherships got changed to supercarriers with a huge hp boost, now would be the time to change doomsdays back as they were.comment/flame/support, have fun.-sfs"
4/8/2010,bookmarking because sfs told me to
4/8/2010,"it got removed because there is no way to counter a titan reasonably in low sec due to the inability to use bubbles. it was a bug, was removed in the first patch and was listed in the patch notes./not supported"
4/8/2010,i heard tansien supports this.
4/8/2010,focussed points from hictors work perfectly
4/8/2010,sfs
4/8/2010,"a focused point is not a reasonable counter. a few hic's are too easy to counter. you need an aoe warp disruptor of some sort to reliably tackle a titan (or super carrier). also, low sec has restrictions besides aoe which further shift things in favor of a titan. it was a bug, i know a handful of people had fun solo owning everyone in low sec who didn't have a titan or 50 dreads on standby but get over it. they promptly and wisely removed that.how would you like to live in null sec with no cyno jammers, no bubbles and 100+ hostile titans 1-2 cynos away all the time? i think you would quickly change your mind on how good of an idea it is. low sec is dead enough as is, we don't need a couple douche bags running around in titans ganking the few people who actually scratch a living there."
4/8/2010,"definately support this. the changes to titans have devalued them slightly, this change would go some way to rectifying this. :)"
4/8/2010,ccp already said that they will bring it back in the last csm meeting in iceland. might want to read the minutes.
4/8/2010,"the minutes say a csm wanted it reintroduced, it did not say ccp was actually interested in doing so. only that they would look into it. it's a very bad idea, it basically destroyed low sec for the few days it existed. if you think low sec is dead now, just wait until 140 bored titan pilots scattered around null sec start hotdropping and one shotting everything bigger than a t1 bc. it will be great for the 140 or so titan pilots, going to suck for the other 400k+ players. i might actually cancel both my accounts, it's a game breaking change for low sec pvp and pve too."
4/8/2010,most things that got shot were station hugging carriers. for anything smaller you should ask yourself why you were sitting still so long that the titan could lock you.all in all i think lowsec dd will get more titans killed. which is a good thing no?
4/8/2010,"it destroyed low-sec because you couldn't station camp in your carrier anymore? any titan pilot without support will still be stuck in a system for 10 minutes after firing a doomsday. if at all, it should bring some more action if titan pilots start doomsdaying small stuff left and right. also the cancelling accounts argument really finishes it, lol.also, if in the next big patch supercapital insurance is going to drop down to 1-10% of the value i would also see this as another reason to re-introduce lowsec-doomsdaying. (lowsec station camping capitals are gay)please visit your user settings to re-enable images."
4/8/2010,"me, no, i don't station camp in a carrier. the lock time is too slow and the dps is terribly unreliable. not a big fan of station camping or gate camping anyways. i have no respect for station hugging capitals either. real men warp their carrier to a belt to fight an obvious trap and win anyways. however, you must look at it in more detail. what happens when you take 140+ titans that are 1 jump away from an area where they:1) can't be bubbled.2) will not face more than a handful of capitals since low sec lacks the resources for large capital fleets.3) are well within range of their own capital fleets if things go badly.i get what you are saying and understand your perspective. but i can't agree or accept it without some additional means to counter titans in low sec. right now the bored titan pilots want to go gank some ""noob pirates"" in low sec that are hugging a station in a carrier. but what happens when they run out of those? well, they are still basically invincible in low sec for the reasons i gave above. so they will go after other shiny stuff.suddenly navy mega's are worthy of a titan hotdrop, then normal mega's. eventually you find yourself dropping titans on t1 bc's. i've seen motherships do this plenty of times, don't think for a second that titans won't if they could actually hit them. the worst current offender i know of is invicta, i've watched them drop several motherships (back when they were moms) and 25+ carriers/dreads on solo bs's. there is no shortage of people who would do the same with a titan if it could one shot anything on grid save for another supercapital. i would do it myself if i could, and it's a good thing i can't because it's bad for gameplay.i also reject your idea that you can get away. my alt has a really nice cyno ship, it's called an arazu. it has a 64km warp disruptor range with recons 4 (overheated) and 20km+ with a scrambler. this is without leadership. i don't think your navy mega is really going to slow boat 20km without a mwd followed by another 44km in the 30 seconds it takes the titan to jump in and lock you. you also won't kill said arazu. it has a tank and can last atleast 30 seconds. even so i'd probably jam you either with the sensor damps or with some ecm drones. i don't think i'd actually put the ship in a situation where you might be able to kill it before you died."
4/8/2010,"what he said.carrier's, even dock monkeys, can be killed by a 20-30 man bs gang so hardly a valid reason for requiring dd's.consider that a titan will require roughly the same number of dreads to be killed before vanishing from log-off or jumping out.hic's will do nothing to a titan unless you have loads of them or a capital fleet on stand-by (in which case you are baiting the titan which can be done now as well).with no capital fleet you will lose a hic every ten minutes from titan dd, more from whatever support he brought with him. with a capital fleet you have to melt it in less than 15 minutes as he can log-off at any time.no bubbles = no dd (and no most low-sec denizens don't want the filthy bubbles either!)if on the other hand you were to make jumping into low-sec (ie. sovereign empire space) so insanely fuel intensive that it severely restricted the use of dd and capitals in general it might be worth it."
4/8/2010,make lowsec doomsday only able to activate on capitals within docking range of a station. problem solved
4/8/2010,not supported. people are already dropping dozens of motherships and carriers on small cruiser gangs or even solo battleships imagine what titans + doomsday in low sec would bring... soon we'd have 5 titans hotdrop small gangs and insta pop them. fuel costs etc most of those pilots couldn't care less about. it would ruin low-sec even more.
4/8/2010,"no thank you.high sec is already crowded enough without the refugees from lowsec doomdays crowding our stations and spaces lanes, whinging on about how concord won't let them do anything fun."
4/8/2010,"you do realize that you still would be able to use those guns to aggro the rats. as far as dps goes, the faster drones can go from target to target, the faster your over all dps for that mission is?i had missions/carebearing along with pvp in mind when i made the suggestion."

4/8/2010,"this is just mainly for pirates and the like of low-sec pvp lovers that loose sec very fast then want to regain it.so basicly its really easy to loose sec from 0.00 to -9.00 by just killing ships or pod kills and other means of loosing the sec, but gaining it is a mind numbing boring job that all pirates/low sec dwellers have to do more than once in there life but to get from -9.00 to at least -2.00 requires hours/days/weeks of none stop grindind of killing rats.now as iv read somewhere that the rats are loosing the juicy loot they loose (as in best named stuff that goes for 1 mill+) it would be nice to increase security gain from every rat so it doesnt take as long, but don't overpower the sec gain as it would cause problems like people going -5 then rattin in a few hours to 0.00 then rinse repeat.this would mean people logging on more as when you grind your sec up it gets boring and most people log and go play something else/goes out, which would benefit on the activity in eve and more pvp/other thingsi know its been mentioned a few times about sec gain vs sec loose but its never been looked into and altered and since we are loosing the juicy loot from rats i thought it is about time to revisit the sec gain from rats.(allso sorry about spelling)"

4/8/2010,"the logoff/overshoot technique was somewhat 'balanced' in that it took a lot of work to create these spots. a legal system for generating deep safes should retain this characteristic in some manner that makes generation of deep safes a task that is not undertaken casually.* methods could allow an increase of the safespot by only a small amount per iteration.* direction of new spots could be randomized so that new locations may or may not be deeper.* methods could cause damage or cap drain which necessitates pauses in the process. hull damage is especially good for this because it takes so long to repair using local reps.these factors can be combined in various ways, but not all are necessary.e.g. emergency warp - warps you a couple of au in the direction you're facing. to prevent this replacing station instawarp bookmarks we can either add a warmup time (so it's not instant) or hull damage. repeat this process until you're far enough out.random emergency warp - throws you a couple of au in a random direction, eventually you'll get far enough out.slingshot around the star maneuver - warp through the gravtiy well, pickup speed, come off in a random direction and end up slightly further out each time you do it. maximum safespot depth is then constrained by how far you can warp in a single leg.i strongly support a replacement of some sort, i just want to see something that takes time and effort."
4/8/2010,"in the beginning of 2007, ccp oveur revealed the project called ""need for speed"". it was an initiative within ccp to raise awareness of ""everything speed"". lag was to be defeated. as ccp oveur put it ""how can one conquer the universe at 1 frame per hour?"". the ""need for speed"" was very ambitious:the need for speed philosophy dictates a ratio of 6 improvements for 1 feature, thus keeping our focus on improving what's in there instead of bells and whistles (and perpetuating older issues).there was a lot of streamlining that came out of the ""need for speed"" initiative that has made new eden a far better place today. what i'm looking for, what i propose, is an equal mindset regarding balance. balance in an ever changing mmo is a monumental task, we all grasp that. this is not a demand for ""better balance"", this is a call for quicker remedies to the ""glaringly obvious imbalances"": the features, ships and modules that is never used due to their current shape and implementation.currently it takes far too long for ccp to correct newly introduced or reworked features. there are some mind boggling examples:- bombs were introduced in revelations ii and only adjusted to usability after 24 months.- black ops came with trinity and they still are not balanced.- rockets were changed, along with all other missiles in quantum rise, and are still considered inferior by the community.- assault frigates...now, granted, features like bombs have not been untouched in their 24 month road to salvation, there have been previous attempts to fix them. the problem is, that there has been no re-evaluation after each attempt, rather a note that the fix didn't work and that they got put back into the queue of stuff that needs to be fixed. but not at the top of the queue, rather at the bottom of it.so, if we could get a re-evaluation followed by necessary actions, of altered features within, say two months or the next major update, that would hopefully leave stuff like gimped black ops to the past. if we could get an equal initiative like the ""need for speed"", where ccp adjusts 6 existing features for every newly introduced one, we would not have to see one year old threads about fixing rockets on the first page of the test server feedback forum.so what needs to be fixed? this seems to be an issue where the csm could shine, if they were to be given a lot more influence. if there was a ""need for balance"" initiative where 6 issues are corrected for every new feature introduced, the csm should be the ones that determines those 6 issues. yes, the lot of them. the csm should not be bothered with how items should be balanced, just what needs to be balanced. and this is where they probably have a better insight than ccp themselves.tl:dr; - introduce ""need for balance"" where 6 issues are adjusted for every new feature.- a newly introduced or changed feature will be re-evaluated, and adjusted if needed, within two months.- give the csm heavy influence of what needs to be looked at."
4/8/2010,i really like this idea. supported.
4/8/2010,"considering that it would take far less time to balance a feature, than to design something totally new, i'm surprised that this sort of stuff isn't dealt with sooner."
4/8/2010,"ok, this is a bit of a far-out idea, so bear with me.first off, please note this proposal is not intended to be implemented now. it's intended to accompany walking in stations, when and if it ever comes out.a lot of people have expressed an interest in arena pvp and the alliance tournaments have always been very popular and fascinating events. however, other people have pointed out the difficulties inherent in the concept and indeed, it seems too difficult to be practical to set aside a section of space for uninterruptable, enforced-rules arena pvp.so the concept of walking in stations/ambulation/whatever gave me an idea- if you're looking for an activity to do while you're walking around in stations, why not include a multiplayer combat simulator where you can load a preset pilot, dial up a ship, form teams (or just set it to free for all), and blow the crap out of your opponents in a completely separate arena space? no chance of permanent ship or implant loss, no chance of cheaters mucking up the fun, nothing stopping you from using pretty much any fit you like. additionally, there's no actual profit from winning except possibly prestige if we include stat tracking, which will keep it from overshadowing or displacing the real pvp in eve. basically it's a minigame, with the added advantage that it can also double as a training simulator.and to get in before the objectors, if your issue is just that the idea doesn't interest you then you don't have to do it. come up with a real and practical objection to why it'd be an actively bad idea first (other than ""too hard to implement""- it could hardly be harder than ambulation itself)."
4/8/2010,not supported and that is why.
4/8/2010,"ccp already tried to do this and said it was impossible to accomplish. the game keeps hard track of losses and wins, and adding 'virtual ships' with 'virtual items' would double the item database (which is already overburdened).in addition, it would kill 90% of pvp in this game. pvp is essential to this game to create a dynamic economy. if this is implemented, the prices for pve depreciate to the point where there is no longer any profitability in mining. eliminating the pvp and the pve means this game crashes faster than the hindenburg.definitely not supported, and i expressed the same to ccp when they discussed a similar idea during my term on the csm."
4/8/2010,qft
4/8/2010,go back to wow if your scared to lose ships you *****.
4/8/2010,"that's not the point really as it assumes that it will not affect those that do not engage in it, when in fact it will and the more ppl that do it, the worse it will be for everyone else. because...1. real loss in pvp is the selling point of this game and despite what you think, a simulation of that as a lightweight option will detract from the real thing, be it in loss of targets, messing up the killboard stats with bad km implementation or any number of other reasons.2. we need the huge isk sink of pvp and while ppl are busy playing no loss arena pvp, they are not losing ships and then everybody from manufacturers, to traders, to pvpers and miners all start to lose out as the market dries up.please do not be so cavalier with what is basically the cornerstone of this game. not supported like i have never not supported any proposal here ever on this char or any other i have posted with."
4/8/2010,"actually dealing with this many people on a server gets very stressful and comes down to hardware speed. there is only so many read/writes you can do on a server with a set ram speed trying to do an insane amount of calculations, keeping track of every shot fired by every ship, everyone's health, boosts of every fleet, etc etc.the fact that they said it was possible is not untrue, in fact it is doable and has been done before. i hope the next server upgrades would make this much more stable.this is not the only game that suffers when server lag when the server gets essentially ddos attacked by information coming from clients, and eve seems to be doing much more processing then most when it comes to server side"
4/8/2010,"the problem: there are players that hide in npc starter corps as a way to avoid war decs. they go about their merry way, suicide ganking and the like, but you cant war dec them in high sec as a way of dealing with them.the solution: once you complete basic training, you get assigned your own default corp ""<player name>'s corp"", that has the single player as the ceo, no office, no wallet no assets, no tax and with all corp ""member"" settings fixed at full access. a very very basic framework.no one else can join the basic corp and the basic corp cannot join an alliance.if you ever join a corp and then leave that corp (or get kicked out) then you go back to your own personal base corp.since your own corp has no office and no assets no wallet, there are no fees for running the corp, and you never lose anything if you leave the corp to join a player corp.the only real use for this basic corp is that you can war dec (paid for out of your own funds) or people can war dec you. fees for a war dec against a single player corp could be reduced... maybe half of a normal player corp.when do you officially ""leave"" the rookie corps and transition to your own corp? any one of the following: - completing all of the missions from one of the three initial career agents (graduation) - accepting a mission from any agent other than the training agent or career agents (turned pro) - leave the training agent or career agents systems for more than 7 days, cumulative (dropped out)and once you leave .. you cant join a rookie corp ever again."
4/8/2010,so basically rendering the 11% tax useless?
4/8/2010,"dont worry, it is kinda useless already. the number of 1 men corp explode already, because they want to avoid that tax. :)"
4/8/2010,true... but there is no reason to say that a single player corp could not have an 11% task that is just siphoned off to nowhere anyway.
4/8/2010,"don't quite see the point of this. getting people out of npc corps, see, its a good thing, but potentially introducing thousands of single player corps? the databases probably wouldn't like that much.another thing. you say this is so people can't avoid wardecs? fine. tell me how many corps are willing to war dec solo corps? the only corps / alliances i can think of that'd be willing to waste isk on something like that are griefers.if you want people out of npc corps, forcing them is not the way to go. you need to provide an incentive to them, not put them in a straight jacket. introduce something that gives players in npc corps a reason to leave for their own interests, and they'll leave. forcing anyone to do something just causes problems, and is against the basic premise of the sandbox. not supported"
4/8/2010,"put them in the presiding empire's militia corps after they are no longer a noob...they can either join a player corp, or whatever, but can never rejoin a rookie corp."
4/8/2010,"how about a system similar to most mmos.corporations require a group of ~6 players to found a corp. to take it a step further, any corp who drops below this number will be disbanded.raise the npc tax to 15 or even 20%, and you will start to see an exodus from beneath the npc umbrella.if it were up to me, i'd take it even further and make switching corps require a 24 or 12 hour cool down, to prevent people corp-hopping away from war-decs. still makes it possible, but a pain in the ass at least."
4/8/2010,thus making new corps unable to anchor empire pos giving existing ones a permanent advantage.no thanx.
4/8/2010,how to alienate every single casual player in eve.yeah... great idea./me epic thumbs down.
4/8/2010,drake is it amazing what kind of things people try to get more weak targets?:)i mean going north to shoot things seems to be too dangerous for them ^^
4/8/2010,"lets get back to the initial problem.we all know that there are pirates that hang out outside the main trading hubs, and along trading routes, and that suicide ganks in high sec are an issue for many players.the care bear approach to handling this issue is to whinge and whine about wanting a gank nerf and removing insurance for concordable offences .. blah blah blah.the real way to deal with these pirates is to take the pvp back at them. war dec them and bring on the fight - keep blowing up their ships and hound them out of the system until they move on and its ""safe"" to use that trade route once more. (noting that no where in eve is safe, you just make that pirate move to another location).the problem is that many of these pirates operate under a rookie corp, so you cant war dec them. they are effectively untouchable.my proposal gets people out of the rookie corps and into corps (even a base model corp) where they are responsible for their actions. you annoy enough people with criminal activity and guess what, someone is going to fight back.all i am trying to do is to stop care bear pirates hiding behind the mothers apron of the rookie corps. you want to blockade the trade routes? fine.. go aheead - just be prepared for one of your victims to declare war."
4/8/2010,"fixed. seriously.. it's pretty hard to get suicide ganked unless you're making big mistakes. in over 4 years of playing it's never happened to me, and i can only think of one member of my corp that it's happened to. in that case he did something dumb.. set auto-pilot to jita and fell asleep on the way. his fault. this proposal is dressed up as ""anti-suicide ganker"", but i believe it's a stealth gank/grief boost."
4/8/2010,"when you drop out from a player owned corp you get automatically added to a npc corp - that's not exactly logical...what i dont get is why all players need to be obligatorially in a corp?why they cant go freelance? mmm... only time i've got actually ganked on the jita route was when alingning for warp to the next gate, not at gate entry - so autopilot or sleeping wasnt an issue there - there's nothing you can do if somebody passively target you with a ship capable to kill your in a single volley, you dont have even the time to see him blinking.and this in an iteroniii fitted with three inertia stabs ii - no cargo expanders, dunno wath else do to warp out faster..."
4/8/2010,the reason the war dec immunity of the npc corps exists is that newbies/solo pilots don't get war decced on and picked on just for lulz. making the newbies or anyone else without backup suffer just because u're incapable of safeguarding your own cargo...i don't think so.
4/8/2010,"i bolded the parts that you have wrong. npc corps are not to protect solo players.corrected, your argument loses its only dynamic:i don't support the ideas presented, but only newbies should be protected from war."
4/8/2010,"you can finish this up in a couple of hours, if memory serves. do you honestly think a player that new to the game knows which end of his ship is the front, much less how to deal with a war dec?again, you can do this immediately on logging in for the first time, if you really try. so i play eve for the very first time for an hour, fly out 1 jump, log off and then don't log back in for a week due to rl issues. when i get back, i'm suddenly in the deep end of the pool without a life vest, and with no idea of how to swim.your ideas are less about getting back at gankers and more about insuring the gankers have an endless supply of clueless victims to shoot at."
4/8/2010,i don't think chribba would be too fond of this...edit: not supported for reasons listed above.
4/8/2010,"i'm already in a single player corp.for all that it was filled with spam, silly questions and morons spouting political slogans a lot of the time, i miss the noob corp chat. no where else do you find that mix of total newbies, moderately experienced players and alts. entertaining and sometimes informative, but still something you can tune out without losing anything important. i've been in ""real"" corps, if not on this character, and even in a mid-sized 0.0 alliance never saw anything that could replace it on a sustained basis.reducing social interaction for new players is the last thing this game needs. i have to wonder if anyone at ccp has thought to collect stats on people who went from npc corp to 1-man to unsubscribing when the 11% tax went into effect."
4/8/2010,i would love to see this. i could dec all the ninja scoopers outside 4-4.
4/8/2010,"... or you could ask for the bounty system to be fixed so people would use the tool already in the game to take care of the problem. as is, it is fairly useless. perhaps make kill rights able to be traded in contracts. shift the focus of bounties from killing the pod to inflicting financial damage."
4/8/2010,"i think they should be removed yes. i like using them, but, it really is rather unfair for newer players who can't make their own anymore.excluding those with stuff dumped at them is a no-go. you left stuff in deep space, that's too bad. do it like with the secure can removal: give a notice, a brief time to go collect, and then delete them all.otherwise peeps would just go dump a shuttle or can at some of them, and retain their advantage indefinitely."
4/8/2010,supported but make that 20au as if you have a mission agent at the planet furthest away from the sun they will be at that range if sent off in a lucky direction.
4/8/2010,"it's fair, i made a 270au deep safe yesterday. not supported."
4/8/2010,not being able to do something anymore doesn't mean it is going to be removed or needs to be removed. see t2 bpo or highsec capitals
4/8/2010,"safespots need to be findable using combat probes so if any ""hard ceiling"" is to be used it should be 64au, which is the limit of their reach.one can only hope that when the insta-deep-safe gimmick is killed off in next expansion (read: log-off thread in test forum) ccp removes the ludicrous ones at the same time.they did purge deeps previously, a few years ago, but we always find new ways to create them so the precedent is there.ps: comparing it to removal of high-sec capitals and the lottery does not really make sense unless you have some way of duping a carrier or bpo"
4/8/2010,"you realize that you can make ""normal"" safespots in many systems that are greater then 15 or 20 au from the nearest celestial. if you are in habit of bookmarking missions as well you could easily end up outside of that range as well. i guess lets just ditch all the large systems and make warp speed totally meaningless.edit: both of your proposals are stupid btw."
4/8/2010,"one more thing, anyone here ever hear of deep space probes? they are designed specifically for probing out those in deep safe spots. they don't have their old 1000 au range but it's still crazy far."
4/8/2010,not supported. no reason why is given.
4/8/2010,"short and simple , under the contracts manager you can search for advanced laser crystal bpo, adv . hybrid ammo bpo , and adv. projectile bpo, but there is no adv. missile bpo. just like to get this added"
4/8/2010,"hi, i would love to see some cosmetic changes in eve.- pos structures are way to small. i can fit a carrier inside a sma but the carrier is twice the size.- some silly size things like the hyperion is just as long as the chimera. (it's just silly!)- scanning. bookmark text blocks your clicks.- could the scanning window have a toggleable grid so you can line up your probes better ?- missiles look like a glowy ball with a silly cone (all kinds of missiles look the same)- missiles do that weird hop when they are about to hit a target this is realy ackward.- missile ships fire missiles from the center and dont show any launchers.- the gas harverster makes a rock crumbling sound.- choice of fonts, eve fonts give a hard time reading them.- leave the scan signature names ( abc-123) for as long as the signature lives (dont change after dt)please add other cosmetic changes to this topic."
4/8/2010,"hint: proposals in the assembly hall are best served as one proposal per topic. that way the discussion can focus on one topic. big ""all the things i want"" topics tend to get less support as you cant really tick the checkbox if there are somethings you dont like."
4/8/2010,actualy no. its just one topic about cosmetic changes in eve that most of the time will just need some numbers changed.if i make 10 seprate topics some one else will tel me to put them together. so it stays this way.
4/8/2010,seems a logic next step and a necessity for us
4/8/2010,well that's not my intent.. i'm looking to get the look and feel of eve for external applications.
4/8/2010,"this issue, well forums moderation in general, were one of the big topics during last csm-ccp summit, and i seriously hope they will follow at least part of things we agreed on (i told you blood i will get it in one way or another :p ). so now we can only wait and see how this goes contrary to what ppl feel, csm does bring a lot of even ""forbidden"" topics to ccp, at least csm4 did. afaik not all are publicly known but they are brought up."
4/8/2010,"lol? play much? or not at all? how about the fact that i have had two characters logged in, in the same fight, and one gets an error message and disconnects, and the other one doesn't? i have been getting socket closure error messages at least once a day, sometimes as many as five or six times within an hour. it doesn't appear to be related to a specific account, as it randomly decides which one to disconnect, and which one to keep online."
4/8/2010,"i support this idea, although i have never had an issue with accounts being stolen on any game i play, even insecure web games i used to play in public libraries and such.however, i have to ask, why is everyone calling it a 9-key? it is a 10-key, as it has 10 keys (0-9)."
4/8/2010,"whew, it's a good thing nobody remembers your monster trucks replacing titans issue, unlimited csm term issue, selling your csm seat to the highest bidder, inappropriate public behavior as a csm, running a ""i've got boobs, vote for me"" campaign, and the general disservice you did to the csm process and player perception of the csms as a whole.that would've been embarrassing if somebody remembered. no worries though, it'll be our little secret can't wait for a repeat of all your clownish antics."

4/8/2010,i totally agree with the op. since the introduction of the rig sizes i considered that the cov-op ships are totally in need for a calibration boost or the grav cap upg rigs need to be lowered.the t2 small rigs are affordable and worth using them if you feel comfortable.
4/8/2010,"smuggling is very simple, fit a fast frig and run the gates. i have only gotten a few confiscation notices and have moved 1000's of boosters. when you get a notice, you just refuse to turn over the boosters and run. concord is completely unable to catch you and the fine is absurdly low.now from a customers perspective things are very different. most customers are very uncomfortable transporting boosters in their hold as they are not familiar with the mechanics and largely decide just not to use boosters at all. i can see a module that allows for safe passage of contraband creating a 10-15% bump in retail booster sales."
4/9/2010,"i can still gank hulks with destoryers for fun. but is there will be a gang gank a charon? lol almost never i think. the safest transportship shows now.and there will not necessary to use officers in deep null only.ppl are less likely to gank a 2b equipped target with 10 bss,for it costs 1b but not sure to drop all the modules.have fun with your gist x-larges! there is no necessary to join a corp for 00 ratting now."
4/9/2010,the upcoming insurance changes should pretty much do what is required anyway.
4/9/2010,"supported original thread, no insurance payout for concord kills.what's the change to insurance you speak of???"
4/9/2010,"shouldn't you at least find out what's going to happen already before demanding more changes?in short, insurance values will (in ~1 month) be determined by mineral values, and will be set to pay ~30% less than the mineral cost of the ship. so it will nearly always cost isk to lose a ship."
4/9/2010,"my bump, my bump, my lovely little bump!(c'mon ccp, give me a reason to fly enyos and hawks. and a web on my wolf.)"
4/9/2010,"there are roughly 2-3 ships that use beams. are they the savior of beams?the short answer is that if you have a couple ships that are problems and a couple ships that aren't. then common elements between them are unlikely to be a problem, or unlikely to be a problem to a significant level that it needs a wide fix.would you overpower 3 ships in order to make 3 others decent?i am not sure what you are saying. are you saying that lag is what is making sniping not as good as it ought to be? or are you saying that ships die in sniper engagements? because neither of these make my points invalid.lag is nuking sniper gangs not because it suddenly makes rr viable(after all, everyone has to get the broadcast, lock the target, and apply reps), its because it makes jumping in suicide and avoiding bombers even harder.bravo. now why do you say that, given the evidence, rails are sub-par?but does their ehp justify their alpha strike? or is that another personal benefit that detracts from the absolute strength of the gang?"
4/9/2010,"actually i have already addressed this. consider that the function for demand of a product is its private benefits and that, for the consumer, all costs are private.but the true utility of a ship is not its private benefits (which is to say, killmail height, personal preference, etc, chance of survival). but also its public benefits, which is to say the advantage of getting out and being able to come back in (to be targeted again), or keeping someones dps on you a second longer(increasing everyone else's damage by the time they're shooting you compared to changing targets multiplied by their dps).there is also information availability issues (you do not notice the times where you would have survived if you had more hp relative when when you would not have and similarly you do not notice times that, if you had less ehp you would have died rather than surviving. if you're not shot, you don't notice survivability but do notice damage).all of these combine to mean that the true social benefit is not considered by the player when he chooses his ship. its also why logistics and e-war aren't flown as often as maximizes the strength of the gang.since, for the most part the costs are entirely private(or equally subsidized) there is a distance between the optimal demand and the realized demand for the good. this reduces the quantity consumed relative to what it ought to be.this is very basic economics relating to externalities(specifically positive demand externalities)."

4/9/2010,"can you elaborate on this please? tank is 2x cdfes, 1xem-screen, 1x invu, 1x lse, dcu ii. do you use 2x sebos? if not, why? how do you get the 396dps @197 optimal? just curious, to see the operations, so i don't jump the gun.i actually do rig my rokhs, but rigs skew the comparison, since the apoc can pile on even more dps and/ or ehp, while the rokh can't do so.for example, 3x magstabs + collision accelerator rig on a rokh do not produce enough dps to reach 2x heat sinks and a + collision accelerator rig on an apoc.in reality, apoc is even better number-wise if rigs are taken into consideration, because it can shift the buffer to rigs (trimarks) and sport 3x heatsinks, increasing the damage output even more.btw, i did humor goumi on his rantings about ehp, but the truth is that ehp is a threshold variable. that threshold is 56k damage (7 bombs), after that, the bombing run must be perfect (good luck in this lag), so that the first bombs do not kill the later ones. and you need just enough buffer to be able to warp out.(yes, goumi, we learned this the hard way, when goons bombed us on a jb. in eve, as in rl, you adapt or die. guess who didn't adapt?). once you reach that threshold (56k ehp), your gains from increasing your ehp are overtaken by the gains you could get from assigning those slots to other attributes, like tracking, locking range and even cap.to wrap this up, if someone is saying that a rokh with 120k ehp*190 dps is equivalent to a 380 dps*60k ehp apoc, maybe he should lobby so that these two ships trade places, or better yet, stop trolling."
4/9/2010,"quoting this, so you can't back out of it. now turn to the chapter about efficiency. you might also want to read up on benchmarking.what you seem to forget is the fact that there is no real market when we are talking about fleet snipers. there is the manufacturer (alliance industrial arm) that has to meet a demand (number of alliance bs pilots).therefore, your objective function is to maximize production for given resources. the opportunity costs in this case can be measured in resources as well and as they increase they decrease your objective function (as is the case with the rokh).it is obvious that you still fail to comprehend what you have been babbling about, and you keep contradicting yourself. you talk about opportunity costs, but do not take them into consideration when trying to optimize production. you talk about the fact that the weapon system (railguns) does not possess the expected characteristics and thus is not utilised as much as it should be, but refuse to accept that railguns under-perform.by the way: the marginal price in the market is the cost to produce something and that is also its opportunity cost of making the good, not the other way around.if you sell bellow cost, you are investing in market share and should have a long term plan to recover losses, usually through increased sales volume and after-sale services/ accessories. you really need to start paying attention when you are studying that textbook."
4/9/2010,"1)yes its a 2sebo fit. i got the 369dps@197k opt by taking [(amoxdmgmod)x#]/rof. range was aquired via: base rangex170%2)i agree that the apoc(tachy) is a much better boat especially when rigs are added into the mix ....its why i have been laughing my a** off during all this ""megabeam"" crap. (its a p. terribad way to balance imo.) i put rigs on the rokh because thats what arrador had, and i put trimarks on everything else as a way to mitigate the ""but the rokh haz rigz!!!"" objection. just trying to compare apples to apples as best as possible (lol).3) i assume the rest of your post is really in regards to goumi? or should i go back and bother to read it?"
4/9/2010,"you don't know what you're talking about do you? there are really two efficiencies we could talk about. pareto efficiency, and welfare efficiency. either of these situations will meet pareto. welfare efficiency as an arbiter isn't considered until we're considering externalities and would have to do with a policy choice.benchmarking is a business process by which companies attempt to find minimum cost production methods by examining competitors. its going to be assumed in any model discussed here since we're abstracting production methods and assuming they're the same. i am really not sure why you brought it up.(well, internally or externally examining. either way it doesn't really matter)except there is a real market since there are people to consume the good and people who produce the good. the method and means of exchange might be different than you expect, but you have the same situation and can model it in roughly the same manner.your objective production function then is to maximize profit(however you define profit) given demand and resources. the opportunity costs are the same as they were in the previous situation (the hauling cost and mineral prices) which again, will be factored into your cost considerations. the demand here is a bit trickier, because it could be either social demand if your alliance is smart and is able to force pilots to fly ships(if they are not smart they may incorrectly determine social demand). or it could be private demand(if they are unable to force pilots). or it could be something else entirely(if they're dumb and are able to force pilots)if its social demand they should be producing more rokhs than they are now. they ought to be because as has been shown, they are quite good ships, better than the competition in that instance. if its private demand, then all of the arguments that had been put out earlier work.in either case, the opportunity cost questions have the same answer.(indeed, since we can expect that your alliance has examined the cost of production via benchmarking we can also assume that your costs are similar to market producers elsewhere and that while you may extract rents, your opportunity costs are roughly the same)no. it is not that it possesses ""unexpected characteristics"" its that the social benefit of the ship is different than the private benefit.""investing in market share"" isn't possible in eve where any all goods are the same, you cannot have brand loyalty(at least not on the market, and within your internal market this is very unlikely), after-sale services/accessories don't exist, and there are no stores to go to(i.e. transaction costs involved in finding competitors). it also would have no effect on the outcome since it would happen to both goods.these points are entirely extraneous to whatever it is you're trying to say."
4/9/2010,"benchmarking is defined as ""measuring your performance against that of best-in-class; determining how the best-in-class achieves those performance levels; and using the information as a basis for your own targets, strategies and implementation."" if you think it applies only to production methods, you are dead wrong.the same techniques can be applied to compare systems in general. the most important attribute of benchmarking as a technique is that it is heavily dependent on the definition of-best-in-class. the simplest ways to define best-in-class of several systems in use is to measure:1) ""market"" penetration/ share (which in eve pretty much means counting fleet compositions/ km damage by ship).2) measure directly the comparable attributes (dps, ehp, cost) as they apply to the operative envelope of the systems under scrutiny.important concepts in this process is to define which characteristics of the ""product"" (in this case the ship+weapon system combination) are those that apply to the operative envelope (tactical situations that ship+w/s combination encounters) and whether these attributes are continuous, step or threshold (binary) variables.eve is a deterministic system so it is pretty much easy for us to define hard limits (tactical envelope: 170-190km engagement range) and measure each system's performance attributes ( rokh: 321 dps when using such and such modules) and costs (120 mil to buy a rokh in jita, needs 12k trit to build). the argument underway boils down to how best utilise the characteristics of each system. goumi proposed that a single metric be used (dps*ehp/isk) and we went along, mainly because it is an easy one off comparison. however, a univariate model does not always reflect the true underlying structure.if we forget that the ships we are looking at have multiple dimensions and each one of those dimensions acts as a continuous increasing function (the more, the better, not necessary linear) as long as it does not exceed a utility threshold, then we will produce fallacious arguments. after that threshold is reached, there is no reason to keep increasing that attribute, but instead, other dimensions of the system must be explored.in the case of ships, too much ehp (threshold that varies according to operating doctrine) and too little dps (threshold that varies according to operating doctrine) is failure to fit properly. there is a relative consensus as to what are the minimums in these values and that is what drives most of this discussion.of course, that's where goumi fails because, he is saying that a rokh with 120k ehp*190 dps is equivalent to a 380 dps*60k ehp apoc. if that is the case, maybe he should lobby so that these two ships trade places.better yet, he can prove us wrong by training caldari and flying overtanked rokhs exclusively from now on, demonstrating how survivable he is in fleet fights ."
4/9/2010,"yeah guomi's idea about ehp is as important as dps and realy nothing else matters in fleet fight is a huge fail. it has been proven many times this thinking is wrong, thats why they come to wrong conclusions.apoc is superior to rokh in every situation especially now that there is no fleet killing dds."
4/9/2010,"a 15% increase to the turret damage modifier means you just need to multiply all damage output by 1.15, since all the calculation are based on that number. my calculations show that for a 15% dmg mod increase (x1.15) and reduction to +70% optimal for spike (x1.7) you get: 369 dps (3x magstabs) and 183.6km optimal. not a bad trade off in my book, especially if you have to use 2x tcs to track as good as aurora.well, it was either using megabeams and arguing about giving the equivalent in fittings railgun (425mm) some more dps, or arguing that bigger railguns are needed (which wouldn't fit on either railboat). i obviously elected to take the easy road . what would you use to compare the 2 weapon systems?remember, medium railguns suffer the same issues, and we need to have at least comparable fitting requirements.trying to educate goumi is an exercise in dementia, don't bother."
4/9/2010,"called ""alpha strike"". which is why you keep saying the rokh will destroy the apoc in x salvos. rather than saying x rokhs will kill the apoc.this is patently false. companies produce past this point often (most noticeably during a price war). equilibrium is the point where efficiencies of scale is greatest. in an economy driving production and prices beyond that point is a signal that the market has matured. opportunity cost is a valuation metric, not a price metric. it has nothing to do with supply side and everything to do with demand. people have a different opportunity cost for the same product because there are an infinite number of factors involved in actually computing that value. so, for the opportunity cost to be the price, the product would have to be priced differently for each consumer.and here's where we get back to other ships can hit a railgun ship from its max range for more alpha and usually more dps than the railgun ship can send back at them. there are only two cases where this is not correct, the rokh (by a small margin) and the eagle. in both cases, the game mechanics work against fighting at those ranges. this has nothing to do with the right ship in the right circumstance. railgun ships are simply never the right ship. this is why we are saying they lack a niche.... and this has what to do with the niche of railguns?then why aren't you flying it? why aren't more people flying it? i fly the harbi because it can track and do damage. two things the ferox can't do.not true. and not true."
4/9/2010,"i""m trying to figure why he lobbies ehp so much, but then turns around and states that sniper battles should be instantly alpha'ing the enemy ships.i'm waiting for irony to go into overload if i hear him complaining about blobs."
4/9/2010,"last weekend, i ran a gang that successfully put 17 bombs on a bs fleet jumping through a gate (cycled launches while they aligned). all the support died, some bcs and a geddon. the sniper bss survived (because of the time lag between launches a bs can align and warp before taking enough bombs to die).since most sniper bs are aligned and can warp out if confronted with something like this (i'll admit, the above case was pure luck), they only need a minimal tank for their function (2-3 tank modules)."
4/9/2010,with 1 tracking computer (no script) you get 197km. this was inside your engagement sphere so i left it.with tracking script it is indeed 184kmwith range script its 210km iirc... i am not on the computer with the info.
4/9/2010,"regardless, this doesn't give railguns a niche, but at least makes them useful."
4/9/2010,"exactly. it just pushes the mega to being a shorter range version of the tachypoc with slightly better dps and roughly equivalent (mega is .0002 better) tracking... just with a better dmg profile.in general people still wont fly the rokh.*this is why i dont really support the idea.*this will make a mega roughly equivalent to an already borderline op ship, while doing very little to make the rokh a mainstream ship. (though as i said earlier this is a problem of it shield tanking mostly. without changing that you would have to make it op to be used regularly...but then everyone would use that in snipefleets because its op.)in the end rails still wouldnt have a niche, but i would definately be enjoying my 250dps railranis"

4/9/2010,"it does when you reference it to a discussion of the costs of production, yes. unless you're saying that the graphs and work that i did do not reflect benchmarking...1) does not work when external benefits are present2) you must have a correct model. you do not have a correct modelthat is actually tri-variate(dps is a variable, ehp is a variable, isk would be a variable). (and i use dps*ehp). the trick is that the maximizing structure is the combination of the two(isk and dps) is the combination of the two in that manner.this part about having too much ehp and too little dps. yea, that part is wrong so long as you've maximized the two of them together (specifically when ehp x dps is maxed %dehp= -%ddps = maximum total damage).(the actual maximizing process throughout a gang is slightly more complicated but inefficiencies(in this case, lower total damage output over a fight) do not occur because because of gang level maximization by dps x ehp but rather individual level maximization which does not properly account for social benefits.they are indeed equivalent in uniform fleets. in non-uniform fleets they are not equivalent. but we aren't balancing to make the rokh and apoc equivalent we are balancing to make the rokh a better sniper.and at 120k ehp * 321 dps it certainly is better than whatever apoc you want to fit.would i benefit if the rokh and apoc changed places, if i could fit a 190km apoc that did 321 dps? certainly. so would most of eve who has currently trained apocs due to private benefits(or, as i did, due to other factors). would it be good for the game? probably not"
4/9/2010,"yes, and it takes fewer rokhs to kill the apoc than it takes apocs to kill the rokh. so the rokh is better at ""alpha strike""those are the same thing(when there is no active tank). if it takes 1 rokh 20 salvos to kill a target, it takes 20 rokhs 1 volley to kill it(or rather, 20 rokhs shooting once is equal to 20 rokh/salvo's.uhhh no. price wars drive prices down to the marginal cost. if they go below, companies fail(its marginal cost is above the market price and so it does something else or reduces production until that point). if they go below intentionally they are attempting to gain market share(which is to say they are reducing profits in order to make more in the future). but market share is not possible in eve. there are no brands, no brand loyalty, no storefronts...yes, it has something to do with the demand side and supply side. see, it costs a company money to make stuff. what they lose in order to make stuff, is the ability to make anything else. or ""the opportunity to make something else"" or ""the opportunity cost"". opportunity cost is always a price metric and never a valuation metric(you're thinking of utility), it measures the ""next best thing that could have been gotten"". for instance if you had $10 and could buy 2 shirts or 1 baseball. the opportunity cost of the shirt would be 1/2 baseball and the opportunity cost of the baseball would be 2 shirts.fortunately we have a handy ""unit of account"" called ""currency"" that we can then list simple numbers for these things such the opportunity is the price of the object. the reason that opportunity cost looks like value is the ""next best thing"". but that is only there to ensure that costs are ordered rationally according to preferences(such that a model of individual consumption does not simply identify quantity and price, but also utility) and to ensure that when there are three things on the market and you have the money to buy one, the opportunity cost of buying one of them is not the sum of the other two( since you would have only been able to get one)because training for it is expensive when i already can fly a gang sniper(that i gained as a secondary benefit to training megapulse geddons and lol-locus rigged apocs). i would have to train rails and caldari bs. i would much rather train for other things and lose out on the better sniper since i have one that is currently good enough.incorrect. the amount of tank depends on the engagement, not simply whether or not they survive a bombing.(though the rokh of course, would be better at that, and better at being able to re-engage later)"
4/9/2010,"... and the apoc would become 1-dimensional, functional only as a long range ship (blaster rokh, really?). also, it would have to shield tank. and it would have less than 10% of the apoc's tracking. and the price of the hull would be 30-40m more (don't start with talk about insurance reimbursement, ccp has already stated that insurance is going to be heavily nerfed for these ships).still interested? how about we also change most of the ships using the same spaceship command skills to missile ships?still interested? lies."
4/9/2010,"that mega compared to 3xhs tachypoc does a tad more rawdps and a tad less rawalpha at 12km less optimal. after dmg profile is taken into consideration the mega outperforms the 3xhs tachypoc....even at 190km. i will post a chart when i get home (and include the fit on the tachypoc)regardless however, what i was insinuating is that the tachypoc is already borderline op. meaning that balancing to a tachypoc is pretty questionable.*sorry for quick and dirty post...in a rush atm. will make better poast later."
4/9/2010,"the apoc already is one dimensional. its a long range ship(yea, you can go long range pulses, but for the most part you want an abaddon or armageddon). i would have no problem with it shield tanking(my skills support that fine, but i could see others who do not have that luxury having an issue) and don't really have an issue with the hull price increase.not sure how you say it would have 10% of the apoc's tracking (if you want you can fit faction ammo and add tracking computers(optimal) in order to run much much better tracking than the apoc) but i've no problems with the rokhs tracking.ahh, so that is the issue? its that you don't want to have to train up missiles and rails? that one i cannot sympathize with, its not like it wasn't known before you started(and if you're gallente the train to caldari bs 5 is not exactly onerous compared to training another weapon system)edit: then again my character is training missiles at the moment...edit: re insurance:""we have our own ideas for how much of the full insurance value we want to payout for each ship class which generally is 100% for tech 1 ship groups""so it looks like it isn't going to change much. and since it will be percentage based the end value won't be a huge problem."
4/9/2010,"you mentioned this but didn't conclusively prove that this is the case for the railboats vs the laserboats and i responded to it anyways and you've yet to present a suitable counter-argument, let me repeat myself.your argument is roughly that ehp is of equal value to dps, i and many here disagree for a plethera or reasons. your example of choice is a battle of equally sized fleets one-volleying each other at sniper range a situation where ehp actually has little to no value until after your fleet has already started to win for other factors. you've consistently pointed out that if one side has higher ehp targets then the other then less damage is required to destroy a target, however when one-volleying each other this becomes almost completely meaningless. regardless of your target's ehp you're going to have your entire fleet or if it's large enough independently led portions of your fleet firing, your volley damage is essentially fixed based on how many ships are being given the same primary. now since nobody wants to have to put another volley into a target the number of ships given that primary will be aimed towards a high and 'safe' volley damage, say 100k ehp, this may be overkill but you don't know what your enemy will bring so it's best to assume worst case scenario. since you only have decent knowledge of your own ships you can't plan your organizational structure around the enemy's expected low ehp, you can plan for your own side's high volley damage/dps though. without knowing what the enemy is going to bring you have to aim for the higher ehp 'just in case' but also to help buffer against attrition during the battle. as a result where it takes 36-54 (2763-1842 alpha)* apocs working together to have a 100k volley it takes 60 rokhs (1688 alpha)* to achieve the same thing, in short a fleet of apocs can target and destroy more ships simultaneously then rokhs, your premise and theory on the value of ehp is wrong.qft, if tachs have damage and fitting requirements that can't be compared to anything else in the game then they shouldn't be in the game, period, otherwise they should be considered when balancing other weapons systems with one of the drawbacks of tachs being seen as it's fitting requirements.there's a program called eft, you might have heard of it, try using it and you'll notice how horribly wrong you are, for the record the alpha of 3x damage mod rokh is 1688 and a beam apoc sits at 1842, the tach apoc at 2763. next time bring some facts and figures and fits that you're basing your speculation off of.*this based off 3x damage mod setups a beam and a tach setup for the apoc"
4/9/2010,"incorrect. since the rokhs have more ehp it takes more ships to kill them.(excess damage is rarely wasted in eve, you should always be locking another target.this means that your enemies ""considerations of 100 ships"" is wrong and more of your ships will survivethe issue is very simple.if ehp does not matter, then volley damage(or dps) cannot matter. it always takes volley damage in order to get through ehp and as ehp is increased it always takes proportionately more volley damage.if you are complaining that ehp does not matter than any complaint about dps and volley damage also cannot matter. that would make your complaints about having low dps irrelevant.actually i did, and the ehp of the rokh is such that it still takes many more apocs, even considering resistances to kill it than it takes rokhs to kill apocs.to expand: this means that if you bring this fleet and the opponent brings the other, the rokh fleet will volley more ships each fire than the apoc fleet will. (and it will have a better rof iirc). or: if you bring the rokh fleet, you will volley more ships than the enemy will compared to if you had brought the apoc fleet.numbers were figured with non-fail fits in eft and naughty boys eve dps spreadsheet(which is actually accurate as compared to eft graphs)"
4/9/2010,not to be a busy body in your fight....but tachypoc that does 2763alpha requires 8 tachs... which makes it virtually impossible to have all the other necessary trimmings. 7-tach apoc = ~2400 alpha.not that it really matters if your just trying to say who has the most rawalpha (didnt really bother to read...just saw the number)
4/9/2010,"production costs were referenced in a discussion about benchmarking as another attribute for comparison, not the other way around, please pay attention and stop trying to derail the discussion. we are discussing railguns and what are the attributes that would make their performance balanced, in comparison to laser turrets and artillery, when used on the properly bonused ships.during the discussion it was mentioned that the rokh, one of the ships that are primary choice for railguns, has a number of drawbacks, including high production costs.define external benefits. divine intervention helps apocs do more damage?does eve report wrong numbers for the damage output of the ships? is the database corrupted? how is my model wrong, when it is based on a deterministic system? if you can fit a rokh that produces more damage than an apocalypse at the same range, has the same tracking, ehp and cost, please amaze us. until you can come forth with one, you are trolling, failing at it, proven wrong and laughed at.efficiency. you still fail to get it, right?furthermore, as much as you are trying to sell it, any fleet bs over 60-65k ehp is an overtanked failfit, does not perform as should in the fleet. the fleet's primary function is too deliver damage, not be a target. if you are not delivering damage, you are crap, crap are dropped behind.that pretty much describes the woes of the rokh1) wtb uniform fleet. not really, but it shows how benighted you are.2) balance = make them equivalent, but not identical. this shows how way off reality you are goumi. you are not interested in balnce, you just wanna clutter up the thread with your drivel.goumindong:a person that dismisses pulsepocs that easily and states that he would happily shield tank a sniper apoc... goumi, your fitting failures keep on amazing me..what is the exploit that let's you redirect damage fired at one ship to another you have locked? i think that the devs and the banhammer would like to know. conversely, you are just talking out of your anterior and trying (and fail) to confound the issue."
4/9/2010,"quick answer as well:1) mega will be already in falloff and thus have lower raw damage.2) op or not, it is in the game and unless we start asking about making it impossible for the apocalypse to fit them, tachs must enter the equation. however, to keep it fair, railguns should never be the equivalent of tachyons. remember, the primary reason for this discussion is turret balance in all sizes and a way to address the fact that railguns do not perform as well as arties and beams."
4/9/2010,"not hardly. i have beam and pulse apocs. both are fantastic ships. one is the best sniper and the other is a fantastic rrbs.tachs have about 50% better tracking than 425mm. megas are about 60% better than 425mm. i had the tracking difference of arties and rails mixed up. it remains a noticeable difference.i have over 10m sp in missiles and over 11m sp in guns. i am pointing out that, unlike amarr, the other races have split weapons systems requiring skill training in two difference categories that do not overlap.not true. this means the reimbursement for the apoc will drop something around 10m and the rokh will drop about 40m. this is noticeable."
4/9/2010,"every second you stay alive your gang does damage. you, as the ship getting shot, do not realize these benefits. every time you are able to stay alive when you would have have before hand, you are able to re-enter the fight and become a target again(and you likely will become a target again). you, as the ship becoming a target again, do not realize these benefits, but rather, the other ships on the field realize those benefits.this is compounded because its difficult to see those benefits(which means that your brain does not account for them rationally, but rather under-reports them due to hueristics) while its very easy to see the benefits of ships with high dps.i have already produced a rokh that has a stronger ability in fleets than the apoc. you simply refuse to see it.no fleet is designed to be a target. such ehp never matters. such you should never tank anything ever. yea, that is pretty dumb.ehp increases your survivability which increases your total damage output. its that simple. its for that same reason that people fly snipers(because an enemy cannot damage what it cannot hit and every little bit out of your opponents falloff you get you get more tank)then buy one. but i should have been more concise. fleets do not have to be entirely uniform for that to work. and the rokh is not a straight equivalency in ehp x dps with the apoc, it has more ehp x dps than the apoc.balance is not that, there is no such thing as equivalency in eve.pulse pocs are just another form of lr apoc. they aren't snipers like they used to be. if you're expecting to be engaging under 45km you should be in an abaddon/geddon. not that i don't love a pulse poc, but for anti-support you're probably better off in a zealot(or just using long range guns anyway) and for fast work you certainly are.as for shield tanking it. yes, if it had 6 meds and a resistance bonus to shields like the rokh, i would happily shield tank it.its called ""locking the secondary target"". you see, when you're engaging a ship and it explodes before you activate your guns, you can then click on the other target and activate your guns on them. if it doesn't then you haven't wasted dps(certainly not much compared to your fleets dps), your damage was applied to the ship in some fashion."
4/9/2010,"oh, come on, you can do math. if the reimbursement for an apoc goes to 10m, then it will be 14m for the rokh assuming a rokh costs 118m to build(current eft market price, too lazy to check in game) and an apoc 82m to build.the extra cost for the apoc's ammo is more than that(ammo for apoc > ammo for rokh due to crystals ammo amounts)and i was pointing out that it doesn't matter. its a different argument than ""omg lets boost rails""you should be using a geddon for an rrbs."
4/9/2010,"this is a big deal when replacing ship losses. also, i haven't seen you in forever.... welcome back. :)-liang"
4/9/2010,"i don't think that the ammo is that big a deal. makes it a pain to move the ship sometimes, but the end cost... eh. whatever. i was just stating that unless the change in insurance was massive its unlikely to have a big effect on costs of the ships. module costs are much more important.i'd say its good to be back, but look at this place"
4/9/2010,the op brings up an interesting solution with the all missiles doing at least 25% kinetic damage and then the ships bonus applying to all missiles.

4/9/2010,"and now you can easily gank those carrier/super carrier gangs that like to hot drop with an even more expensive hotdropall it was, a nerf to station games and gave a chance to strike at almost invulnerable jfs in lowsec. titan pilots that continue to hot drop single battleships will eventually be removed of their titan by someone with more brain power, most likely using titans to kill his titaneve is an arms race... i say let them use the bfg!"
4/9/2010,totally.lowsec needs more risks for those people who are not in power blocks or part of naptrains. especially those that are audacious enough to try and drop a pos down.its time they adapted or died... or just went back to highsec.
4/9/2010,fixing the station hugging carrier problem is not worth making it so that solo pilots in pimped out subcaps die instantly to a titan.
4/9/2010,"it's still a difference if you buy one or can afford to buy one.also you implied that anyone, who does not want to afford an overpriced console, has no job.you are a generalizing idiot.also, i dont know if you get a life, dont ask me doode.edit: spelling"
4/9/2010,"i can afford one and i will buy an xbox 360 or playstation 3 not just for dust 514. i'm buying it so i have other nice games to play that will come out in the future.do you really think i'm gonna buy a ps3 or xbox 360 just for dust 514?. if you think that, then it's not me that is the idiot here.now what's your next dumb excuse?."
4/9/2010,"wow, 11 supporting posts out of 188.pretty sure the consensus is ""gb2wow""."
4/9/2010,"yes i changed my mind. bs could be more slow which may bonus good cooperation.what blow was my thinking.re:yes i somewhat agree the warp speed could be changed due to mass, which may make shield tanked ships more usefull in large combat.but making the difference initial would cause problemdon't forget align time and acceleracion time are already affected by the mass.for instance:now,as i tried, a t2 frigate (1.88x agl) takes around 3 sec to start warp at max speed,(destination is exactly to the back); less than 2 sec in acceleration from 0 speed (align destination).and bs takes more than 20 sec from max speed to turn its head(sorry for the assumption i'm currently in a frigate and wouldn't back atm); costs at least 8 sec in acceleraction from 0 speed (align destination).after your modification, for example,int takes 1 sec in acceleration; bs take 12 sec in acceleration,both from the speed 0m/s ignore crs and bcs between atm.what will happen:for frigates it boosts almost nothing, except the bombers,they already hard to catch. i'm sure you will not stop your int so the warp just costs max 3 sec to start.if you know how to do it just costs around 1.5 sec usually."
4/9/2010,"what the hell? so your massive battleship should have a chance to escape versus a capable interceptor pilot? you're not making any sense. and kaz, you're not making any sense either. changing grid does not imply session change, session change is jumping, docking, etc. how else would you explain being able to hop grid borders in an instant?"
4/9/2010,well i am sure kaz knows a lot about fast ships. :) he used to race in eve :)and not bad i have to say.
4/9/2010,"absolutely agree.currently, all ships follow the exact same acceleration profile (it's exponential, so it takes the same amount of time to double the warp speed no matter what ship or warp speed), and deceleration profile (again, exponential, but in reverse).the only factor maximum warp speed has is, obviously, to limit the attainable warp speed. a carrier will accelerate to top warp speed at the same exact rate as a shuttle. of course, the shuttle will accelerate longer as it has a higher top warp speed.for a short warp where the terminal velocity is below the maximum warp speed of two different ships, those two ships will follow identical acceleration/deceleration profiles."
4/9/2010,"/supportedthere should be a connection to the mass of the ship.empty or full cargo should be a difference in acceleration, but not in end speed.i dont understand why the speed of the ship is important, a large freighter can be as fast as a small frig, just the acceleration is important.we are not in water, we are in space. this should be sorted out somehow, still eve looks like a submarine simulation. correct this please."
4/9/2010,"bombers are really starting to get out of control. everyone knows how great a tactic they are, but also what a huge pain in the ass they've become. my only real complaint is that they are removing the ability to fight on grid for extended periods of time, which can be highly frustrating for both sides that just want to have the good fight. so with that in mind, here's 3 things i think can change that won't really hurt bombers effect, but will free up fights.1) extend the bomb launch time from ~ 2 minutes with good skills to closer to 7-10 minutes. 2) increase the flight time of bombs from 3.5 seconds back to the original 5 seconds. the reduction in time has made it way to easy to use 20+ bombers at a time simply because lag creates enough separation where the bombs don't destroy each other. 5 seconds reduces that problem and makes launching more than 8 bombs more reasonable as was originally intended.3) decrease bomber agility by 10% base. that means their 5.8 second warp time with max skills will go to about 6.5 seconds. if you add 1 inertial stab 2, it should take warp time down from an original 4.5 seconds to about 4.95 seconds. 2 inertial stabs originally 3.9 seconds up to 4.3 seconds.the agility change is only because of the change in the cloaking ability of bombers where it's impossible to see them coming. i personally am not a fan of completely nerfing bombers, and even this is probably a bit much. but it's getting to the point where every fight that bombers are around, the 10-20 bombers are creating far more havoc than the other 200 in fleets. to me, that just isn't kosher fun for everyone. i would be fine with bombers as they stand if instead ccp created more warp options, especially with fleet warps, or changed probing back to it's originally 30 second time. as it stands now, by the time everyone has loaded grid, they're already probed and bombers likely already in warp before there's even a chance to spread out. and warping at spread ranges still offers bomber food and shouldn't be necessary. why is it i can have a fleet spread in a 60km bubble on 1 grid, and fleet warp pulls them all to 5km sphere when they land. fleet warp should retain separation. until that can happen, bombers need to be slightly more limited.as for the north, both sides have benefited heavily from bombers. and dodging them has it's elements of fun. but **** sake when you cant even load grid before getting bombed, something's wrong. and neither side should have to deal with that."
4/9/2010,and all that because rol vaporized your fleet?i think your real grip is the grid loading and not so much the bombers.not supported. they are fine in the current way.
4/9/2010,bombs fly for 10 seconds at 3km/s.
4/9/2010,learn to form up inside the pos next time rather than whine that an anti-blob mechanism effectively countered your blobnext up: how cloaked ships are overpowered because i can't see them
4/9/2010,forming up inside the pos is for wimps. :)it is way more fun to read on caod about 13bombers getting 100kills ;)so nc please ignore malcanis. form up outside of the pos please!! :)
4/9/2010,"i don't know if this has to do with the bridgebombing, if you're referring to loading grid or not- remember bombers making a run have to load grid as well.... for every time a fleet gets caught and bombed, there are many times when a fleet is aligned and able to warp out before a bomb can even be released.the bridgebombing incident... live and learn i guess, but that's to blame on the fc, not the bombers.i love my bomber, i kill a lot of ships in bomber squads, do not support any changes."
4/9/2010,no freaking way !!!!
4/9/2010,"i swear i was advocating bombs for what they do, just not the frequency or ease during fleet fights, but meh... idiots are why things never get good changes.guy on bomb flight times, you're right, was looking at ecm bombs. however, it still only takes 5 seconds of separation for bombs to be out of range of each other. obviously that isn't enough when you're seeing 20+ bombers landing regularly during fleet fights at the same time and all dropping bombs."
4/9/2010,"not supported. a solo bomber already has a lot of limitations on what it can kill so it doesn't need any more nerfs. just because a smaller fleet beat your much bigger fleet, u wanna cry about it simply because u rely on riskless blobbing, swearing by the rule that more numbers = 100% winning? collect your insurance and move on--it's not like bombers can take down your pos, unlike a fleet of 200 other combat ships..."
4/9/2010,calling people idiots will definitely help your case. it helped the other morsus mihi guy aswell. but keep it coming.
4/9/2010,"this isn't caod, leave politics out of this. and post with your main ;)."
4/9/2010,it wasnt meant to be a political statement. i just noticed that mm folks tend to call people idiots who dont support their ideas.
4/9/2010,"yaay, to address your points:1) increasing reload time: countered by running 2 waves of bombers.2) flight time increase, no problem because you can just split your warp to... in fact any time over 8 bombers you should be doing this anyway...3) dropping agility... solo or very small groups i do my runs aligned. in defensive positions i have bookmarks set up just for that. in fleet positions where you usually align... the difference of 1-1.5 seconds means nothing.i'm just saying, bombers are fine.. the problem is fleet fcing. spread your fleets, involve more small ships like intys to nab the bombers. make sure fleets align. when you talk about a fleet landing on bombs (i know this to have happened recently) it's lag + bad luck. changing a ship class based upon an issue not related to balancing is just a bad idea. instead the lag should be fixed."
4/9/2010,i just noticed that mm folks tend to call people idiots who dont support their ideas.
4/9/2010,"a 15 man stealth bomber fleet can be a very effective way to spank those who plans on blobbing. a stealth bomber can be called a super mini titan with aoe dd (yes we can call them for that), since the aoe dd's earlier had a range and had 15 secs delay. it's the same with bombs, they have a range and have 15 secs delay before it goes off. and the stealth bombers are very very easy to kill because they are paper thin.and because stealth bombers are very easy to kill if you have smaller ships or fast ships that can mwd out of the bomb range before they go off and tackle or kill them before they warp off, then yeah, problem solved.yes stealth bombers are totally fine. i use a hound my self and they are perfect as they are now.so no, i don't support this."
4/9/2010,"couple things:1. may want to check the flight time on bombs... 3.5 seconds, to go 30 km? that's really zoom-fast!2. ""...yada yada so bombs don't destroy each other..."" um if you are running a tight bomber squad with everyone running the same bomb type, there's no problem. (bombs of a type do minimal damage to each other) now, integrating speciality bombs like lock breakers pose an issue, but that's something the sb squad's fc works out... fire to blank your screens between sb decloak and expected lock time... of course, the one to toss it does have to shoot n scoot!all is made much easier if you're sitting there wondering when you'll be able to move on grid :)"
4/9/2010,it's either very obvious that you know nothing about bombers... or you think you know.or your whining your ass off because you got your butt wuuped by them.all the more reason to not support this epic failness of an idea.stealth bombers take skill and coordination.... its just a stick with a nuke strapped to it.if you can't take the heat.... get out of the blast radius.
4/9/2010,"i agree completely. if we have more friends in our gang than you do in your blob, you should not be allowed to win. bombers use lots of unfair tactics that just can't be countered. i vote to remove bombers from game and bring back our aoe doomsday titans. i am tired of us losing a whole fleet trying to do an anomaly because people want to be jerks. mother f-in supported!"
4/9/2010,people like you are the reasons why bombers should stay as they are. so you learn lessons with pain. there are plenty tactical elements out there to make bombers less effective. some day you will learn about it ...
4/9/2010,u mad?
4/9/2010,me? naw just sold 5 more bombers. ;)
4/9/2010,lol !!!nc did that a lots of time when we were sometimes on ur pos and now u whine bout coz u got pwned by bombs...let me laugh plz epic joke
4/9/2010,you've been trolled.
4/9/2010,no.unless they completely get rid of insurance after concord related deaths.then ok*fake edit- lawlz
4/9/2010,"stop being a ****, and this won't be an issue."
4/9/2010,account security has already been discussed by the csm and in fact we had a whole session about it at the iceland summit. ccp have taken the proposal and comments on board so hopefully more changes will appear in the near future.if you are interested the proposal is here and the iceland minutes are here
4/9/2010,support my shizzle
4/9/2010,"lol yeah used to play tradewars2002 back in the day loved mines especially ""limpit mines"" we didn't have these fancy tracking agents. anyway don't think they will bring them back though a set of specific ships for mine laying might increase the chances also mines should be treated more like ""bombs"" being that they are basically 'floating bombs' that activate when a target ship gets close. i liked the idea of limiting mines to a set number per toon. but 5 really isn't enough to set up a successful mine field you would need something around 1000. love the idea about not letting ""combat"" mines into empire space that would result in less concord aggression as well as any other problems. though the problem of lag issues would still be there as i'm sure people woud put the maxium number of mines out as well as create multiple toons to incease they're mine numbers. lol sorry this also brings up the scene from startrek deep space 9 of the cloacking self replicating mine field lol."
4/9/2010,"in many wars when an invader attacks there are three advantages a defender has:1. they know the territory. this is working fine because defenders normally have been in the area longer and have bookmarks all over and know the dead ends of systems and are usually better pvpers because they do not have to waste time flying many jumps to find non-blues. due to always being attacked due to jealous players of their success. all in all, no changes here because it is working as intended.2. defenders usually have better leaders community wise and military wise. hey, they didn't get that territory out of sheer luck. it took carefully calculated tactics to secure the area. all in all, no changes here because it is working as we can see from the current 'great war' in eve.3. defenders are more passionate about fighting than the invaders. defenders are defending their home and family. this is where some mechanical changes to the game are to be made to properly represent this third aspect. the following should be implimented:bombs can not be launched from stealth bombers unless you are in a system that is controlled (claimed) by your alliance, or an alliance that has you set blue.because invaders are the ones who are most likely to blob up due to not having the above said three advantages, this change would balance that out and properly represent how war really is fought."
4/9/2010,supporting to better balance invading vs. defending.
4/9/2010,"just to see if i understand the logic behind your suggestion:1) defenders have home-field advantages over attackers2) therefore attackers form larger fleets to counter act those advantages???n) therefore attackers should not have weapons that can counter defenders' large fleets, giving defenders an additional home-field advantage.i think you are missing something in the logical progression and resulting conclusion."
4/9/2010,"no, even if defenders need a boost, which i don't believe they do (only ones that can field cap ships if there is a cyno jammer is one example), bombs do not need additional restrictions."
4/9/2010,i think emo tj should be banned from assembly hall

4/9/2010,"supported, i've thought that a greater emphasis on balance was needed for a while now."
4/9/2010,ramen.
4/9/2010,"i agree with your proposal in principle... however my understanding on why certain things are not altered or adjusted on a 2 to 3 month basis is that when certain things are implemented it takes a few months to see what/how effects, if any, play out in the grander scheme of things. there is no way to exactly tell how a subtle alteration in a ship bonus or mod will effect everyone. that slight alteration could make certain ships that were useless before the change become fotm and vice versa. moreover, too many changes in such a short timeframe does not play well to eve's markets, increasing volatility into an already rollercoaster market.that said... it is somewhat stupid that it takes more than a year to get certain glaring issues fixed (i.e. rockets and black-ops).tentatively supported."
4/9/2010,i really support this.
4/9/2010,"yes, supported.i really dont need new features like the whole new planetary stuff coming with the next patch.i really like more to see the existings features become better balanced and fixed."
4/9/2010,"fix the foundation, before you build a floor more, agreed."
4/9/2010,"no need for new features, balance/fix existing ones first."
4/9/2010,"strongly agreed, and supported."
4/9/2010,no. go back to wow.
4/9/2010,"the naysayers are just saying nay for the sake of sayering... or something. pew for sport (if done properly) would be a welcome addition to eve. however, there are too many technical reasons why this would be a bad idea. in order for it to work, it would require a duplicate star system for each battle. this would be way too demanding on the server, and this isn't even accounting for the duplicate item handling for the db. it was tried before, and the server threw a tantrum.to get around these limitations would require something to be added to the game that was written from scratch, and nearly isolated from the rest of the game. ccp has far more important things to do, like breaking balance to existing mechanics even further."
4/9/2010,ahhh i figured why your posting this nowyour just another angry carebear that lost something ^^its ok guys no news here just keep going to a threahd that matters ^^

4/9/2010,ur all oneliners were quite bs-suiciders are not effecting for real mineral supply. where they effect are just small haulers with very common minerals. current big alliances/corporations are getting larger and newcomers days are made to be harder and harder. but you dont need more players :p -they dont increase rare/expensive module prices. coz players who produce them are not getting ganked. -put risk blablabla. yup again newcomers gets risk not old players..-encourage using t2 haulers. . or in another words make newcomers not able to access that stuff..-again and again .. how many moons are left in current market hubs ? ... blablabalur message is clear. just keep current players and no need for new ones. or if new ones are coming they should just join ur corp and pay more and more taxes :pbut for u folks who already get ur plex from eve markets.. i belive this game is biz and they dont want to run it free just for u guys :p this game with small option to run new corp/alliance is not very inviting..

4/10/2010,"1)at 190km the mega with your changes has a 96%chance to hit. this means that the dmg reduction is minimal (344dps), but once applied to resists that dmg is more potent where it counts...ie armor with 172dps vs. the apocs 134dps (alpha is higher too). yes the apoc goes through the mega's shild much faster, but then again it takes longer to get through the structure as well.sooo.. i put together this little time comparison for chewing through hp considering dmg profile. this uses the avgdps calcs that include the statistical occurance of wreckings (and assume wrecking shots are at full 3x dmg) for all to see.@190km your new mega kills the apoc: 1xapoc volley before apoc kills mega your new mega kills the pest: 1xapoc volley before apoc kills pest@ 180km or less its 2x apoc volley faster@ 200km+ things switch over to the apoc...but this was outside the engagment sphere you set forth (and i am too tired to make all these charts for the rokh as well)which leads me to..2)after a 15% increase to the dmg modifier it is always better to fly a mega over an apoc inside your allotted engagement sphere... tachs are only ""better"" if you fight outside what you claim to be the engagement sphere (w/apoc)or start flying abby's (156km opt...but a shyte load more dmg). in the latter scenario, there winds up being more whine threads next year because the mega cant keep up with the abby (not sure about hyp...would have to check)nor can it keep up with the zomg alpha!! pest (if the engagement window is constricted)."

4/10/2010,"put simply, i don't agree with your assessment, the inefficiencies of dealing small fractions of a volley to the next target due to low target ehp can easily whipe out the advantages of said damage your target can warp off, it can receive logistics support. halfway killing a target in such a situation tips your hand and makes it easier for the opponent to disrupt your primary/secondary calling. what remains efficient and fully effective is deviding your fleet into smaller groups with each having their own primary allowing you to volley more targets simultaniously.in short dps > ehpthis dosen't mean and i don't think anyone's said that ehp is irrelevent, simply less relevent then damage output, especially less relevent past certain thresholds. moreso if we venture outside of your very specific example where fleets are attacking ships that cannot respond at the same range or cannot respond at all for whatever reason dps starts to be about the only thing that matters at all, failing to realise this is a failure to understand the core mission of a sniper fleet, to destroy targets, not simply persist.oh i'm well aware of the challanges of the tachapoc, one of the reasons why i enjoy it so much!3xheat sink iitracking enhancer iidamage control ii1600mm reinforced rolled tungsten plates ireactor control unit ii2xsensor booster ii, targeting rangecap recharger iiquad lif fueled i booster rockets8xtachyon beam laser ii, aurora l2xlarge ancillary current router ilarge algid energy administrations unit i400dps @ 188km with 58k ehpi for one won't be whining, so long as every ship has a reasonable niche where they outpreform others it's acceptable. currently neither the mega nor the rokh have this, both of them overshadowed by the apoc in various ways, a 15% improvement would allow both to compete at their respective ranges without in turn overshadowing the apoc."
4/10/2010,"yeah, its true. i remember buying a rr geddon and calculating the full price before insurance at being 180m or so, and 120m afterwards. i posted the exact details in one of the insurance threads.even still, if you don't think you're going to live very long laser ammo is pretty freakin expensive - and that neglects the hassle of dealing with contracting it around. blargh. obviously, i've trained amarr in the time you've been gone. actually, i fly all the races pretty equally now. things seem pretty balanced for the most part. i'm worried about balance tweaks really ****ing things up. :) look on the bright side - i don't post as often as i used to.-liang"
4/10/2010,"1. only one ship can deal small fractions of a volley to a ship. this inefficiency would actually be blanket applied to dps as a percentage if you were figuring it as a part of the system. (and so in a ship to ship comparison would cancel out)2. these inefficiencies in dealing dps due to warping out make having higher ehp more efficient since having a higher ehp make those inefficiencies larger. in fact, its by the same percentage of having ehp and dealing dps that these values manifest itself.if they can't respond then they will lose. that much is pretty simple. effectiveness at that point becomes holding them and not dealing damage.except that the rokh currently has that niche as has been shown.yea, but i don't think that those costs make it reasonable that a ship is more powerful. which is one reason that i am arguing against this ridiculous cost metric they're introducing.at least you were willing to have a civil discussion(at least when the other party was). those who have replaced us are not so inclined. its now a lot of bellum eternuses.anyway, if you've the time, i've written something i would like you to take a look at."
4/10/2010,"all this is true but it completely breaks your premise of dps being used 'efficiently'. originally you were stating that a rokh fleet would somehow know the low ehp of the apoc fleet and dispense their damage efficiently whereas my premise is that since you don't know how your enemy sets their ships up people will be forced to assume higher ehp for safety's sake. basically if the 'extra' dps after a volley-shot kills a target isn't enough to efficiently damage another ship then the higher ehp numbers that would reduce the 'extra' dps aren't relevent where higher overall dps that allows fewer ships to attain the critical mass to safely volley-shot a sniper bs remains quite relevent.in short ehp isn't as important as dps in your own example, though not completely irrelevent it's an advantage that isn't as tactically exploitable as dps.killing things faster means you have to hold a target for less time, saves your fleet time etc etc.no it really hasn't, you may have that opinion but we've repeatedly proven that the rokh dosen't have a usable niche due to having it's damage overshadowed by the falloff of a tachapoc."
4/10/2010,i evemailed you my email address.-lianged: feel free to im or email me. :)
4/10/2010,"there is no such premise. my claim was that dps is used as inefficiently on each and that having a high ehp would only make that larger according to your claim(your claim was false, due to the fact that very little dps is ever applied over a ships ehp)such, there is no inefficiencies that are not present on both sides(i.e. that any specific ship is more or less efficient in applying its dps than another), such, claiming that ehp doesn't matter is also claiming that dps doesn't matter. and if dps doesn't matter then your complaint against the rokh is based on false grounds.except, as you claim, the killing speed is largely dependent on how fast you can acquire targets and now how much dps you do. after all you're volleying them...the differences in killing speed at this point are going to be negligible compared to holding them down. and you keep using damage as the sole metric of strength without accounting for the value of hit points."
4/10/2010,supported! nh does needs more pg.
4/10/2010,"agreed, put grid and slots needed for field commands to fit a ganglink w/o gimping setup."
4/10/2010,"most of your suggestions apply to the tank of these ships, which imo is the right fix. i would also add either +50 cargo capacity or + 10m/s speed to the fixes for all of them. right now the teir 2 bc are way more valuable for virtually 0 loss of income. especially with the rig changes due to the extra rig slot. i still think the drake needs to lose 100 pg in addition as it just has way to much tank. that would ultimately benefit the nh argument."
4/10/2010,"yes, or at least show the good hits if that limits the source for lag - having at least some idea what damage you put out would be great."
4/10/2010,"yupp, this would be really usefull."
4/10/2010,so how would you fix it?
4/10/2010,"how about a 5 minute aggression timer for any cap that aggro'd outside a station or rrs a ship that is aggro'ing. see, now everyone has a shot to kill the lame station capitals instead of just a few titan pilots. using titans to fix a broken game mechanic is a terrible idea. titans weren't allowed to ddd in low sec before and i don't see why they should now or ever."
4/10/2010,because before titans used to have area of effect doomsdays. its different to take out 1 ship or a 30 man lowsec battlecruiser roaming gang with 1 shot.
4/10/2010,"the old dd couldn't kill 30 bc's. a typical bc has 70k-110k ehp, the old dd did 65k damage if my memory is correct. that's pretty tankable. i would support increasing the deaggression timer some or even scaling it with ship size but introducing dd's in low sec is a terrible idea. yes it solves some problems, but the cure is worse than the disease. this is especially true since a few minor adjustments to other aspects would work even better.jump freighters should be banned from high sec just like all the other capitals with jump drives. the jump freighter might still be invincible but that iteron he has to use to ferry stuff to and from low sec to the jf isn't. it's the cargo that's important, not the ship. station hugging carriers can be solved with simply increasing the aggression timer for them. make it 5 minutes instead of 1 for capitals and make remote repping for all ships count as aggression and block docking. i'd also support a general aggression timer increase to 2 minutes instead of the current 1 minute.on a related note, most station hugging carriers are too afraid of a 30 dread hotdrop so they don't aggress anyways. all they do is remote rep people. if you light a cyno and drop a titan on them they will dock before you could ever lock them, nevermind dd them.i think this whole thread is supported not by those who want to kill station hugging carriers but those who want to gank everything in low sec with their titan risk free since they can't really be tackled. yes a hic can, but that can only hold a titan long enough to throw up a bubble and it's a suicide tackle. no bubbles in low sec means you really can't hold him there even if you have enough dreads to kill him in 15 minutes. which is doubtful since low sec lacks the resources to support dread fleets that big."
4/10/2010,/me waves handthis is not the boost to low sec you are looking for.
4/10/2010,"looking at the standpoint of it's exclusivity, i think it is a bad idea to make it console solely.it seems, the more platforms (meaning also on pc), the more money.if they do micro transactions, they would likely see more income off of having more methods of gameplay, maning wouldn't they make more money if it was also on the pc?i am not against it being on consoles, as to i enjoy my 360, but i play shooters on my pc. ah well, whatever, i am buying it either way."
4/10/2010,"i dont think it needs to go this far, but it certainly shouldnt be so cheap to get free kills in high sec. i would support a cost increase."
4/10/2010,"not supported. i've no problems with decs in high sec. i would however, like to see the mechanic modified. i'd like to see the costs of the non mutual decs double in price weekely to limit the perma decs.ahs"
4/10/2010,maybe you shouldn't make it worth their time to wardec you? do you talk to them during the war? beg them to stop? pay them to stop?if you answered yes to any of those questions then they are most definitely enjoying themselves.
4/10/2010,absolutely notthough the whole war dec mechanics could always be improved upon
4/10/2010,"yup, no mission for them. no shooting the rats attacking their barges either. can't have it both ways.edit: can't anchor pos, nor participate in planetary interaction either obviously. why don't you join a npc corp, you obviously can't handle a player corp."
4/10/2010,you can already run l5s in highsec if the shuttle trip to the agent is too much for you you really don't deserve them.
4/10/2010,"so you're saying make high-sec level 5's like level 4's.if running level 4 missions is too monotonous for you, why do you think level 5 missions will be any different? go buy some cajone seeds and plant them in your vagina. place in a well-lit area and water twice a day... in a few weeks you will find yourself having the balls to go to low-sec to run your ""totally-not-repetitive-and-grindy"" level 5 missions. you obviously already have the (in-game) pvp skills. stop trying to make eve easy."
4/10/2010,have ccp introduce sleeper ai to every 10th mission you run or a random number of missions. that'll shake up things for you.
4/10/2010,i would support this only if it gets a ridiculous sleeper ai in the mission where low sec would be easier.
4/10/2010,"currently, for newer pilots or people who only play occasionally, bulletins are not very easy to spot.if they had their own button on the neocom which would blink on changes, it would be far easier to communicate via this tool.it could then be very easily conveyed to members that regardless how new you are, or how long you have been gone, if bulletins is blinky, don't move till you've read it.i have nothing against the tool as such, but it takes 5-7 clicks in a tab where people don't normally go to get to them which limits the use of them a little in my honest opinion.if it is not a lot of hassle, could we improve this feature a little?regards,misha moonedit title and - yes makes sense to make just the corp button blinky - an indication of look here would be good"
4/10/2010,"no more buttons on neocom, thank you.maybe it is corp button which may be used to blink. other than this, good proposal."
4/10/2010,"when posting on the forums, the character drop down box should be removed and defaulted to the character that has the highest skill points on the account.no more hiding. be a man! or a woman for you lovely ladies that play this game. also, in before all the alt flames and tears."
4/10/2010,supporting.. with my main!
4/10/2010,"but how will we sell locations and stuff when we have lost our last defence against locator agents?posting with an alt, just to make a point"
4/10/2010,i honestly have no freakin clue what you are talking about.
4/10/2010,"my pvp main?my industrial main?my hauler main?my mission main?doh?useless proposal. you would need to bring a definition of ""main"" for your proposal."
4/10/2010,"this.and to make an example:character a was created to be the founder of an alliance and is used to speak about alliance relate stuff in caod but is not the ""main"" as for marlon definitiona (the character with more skillpoint on the account) because the pvp character on the same account has much more sp, he will disappear and never post again? or maybe the mining and reprocessing alt will be the one used?"
4/10/2010,"not supporting with my alt.this is kind of like learning skills, attributes and t2 bpo. would have been nice to set up originally but te previous posts can't be undone.what if one person split their posting between three toons. how could you fairly restrict him to a single toon?"
4/10/2010,"definition: out of the 3 possible characters on the account, the character that has the most skill points out of the 3 would be classified as the 'main'. therefor being the character that will show up when posting in the forums with that account.understand now?"
4/10/2010,"so what happens to people who switch mains then? or people that buy characters and suddenly can't use the character they always used to post with?this wasn't well thought out. if you want to limit which characters post on the forums, how about make it so the first character to post on the forums is the only one an account can use to post.however this raises problems in itself and unless it was well thought out and developed i probably wouldn't support it either."
4/10/2010,i agree with darius... but only the bit about the definition of a main.however... the alt posting crud needs to stop... and that's a major turn off for me.people will go make these stupid assed alts for the expressed purpose of posting trash on forums... that's the issue here... not necessarily the alts in-game.some say the forums should have a singular account based on the user-name of said account... but that's a security risk itself.if anything... something similar to phpbb (3.0) boards where it blocks repeat email accounts and a.b.c ip filtration would go a long ways to stopping dupie accounts and alts.it's not that hard... so perhaps we are approaching this from the wrong direction...a separate and singular user-name per account for forum posting would be nice... and have it tack the name of the first char created... if it gets bio'd... have it switch to the next one (highest sp count if you wana get picky).i'm just going off random notions here.. but hopefully you get the point.
4/10/2010,"i understand what you are saying. it is one of those, 'the cat is out of the bag' deals. i think they should have only had one character per account. but that is just my opinion. i knew i would get zero support here simply because this game contains an insane amount of faceless critics that would prefer to stay that way.""in many ways, the work of a critic is easy. we risk very little yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment. we thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read. but the bitter truth we critics must face is that, in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is more meaningful than our criticism designating it so."" - ratatouille <-- good movie, but you guys get what i mean i hope."
4/10/2010,but how will larkonis get around his next forum ban?i'm just saying.
4/10/2010,lol!and coincidentally... i don't have many issues with 1 char per account being the rule of thumb.it's not unusual for people to have more than one account as it is... some how i wouldn't cry much over losing alts. would be annoying but not that annoying.
4/10/2010,8 of my alts are just for checking prices! take your hands away from my alts!:p
4/10/2010,"i call a spade a spade. just because something is overpowered doesn't mean my e-pride is gonna take over and prevent me or anyone else from using that tool. bombers are fragile, they are not easy to kill if used right. there's a reason they were heavily pre-nerfed once bombs were implemented. now that everyone is finally understanding how to use them, it's almost to the point of absurdity. not one of the changes i offered is going to prevent bombers from having epic moments. what it will do is limit how many chances they'll get in a 30 minute window. i don't get how a 7 minute rate of fire is really going to criple bombers... it just give more time to actually fight on grid rather than dodge **** constantly.that said, this thread is dead, so meh. word on the street is dev's are planning to nerf them anyways, so, i guess victory without the csm!"
4/10/2010,you tell them yaay! :high five:i told you cheaters you would be dealt with. you can't stop us from being friends with your abuse of game mechanics.
4/10/2010,"nothing is said that bombers will be nerfed, so just keep dreaming about getting bombers nerfed. because as far as i know, they wont get nerfed.and for those who thinks it's easy to use bombers, then you basicly have no clue about bombers and how they are used.learn to be good in using them and you can have some good runs in stealth bombers.and also, how often do you see that 15-20 bombers have killed 100+ ships?. it's not often that happens. most of the times it ends up by some few kills here and there"
4/10/2010,why did you bring 150+ guys to fight the 15 bombers?
4/10/2010,150 kills for 15bombers sounds nice. ;)
4/10/2010,"wouldn't it make more sense to limit the amount of bombs that can go off in proximity of each other by tweaking the resistance/signature of the bombs?remove the current easy mode pvp that dropping a crap-ton at a time represents while benefiting the groups that take the time to drill and train together (staggered release, multiple vectors etc.)"
4/10/2010,"for starters you people are assuming that the bombs live long enough to be dropped in mass numbers.i've been told repeatedly that anything beyond 5 bombs (of like type) is as far as it will take it before the resistances fail to resist damage from being taken as the bomb is in flight.anything beyond that... causes them to blow each other up.then you got the problem of using mixed bombs which kill each other in the ensuing shock-waves.then you got the fact there's a 15 to 30km shockwave radius. (varies depending on resistances of course)and lastly... the stealth bomber itself resists its own racial type but not others... so you have to be careful not to kill yourself due to some one else's bomb being tossed.take the above into account.. it's not as ""easy"" as you yahoos make it out to be.like i've said already... if you can't take the heat... get the #### out of the blast radius.man up.it's just a stick with a nuke.snap that twig... problem solved."
4/10/2010,there is a much easier solution for the bomb efficiency ... dont hug each other. if you have like 10-20k between all your ships ... the bombs become almost useless.does this nerf rr bs gangs? sure it does. but they were kind of invincible before.now you need to spread out and bring logistics to rep your ships.
4/10/2010,darius ftw.people are always too damn close... that makes bombs very powerful.the problem with the op is tactics... not just emo-raging over foolishness.
4/10/2010,"ah ha!so, the truth finally is revealed. yet again, more ccp intervention to help out bob.the great northern coalition invented rr bs tactics and, are by far are the most skilled in deploying such ships. the southern coalition, along with its slav...um, pets, (don't worry, we will free you soon) are jealous of this. so bombers get 'buffed' to counter these rr fleets.just like a certain disbanded :high five to goonswarm: that abused multiple aoe titan doomsdays that even ccp finally admitted in their own words, ""would ruin the fun for hundreds of people with the push of a button with virtually no risk."" bomber runs are the same thing, except on a far cheaper and less risky scale.the southern coalition is not as rich as the northern coaltion, so abusing these ships is a desperate tactic to try and outlast the north.sorry sc, but we are thru letting you abuse a ship because of a grudge.the bombers need a nerf, and a nerf soon.they should allow us to give a second thumbs up, because yaay's suggested change is right on."
4/10/2010,"lol you dont know jack of you are talking about, either you're a noob to the game or average nc muppet that believes everything their leadership tells them. small alliances were the first people to use rr fleets years ago. nc finally learned how to use them only after 2-3 years of gettin slaughtered by tri / wn / insurgency fleets that had 1/3 or 1/4 of their numbers. you can look this up in any kbs and even forum battle reports and see the huge success they had while nc was still flying snipe/rr snipe bs.and fyi you people are not even close to being good with them, you suck at it horribly, you just spam the fleet with like 30-50 logistics and still people in fail fit bs and bunch of worthless support and even the logis with fail fits, that is why you still loose fights(again see kbs and forum battlereports)if any of those 3 alliances above could field a fleet with 30-50 logistics + 200 bs they would lol stomp nc anyday. the strenght of the nc is the insane numbers you guys have, a combined 30 or so alliances and good logistics/industrial backbone(wealth) to allow people to constantly keep refitting and coming back into the fight. keep ridiculing yourself.and yes i agree with the original topic, bombers should be nerfed or something. although the nc was the latest victim of epic bomb run, both sides have had their mouthfull with bombers, 20 mil ships annihilating 100-200 man fleets, its even worst than titan aoe dd, because they can fire their bombs way more often than a titan can dd, do more damage than a dd(since most of the times there are several bombers) and if they get caught oh well its only a 20 mil ship."
4/10/2010,"your argument was lost at that point. either try it yourself, or don't comment. telling me what someone else told you is just pointless. i use and fc bombers frequently. when done right, it's almost comedy watching enemy fleets run like benny hill on grid.in the perfect scenario, 8-10 bombs are the minimum that will hit. if you do it properly, with dedicated pilots and ships, bombs hit for 8k dmg per and 8 will hit. if you use the wrong ship types, 10 will likely hit for about 6k dmg per. 8x8 = 64000 dmg or 6x10 60,000 dmg. average sniper fit bs depending on fit has somewhere between 60 and 90k ehp partly dependent on gang bonuses. some sniper fits with max damnation go up to about 120k ehp, but not many alliances use those. by comparison, good rr fits start around 180k ehp and go up.ok, that's ideal.it takes 5 seconds for one bomb to move out of damage range of another bomb. if you watch a fleet warped group of bombers land on grid, load and launch, typically they have a spread of about exactly 5 seconds on bombs. if you have free warp rather than fleet warp, the spread is easily more like 7 seconds or greater. or you can do squad warps which again, only need about 1-2 seconds delay to work because of delays on land due to lag and player error.what does that mean. it means that launching 20-30 bombs at a time isn't that hard and can be done over the course of about 7 seconds rather than the 30 + seconds most inexperienced bomber pilots think it takes. also mixed bombs. most mixed bomb problems are a result of one problem bomber. in order for that bomb to be a problem, that bomb has to be the first launched and first to explode. if any of the correct bombs hits first, the incorrect bomb is destroyed. it's almost never an issue with experienced bomber fleets more than a day or two into practice. even if somehow all 20 bombers launched at the exact same time, no matter what, 8-10 bombs will hit. on a sniper fleet, just 8 bombs means either your entire fleet is low armor, or into structure. how many fleets are going to stay on grid when this happens. when you're talking fleets of even 50 bs, it takes a very long time of exposure just to repair everyone, assuming you have proper logistics. 5 logistics will take about 10 minutes to repair 50 bs at best speed. =========none of that would be a problem if fleet warps, and probing weren't so problematic at the moment. it only takes 10 seconds to probe an enemy fleet once it lands on grid. less time if you have good spies. a bs takes about 12-15 seconds to align. that means you are almost guaranteed to get bombed instantaneously. on top of that, even if your fleet warps at varied ranges, 2/3 are going to warp in at a range between 0 and 50km. so now you have a large chunk of your fleet either at 20, 30, 50, or 10,20,30 or 0, 10 , 20 which means that any of those 3 groups can get bombed easily. about the only effective way to fleet warp in and prevent heavy losses is to have a ceptor on grid mwd'ing. but well, ceptors get chased, and shot at, so that's not an easy task mid fight while still staying in your fleets range. there are other **** poor game mechanics like gate jump ques and jump bridge fueling problems that also give bombers advantages. i didn't call for a major nerf, in fact, hardly any mechanics of bombers would change with the exception of more delay and a tad more vulnerability while bombing. very minimal. beyond that, the birdies say they're getting nerfed. we'll see; but rumors are rumors and some rumor mills tend to be more accurate than others.nc does not use rr in it's classical sense. in fact, they're far from the classical rr fleets. we don't hardly even use the same tactics as most traditional rr fleets."
4/10/2010,"ccp said they would slowly implement this. when were they going to start??? it is time.it would cut back on marco-missioners.make mission running more fun and interesting.balance the isk/hr ratio of high sec vs. 0.0seriously, what is the hold up on moving forward with this?"
4/10/2010,"if it would balance high sec vs 0.0 would entirely depends on rewards you get and for what risk.it would at least help low sec mission running, becomes bit harder to gank a ship if it isnt purely tanked for 2 damage types and only one getting npc aggro.also will cause ninja salvager tears."
4/10/2010,"a) ccp don't like to spend development time on pve and a lot of pvpers will protest if ccp was spending time there;b) balancing them will require a noticeable effort, especially as testing missions on the sisi server is almost useless;c) if done for low level missions will simply kill new players;d) making missions more interesting will increase the number of people sticking to them, reducing the number of players doing pvp and that is against ccp stated goals;e) no csm member care about missions so there is no one lobbyingfor them;f) harder missions would require more time to farm isk for pvp, same thing for harder belt rats,g) ecc. ecc.mission need to be brought up to date with the current ship capabilities, especially higher level missions, but apparently there is no interest on ccp part to do that. tyrannis expansion would have been the right time to try this, reducing the number of ships and implementing a better ai instead of reducing the loot quantity for ship; the end result would be the same, less minerals from loot, but without the (probable) hassle to fly to a wreck to discover that the loot is only some unit of scrapmetal. so, supported for the general idea of harder missions, with the caveat that the ai should be tweaked in a way that will not make drones useless in them.probably it will not help low sec, harder missions mean a easiest time for a pirate warping in (even if the npc switching targets will help a bit). still it is a possibility."
4/10/2010,"dont think that sleepers ai is the panacea for all the mission problems - it's better than the p.o.s. in regular missions but not so better as it looks - most of the sleepers pwnage comes from the fact that they do damage to all resist (so you cant stack resists against their damage), resist all type of damage (so you cant damage them in their resist hole), do unbeliveable dps and tank and they cheats - bs that moves at 1km/sec with cruiser-like signature, neuts, scramblers and webs that hit you at 250km and so on...that said, the intersting parts of sleepers ai (dynamic aggro, rr etc) would be nice - maybe with the ""danger weight"" toned down for drones as this would just kill gallente as missioners and make a pain in the ass killing frigates for everyone else..."
4/10/2010,"are you saying that ccp have implemented something with potential and then got distracted by the next shiny thing and not fully developed it? unbelievable! :)an ai upgrade for missions sounds good--not an exact copy of sleeper ai, though. making them less numbingly boring to run sounds good."
4/10/2010,"the missions would need to be redesigned from scratch. sleepers can be nasty enough in the small numbers the w-space waves have .. imagine a room with 50 of the things *shudder*i think that is the main reason why ccp has put it on hold indefinitely, the amount of work is likely far greater than they first thought when they voiced their intentions in the first place.isk/hr in empire is now peanuts compared to what a developed null-sec system can provide so please don't use that argument, a change like this is more than justified by limiting the afk/macro mission runners as well as increase the market competition for salvage and minerals.@ccp: put some of the redundant people (you know you have them ) to work on storyboards or whatever you use as the first steps in mission designs. have everything ready for when the programmers have some free time"
4/10/2010,i don't mean rats as hard as the ones found in wormholes but the same a.i. they use. of course there would need to be balance and such depending on several factors but you get the idea.
4/10/2010,"speaking as someone who mainly uses a drone boat (domi/ishtar) for missions, this could be done very well, or very badly.if the sleeper ai is toned down a little, so that it only attacks drones if the drone's controlling ship isn't attacking the sleepers or something similar, then it will be done well. mainly because not just gallente will suffer if drones become incredibly hard to use in missions, but everyone will have a much harder time dealing with frigates, which are actually imo the biggest threat in level 4s.however, i used an ishtar to farm some sleepers a while ago, and it was manageable, so i'm still in favour of this idea."
4/10/2010,"sleepers dont actually target drone di per se, they weight the dps/tank rateo of every entity (and a flight of drone is considered a single entity) then target the more dangerous/easily destroyed entity - you can check this easily: warp two ships with high tank - lowish dps at 100km range from each other, then shut down some hardeners on one of the ships, sleepers will mostly target that and ignore the other, by alternating you can actually ""ping pong tank"" them.so you have a dominix with huge tank and lowish dps and a flight of hobbos with paper-thin tank and (realative to their size) huge dps, its natural that sleepers will give more weight to the drones, if you have some heavier dps boat like a raven or such dones will be targeted a lot less.then there's to factor other things that change the ""weight"" of every entity, like ecm, time on grid (when a ship warp in generally get aggro even if its a bad target for sleepers) and so on.the most intresting thing of this kind of ai is that you can adjust how all the various factor are weighted to give more ""flavor"" to a faction - lets say that angels are more brash and ""in your face"" so they will give a lot more weight to pure dps, targeting the heaviest hitters before every else while caldari will prefer to keep at range and pluck the easiest kills and so on - you can give lot of personality to those npc with just a few tweakings..."
4/10/2010,yes please
4/10/2010,"oh, right, because drones aren't worthless enough already with their slow damage delivery, awful ai and vulnerability to enemy fire. go doing something like this and you'd better be supporting a hybrid buff."
4/10/2010,"it will only nerf afk domis, which is a good thing. people micro managing their drones can happily fight sleeper."
4/10/2010,supported.
4/10/2010,supported for implementation on half the l3 missions and most of the l4 missions. the sleeper ai would be too tough for the new players in the l1 & l2 missions.ahs
4/10/2010,"i guess sleeper ai will not make a change for solo mission runners.if there's only one target there isn't much of a decision to be made - might make a difference for drone users tho.but yeah, i'm all for keeping ""promises""..."
4/10/2010,i'm in support of your hybrid buff.
4/10/2010,you still didnt train lasers?:p
4/10/2010,"i think a more advanced a.i for npcs has a lot of possibilites, fighting fewer more intelligent npc's may even make running l1/l2 missions for new players more engaging and would be a better learning experiance - prioritising targets, how to fit a ship to counter a particular threat etc. if the mission briefing provides sufficient intelligence. missions could also be made harder if done as a fleet - npcs fight harder, reinforcements arrive sooner - non fleet players turning up could be seen as soft target as not supported making ninjaing harder."

4/10/2010,"regarding the lag caused by having lots of mines deployed on grid...there's a turn-based space empire game called stars! which also had mines, but it handled them as a field. if you laid some mines, you would create a minefield. if you laid more mines into an existing field, it got bigger. if some of the mines detonated, the field would shrink, and a minesweeper would also cause the field to shrink.so instead of keeping track of hundreds or thousands of individual mines, the game would just keep track of the minefields. the mines themselves were described as semi-mobile, so if a gap appeared inside, the mines would move themselves to fill the gap to keep the density, which resulted in the field shrinking. adding mines would cause them to ripple away, enlarging the field."
4/10/2010,"i would like to see the char trading and sales be updated to protect the innocent victims.i will start off with a suggestion, please feel free to comment on it and or add your own.i would hope everyone who post in here sticks to that format.please do no flames this problem is huge and needs to be fixed. my suggestionccp set up a escrow system something simple.i want to buy a char and have come to agreement with a seller.seller places the char in the escrow with my name and a isk value or a char he would like in return.then i am alerted in-game and allowed to reject or accept this deal.if i accept the deal the char and isk are placed in escrow at this time the seller must pay the transfer fee.after a predetermined time the isk and char goes to it new owner. why i suggest this, simple during that time if there is a problem with a char being stolen it would show up.ie stolen credit card, original owner logging in to find his char gone ect."
4/10/2010,"yeah i agree that something still needs to be done.almost a year ago i pushed for pretty similar stuff to this(hack protections for character sales). but i would be interested to find out where that money to pay for the transfer actually comes from.there's also privacy issues, when petitions/evemail gets transferred along with the char. i dont think theres been any progress on this at all."

4/11/2010,"what you keep failing to understand goumi is that ehp over a certain limit do not contribute.dps has no threshold, you want as much gank as possible. if there is a choice between ehp and dps and you choose ehp, you are doing it wrong."
4/11/2010,this isn't true at all. suppose for a moment that you have a battle between 500 people and 500 people. one side does 500 dps and has 120k ehp each. the other side does 600 dps and has 60k ehp each. who do you think will win?-liang
4/11/2010,"you are so wrong. first you wont be able to get a huge fleet which consist from only one ship type,for several reasons. so enemy fleet would just ignore your high ehp low dps ships and kill all your high dps ships--> dps wins.also dps wins always as it has much more use than simple ehp. you want to shoot a pos or sov unit dps wins. you want to kill capitals dps wins. also this ""even"" fight never happens in eve, so most of the time one team will out member the other and in those situations dps wins over ehp.in eve dps>>ehp."
4/11/2010,"and is this not the real issue? from what i've heard and read large fleet fights involve lots of warping around, and once you actually start shooting, because of focused fire being so effective, you either alpha pop your target or the target warps (unless bubbled/scrammed) on the first sight of a ""yellow box"". this sounds ultra boring and is the reason i don't live in 0.0wouldn't people rather fleet fights remain on the same grid, involve the use of all ship types (ewar, logi, etc)and be a much more drawn out affair?anyways... back on topic, rails aren't that bad, but they don't have the range advantage they should because beams are too powerful. beams have too much range/tracking/dps. the answer is to nerf beams a bit to give rails that ""something""edit: still ultra hungover post birthday drinks last night so completely screwed the post up twice"
4/11/2010,"look, we have been over this. the situations where dps is better than ehp are marginal. you're giving up a massive advantage in fights that are relatively equal and where you're outgunned in favor of a tiny advantage when you're going to win anyway. you're ignoring advantages that you have from cumulative engagements(for instance if you get in a fight and then get in another one, maximizing ehp x dps is better than simply having a lot of dps, as you will have more ships in the second fight pretty much regardless of whether or not the first fight was a blowout or note.g. capital ships. 100 rokhs puts out ~32k dps@ 190km. that kills a 10m ehp capital ship in about 5.2 minutes. 100k apocs(your fit) puts out ~35k dps @ 190km which kills a 10m ehp capital ship in about 4 minutes 45 seconds. you save a whole 25 seconds with the apocs over the rokhs against capitals and sacrifice over 50% ehp! ehp that matters a whole **** tonne when you're actually in fights."
4/11/2010,"and that is irrelevant to the argument, really.cool, suppose you have a heterogeneous fleet consisting of ships that deal 300 dps with 120k ehp and 400 dps with 65k ehp. the other side has none of these pansy 300 dps ships but fields a fleet of roughly the same size. now the decision tree will take two ways:situation 1 - people are instapopping dps is limited by how fast the fc can call targets and people can lock them. ping and lock time become king over both dps and alpha. the high dps ships all start dying off on both sides in roughly equal rates (!!). the combat situation will evolve into situation 2.situation 2 - people are not instapopping*obviously the high dps/low ehp ships that you claim will be shot are in fact primaried and killed. however, there will come a time when the fight has worn on, numbers are still roughly equal (perhaps the high dps fleet might have a few more ships than the other, but it won't be anything special), and you have nothing but high ehp ships to their high dps ships. your ships all have 200% of their ehp and 75% of their dps, and you will begin to kill them at three times the rate they kill you. hence, the high ehp/""low"" dps ships will hold the field long after the high dps/low ehp ships died. even in your ""hell scenario"".* we'll assume for the sake of simplicity that people die instead of warp out - because the warp out->repair (via station/carrier)->come back cycle does nothing but increase the effectiveness of my argument (since it can be applied to either side, and one side is much better at it!).ok, so if the fight is uneven then it doesn't even matter what anyone on either side fits. that's called a ""gank"" and doesn't really factor into ship balance discussions.not really. dps is situationally better than ehp primarily because dps yields you the option of having someone safely dead by the time their backup/blob arrives. this is what we generally think of ""ganking someone"". however, if you intend to actually engage that blob, some form of tank, like ehp, is better.so, while i am a firm believer in gank over tank, there are situations where that maxim is either outright false or extremely misleading. simply put: fleet combat isn't really an unknown tactical situation - either the gang sizes are roughly equivalent and what you bring actually matters, or one of you's walking into a death trap and it didn't matter anyway (outside of cost for the loser).-liang"
4/11/2010,"and since we're talking about fleet snipers the marginal value on that dps is going to be very small when ganking. your fleet is going to have plenty of dps such that in an overwhelming situation adding more isn't going to modify the ""other blobs ability to respond"" much"

4/11/2010,you never seen a big low-sec dread fleet? it supports it pretty well.
4/11/2010,"name a single low sec corp/alliance that has 20+ dread pilots online and active 23/7. between my corp and various allies, i'm sure i can throw together a sizable capital fleet with a day or two of notice. but 20+ dreads with 30 seconds warning is asking a bit much of any low sec group. the only ones who can do that are alliances with 1000's of members and you won't find those in low sec. only null sec has sufficient riches to support that many players.this is going off topic though, the real reason titans should not and are not allowed to dd in low sec is because without bubbles, they can't be reasonably tackled and killed if all they are doing are drive by's with their one shot wonder gun. they can of course go to low sec and blast away with their heavily bonused weapons and jump bridge fleets around. but those actions are less powerful and are more easily countered by the game mechanics and resources of low sec.tbh the current dd design in general is terrible for gameplay. i would much prefer to see it turned into a super siege module. then make the thing the ultimate gun/missile boat from hell. do that and suddenly the dd argument becomes moot, i'd have no problem with that in low sec. but that's another argument i suppose."
4/11/2010,just guessing but how about adh/ch/invicta?they would mostlikely drop titans and moms on your titan aswell.
4/11/2010,"in two minds about this. all the guys qqing about the risks to their pimp bs or station hugging carriers, grow up, really. what you can achieve with a titan you can achieve with 1-2 milfs under current mechanics.i see it as a good conflict driver and will give entities more opportunities to bait titans and send them to their watery graves."
4/11/2010,"titan dd in low sec: making low-sec more like 0.0 since 2010!how about we just get rid of low sec all together ehh?i would support such an idea if instead of titans being stuck for 30 seconds, they were stuck for 2+ minutes after dding. otherwise this is just people wanting drive by dd's with even less risk than they already have."
4/11/2010,not supported. we would probably see alot of random single pilots sitting on gates and stations blasting everything...at random with virtually no risk.
4/11/2010,"ya, like all those solo milf pilots we see sitting at gates and stations blasting everything with no risk...oh wai-"
4/11/2010,"*ahum*i don't see any problem with hics tackleing a titan either way. yes there wont be normall light dictor bubbles (that can be smartbombed!). but with 5 hics on a t i t t y it aint going anywhere anytime soon, specially with carriers taking turns at repping the hics when they don't have their point on. only extra disadvantage is is that the hics ~could~ be jammed.fact of the matter is is that it would be dead easy to bait a reckless lowsec titan pilot. -sfs"
4/11/2010,way too many titans in game these days. they do not die frequently enough as it is. we do not need the iwin button back. glad its gone.
4/11/2010,"rofl, you guys that says a titan have no risks in low sec by sitting at a station or a gate. can i ask you if you know much about eve?. or are you very new to eve?.and do you think a titan will just jump in to a low sec system where he don't have a pos and just doomsday players?.like we in it alliance, we are living in x-70 that are one capital jump to aunenen and saranen for example. anyone who lives on a place like us that have many capital ships can pretty much hot drop into low sec with tons of carriers / dreads / super carriers and even titans in one jump while having several hic's flying around where the titans / super carriers are.and also, titans can jump bridge in a crap ton of other ships into low sec to.i'm still in for bringing back the dd in low sec, since the dd today are for single targets only now."
4/11/2010,"the iwin button was when we could remote doomsday trough cyno fields. using your titan to doomsday in a system you do not have a pos in is extremely risky, since you will be stuck unable to cloak or cyno out of the system for 10 minutes. if anything, this should get more titans killed."
4/11/2010,"no thanks, if i wanted doomsdays and blobs i would go to 0.0"

4/11/2010,i think this should be brought back. there is no reason a dd can't be used in lowsec it is essentially just a really really large gun. you carebears need to get over that someone might have a bigger ship than you and need to realize that the **** that happens in 0.0 happens in low sec too. invica hot drops anyone?
4/11/2010,ignorant suggestion.

4/11/2010,"because when you turn off the negative effect module then it would lose that penalty. i.e. each 5 seconds the docking system would check how long you've been trying to dock, count the number of hostile effects at that time, then either dock or not dock.yep, we bump stuff off stations all the time. it's ok on most stations but some (particularly some of the caldari and one of the gallente ones) have rediculous undocks. i was looking at one the other day where you could be 20km from the undock point and still in docking range.personally i'm ok with the current situation although i do think it could be improved. what i am not ok with though is the proposed change to have scrams block docking - which i think is an incredibly bad idea.that's why i've made some proposals for much more balanced responses."
4/11/2010,anything is better than scram blocking docking!

4/11/2010,"obvious posting with an alt!i can't support this. this is eve-online after all. the game with one server. the one server with rp-players and not rp-players. when posting on the forums i may want to stay anonymous from an in game player point of view (don't argue, ppl do go mocking about forum posts). being a multiple account player with active chars on both accounts. who would be my ""main"" the one with most sp or the one i put most playing resources into, and how to measure this?this kind of forced posting mechanism would mostly hurt singe account players.and for those that think this is a good way to stop personal warfare on the forums. naaah, the gm's can see all your toons!"
4/11/2010,this. highest sp doesn't quite cut it.
4/11/2010,sorry for not making sense this thread sums my objection up:
4/11/2010,quite easily i'd imagine i'd be willing to support this if for example if when you selected your 'default' character that would become your permanant posting character (perhaps with a 4-5 day cooldown before you could switch).
4/11/2010,excellent idea! that way every time someone makes a proposal or makes a comment not in line with mine i could war dec and bully his entire alliance and grief them out of game !
4/11/2010,you shouldn't believe everything the ads say kid.
4/11/2010,"you posted a suggestion, but stated no purpose."
4/11/2010,"trying to get wardeced because of disagreeing with tons of people never worked for me so far. also wardecing people requires effort, being a ass on the forums does not, you just grief yourself..."
4/11/2010,"and going that extra mile to squeeze ""tears"" from players and bullying is the mission of quite a few peeps. so yes, i believe there are a few that would make the effort to war dec just because someone disagrees with them. hell, kiddies have done it for less, afterall."
4/11/2010,"camping people/being camped makes me post more on forums not less, so it is pretty counter effective in this department."
4/11/2010,"my point is this idea will just bully people out, leaving just the idiots that think it's lulz. traps comes to mind. speak against them on your main and your alliance can pretty much be guaranteed a months-long wardec.no thanks. until the kiddies learn to behave themselves (fat chance really) this will just be another tool for bullies to exploit.oh and by the way, i always post my mission ship fits with my alt because again, posting them on my main is just begging to be ganked by kiddies."

4/11/2010,by micromanaging you mean recalling them every other minute?as a loving drone user/not supported
4/11/2010,if this results in more carebear deaths it's worth it
4/11/2010,"i dont know that much about ai stuff but what i know is that empire rats are exactly 100% predictable. i would just put back the cargohold to dronebay feature so the drone guys dont get left behind.also, sleeper ai != sleeper specsif there is a will, there is a way.where is the will?"
4/11/2010,supported if it puts risk into missions again
4/11/2010,i'm going projectiles.
4/11/2010,yes micro managing means recalling drones when they got aggro. it also means picking group aggro wisely. it also means you got your turrets active on the domi all the time to keep the aggro on you. *gasps* domi user finally have to do something in missions. (no salvaing and looting dont count.)
4/11/2010,"not supported.seriously, i'd like to use my ishtar/domi for missioning without constantly cycling drones."
4/11/2010,"i propose the following:in l1 and 2 missions, ai stays as it isin l3 and 4 missions, ai for frigs and cruisers changes to sleeper ai. this will probably be harder, since those can actually hurt your drones, the bs are better off just shooting you."
4/11/2010,i am pretty sure ccp said that they would slowly introduce it and i am sure this would be on a scaling level. ccp sounded serious about it and the eve community seemed like it was ready to welcome it with open arms. what happened???
4/11/2010,maby a idea but how about a new type of agent?this will have complete new mission with the sleeper a.i. in it.
4/11/2010,people noticed they cant (semi)afk mission anymore.
4/11/2010,"yes please.and/or randomize triggers, both ship type and group # (on those missions with several ""groups"")anything to make mission running more interesting and less afk."
4/11/2010,"wrong. as it currently stands a sleeper ai will always aggro the drones because the drones have a paper thin tank but great dps.blasters and rails have sucky dps and ships are tanked very good. not to mention missioners can't afford to sacrifice pw/cpu for properly fitted tank and guns.so, all this proposal would do is make it so drones would be unusable in missions."
4/11/2010,huh? what are you smoking? you can properly fit turrets on domis and ishtars. (although i have to say that i usually fit ishtar with acs)if you go for 3 ccc rigs you can even run antimatter with perma tank. and the fit leaves soo much room that even without all lvl5s it should fit easily.but yes you really have to sacrify a lot to fit guns.
4/11/2010,"lol did you just post a dual rail fit? wow. dual rails are useless, their range sucks and their tracking sucks and their scan resolution sucks if you want to shoot anything smaller then a cruiser. i also doubt you can fit any speed mods, so you can't control the range you need to be at to make those rails work effectively. why would you even fit 2 drone links when that would put your drone range waaay beyond what those guns can hit at? (because you're out of pw? probably) not to mention, that tank is so permaed that, it once again proves my point, sleeper ais will always retarget drones and basically force any droneboat to keep their drones in the hold permenantly."
4/11/2010,"one thing for sure, dual rails suck very badlymaybe if ccp decreased their sig radius to 250.. people still wouldn't use them"
4/11/2010,"hey. don't turn down this idea because gallente rails/blasters are broken right now. actually, almost everything about gallente is borked. that is another issue that needs to be looked at separately."

4/11/2010,cross posting is bad. especially as people still got open questions in the other thread.

4/11/2010,well yeah most of the domi items are crap.bigger problem is actually that the drop rate for low sec domi rats is kind of terrible.i had 2-3 drops in the last 2 years in heimatar and modlen with at least 100 faction spawns that only give you a tag and the ammo.
4/11/2010,dont worry other regions are not better.
4/11/2010,"they are. i got around 300 m in slave imps and sansha faction stuff during a week belthunting down in amarr low sec space. 6 drops out of 10 spawns...while some other regions might be just as bad, i would like to see some kind of improvement in this department."

4/11/2010,support from me as well.
4/11/2010,"id like this, stoping lagging quite a bit"
4/11/2010,"the idea came up in one of the myrmidon threads and immediately clicked with me, it is the most obvious of ideas.medium sentry drones.- damage, optimal and fall-off values one half of regular sentries.- tracking at least twice of regular sentries, possibly even more. should be a clear advantage to using normal drones when close in though.- size, damage types same as regular medium drones.- hitpoints roughly triple regular drones, same ratio as heavy:sentry.and that is it, short and sweet. give us something to spam other than warriors"
4/11/2010,hmm giving it double or more trackings sounds op towards frigates tbh.
4/11/2010,"i like this idea. i would say 1,5x tracking though."
4/11/2010,"yea i considered that, but if you look at the stats of the heavy sentries:garde ii - 24/12km, 0.036curator ii - 42/24km, 0.024bouncer ii - 48/42km, 0.012warden ii - 60/30km, 0.012and then compare it to lr guns. halving range and doubling tracking yields very similar numbers when compared against medium lr guns (except for rails because they are poo).due to cruiser weapon ranges chances are that they will rarely be used at their optimals, which is why i said that there should be a clear advantage to using normal drones closer in.halving range and doubling tracking gives worse total tracking overall if i understand the guide correctly (transversal increases as range decreases). look at how appallingly bad medium drones are against frigates due to signature resolution alone, i don't think it will be major issue. frigate pilots will have to be aware of them being deployed and add them to the list of stuff to keep transversal up against."
4/11/2010,"just so people are clear about what happens once skills are applied:*a 2x otl myrm (leaving full tackle mids)with 2x sda rigs:5x med. guard ii's= 269dps, 21k opt/6k falloff, .1014 tracking (tracking = hpl ii with multifreq loaded)*vexor with 2xsda rigs (full tackle= no otl's):5x med guard ii's= 269dps, 15k opt/6k falloff, .072 tracking (tracking = hpl ii w/ scorch loaded)*edit- clarrification*edit2- missed the halving of falloff. changed to 6km from 12km"
4/11/2010,what multiplier did you use for tracking in those two examples?is it possible to equip a usable fit after the sda's take their pound of flesh from the cpu or does it only leave nano option?offhand i would say that tracking should be slightly worse than hp with scorch. at least on the longer range versions - that is why i mentioned the lr guns which have some 15-20% less tracking than scorch.damage levels seem appropriate. after having engaged rigged heavy sentry vexors i have a healthy respect for their output (navy vexor is just downright nasty).side-note: if the reinvigorated lobby activity to revisit the myrmidon's dronebay and/or bandwidth bears fruit these would come in very handy i should think.
4/11/2010,"i used the 2x tracking multi that was in the original post.a quick eft whoring showed a platemrym as feasible (needs 1% cpu implant for full t2 tackle with 24km scram. fine if you use a named web and/or use t2 9km scram). have not checked dualrep/trirep fits, and tbh 1xotl + 2x web still might be more popular.... hell 2x web and you might not need an otl except for range.i assumed they would be 10mb of space (like med drones), so an increase of the myrm's bay or bandwidth would not be needed.... that being said i would like to see 100mb bandwidth!!"
4/11/2010,"concord isn't doing it's job. some hi sec systems see regular piracy. often these are 0.5 sec status systems.i propose that sec status be dynamic. after extensive piracy in a system it's sec status can fall.this may mean for instance routes to jita have to be changed to avoid new low-sec systems. jita itself might eventually become lowsec.this would cause some disruption. but makes sense though.sec status of systems that lost status from their 'defalut/base line' status could recover over time, or alternatively improve if lots of special storyline missions are completed in the system. this would make players have more of an impact on the universe. similar to the consequences of fw which have led to gallente mission runners having to complete storyline missions in lowsec.it might also lead to more distribution of the market between hubs, rather then jita dominating.thoughts?"
4/11/2010,"(yes using the search was too hard for you, i know)highsec is supposed to be safer. not safe. and the sec status is more a qualification how much the government cares about the security in those systems. for 0.5 they still care a little but not enough to have more police there.oh and yes it has been proposed before ..."
4/11/2010,"where piracy along a trade route reaches the point where it significantly impacts commerce, the affected states usually respond by trying to do something to deter the pirates. trade generates tax receipts after all. if anything, i would expect concord's presence in systems with a lot of piracy to be reinforced. most likely though, the npc trade that takes place below the level that we as pod-pilots see so dwarfs our efforts that what we do to each other gets lost in the economy's background noise."

4/11/2010,"this dev blog might answer your question - voting isn't open yet.in case you were wondering, the link is in a sticky post at the top of this forum."
4/11/2010,"well apparently english is not your first language or if it is you do not seem to comprehend the written word. did i ask if the voting was open yet? hmmmm nope don't think so. but let me check........nope not one time have i asked if the voting was open. what i asked was a) how is anyone supposed to know when or if their app for the elevetion was accepted or not? still no answer there.b) i also asked who are the other canidats running and where do you find this information? again that would be no answer as yet. wow the bleeped out frack? that is to drool for words to express. apparently as near as i can tell this and most ever other forum has everything that was ever posted by anyone at any time. the most i can find out about csm is about anywhere from 1 to 4 years out of date. why doesn't someone set up a auto cleaning program to get rid of any forum topic 6 months to a year old. peopl are just going to keep asking the same qyestions again and again no matter how often you or i or any one else tells them to do the tutorials first then ask players in the rookie rooms. if that fails then post a forum. but we alll know that is not going to happen so make life a little easier on everyone and get rid of all the old deadwood. it would proberly free up about a terabyte of server space. second this hold csm thing seems to have started by word of mouth and as such has been dominated from the beginning by people from really big corps to hugh conbinations or faction and corps. the reason being the learders find out about csm tell everyone in their association whom to vote for and thats that. they allways will win seats everytime. the small independent player and or small corp may not even know about csm and if they did, getting elected against those odds is fairly unlikely. you (ccp/eve)say you want new blood new players new ideas but the way everyone is going about it now is doing the exact oppisite. and the beat goes on. the voting process needs to change some how in some manner. perhaps one vote per corp, faction and independent player. something needs to change, and you folks need to figure out how it can be done or the incredable potentila of this magnifisent game with the potential to lead the way to global connectiivety with all devices will with and die. and that would be a crime and a shame. do i play this game well? not a chance even after 6 months but do i love it and try to help anyone i can hell ya. elf lord"

4/12/2010,+1i'd love to see a pos looks like this
4/12/2010,/signed
4/12/2010,to liang: you have a choice between 120k ehp * 190 dps or 60k ehp *380dps for a fleet sniper. no other information available. which one do you prefer?
4/12/2010,but that is not the choice between the rokh and the apoc. and that is not the choice between tanking your apoc and ganking your apoc. its a pointless hypothetical.
4/12/2010,"comments:- this is insufficient data to answer the question. the most important thing will be who has home field advantage, followed by how big the expected gangs are.- your numbers were contrived. mine were not - the rokh really does have 75% of the dps and 2x the ehp of a tach apoc. believe it or not, a megabeam apoc actually outperforms the tach apoc in a lot of ways.to take a stab at answering your question...assuming home field advantage... the ehp fits. you have a higher probability of getting them to warp out and get repaired (either at a station or by carriers).assuming away team... the dps fits, because you want to get the kills and gtfo before the enemy can muster a solid defense fleet.note that i still stand by my argument that rails need no more than 15% dps at expected sniper ranges. but you can't deny that fleet effectiveness is primarily determined by the dps:ehp ratio.-liang"
4/12/2010,"a slight correction and a question. effectiveness is primarily determined by the dps x ehp value. the ratio determines optimal target calling of the opposing gang.what do you mean however that ""rails need no more than 15% dps at expected sniper ranges""?"
4/12/2010,"hmmmm.... sure i'll take that as a good metric. its a better way to express what i have been driving at for the last few years.i mean that the mega (for example) is a tad low on dps at sniper ranges - even when compared to ships that simply don't have a damage bonus. the kick in the nuts is that these optimal bonused ships aren't even outdamaging the mega because they're able to use higher dps ammo! it's just that rails - from both the mega and rokh - do pretty crappy damage.so the crux of my argument was:- gallente ships don't do enough damage at sniper ranges (it doesn't need much of a boost, but it does need some).- caldari ships aren't able to capitalize on their optimal bonus by using closer ranged higher damage ammo-lianged: i don't remember my exact proposal - but i remember that a key part of it was to increase the optimal range bonus to 15% so that the eagle and rokh could be using higher damage ammo. i think it included a 10% damage increase for rails to fix the gallente problem. i should hunt that thread up."
4/12/2010,"ahh, see that is the thing. the mega certainly underperforms, but the only reason that the rokh isn't able to use higher damage ammo and capitalize is that its not fitting any optimal range modules.(specifically the extra damage is not valuable compared to the ehp)the eagle however can indeed do that.for instance. this eagle has more ehp (less speed), but very good damage and tracking @ 100km compared to a muninn and zealot[eagle, new setup 1]magnetic field stabilizer iimagnetic field stabilizer iimagnetic field stabilizer iireactor control unit ii10mn microwarpdrive itracking computer ii, optimal rangetracking computer ii, optimal rangetracking computer ii, optimal rangelarge shield extender ii250mm railgun ii, caldari navy uranium charge m250mm railgun ii, caldari navy uranium charge m250mm railgun ii, caldari navy uranium charge m250mm railgun ii, caldari navy uranium charge m250mm railgun ii, caldari navy uranium charge m[empty high slot]medium ancillary current router imedium ionic field projector iwith standard frentix, the eagle can realize strong advantages and hit to 94+30km with navy uranium for 270 dps(100+30 w/thorium @ 243 dps else)(zealot can get close with 250 dps out of microwave or higher with aurora, but at about 1/3rd the tracking, but still not as much, the muninn is left entirely in the dust)if you boost rails in general you're going to break those ships that are fine, like the eagle and the rokh, but underutilized due to people making bad decisions in order to fix those ships that are not fine like the megathron"
4/12/2010,to me it kinda comes down to the fact that spike isn't really outdamaged until you get to iridium - and the range on iridium (without making absurd fitting choices like 3 tcs!) is just a bit too low.it's true - and that's why i am so leery of a huge damage boost on rails - no more than 15%... and even that i feel is pushing the limits of sanity. i was going for a fix that would let caldari reasonably capitalize on their optimal range bonuses while simultaneously letting the somewhat subpar ships be more reasonable.i remember that tagami wanted a pg boost on caldari ships (to eliminate the rcu in favor of a te) instead of boosting the optimal bonus. i'm kinda ambivalent to that - but i am realistic enough to admit that i had my eye on the blokh and beagle when i suggested bigger optimal bonuses. ;-)-liang
4/12/2010,"on my numbers: they are just the 2 extremes, used to emphasize the dichotomy.on the rest: liang pretty much nails it and recaps the discussion we had, where the proposal took form. i still stand by the fact that the fit goumi is trying to use to support that eagle is fine is totally wrong and thus should be discarded.the reason's for choosing the 15% increase is so that both mega and rokh enjoy a boost, a boost which is more in favor to the mega. that bias is mainly the reason i included the 10% pg increas for caldari and the ~70% spike optimal change, as a balancing factor, so as to not break the limits of sanity. by the way, blokh and beagle would be better off with a te (since they don't have the gallente tracking bonuses) than with inherent range bonuses."
4/12/2010,"then again, in this thread, we have already shown that the rokh, in terms of fleet effectiveness pretty clearly dominates.the megabeam apoc dominates the tachyon apoc (to the tune of megabeam vs tachyon it takes less megabeam apocs to volley a tachyon apoc than it does tachypocs a megabeam apoc) in both dps x ehp and relative volley effectiveness (even before resistances are figured, so the megabeam poc has more relative volley effectiveness vs just about everything)the rokh dominates the megabeam apoc both in terms of relative volley effectiveness (even after resistances are figured and the rokh is not fitting any em hardeners) and in terms of dps x ehp.if the rokh is boosted in the manner you propose, it will go from ""strong and under appreciated"" to ""holy good hell overpowered"". with a 15% optimal range bonus it would hit 250km with no tracking enhancers. with a 15% damage bonus it would do 369 dps with 120k ehp. more dps than any other fleet optimized sniper with more ehp than any other fleet optimized sniper with more range than any other fleet optimized sniper.with either it will go from ""the best sniper"" to ""so much better than the rest the rest are pointless"""
4/12/2010,"as to your numbers, if the dps/ehp ratio worked that way (100% increase in ehp for a 17% decrease in dps), people would definitely fit for more ehp over dps. because the extra ehp = win.however, the ratio is (using goum's apoc compared to a non-failfit apoc) a 62% increase in dps for a 33% decrease in ehp. that is to say the ratio tracks opposite of what you suggest. additionally, a 100-man sniper bs fleet has something on the order of 250,000 alpha strike to throw around and ships with roughly 60,000 ehp. so, focusing more on ehp would net a change to 155,000 alpha and 90,000 ehp (a fleet of goum's apocs). these are more accurate numbers than the ones you posted. which fleet wins? the higher damage fleet. this with only 100-man bs fleets, let alone the million plus alpha strike of a 500-man bs fleet (500 dps for 500 ships is simply absurd).these computations ignore the most critical part of fleet equations, the time factor. as long as a fleet can volley a ship to death before they lock their next target, damage > ehp. this is generally the case in fleet fights where no one can survive concentrated fire for more than a a couple seconds (usually you have about 2-3 seconds from first hit to the time you have to warp or you die).you still don't understand what you are talking about. adding ehp on a ship does not add ehp for the fleet, adding dps to a single ship adds dps for the fleet. that is about as simple as it can be stated. because the target's tank is not the time limiter, locking time is the limiter."
4/12/2010,"most of what you say is true - and to a certain extent part of it was my intention. however, i want to point out that range in excess of the range your fleet is at is situationally useful at best -- unless you can leverage that extra range to use a higher damage or higher tracking ammo.-liang"
4/12/2010,"ahh, but you always can. because you always will have less drift out of range and as the shorter range ships in your fleet get picked off/warp out you will have significant advantages. just as when you have any significant number of ships with high ehp and only slightly lower dps and the lower dps ships are picked off.in that instance, the extra range works just like extra tank, since the enemies dps is lowered in attempting to hit you."
4/12/2010,"what you keep trying to pass off as a fact is just your opinion, which is unbased and pretty much wrong. if the rokh was the ""best sniper"" and railguns were ok, you would notice the masses of pilots switching to railguns and caldari bs training. however since the facts are that most pilots train amarr/minmatar bs and beam/ arties because of the advantages they offer in sniper fleets, your opinion is false.as i said, i don't have to prove the fact that rokh is not good enough, a glance at 0.0 alliance fleet battle reports is enough to substantiate my premises. the number of rokhs/total of those fleets pretty much describes the problem of imbalance that exists.your claim of rokh superiority however needs to be proven. therefore, i urge you to proceed in setting up the social and logistical experiment of creating rokh fleets that will overpower all else. if you can't do that, because the pilots available to you do not wish to invest in railguns/ caldari bs, but prefer other turrets, then you have to rethink what you are doing wrong.p.s. how many people do you need to tell you that you are fitting ships wrong, to finally realise it?"
4/12/2010,"my apoc does 325 dps. the most an apoc can do with 8 tachyons and 3 heat sinks is 401 dps. that is, at most, a 23% increase in dps. it has 85k ehp.[71.7k w/ 2x te]the actual values for your proposed apoc were 357 dps and 51k ehp(adding in that extra armor rig for good measure). [or 331 dps and 80k ehp, which still puts me ahead]as such, the trade off between your proposed and mine was 9.8% dps (positive for you) and 40% ehp (positive for me, assuming that i fit 2 te's rather than a second plate, its 66% for the second plate)as has already been shown, it takes fewer of my apocs to volley one of yours than it does for one of yours to volley one of mine."
4/12/2010,"ime the fc will usually try to move your own fleet around semi frequently to prevent warp ins and so that your megas/tempests stay in a range that they will deal effective damage. this process generally invalidates any the advantages conferred from having extra range that can't be converted into better ammo. and then once the battle is joined, it becomes a matter of targeting and firing -- if you can even get your modules to cycle at all.-lianged: i have heard rumors of alliances telling people to get an apoc or gtfo... but i've been fortunate enough to never have heard that one in person. not that i'd care these days... there are advantages to having all racial bs 5. :)"
4/12/2010,"then agian, so will the other fc attempting to get warp ins that maximize their range. supposing one is more effective than the other is supposing that one ""wins"" that engagement. and that isn't really fair to judge the ships.which is why comparing their value at specific ranges is done. and in these cases the rokh comes out quite ahead.with regards to alliances telling people apoc or gfto. yes, foolish people often do foolish thingsedit: i see there is a tachypoc that is better than the 7 megabeam set(oh hey, didn't think of using anp, +8% dps, -6.5% ehp). it would be better to use that as a comparison(unless you're in a rokh heavy fleet, where having more ehp would be better))... but the rokh is still better."
4/12/2010,"i am interested in seeing your 80k ehp and 500 dps@180-200km apoc. also, i'm interested in seeing which ship is cheaper (protip: it's the rokh because of rigs).-liang"

4/12/2010,the rokh has 2 invulns meaning that a second cdfe(it uses a lock range rig instead of a cdfe. lets it get another lse/invlun on and increases ehp slightly). actually lowers effective ehp vs aurora from 112k to 110k

4/12/2010,"yes, because it totally makes sense for everyone that disagrees with a topic in the assembly hall to not post in the appropriate thread. good idea! what we've done is show that it doesn't really matter if the fleet is heterogeneous or homogeneous. balance differences will exist in either situation - and that's the basis of all balance requests. the idea behind setting up homogeneous fleets is that the balance differences will be most visible there. it's the ""edge case"", so to speak. but i'm wasting my fingers away typing to someone that has no interest in the balance of the game, and just wants caldari pwnmobiles. this is basically you saying ""i don't have a good answer to what you said and i may be wrong but i'm going to stick my fingers in my ears and scream ""i'm right i'm right i'm right!!!!"". look naomi - i don't have a vested interest in seeing any race dominate or suck. i am not trying to stand in the way of reasonable boost requests - but must understand that i will stand in the way of unreasonable requests. i care about the balance of this game - even if you do not.ok, since you're obviously so much smarter than us all, why don't you go ahead and post what you think are reasonable apoc, rokh, zealot, and eagle fits. :)-liang"

4/12/2010,"do i have to go back and highlight every time i say alpha strike and you read it as dps instead? dps is not as important in large fleet fights as alpha strike. i swear i've said this to you a few times as well. apparently you don't read what i say and go off about other things. also, i've said a few times in this thread that the apoc i posted is not a rational apoc, that one is designed with one purpose, to do what the rokh does but better (which it does all the way out to around 230km, at which point the rokh has a slight advantage over it). there is no reason to fit an apoc to shoot as far as that one is fit. no one fights out there, nothing is out there to shoot, the rokh has no niche (if you've read any of my posts, the repetition is beginning to border ridiculous). a normal ultra long range apoc would have the same damage numbers but drop some range for more tank (as has been stated, sniper bs should have at least 60k ehp).pro tip, you are the only person in this thread to say 500 dps and it was in reference to the dps of a 500 ship fleet."
4/12/2010,"or like heavy assaults? i've always found it weird that my abso has worse resistances then zealot those become higher only after you factor in the bonus.would be handy, but that change alone won't change much - for instance, nh will get slightly higher term and kin and those already are the highest resistances by a large margin. the em-hole and slot layout disparity outlining this hole would still be left there as it."
4/12/2010,"good point, it would be more of a ""band-aid"" fix than adressing the cause of the current issues with field commands. i still stand by my point that all field commands and to a lesser extent all bcs should have slot layouts and grid reworked to allow for a decent fitting while also fielding a gang link of their choice. personally i think that gang links requirements are way too high and take too much cap to boot but i guess that is for a different topic.+1 hs and +200 grid for both the brutix and the astarte, i think that would be a good start."
4/12/2010,"they should get 100% reduction in cpu/pg cost of a single warfare link, so you can fit one only for free. that helps solve the pg/cpu problems, although astarte still needs an extra highslot and nh still needs more pg.then they probably need a small bonus to the effectiveness of that single gang mod - otherwise the t3's 25% strength bonus looks too attractive. maybe 3%/level?then the gang mods themselves need overhauling. let's face it, the minnie and amarr links are great and the gall and cal ones are a bit crappy - the inforwarfare links are too niche, tend to be stacked with modules and are a bit weak anyway, while the caldari ones are designed for shield gangs that simply don't exist thanks to the absurd cpu requirements of shield transporters. okay, they help with e.g. shield cruiser gangs, but you'd still prefer the minnie ones there.so... amarr ones are fine, leave them as is. minmatar gets sig radius, tackle range and mwd/ab speed boost bonus. these are too good. the sig radius bonus isn't stacked with other mods, unlike e.g. shield/armour resists, neither is the speed boost bonus. while it makes sense in principle for these to be minmatar links, their magnitudes should be examined. the tackle mod range bonus is too good. it should apply only to webs, while gallente gets a gang mod for disruptor/scrambler range. the gallente link for sensor strength makes sense racially, but it needs to be stronger, and to avoid being too niche it should also give a bonus to scan resolution. hell, you could even throw a targeting range bonus in as well. the second gall link could be the scrambler/disruptor range one. the third could be ewar mods strength and range - i'd like this to be a caldari one really, but i'm not sure what to do with the caldari ones if it were moved to caldari. hell, i'm not sure what to do with the caldari ones anyway - even if shield transporter cpu requirements are fixed then armour bs gangs will still be dominant, simply because of slot layouts."

4/12/2010,"awsome idea thumbs up.gonna have to add on to what you said. with the alliance tax you could set it up similar to that of the corporate tax. it only taxes members that get mission rewards, and bounties. any loot sales etc. is excempt. however instead of the individual member of the ""corp"" getting taxed the corp itself that is taking the income from its members gets the tax for its income excluding member donations etc. (no double taxation) so for example if you have an alliance that has say 5 member corps which is costing you 10mil isk a month to support. each of the corps have a tax rate of say close to 10% and you set your alliance tax at 10% the alliance though is taking only 10% of the 10% taken from the corp members income it doesn't add to the corp members losses to his or her corp. got a little math below.alliance 10% tax 18.3mil income from corps over the month corp 1 10% tax 40mil income from members over the month corp 2 5% tax 6mil income from members over the month corp 3 15% tax 135mil income from members over the month corp 4 1% tax 2mil income from members over the month corp 5 0% tax 0 income from members over the monthi'm sure taxes and numbers would vary over time but at least you get an idea what i think would be a great addition to this discussion. if you set it to stack onto the taxes already being paid by members of a corp and you have a member corp that is charging 100% tax and then your alliance is charging 100% tax you would be paying not only the reward into either corp or alliance but you would be paying the same amount out of your pocket to one of the two. if you restrict it to a certain percentage you basically loose the reason for request it. the alliance tax would be great to cover the transactions that the alliance may take on as a whole rather then just the exec paying for it all. lots of other ways to look at it like i have in my quote from venkul mul. you could charge per head a set price which is then set by the alliance to the corp to pay though you could run into an alliance charging 1mil per member per month and that alliance gets say a 400 member corp that would be a cost of 400mil per month. which would be like decing an alliance for 2 months though i'm sure the 400 member corp could easily afford the cost lol. though i really would like to see if the corp can't afford its automatically removed from the alliance and the assets that are in alliance possession are impounded. bunch of possibilities with this idea."

4/12/2010,"i remember one time i was roaming venal (caldari stations) and there was a raven at the undock point. i was in my 7km/s mach, he started to aggro me, so i mwd'ed out 30km from him and then mwd'ed toward him, bumped him square in the face - and then had 2nd bump in the direction. by then he was 20km out and had me dual webbed (90% webs) but we were both rolling on inertia and stopped 40km out of station. and as all that was going on, he had a friend in moros undock right after i bumped into the raven. if it wasn't for the successful bump, they would have killed me easy with the moros drones and blasters (dual web). but at 40km the moros drones needed time to fly to me and blasters barely did any damage. i killed the raven and escaped.now that was excitement - all gone. impossible now after the nerfs"

4/12/2010,"i produced a flowchart as i had promised earlier, and hit an immediate logical problem that stumped me for several days as to how copies would be properly addressed such that the bpc market was not impacted.what i had in mind was a single entry for the player (or corp) database for each bp that they had access to, either as a bpo or a bpc. in either case, the s&i blueprint list would show a number of copies and so long as that number were greater than 0 whatever production job that player attempted would just reduce the number by 1 and leave the rest for later (assuming all copies to have the max number of runs). at 0, if bpo=no it would dump the entry completely, if bpo=yes it would lock the blueprint until the job ended.this setup would not handle multiple entries for different bpcs gracefully, if a player were to buy several different copies of different research levels which would be displayed? it doesn't make sense for all copies to have the research levels of the highest copy, that could be exploited. what about having them all assume the research levels of the lowest? would it make sense for the purchasing player to have to 'inject' them one at a time as they were used? this doesn't really escape an inventory full of copies well.also, does it make sense to have all copies assume max number of runs? if a player uses less than the maximum number of runs, is that fair to remove a copy completely? also, is it fair that they would need to eject runs at a later point, as an additional step just to get a copy out for the market and would that be worth having a more compact blueprint list to begin with? when do players deliberately intend to make a bpc with less than the max number of runs?i would welcome feedback on these questions. also, regarding the traffic of blueprints, i have two interesting avenues that this could proceed down. please let me know if either of the following scenarios are appealing (as a pirate/as an industrialist):firstly, assuming a player has any blueprints would it be more satisfying to have them leave behind a 'black box' style item that is hackable for random bpo rewards. assuming the player has hacking skills, and perhaps with the assistance of a lab or service agent (hacking in stations maybe?) let's say that player x leaves behind a mystery box and the player has an opportunity to hack out a number of bps based on skill + luck compared against the blueprints worth (measured in time to research). would it be preferable to have a steady chance of looting a player's bps this way instead of waiting for a lucky break?secondly, assuming that suddenly players could compress all their bps into a remotely accessible data warehouse, would it be motivating (in regards to encouraging blueprint traffic) to have research/production time impacted by distance to their datapoint. let's say that the database lives in their home station, and if the factory they wish to access it from is several jumps away the overall production time goes up by a percentage. across a constellation or region it goes up more dramatically until it is unreasonable/impossible. would you as a player be motivated to move your home station regularly? what if new blueprints had to be delivered to that home station to be made usable? would moving that database be more attractive if you had a bonus to research/production times local to the database?these are just conceptual items, feedback wanted/welcome."
4/12/2010,"supported no mather what whacky details needs to be discussed further.freedom of speech is of major importance in an environment like eve.we, v3spa community, hardly ever 'locks' or 'removes' topics ourselves and believe me, with almost 300 members, there's always someone complaining the 'gods of moderations (usually called dictator's ^#@@#$^%)"
4/12/2010,"moderation really got out of hand lately. i don't like caod-like smack and trolling, but this is completely different. some fine and civil posts are deleted and topics closed. ccp, please do something about it."
4/12/2010,i also like to join the supporters of this thread.

4/12/2010,"fellow forumeers, this is simply unacceptable.ccp have in the past stated that with the eve gate expansion, we would get new forums, that work.now it seems that we have been left as the even more unloved minority, even more unloved than the 0.0 players who must struggle through crippling lag just to do what ccp intend them to do.it is time, forumeers, to take a stand and demand our rights as fee-paying citizens of eve. no longer will we be forced by ccp to contend with positively hostile forums, where simply posting is a four stage event.no more should we be tainted by such plain uselessness!let ccp know, that every single member who supports this is demanding that we get new and improved forums, sooner than soon. we want them now, and we are not afraid to make ourselves heard.together brothers, we can be the force for change that ccp has needed for years, and we will take up the fallen mantle of the forums and, by the grace of chribba, all will be solved!"
4/12/2010,supporting myself.
4/12/2010,supported after going through an insane number of steps in order to simply post my support.original thread:
4/12/2010,"there are two separate places where ccp definitely promised to give us new forums as part of cosmos/eve gate. not doing so, and then just casually dropping into conversation that they've just stopped working on it is wrong.12"
4/12/2010,"geez. they're working on it. most likely the forums will be rolled out with an update to the website as well, which is also of the 1997 variety.just relax, and continue trolling in the meantime."
4/12/2010,"it's not even so much that they haven't made us new forums, it's that they explicitly stated that they would give us new forums. it's essentially the same as what happened with fighter bombers in dominion; ccp said they would do something then just turned around and said that they couldn't.seriously, it's not even hard to get decent forums these days..."
4/12/2010,"agreed. forum software is a dime a dozen. i think i've even setup my own forums for fun in the past, just to see if i could do it.the issue here is that:a) we're using forums and a website that's so out of date as to be clunky and counter-intuitive. - this tends to scare off newcomers who tend to take a more superficial stance upon first playing the game.b) we were told something would happen, nigh promised it, and it wasn't delivered. - either fulfill what you tell us your going to do, admit that you can't deliver on time and be honest about it, or be honest in the first place and don't tell us you'll do something you can't deliver on. no more of this ""oh, you'll get x in y expansion."" *commence making a big deal of x* *3 weeks later* ""hey, whatever happened to x?"""
4/12/2010,you have my support in this forum upgrade crusade. maybe if everyone sent candy and beer then ccp could get it done? i know mountains of alcohol and sugar always increase my work output...
4/12/2010,even third world contrys have better forum software than this
4/12/2010,they are from iceland...
4/12/2010,"had a co-worker reading over my shoulder when i was looking this topic over again and he asked me a few questions so i had to explain what all this was lol thats was an entertaining conversation glad it wasn't my boss lol. nothing like a fresh set of eyes on something. so gonna quote what he wanted to ask you mortimer civeri. ""would they come back online after you de-cloak or finish your warp cycle?"". lol told him to get the game don't think he will he was kinda over whelmed with all the politics of the game. anyway love the free mines idea could set them up to target only hostiles towards you, standings, or wts rather then just dumbie mines. i mean in game they are far more advanced with technology lol why not! lol not my idea his btw. like i said nice to have someone new look at something."

4/12/2010,no. just no. jump bridges made life easy enough.
4/12/2010,my proposal is to introduce probes that only can be used for scanning of wormhole signatures. wormholes are fun places where u can travell trough to lovely upgraded systems from all sorts of people. however sometimes a wormhole is full of signatures and it takes a hour or more to scan an exit. my proposal is to introduce probes that can only be used for scanning of wormhole siganatures. nothing more nothing less. the probes should have the skill requirements like deep space probes.this saves enourmous amounts of time scanning out all those pesky ladar and gravi sites.
4/12/2010,given you only have to scan down those sites to like 50-60% signal strength to get the type difference ... we dont need to make it even more easier ...
4/12/2010,i'm waiting for the part where anyone said eve would be easy.
4/12/2010,bawhahahahahahahahhaaghaaaahahaheheheheheheheheahahahohohohoohh (falls out of chair)please... your making my sides hurt.
4/12/2010,"i make a counter proposal that we bring back the old division of probes for grav, radar, etc. and that worm holes are all assigned various sig types (like wormhole a is gravimetric and wormhole b is ladar or whatever). then its even more fun to find the wormholes hahahaha, yeah that'd be awesome."
4/12/2010,"not into details, but agree it's not a 100% safe proces at the moment."
4/12/2010,never cared about character sales (my characters are mine and will live and die with me) but the request of better security and protection against sales of characters from stolen account is very reasonable.
4/12/2010,definitely supported.

4/12/2010,anymore comments on this much needed change? sure it could be tweaked a bit but this is for the best.

4/12/2010,it's already done....spawns are limited and overpowered to reduce the lag that was seen when they were realistic with large numbers and unlimited spawns.
4/12/2010,"my understanding, from asking past csms, is that all csms from the relevant year get fanfest trips. however, only sitting csms got to be on the panel. thus, when ankh asked a question at the second year's csm fanfest panel, she was doing it with a free ticket, but she was asking from the floor, not answering from the stage. i may be wrong about this, and i'm open to correction from people who have actually won their races, but that's the version i've understood to be true. in the context of mazz, there's the generous interpretation of ""i thought the fanfest panel was worth waiting a term"", though given how she treated the first, i think we'll call that an unlikely possibility. the more likely explanation is, of course, that she was just ****ing around as per her usual public persona."
4/12/2010,lol @ the thief defending the liar.
4/12/2010,how/why do people get so worked up about this stuff? isn't it quite possible that many csm candidates see the trip to iceland/fanfest as definite plus? are they all supposed to raise their right hand and swear that they hate the idea of going to fanfest in iceland and view their work on csm as nothing more than drudgery and hard labor?
4/12/2010,"i wouldn't be comfortable with any political system where people are rewarded for voting. how long until someone runs on the campaign of, 'vote for me, and i'll get you better rewards!"" the main reason people should vote is because they believe the person they're voting for will do a good job representing them. that so few people vote is due more to the population's appathy. and hey, who wants an appathetic vote?i like the idea of impeachment, except that like someone else already pointed out, there are large powerblocks which might have the votes to impeach someone for no good reason. instead, perhaps a way to lobby ccp to investigate a csm for impropper actions, or even a 'csm eethics panel' of some sort. being a noob, for all i know they already exist, but if not it may be a better approach then straight impeachment.gee. my very first post and it's a political one. this bodes ill for eo......<lol>."
4/12/2010,"i'm sorry about the slow response time, i had to go abroad quite abrubtly and only returned yesterday.on the problem of impeachment abuse:it should be theoretically possible (i think) to check how large a percentage of votes on impeachment come from characters belonging to the same alliance, or alts on accounts owned by people who all belong to the same alliance. if the percentage of people voting from the same alliance is too high then the votes from that alliance might be counted as less votes than they really are or the result becomes outright invalid. if the diversity of alliances in a vote result is mixed enough the vote result is deemed legit and the impeachment is carried out.i'll reply later to the other comments made, so i can think about things a little more."
4/12/2010,"yay! finally!go for your two-and-a-halfth term, issler! :)"
4/12/2010,just set the cspa charge to 1m isk

4/13/2010,yes please capital jumping is lame now...
4/13/2010,"protip: shield logistics work just as well if you're not on grid(or if you're on grid really). armor rr is used for short range rr bs gangs since you can fit tackle/utility in your med slots which you cannot do when shield tanking. but for snipers, these med slots are taken up by sensor boosters and so no advantage is gained. we aren't really asking ""what is the best pos shooter"" are we? because that is typically an rr geddon fit for short range.you really don't need to carry that much ammo around. 200 cubes is 4,000 rounds. that is 43 minutes of continuous shooting and leaves you 400 cubes for cap boosters. (if you're shooting a pos you will have ammo logistics no, you cannot. the economics of this has been explained to you many times. since you want to make this about our experience. it has not been since the last changes to these ships. other changes, like changes to bombers and dd's, have done nothing but to push fleet fighting towards my position(dd's because you're no longer as worried about a specific amount of dd tank [and willing to sacrifice dps for it]). which is to say; the fleet environment has not changed for these ships since when i was flying them.tagami, you have 28 kills in a rokh and about 50 in a eagle. i have killed more pos in battleships than you have generated fleet killmails in your entire career. i have more engagement experience in a fleet apoc than you have in both the eagle and the rokh. i have more fleet engagement experience in an abaddon than you do a rokh. i have more anti-support experience than all of that put together. i have more more experience in an beam absolution (skirmish gang mod, shoots med size ships to get them away from tacklers) than you have experience in the entirety of your fleet work.i started seriously pvping in this game as a tackler against lv. then anti-support and logistics, then battleship work. all throughout the south until the final push into delve. i have seen more fleet engagements than you have seen fights in total. you may laugh and say ""olol goons"". but goons won the same way everyone else has won(and lost the same way too!), by making friends, logging in battleships, winning fleet engagements, and destroying towers. our fleet battleship fitting was pretty much as you see here, maximizing ehp and dps at the desired engagement range. the only questions were to fit for longer or shorter range(and we strategies for both). rokhs and apocs were our number one ships of choice(rokhs were more heavily reimbursed than others). and do you know why we won so often(besides the fact that we had good fc's)? there are two main reasons. the first is that we knew that our tacklers and e-war were of supreme importance and not only encouraged their use(despite the personal incentives to not fly those ships), but had both dedicated anti-support and dedicated anti-anti-support while our opponents did not. the second is that we had fit to maximize dps and ehp and our opponents flew glass cannons(at least, until they started mimicing our fleet doctrine).your alliance has space at the good graces of aaa. do not pretend that you had one ounce of ability to beat cva(as terrible as they've been) until they were removed for you."
4/13/2010,"i guess so. because i did not know that ""alpha strike"" was spelled ""d-p-s"". i mean, if you meant alpha strike that is one thing, but you typed dps.oh, and you overestimate the effect of volley damage. its not the be all end all, its good, but after the initial ""oomph"" the dpsing ships start volleying again.which is fine. but what the rokh does good is have a lot of ehp and good dps not just volley damage and ehp.(if you want just volley and ehp take a look at the maelstrom, which, given current situations will probably have the highest effectiveness well into the ranges of the apoc and rokh. it still has a 2500 damage average volley @ 230km and has a 4k volley around 190km)so you seem to be making the apoc do something other than what the rokh does. he was referencing your ""60% more dps than goums"". mine was listed at 320 dps or so, and 320 x 1.6 = ~500"
4/13/2010,"the funny thing about it is that i don't think i've ever actually run out of cap in fleet combat. however, your fit doesn't have that much better cap than goum's, and truth be told you'd have been better off fitting a cap booster instead of unnecessarily wasting two slots on cap.ed: and i dare you to comment on fleet lag and how you won't be able to active the cap booster.... yes, and that's why i keep demanding more dps and ehp for the tempest and more range for the rokh amirite? can you please go back to second grade and learn to read? my kindergarten daughter has better reading comprehension than you.-liang"
4/13/2010,"i will be fair here and say that i have run out of cap in a fleet combat.(to the point i had to inject).of course, i was flying an abaddon which caps out, guns only in some 1 minute, 30 seconds."
4/13/2010,"only reason you have not run out of cap because you were lazy to reactivate your guns or had huge lag which maked you fire less often.or fights end before 2-3mins? doesnt that contradict what you based on your balance on the huge fleet fights which fought between 500vs500 ships over a long period?so lets see fight only take 2 mins that is when one fleet completly out manouvered and/or out membered the other one. in this case dps/alpha matters mostly as one side is hurrily tries to disengage.do if you realy think 8mins cap isnt much better than 3.5mins.you can use the lower cap consume ammos to shoot infinietly while guomis fit just runs out of cap no matter what you do. the extra ehp his fits has is useless.and ive already shown how lag affects railships the most. 2sec lag cuts rails dps much more than arties or beams,thats why in laggy fights arties are the best.btw as tagami said if i have to bring a cap booster than i will run out of batteries then ammos too. as i said before sniper bs is not only for fleet fights but pos/sov unit shooting,both needs a lots of time and ammo. oh so now i have to bring both batteries+ammo supplies with me? why not just use the tempest or apoc and dont have to worrie about this. they have no disadvantage over the rokh or mega.yes thats why you bring ehp/dps comparison in every ""balance"" thread? here too,and as i remember in projectile boost threads too.so do you think rail ships are balanced or not? if not shouldnt be they boosted?because they only seem balanced in extreme examples which never happens and at 99% of time they are just crap."
4/13/2010,"that's because ehp and dps are of prime importance in fleet fights. they're damn near the only topics worth discussing, providing you can reach the requisite range.i thought i'd made myself plain:- i'm not at all interested in poor game balance. i've trained all the races and tbh couldn't care less what is nerfed or boosted since i will be utterly unaffected. however, since i care about game balance, i'll do my best to ensure argue for it to be reasonable to bring about situations where each race's combat philosophy can be maximized.- fleet efficiency is determined primarily through three criteria: 1. being able to hit the appropriate range, 2. ehp, and 3. dps.- imo, rail damage should be nudged upwards. it doesn't need a lot, otherwise we risk making them omg what the **** overpowered. absolutely no more than 15% can be possibly justified - and even that has i strongly question as unbalancing.- imo, the caldari optimal bonus should be improved so that it's reasonable to run with (at least) cn iridium at fleet ranges. the benefits from shooting beyond everyone else's engagement range are too ephemeral in heterogeneous fleets.anyone discounting what goum says in this thread is an idiot. imo, you should argue that the ship that gets two bonuses to fleet sniping should perhaps be the best one at it. maybe even by a significant margin - the question will just be ""by how much"". :)-liang"
4/13/2010,"in what fleet fight do you last long enough to get reps if you're in a battleship, specially with dominion lag?i haven't participated in many but the general rule seemed to be: if you're primary, you're dead.68 ehp or 120 ehp or 300k ehp doesn't make much of a difference if you have the combined firepower of 150 battleships on you."
4/13/2010,"well, if this is true, then quite obviously the dps of these ships doesn't matter either."
4/13/2010,"if you can warp out(and you sometimes can, and having more ehp helps) then you can get remote logistics off grid(either at a pos, or a station, or a rolling safe spot[granted this last one is dangerous]). and as the poster above me noted, if your ehp doesn't matter then enemy dps or volley damage doesn't matter either."
4/13/2010,"since we are comparing turrets and ships, i was trying to find a way to show how disadvantaged rails are. but we always hit the wall of stupid people like those who get hang up on their little view of reality and their butthurt. their cries of ""rails are fine"" and ""don't touch my precious amarr l4zors"" are a bit tiresome so, let's compare shield tanked bss, with projectiles vs rails. to forestall the cries from people that can't get that dps>>ehp (aka gank is tank philosophy), we'll use 2 fits that have 77k ehp each, high resists and same number of turrets (keeping things simple for the stupid ones):[maelstrom, sniper t2]gyrostabilizer iigyrostabilizer iitracking enhancer iipower diagnostic system iidamage control ii100mn microwarpdrive isensor booster ii, targeting rangesensor booster ii, targeting rangetracking computer ii, optimal rangelarge shield extender iiinvulnerability field ii1400mm howitzer artillery ii, tremor l1400mm howitzer artillery ii, tremor l1400mm howitzer artillery ii, tremor l1400mm howitzer artillery ii, tremor l1400mm howitzer artillery ii, tremor l1400mm howitzer artillery ii, tremor l1400mm howitzer artillery ii, tremor l1400mm howitzer artillery ii, tremor llarge anti-em screen reinforcer ilarge anti-em screen reinforcer ilarge anti-thermal screen reinforcer i[rokh, sniper t2]magnetic field stabilizer iimagnetic field stabilizer iimagnetic field stabilizer iireactor control unit idamage control ii100mn microwarpdrive iisensor booster iisensor booster ii, targeting rangetracking computer ii, tracking speedtracking computer ii, tracking speedlarge shield extender ii425mm railgun ii, spike l425mm railgun ii, spike l425mm railgun ii, spike l425mm railgun ii, spike l425mm railgun ii, spike l425mm railgun ii, spike l425mm railgun ii, spike l425mm railgun ii, spike llarge anti-em screen reinforcer ilarge anti-em screen reinforcer ilarge anti-thermal screen reinforcer inow, mael has 77k ehp, no cap issues and does 351 dps, in comparison to rokh's 77k ehp and 321 dps. but @ 170km they do pretty much the same dps (falloff for the mael takes it down to roughly 320 dps but still @ 6k alpha). these 2 ships seem roughly equivalent, and the mael costs as much as a rokh anyway, both are rigged and minmatar pilots are usually both armor and shield proficient. furthermore, the mael does not have cap issues and capitalizes on the huge alpha that is a very attractive attribute for fleets.quiz 1: how many maels are there in fleets on average?quiz 2: how many rokhs are there in fleets on average?quiz 3: why do you think this happens?quiz 4: what would you recommend in order to make these ships more attractive to pilots?by the way, matari pilots have better alternative ships to fly in fleet (pest), gallente have at least one other sniper capable ship, which just as problematic as the mega (hype has the same or worse issues, maybe because of... rails?), amarr got both apoc and abaddon but caldari have no alternative to the rokh. and after looking at the data, we got people who have never flown a rokh or mega, trying to tell us that they are just fine. guess what? if they were ok, people would fly them.p.s. liang, as far goumi is concerned, he has not been able to prove that his arguments have a basis and namecalling does not make your position stronger. i maintain that his fittings are wrong and you yourself has accepted that. he did bring up interesting points and i rerun the numbers taking into consideration his suggestions. after doing that, i came back and confirmed that even when you take into consideration the metrics he suggested, the rokh and mega do not match up to the other turret ships. he then kept trying to skew the metrics in favor of the rokh and mega by suggesting absurd fittings. from that point on, i just disregard him, because he is biased.disclaimer: the above are the opinions of a person playing since beta, nothing more[8)"
4/13/2010,"gypsio, what was your fleet experience again? i remember telling us you have never been in a fleet fight, is that correct? dps matters because you can create the alpha strike effect with less ships. less ships also means less lag and better fleet performance overall. less stress for the fc, scales better than ehp and is helping to achieve the objective of the fleet."
4/13/2010,"i don't need fleet experience to spot a crap rokh fit when i see one. intentionally gimping yourself by wasting medslots on pointless tracking-scripted tcs solely to produce a rokh with the ehp of a maelstrom is stupid. use a non-stupid fit and your inane comparisons might mean something.but if you acknowledge that experience is important, then maybe you could listen to goumindong? also, the ""other caldari fleet bs"" is the scorpion, and if the job of a fleet bs is to remove the dps of other enemy fleet bs from the field, then it's arguably the best fleet bs."
4/13/2010,all that needs to be said is said right here.
4/13/2010,"this isn't true at all, actually. when i started playing in 2006, nobody flew the drake in pvp - because everyone knew it sucked. i could seriously count the number of other pvp drakes that i'd seen in space on one hand as late as maybe early 2008. however, almost nothing has changed in bc balance (sans the unnecessary myrm nerf) and somehow the drake is considered the best bc these days. well, speaking from experience... it was then too.-liang"
4/13/2010,"i hate to harp on this, but the scorpion is a pretty crappy fleet bs. it operates far too far into falloff at fleet ranges, which unnecessarily hurts its chances of jamming enemy battleships (which you'll have trouble jamming in optimal!). imo, they should just go ahead and scrap the fleet use of the scorp, move a couple mids to lows, give it a 30% jam strength bonus, 2 extra launchers, and trade the range bonus for a 5% rof bonus. i want my brawler scorp! -liang"
4/13/2010,"dps creates the alpha strike effect....wut? alpha strike is the damage from a singular instance of weapon activation. dps is damage over time. you can have high dps with tiny tiny alpha (insufficient for instapopping)if your rof is high enough. or were you trying to say that dps matters because you get to apply your alpha (assuming we are instapopping enemies) on a new target faster? i am betting this is more what you meant... but it always helps to clarify things for readers right?it would be nice if the dream of high alpha being an incentive to bring less people (and therefore less lag) was achieved, but in the enviroment of planned fleet ops nobody is going to say ""we dont need this many people. we have plenty o ships and dont want to have things get laggy/dont want to blob"".now in regards to your statement:""and after looking at the data, we got people who have never flown a rokh or mega,trying to tell us that they are just fine. guess what? if they were ok, people would fly them""you have used the naturalistic fallacy on so many occasions in this thread that i will assume you do not see it as problematic (it's legacy as a fallacy is contentionous) so there should be no problem in saying the mega must be just fine because, of your own accounting, its the second most used fleet sniper at the moment."
4/13/2010,"i liked the brawler scorp idea also, but i thought it was important that there was a t1 fleet ecm platform. i know as a fleet ecm platform it took a hit, but the numbers aren't that unattractive really:6x ecm, strength 9.42, optimal 147 km, falloff 107 km.locks outside gang to 225 km, 46k ehp.at 180 km, that's a ~94% ecm hit chance and a 47.1% jam chance, giving you an average of 2.66 apocalypses jammed. at 200 km, it's 85% to hit, giving 2.40 apocs. i know it used to be better, but is this really so bad?"
4/13/2010,"yes, it really is that bad, imo. the fleet scorp is paper thin and primaried at the beginning of the fight. with only 2.5 expected jams at sniper ranges, the ship simply doesn't fulfill its role in any reasonable interpretation of it. engaging a similarly sized fleet means that you will almost certainly have been better off having brought yet another damage battleship. furthermore, all of this assumes that max skills - which is at odds with the intended (stated!) purpose of giving missile noobs something to do in fleet combat! trying again with bs4 and sig dispersion 4 (i think that's the right skill ... it's been a long time since i trained it) should reveal some much much less appealing results.i realize that i'm mostly bitter because they dangled a scorp in front of me that in retrospect would have been amazingly fun. maybe we can both have what we want - fix the ecm rigs so that you trade strength for range and range for strength (instead of shield amount) - like making the augmentor rig give 30% jam strength at the cost of 50% jam range and the projector give 50% more range for 30% strength or something.but i still want my 6 launchers with a rof bonus. -liang"
4/13/2010,"do you have the maths behind this to hand? looking at a 50 vs 50 fight, where one side has 10 scorps, it seems to me that instantly reducing the opposing fleet to ~30 effective bs (assume some target duplication) would give a significant advantage. or is it simply the case that the remaining 30 chew through the scorps in quick order, eliminate the jamming and then have the advantage in the dps x ehp race?"
4/13/2010,"yes, that. the scorps fall like flies and contribute very very little to the dps/ehp race.-lianged: i don't have any exact numbers to back it up - but experience tells me that what i say is true. but as goum says - since i was flying the ecm ship it may have been cold comfort for me. ;-)"
4/13/2010,"ah. i feel foolish. i meant alpha strike. the point i was making about dps is that the cycle time of guns is only important if you can get two shots off on a single target. cycle time of targeting is the time component for calculating dps in a fleet fight (unless you are a arty boat with their ~15 sec gun cycles). in a pos shoot, i agree, rokh can have decent damage output. when sniper bs move in for the kill at close range, the rokh is on-par-to-above-average (using anti-matter).mega is a carryover of a bygone era (about 2 years ago) when they were fantastic snipers (before the t2 ammo, damage mod, range mod nerfs). people trained heavily for them, and many people have large hybrids and gallente bs5 because of the fantastic moros. if it took only a few days to train large guns 5 and bs5, people would be able to adapt faster. people have caldari bs trained up because they are reformed mission runners (hard to deny the raven is not the ship of choice for killing npcs)."
4/13/2010,"the short answer is that scorps are not used because the personal incentive is very weak compared to the gang incentive.scorpion pilots will lose their bs.to compare simply. at the start its 50 vs 50. 50 apocs vs 40 apocs 10 scorps.starting dmg numbers are 40 apocs vs 30 apocs.assume apocs kill scorpions 2x as fast as they kill apocs. (not sure the real values)this means that at the start, for every 2 apocs the 40/10 gang kills they lose 3 scorpions.now we have 40 apocs,7 scorps vs 34 effective apocs. more scorps and apocs are volleyed. ~2 scorps for every apoc.(actually a bit less)now its 40 apocs,5 scorps vs 37 effective apocs. again 2 scorps for every apoc. now its 40 apocs, 3 scorps vs 40 apocs. 2 for 1 again its 40 apocs 1 scorp vs 44 apocs.the more scorps you bring the better this actually gets, up until the point where you do break even and they never have enough dps to really overcome your advantage in jamming them. 20 scorps, 30 apocs make the starting point 30 apocs vs 10 effective. and even killing scoprs twice as fast as apocs means that after a few founds the dps only gang is going to have problems.but even if you have enough to make them better the scorpion pilots are going to get hammered. they're always going to be primary. and this means that scorpion pilots aren't going to want to fly scorpions.in gf we experienced this all the time. we knew that scorpions were better than blackbirds (and sometimes rooks and falcons since all the anti-support was gunning for them and they have so little ehp), but getting people to fly scorpions was very hard because they were always primary and were always going to lose their ship. such ecm pilots tended to fly blackbirds. if they're going to lose a ship, might as well be a cheap one.that being said i do not think that this situation is a bad one. ecm is mighty powerful (breaks rr tanks for one) and having more makes it even more powerful. just because its tough to get people to use them doesn't mean that they should not be in the game. indeed, it rewards people for making the smart and community centered choice."
4/13/2010,"so your basing the lack of popularity of the rokh on the concept that it just isn't used correctly? the drakes popularity took off when it became widely known for passive shield tanking which is something that only it can effectively do. you can passive fit a ton of ships and get a good tank but nothing like the overall effectiveness of a drake. those other ships are always better kitted some other way unless you are using it as a bait ship. so your basing your argument off of the concept that in all the years that have passed since the rokhs release no one has figured out how to use it yet except for you and guam...yeah right. there is more to the game than eft warrioring and it's reflected by who fly's what in the end. from the q4 2009 qerdrake 15,959 2.21% +1hulk 14,494 2.01% -1kestrel 11,893 1.65% -rifter 11,690 1.62% -zephyr 10,540 1.46% newretriever 9,466 1.31% -1raven 8,835 1.22% -1catalyst 8,340 1.16% -cormorant 7,957 1.10% +2dominix 7,273 1.01% -3rookie ships, shuttles and capsules 305,480 42.31%other 310,019 42.94%total: 721,946is the mega and apoc the better mission runner? once upon a time it was(04'-05'). what happened? people figured out what was optimal and what wasn't and off to mission running obscurity they went. why isn't the cnr, golem, or vargur up there? they are better mission runners than all those ships listed and after all mission runners like myself are raking in by most non-mission runners estimates 40-60m an hour. that's one solid weekend and you can buy a marauder or two cnr's. the cost(both isk and training time) and risk don't outweigh the benefit to most people. same with the rail boats. the trend now is to train up to the drake and then go either amarr or minmatar. why continue past drake as caldari? there is zero benefit to spend another month and a half training to caldari bs 5 just to get a rokh that your alliance won't reimburse you for when you could train minmatar, get use out of your shield and missile skills, and have plenty of good pvp ships to choose from in all classes. i myself went minmatar though i did that even before the bc's even came out."
4/13/2010,"prodalt is me. posting error on a different computer.actually the maelstrom has historically not been used not because the pest was better, but because both were so bad there was no reason to use either (and since you were going to get shot first due to having so low ehp, might as well be a cheap loss as a personal incentive)getting people to fly maelstroms has been surprisingly hard considering they dominate pests in pretty much every way.but again, as laing says, this problem existed for the drake as well. it really hasn't changed in balance (armor/shield changes boosted the cane/harb, ac changes boosted the cane, myrm got nerfed) all that much but is now regarded as awesome when it was previously regarded as ""terrible""this is rich coming from you.says the man fitting tracking scripted tracking computers to a rokh instead of extra hit points.always maximize dps x ehp. if you can increase dps or ehp without decreasing the other (or range), then you do that. there is never a reason not to.also, why are you not comparing at 190km, where we compared everything else? the rokh has 20km extra range that isn't being used before it even fits any tracking enhancers/computers and it seems like you're comparing it there just to somehow make the rokh look worse than it really is"
4/13/2010,"you are wrong. the drake's pvp popularity took off when it became known that you could be wildly successful by not passive tanking it (you also forget the myrm's nuts passive tank -- which is better until bc5 incidentally). hence... it is exactly the same situation - they weren't properly understanding the drake, and nor are they currently properly understanding the rokh.-liang"
4/13/2010,"you can fit a ton of ehp with those mids. if you want close range brawler, it can do that. brawler and ecm don't mix all that well though. ecm was over nerfed to the point of not being used but in rare occasions (like taking out a solo carrier with subcaps), and that's just hoping they don't triage until it is too late. none of this has anything to do with railguns though."
4/13/2010,that's a logical fallacy given how incoming firepower is increased by every extra ship on the field and ehp is constant for one target.oh... and you can't warp off if you're bubbled.
4/13/2010,"the drake became wildly popular because it could passive tank better than most bs could active tank (before the nerf). the drake continues to be popular because it is fantastic and cheap way to fight bs at close-medium range. anyone who has ever been in a tackled bs and saw that giant, glowing glob of heavies coming at them understands why the drake is a good ship. add to that the ability to fit a drake with a high enough buffer and high resists for rr to keep it alive under heavy bs fire.i beg to differ with you, liang. please state what the effective niche is for the rokh.nobody flew the drake because it was caldari, and everyone flew gallente and amarr for pvp. mission runners had shield training, not pvpers."
4/13/2010,"you're not looking at the margin.after getting fired upon, you have two choices1. explode2. warp offif you warp off, get repped, and come back(or just warp off and come back). you will have more ships on the field for more time than if you explode. having more ehp makes it easier for you to warp off rather than exploding (technically if you were super-human it would extend the time that you are on the field before you warp off beyond the time it takes the lighter tanked ship to explode. since people aren't perfect in ability this won't precisely be the case, but since thy aren't perfect in ability in both cases it will generally be the case. and generally is all that we need to prove the value in a large fight)if you have more ehp it takes longer for you to explode anyway. so in the situation where you're bubbled if you have more ehp then you explode later(if you don't explode later, then dps doesn't matter), making the enemy spend more time on you and allowing your allies more time to do damage. even little bits will add up over the course of the fight.such, whether or not you can warp out, having more ehp will always increase the number of ships on the field at any given time.the question is ""how much of that is worth how much dps"". the answer to that question is that an equal percentage of that is worth an equal percentage of dps, so maximize the combination of ehp x dps.(which will fulfill that condition)"
4/13/2010,"goum and i have already illustrated why this is wrong. yes, individually your ships will still die... but collectively you will win if all of your ships maximize ehp and dps.the funny thing about that is that you're claiming that a fringe benefit might not apply - after ships with lower dps and higher ehp have already been shown to be at least equivalent.-liang"
4/13/2010,"so what you're saying is that the drake became popular because of a fit that sucked and maintained its popularity because people then realized it didn't suck.so you're saying that the drake did not become popular because it was good, but because people made bad decisions.and by the same vein you're saying that the rokh cannot be good because you do not see how it can be good? something that very few people did in the age of the terribly passive tanked drake?the evidence is here. all it takes is for you to read up a bit.and yet this does not apply to the rokh how? people training rails for the mega did not suddenly have caldari bs and shield skills trained. that does not make the rokh bad. people training caldari which mainly had missile ships did not have rails trained... which does not make the rokh bad...maybe, instead of the rokh being bad, there is some organizational resistance to people wanting to train a second sniper bs up, regardless of the strength of the one they have? i mean, look how long it took to get people out of tempests."
4/13/2010,"so you are saying the 200+ recharge per second on a buffer tanked drake with active hardeners has zero effect on its popularity? the same set up on just about any other ship would result in half that passive recharge. the ship is just made for passive tanking even if that's not what you are trying to do with it. my active kitted vargur with marauder 4, shield skills maxed, and crystal's 1-4 nets me about 250 recharge per second counting passive recharge of about 21 hp/s. a buffer kitted gank drake can get over 200. so really? maybe we need to figure out what you mean by active tank because the hardeners being active is not what i consider an active tank yet most pvp'rs seem to float about this idea that a drake with two active hardeners is an active tank even though it has no shield booster. mission runners like myself call that a passive tank. there is no real buffer in mission running of course.it's popularity took off for mission running long before pvp. 15k people are not flying them in pvp on a regular basis. they are easily to this day one of the most if not the most popular mission running ship now due to training requirements and cost.anyways the drake isn't in need of railguns. is that all you had a problem with?"
4/13/2010,"your post is so utterly incorrect as to defy comprehension. the drake was not wildly popular for pvp by any possible stretch of the imagination. for every pvp fit drake i saw (usually only mine...) i'd see hundreds of other bcs. hell - i saw more bait prophecies than bait drakes! the drake was constantly heckled as being a ""noob ship with crap damage - enjoy dying last noob"". i mean seriously - if i engaged a drake as you are suggesting they were fit with my tempest, i'd be like... lol? wow, my single rep can keep this up while my blob lands behind me. my armageddon can just flat kill you before you break my shields with that ****ty dps.no, what you're talking about is a much more recent way of fitting drakes - i should know since i got constantly heckled for claiming the drake was a good ship. as far as i've been able to tell, i came up with and publicized the standard ham drake fit. it simply didn't exist on the forums before then (afiact). but ... that fit is better than every other non pirate implanted bc.first and foremost, you need to learn to read. i have repeatedly stated that i'm in favor of a small rail boost. however, the rokh is a fantastic fleet bs. period. end of subject - and no amount of burying your head in the sand is going to change that.supposing this is correct... maybe that same problem applies to the rokh today? imo, caldari players are told in noob corps (they are btw - i've seen it) that caldari is crap at pvp and you should just train anther race. the sad thing is that it's just flat incorrect, and i doubt that the caldari community can recognize that unless they're delivered a what the **** omg bbq so overpowered win button lololollololololololl button...-liang"
4/13/2010,"for the most part i put this foward, not as a justification for the mega, just to stop people from using the naturalistic fallacy. *its a personal pet peave*i agree that people train caldari for missles... why would you train them for guns when they have only a few gun related ships (as a %of line up). i am not sure i follow your statemeent about training/adaption time however. its been 2 years since amarr became what they are today. are you saying you cant train bs5 and lg.turret5 in two years? yes many people have trained amarr, and they statistcally outnumber other races in bs fleets (probably see an influx of minmi bs over the next year as well....fotm chasers are fotm chasers), but there sure are a lot of people who didnt bother switching from the mega to date. if numbers meant anything it would suggest that mega's are not that terribad.... that was my point."
4/13/2010,"in case you didn't notice, this discussion is about pvp. i was referring to pvp drakes - which did in fact only become wildly popular once people realized the huge host of advantages of flying them. but it took a lot of convincing on the forums to make it happen.this isn't necessarily true, but that's a discussion for another thread. feel free to start one in ships & modules and i'll explain why buffer is important to a lot of good pve ships.my point was that the drake was misused and misunderstood for a very long time - such that it had a terrible reputation as a pvp ship. i mean, think about it: the drake was considered a totally useless pvp ship. since then:- the drake was nerfed twice (!!!)- the myrm was nerfed :( :(- the harbinger was boosted (lasers)- the hurricane was boosted (projectiles)so... the drake's been nerfed twice and two already superior bcs were boosted. what is the reasonable expectation if the drake really was crap back the? well we'd expect it to be even more useless in pvp..... except that it isn't. it's even widely (and rightly) considered the best small gang bc.-liang"
4/13/2010,"am i the only mission runner that keeps an eye on this? now i am guessing here but i used to use a rokh a lot in missions because it had a good tank and a lot of range. (i didn't salvage or loot so the range was a benefit but an ac vargur just flat out beats it in everything but range and if i feel like looting and/or salvaging it is even better.) i believe you can fit a drake to have quite a bit more dps than any of these ships and still have over 60k ehp and be beyond web/jam range. wouldn't that mean sniping as a whole would be obsolete if it were not for intangibles associated to it? i mean we are verging on the concept that a raven is the best sniper and we all know that isn't true but everyone saying rails are fine is looking at ehp and dps only. yes cost has been discussed but there is a lot more than just cost that it involves. there is no good pvp reason to train caldari bs. the rokh is hardly a good reason when you are better off getting a cheaper, comparable ship from amarr or minmatar that can perform other roles outside of a sniper. even gallante is better using mega's/hyperions in small gang warfare."
4/13/2010,"probably.i'm not sure what intangibles you're talking about... but 100 battleships shooting you from 180km (where you can't even respond) kinda sucks.the raven doesn't actually apply its dps because of flight time. the primary, secondary, and maybe even tertiary will all be dead long before your missiles decide the primary is dead. thus, the raven's dps*ehp = 0 for the most part.you're completely wrong. the scorpion is a good pvp bs (the only purely pvp bs in the game!), the raven is a what the **** amazing small gang bs -- arguably better than the phoon in some ways, and the rokh is the best sniper in the game due to its ehp. hell, it's also the most sp forgiving sniper bs in the game... you don't even require t2 guns to make it work.let me ask you how much you think it costs to fit and lose a rokh with extender rigs vs an apoc with trimarks?you shouldn't be using either of those ships in small gang warfare. i would never consider it, and i have gallente bs5.-lianged: goum, ehp*dps is exactly what i've been looking for. thanks for really clarifying that for me... it's been a central pillar of my argument for years but i couldn't express it properly. red raider: i should point out that i have all racial bs5.... and caldari twice."
4/13/2010,"this discussion is about railguns not pvp and not drakes. wildly popular to a .0 person and wildly popular to a high sec mission runner are two different worlds. like i said, 15k people are not flying drakes in pvp but it is one of if not the most popular mission running ship now for a multitude of reasons.run an ae 4 bonus room with an armor buffer and i will salvage your wreck. a shield buffer will still get a massive passive recharge unless you intentionally nerf it for no valuable reason at all. lvl 5's are almost completely reliant on passive tanks as well due to the amount of cap drain in them. buffer is handy and all but if you can't repair you can't finish most of the missions actually worth running.in the end dismissing my arguments because your a high and mighty .0 dweller is childish. mission runners can be effected just as much as you do because though we like to pew pew npc's not all mission runners drop our corp and run every time we get war decced. which is why no one in my entire corp flies rail boats in pvp. in turn the weakness of rail boats makes amarr, minmatar, and gallante drone/blaster boats much more appealing than anything caldari or rail fitted. that directly effects our ability to defend ourselves and the training time required to adequately do so."
4/13/2010,"will you ****ing listen? the entire argument about drakes is that people didn't understand drakes then... and they don't understand rokhs today. this is just one more cog in the caldari ""i can't win"" syndrome.who said anything about running it as a buffer tank? i said that buffer is important to many pve fits. can you please learn to comprehend what you're reading?i'm dismissing your arguments because you're wrong. simple as that.-lianged: the funny thing here is that you're presuming to lecture me on missions. i think you'll find that i know far more about missions and how to run them than you do. feel free to take me up on it in a different thread. :)"
4/13/2010,"please read the title of this thread. it doesn't say ""rokh"" or ""megathron"" it says ""railguns"". i'm not going to ask you to post a fit that shows how any of these hybrid boats can use rails better than a different race can fit a similar ship. i've seen your fits. none of them have been functional.as to the idea that people would purposefully train caldari bs so they can fly that wonderful ship, the rokh... you're full of it. are you training it? if not, why not? i'm training up amarr/beams currently, because i have experienced both the receiving end and giving end of lasers and they are better than the railguns/blasters that i trained.organizational resistance? to training a different sniper bs? no. if this was the case, people wouldn't be told to train amarr/beam or minmatar/artillery constantly. honestly, the mega is worse the the rokh, but at least it is easy to armor tank so it can function within the fleet.if there is any organizational resistance, it is to shield tanking bs. but there is a logical reason for that, 6 of 7 possible sniper ships are easily armor tanked. the only one that is hard to armor tank is the self-professed (and praised by you despite not flying it) king of snipers, the rokh.also, why would you not want people in tempest now? before dominion, there was a very good reason, but not anymore."
4/13/2010,statistics disagree with you on that.
4/13/2010,"except the megas are usually close range rr bs (fleets, not solo). they're pretty decent at this. hence, they get a lot of kills."
4/13/2010,"if the rokh is fine, then the problem cannot be railguns. this has been discussed already.1. if people feel that they have a fleet bs already they are unlikely to train a second one over training something else. if i did not have a fleet bs trained yet and did not have a reason to train other things i would be training the rokh right now, yes, over the apoc.2. this holds true regardless of the strength of the fleet bs. it held true for bob when apocs were terrible and megas were king of the roost(their fleets were majority apocs because they all trained amarr during the age of the 8hs geddon). it held true after the introduction of the rokh. it held true after the apoc boost (do you know how long it took to get people to stop flying tempests when they were easily the worst fleet bs in the game by miles? a: they never stopped)yes. trying something different is hard, and so is getting your pilots to train other races. for instance, shield tanking your fleet snipers. there is nothing wrong with it, there is no reason to not shield tank your fleet snipers. shield tanks should be even stronger now that pests and maelstroms have ""omg alpha"" (its nearly all explosive damage). shield tanks are just as easy to remote logistics as anything else(rr bs are short range and fit tackle/utility in their meds, which is why you fit armor in those gangs and not shields. this does not apply to fleet snipers)you are a prime example of someone who has this sort of dug in mentality that is stopping you from seeing what strengths a ship clearly has. if you cannot convince me that you are right, and i cannot convince you are right, why are organizations(especially top down organizations) suddenly going to come to the ""right answer"" and why is that answer your answer?re: laing: that thing i sent you, check out the maths section, it goes more in depth and i think you would quite enjoy it(even if its not the most rigorous application)"
4/13/2010,"going back to rails, a snyperion seems an interesting option. i'm looking at a fit with 401 dps at 183/58 km and 67k ehp, which compares well with the 8-tachy apoc fit i'm looking at. it does need an acr though..."
4/13/2010,i never said anything about solo. rr gangs do use them and it's the preferred bs of the mercs i hire for affordability vs utility. if i need them to gank a bunch of hulks they use a bunch of mega's. it has a lot of uses. thats the problem with caldari bs's...they don't.
4/13/2010,you're a damn fool if you think that caldari bs's don't have a lot of uses. i'd aaaaallllmmoooosssttt reveal my caldari alt to challenge you to a mega vs raven fight. :)-liang
4/13/2010,"the raven is great at pve and the rokh is great for insurance fraud. if they were so amazing they would make a list somewhere but they don't do they? they are much more limited in utility. they may have uses in pvp but its a hell of a lot less than the bs's of all the other races.i don't fly a mega i already told you i went minmatar, i can fly a mega i just don't when i have minmatar bs 5 why use an inferior ship? especially when my skill is at 3 and not 5 but its still better to fly a minmitar ship. not to mention this isn't about solo pvp its about rails and how they need a buff. which is supported by hard data a dozen times over. if the rohk was so great why isn't it on the list? the hyperion even made the list which you also said you wouldn't use."
4/13/2010,"hey, how about you stick to talking about something you know anything about?-lianged: i find it hilarious that a guy that flies minmatar and hardly knows the first thing about missioning is telling me that the caldari bs's suck for pvp."

4/13/2010,support a boost to field command ships. astarte especially. its just terribad. maybe switch the falloff bonus for a rof bonus. more pg is required and i think a low slot over a high with a rof bonus.reduce cost of these ships too. no point flying a cs over a bs at the minute. gallente gang links are a joke. they need an entire new line of gang links that fit the gallente doctrine. assault warfare links anyone? these links would improve weapon performance but not dps.info links moved to new ship class for each race -covert command- (t2 destroyer anyone?)
4/13/2010,"the answer to woes of field commands is not in warfare links. if you want to fit a unbonused warfare link on a ship, tier 2 bcs already do this for a hugely lower price while generally fitting tank and dps on top (well, with more problems on some ships, sure).furthermore, with two ship classes bonused for warfare link efficiency there's really no point in adding a extra role bonus on top here. sure, the astarte could use a utility high anyway (ditto brutix) and more fitting anyway for it not to be worthless, but that alone doesn't make the ship stop being a failboat. +1 slot to all (and extra utility high on top for astarte and brutix since, let's be fair, losing 10m3 of dronebay compared to a cyclone/sleipnir is not worth a highslot) and rebalancing bonuses and fitting across the class is imo the way to go, along with giving them tier 2 bc base hp, and a few nice extras like higher sensor strenght and slightly higher agility as per the op's suggestion."
4/13/2010,"ditto this for simplicity. also, add in a cost reduction because they will still be insta-primary. thank you for someone else agreeing that field command + ganglink = fail."

4/13/2010,"it is no secret that the t2 close range ammo, for both long range, and short range turrets, is not even worth the cargo space it takes in your cargohold to carry.why does t2 close range ammo suck? (void, javelin, conflag, gleam, hail, quake). the first reason is that faction ammo is readily avaliable, and is always in great supply on the market. t2 close range ammo does exactly 1.4492753623188355x more damage than faction ammo. yes, less than a 1.5% increase. for this increase, you gain the following penalty's.void ~ 50% less tracking, 25% increased cap cost, -50% falloff. (it should be noted that void gives a 47% optimal range bonus over regular antimatter, however, blaster optimal has terrible range as it is, and this increased range actually results in less effective range when you take into account the falloff penalty). javelin ~ 75% optimal penalty, 25% tracking penalty, 10% speed penalty, 25% increased cap cost.conflag ~ 50% less tracking, 50% less optimal, 25% increased cap cost. gleam ~ 75% optimal penalty, 25% tracking penalty, -10% shield, +12% signature radiushail ~ 50% optimal penalty, 50% falloff penalty, -50% tracking penalty 5% increased cap rechargequake ~ 75% optimal penalty, 25% tracking penalty, +12% cap recharge penalty, -10% speed.all of the ammo types have 4 things in common, reduced range, a cap penalty, a tracking penalty, and in the case of t2 long range weapon, close ammo, a penalty which significantly compromises your ability to evade damage, and in gleams case, direct loss of ehp. the long range t2 close range penalty's are incredibly harsh because they stack with each other, for example, an apocalypse loading gleam would more than half it's shields, and more than double its signature radius. it should be stressed and repeated that for all these incredibly harsh penalty's, that you are gaining less than 1.5% dps. another problem with t2 close range ammo is the nature of the penalty's, optimal and falloff reductions make sense, however tracking penalty's, especially 50% tracking, on ammo thats meant to shoot at extreme close range, where traversal, and tracking is going to incredibly important, is stupid, the signiture radius and speed penaltys also are stupid, and makes these ammo types, where they would make sense, going against a bigger ship, or bigger guns at close range and going under their guns, impossible. t2 long range weapon, close range ammo users already place a risk on themselves entering the domain of close range weapons.my proposal.~ scrap the tracking penalty's, and the signature radius/speed penalty's. ~ rework the cap penalty on projectile ammo, i think it should add a flat cap cost amount to fire the gun (maybe similar to blasters normal cap cost), instead of stacking cap recharge penalty's. ~ increase the damage on the ammo so it is more like 5% more dps than faction ammo.~ get rid of the shield penalty on gleam.this leaves us with ammo which gives a range and cap use penalty, which for 5% more damage i think is pretty fair. it leaves the ammo with the similar design, penalty's for a small improvement in damage, only that the the penalty's aren't completely ridiculous and the increase isn't either. discuss & support etc."
4/13/2010,maybe kick the sigradius penalties on t2 short range missiles at the same go.rage/fury missiles also have less range and less explosion velocity (our tracking) compared to the plain t1 counterparts.a standard ham drake with rage missiles has a bigger sigradius than a golem. o_o(edit: for support)
4/13/2010,supported as it stands now most close range t2 ammo is more or less useless. i personally would never use it. if i need close range ammo i use fraction ammo. the op explained why. all t2 close range ammo needs a overhaul both turret and missile ammo.
4/13/2010,.
4/13/2010,"unfortunately, in your analysis, you forgot to ask and answer a very reasonable question.is it ok that tech 2 short range ammo is bad?and the answer is: yes; it is very ok that tech 2 short range ammo is bad.in fact, if it were not for the fact that autocannons and lasers would be terrible without tech 2 long range ammo(auto-cannons less so now) it would be very ok if tech 2 long range ammo sucked too.the reason for this is basically a dichotomy between people who can fit tech 2 guns and people who cannot. when tech 2 guns were created, they were very much ""special"" and rare. not quite what faction is today, but similar enough that a full tech 2 fit on your ship was a significant expense and put you far above the largely ""high meta named"" ships you would expect to see.since tech 2 items have gotten less scarce in the time between then and now, the advantages of ""being old"" are, rather than having the option to find scarce items that boosted performance significantly is now not only the raw boost of in strength of fitting these options, but also cost reductions in fitting as ""good fits"" can go to the tech 2 items rather than more expensive named items.this has seriously messed up the marginal returns on skill training and is one of the primary reasons that new players are hampered in eve.so, not only is it ok that tech 2 short range ammo is bad, its good that tech 2 short range ammo is bad."
4/13/2010,"while the idea that also t1 guns can use t2 ammo has some merits, in regards to give people without the t2 weapons skills less of a handy cap it is not a serious justification that some ammo types should be next to useless compared to other alternatives.i actually would like something like a tracking bonus over the dps advantage or a more reasonable dps with the tracking disadvantages still present, so it doesn't make faction ammo obsolete. edit, forget to support."
4/13/2010,"that would be the case if it were not actively a detriment to newer players. and, especially given the problems that people proclaim with ""taking 10 seconds to change ammo"" i doubt that any option strong enough to sate people who want the ammo to be viable will also be weak enough such that it provides no significant advantage to people with tech 2 guns rather than people who do not have them.if you can find one, then good on ya. but until that time, or until tech 2 item requirements are modified, this idea remains something that should not be enacted or supported."
4/13/2010,"not flying with t2 guns is a huge detriment already (by much more expensive fit if you use top named, by losing the final 5% from the appropriate turret v and spec iv, without even going into t2 long range ammo) - the dps difference between someone with turret 4 and turret 5 + spec 4 is 12.5% already.on the other hand, it's not too hard to get into small t2 guns (back when people started with 800k sp, it took you a few days at most; now it takes maybe ten days or so), and ships larger then that for pvp purposes you should skill for t2 guns before starting to seriously fly them anyway (doing otherwise, even now, just leaves you with a overly expensive ship with subpar performance or a normally priced ship with really really subpar performance).i would not really mind t2 gun requirements being modified, but this should not be a reason to avoid making t2 ammo non-worthless.on the other hand, if t2 ammo becomes a no-brainer to use, that is problematic as well. so i would really go for t2 short range having optimal and falloff penalties but removing the rest like tracking and giving it 7-10% dps over faction. with 10s reloads (well, lasers are obviously the problem), it makes it situational whether you use the much longer ranged faction or shorter range but higher dps t2, something which can be exploited by someone with faction ammo loaded.boosting gank is always got my vote, anyway."
4/13/2010,"rage/fury missiles are well-balanced and are exactly what the high-damage t2 turret ammos should be. that is, designed to be used against ships bigger than you - rage/fury ammo has explosion radius/velocity penalties, but does ~11% more raw damage than faction.applying this to turrets means keeping the tracking penalties but boosting damage. result - ammo that isn't essential in the same way that barrage/scorch is (which, as noted, hurts new players), but provides a respectable dps increase - but only in the right situations."
4/13/2010,"the sigradius penalty is still stupid, no?"
4/13/2010,"it is if it contributes to the problem.precisely, it is a huge detriment already. no only in ease of acquiring, and strength, but also cost. so i am not sure why there should be any more detriment to these pilots.if you're arguing for a boost to tech 2 ammo you are necessarily arguing that this advantage ought to be larger than it currently is(and its currently massive, especially with tech 2 long range ammo. e.g. for lasers you go from 5 damage to 11 damage ammo in addition to the 12.5% boost from skills for a 147% increase in dpsexcept that since if a player is primarily worried about range they run with tech 2 long range ammo this has the same effect as making faction ammo worthless.(especially on lasers and autocannons where the falloff bonus on barrage makes it strong to very short distances and the lack of falloff on pulse lasers makes no one care about losing that marginal amount of range)"
4/13/2010,stupid forum; the above is me.
4/13/2010,"well, i don't know, really. in the case of using t2 ammo against a bigger ship, it means that bigger ships finds it easier to hit you. is it reasonable that this ammo increases the damage that you receive also? or should you get the benefits of increased damage agaisnt a large ship, but with no meaningful drawbacks (assume that your decreased tracking is not a problem)?i think it's the sort of penalty that leads to some sort of tactical analysis of the situation. rather than just ""hurr big ship, load t2 hi-damage, shoot"", a situation in which some level of thought is required to know which ammo to use is good for the game, as it favours player skill. i think the whole point of t2 ammo is that it should be situational, and i think that the sig penalty is reasonable as part of that. anyway, rage/fury work okay even with the sig penalties, i think, so shouldn't it be okay with turrets also?"
4/13/2010,imho making a drake so big (sig radius wise) that even torps hit full dmg is just stupid. (iirc it was 540-550m sigradius with all rage hams) you dont need to target paint it anymore. part of the problem is that it has 7 launchers where each rage missile increases it further.
4/13/2010,"signed.short range t2 ammo as it's now, is useless."
4/13/2010,"yeah, it's a bit much on any ship with lots of weapons, isn't it? maybe making it a flat penalty ignoring the number of guns loaded with the ammo would be sensible? or applying a stacking penalty to the penalties?"
4/13/2010,stacking penalize the penalty would be a start yes.
4/13/2010,"so wait, is this supposed to be an argument defending the fact that sr t2 ammo is hugely worse than faction ammo?leaving aside the rather questionable assertion that t2 shouldn't represent a qualitative step up from t1*, t2 ammo doesn't have to be significantly better than faction ammo. but it should be as good. it should be able to do something better, even if it's worse at other things (and no, +1.5% dps does not count)*t2 long range ammo is qualitatively better, after all."
4/13/2010,"t2 is a qualitative step up from tech 1. we are discussing navy faction ammo compared to tech 2 ammo. navy faction ammo isn't even the low faction ammo, but rather the middle tier faction.why should tech 2 be better than or equal to faction equipment?now there may be an argument, so lets assume that its true for a moment.is is possible to make tech 2 ammo as good as faction ammo without making tech 2 guns even better?a: no. it is notif faction ammo is better in some situations and tech 2 in others, then tech 2 ammo will be used in those situations and the aggregate of the two will be a total increase in the strength of tech 2 guns, even if the two ammos, in comparison to each other, are relatively ""balanced"". (we can assume that you don't freeze up and load no ammo)so, in short, you cannot boost tech 2 ammo without boosting tech 2 guns and increasing the difference between those with tech 2 guns and those without even further. and whether or not you even have a rational to boost tech 2 ammo above faction ammo(based on some intrinsic argument about its superiority) is spurious at best"
4/13/2010,"there once was a time when hail was useful.then they buffed fusion.now its p.worthless.an overhaul of t2 ammo(short and long), t2 guns/launchers, and ship bonus's is in order. so many things have changed over the past 4 years things need a good balancing. but dont do one overhaul without an overhaul to (or at least with an eye towards) all. otherwise you just break more stuff over time."
4/13/2010,"i'd fit standard antimatter before i would fit void or javelin. with blasers, i have to be inside the ship to hit it. the increased cap use for either is reason enough to not load it.with lasers, i'm all about my navy multispec, but would still prefer standard multi over conflag/gleam. conflag means i run out of cap in 2 seconds and gleam kills the range of my beams too much as well as making my ship the size of a station (sig radius). i've never used hail or quake (i've heard loading it kills kittens). anything that hurts falloff on projectiles or reduces the speed of the flying duct-taped-rust-bucket is a really bad idea.i'm not overly worried about t2 missile ammo. it seems to work fairly well.edit: support."
4/13/2010,"these pilots should fly small where you get t2 very very fast until they can properly fly something large rather then jump into a ship they're not skilled for prematurely and die horrible deaths. it has been like that for a long long time.that said, i would not mind at all if t2 gun requirements were lowered to the appropriate turret skill at 4 (much like thermodynamics skill prerequisites being lowered was a move in the right direction). i don't view it as a important balance factor when discussing ship performance.boosting t2 short range to have 1/2 the range (optimal and falloff included) of faction with having somewhat (say, 7-10%) higher dps and no tracking penalties (since that makes it useless in combination with shorter range; since the range already incurs tracking penalties practically speaking) would give people the option to have more gank at expense of range. the only problem are amarr with 0s reload time, which could probably be coded to require time to change to t2 shortrange and back from it.having a ""more gank"" option at cost of having to fight in hugging range (what faction isn't really restricted to) and keep the target in hugging range would add a interesting option in combat and boost gank at the same time (which is in my book a good thing)."
4/13/2010,deeply and thoroughly supported.
4/13/2010,"i think we might have different definitions of what ""play"" is. i'm here to play. zip around in space. get ships, mine, run some missions, de-stress from work. i get plenty of opportunity to do stuff i don't like in the non-play parts of life. i think it's great that the game can give you the discomfort that you enjoy, but it should equally give the comfort that others seek in a game.unless, of course, ccp doesn't see that as a goal. in which case, i'll unsubscribe and get my play and space fixes elsewhere."
4/13/2010,great idea!
4/13/2010,"going to bump this one again, this is a very good idea, the more i think on it the more i would like to se somthing like this implemented.as it is now, the only time i hit f11 is by accident, then it gets hit again as i close those map windows, they just dont present any information that i find usfull.i always use the normal map window when i wish to view system map, using these window to present players with information they use on a normal basis would be a vast improvment.realy hope ccp will jump on this and give us somthing usfull with f11."

4/13/2010,"the problem is not that there are deep safespots, the problem is that you have to use an exploit to create one. just introduce a way to create one and i would prefer a challenging way, not just ""move probe here. warp"". something where you have to think, calculate, solve problems.. whatever, it should not be easy to do.my idea for this is a new warpdrive mechanic, and also the techi **** behind (cause this is scifi k ):1. the theory of why you can't just...if you have a bookmark of a point in space it is not just coordinates, it contains also a lot of information about the spacetime topology itself in this target region. only with this information the warpdrive is able to lock on and warp to this point. without the information of the topologie the warp bubble may not terminate at a specific point but spread over some distance which results in you and your ship also ""spread"" over the same distance..however, probes are small and unmaned so they can use different warp mechanics which lead to very high accl/decl forces (which can't be compensated) but prevent them from beeing vaporized while exiting warp in unknown spacetime topology. if used to scan signatures, probes use an active scann system to eventualy find the object and use it as a reference point to measure the topology at the target. without this artificial reference point it is impossible for a probe to determine the point it should measure. they can also not act as they'r own reference point, they are too small to act as a beacon that is strong enought. 2. one first idea how you can do it (maybe this is a bad idea cause it may be boring)there are other ""probes"" that act as a beacon, but they are not able to enter warp, they have to use the relativistic way, while sending out a signal that can be tracked down. to launch such a probe you need to anchor an accelerator which accelerates the beacon into a specific direction. you can also use gravitation of planets to increase the speed of the beacon (there should be various other factors), but this will result in a different direction. once the beacon is on its way to the outer solar system you can track it down with your probes, but it will always move while you are scanning. the beacon will not deccelerate except from the cosmic medium which ""scources"" the beacon at this high velocity and limits its lifetime. as the beacon can not pass the lightspeed barrier it will take some time to travel and you don't exactly know how long it will last. the faster it travels the more likely it is that it gets destroyed early and the harder it is to track down.3. othermaybe someone has a better idea, there was always this deadspace thing which may also result in a interesting and maybe more challenging idea how to get deep safespots. at least ccp talked at fanfest about some plans around deadspace.would like to see some thought from others on this or other ideas. less whining more thinking!!"

4/13/2010,"i, for one, disapprove of this.there will still be 'deep safes' out there, just not super-deep safes. there are plenty of systems which are >100 au in diameter. i'm more concerned about the fact that you will still be able to hide things in these systems which are unlikely to be found without deep space probes yet this will not be possible in others.rework the 'grid' system on the solar system map so it doesn't spaz out when trying to place probes at range.have a 'hard cap' of say 256 au diameter. all bookmarks/assets move to the edge of this 'cap' come patch day but make the 'warpable' boundry 257 au to prevent some fellow right on the edge sneaking back over it in his supercap and becoming truely unprobable.until then you'll probably see me and my alts logging in and out a lot as i push the boundries in systems i frequent."

4/13/2010,"i'm torn on this issue. i think there is a very small, very small percentage of eve players that own these deep safe spots. i do know that that small percentage will try to make their voice be extremely loud to be heard by ccp.is having a deep safe spot an unfair advantage? sure. the tools to create the same advantage are no longer available. my problem is that ccp waited this long to remove these deep safes. if they had done away with this immediately when they took away the tools to make them then they would not be as coveted as they are from all the threads started and comments on the dev blog.in many ways, i view these deep safes as i do owners of the t2 bpo's. these are the ones who lucked out. it is a valuable asset, just like the deep safes. i would be shouting at ccp too if it was not for this one factor. invention allows those without t2 bpo's to compete with those who do have it.i have seen someone light a cyno, sacrafice the ship the lit the cyno by killing it thus forcing the cyno to drop. the cyno was 2000+ au away from where we were at in the solar system. this allowed them to bridge in an entire fleet uncontested. no one was able to warp to the beacon before it closed, no even remotely close.i can't remember if you can right click on a cyno beacon and bookmark it, but it creates and extreme, extreme unfair advantage that can not be duplicated. it is not the same as when comparing invention to t2 bpo owners.now i will say i completely disagree with them blowing up ships that players are currently flying if they are at said deep safes.if ccp is do get rid of deep safe bookmarks, then they should move any ship that a player is piloting to a random safe spot that is actually within the boundaries of the solar system. hopefully to the furthest edge of the boundary. if that is not possible, then by all means, dock them in the closest non-kick out station. capitals and super capitals to the closest non-kickout, low sec station. along with this, any ships they docked that was out of bounds, when that player logs in, there is a window that pops up just like the eula. they have to read it and in this letter it explains what ccp did, why and lets them know where they were moved. the player has to scroll to the bottom to get a box to pop up that they check saying they read the letter. once checked, they can hit the 'enter game' button.i mean no offence to those forum warriors that make a habit of spending a sizable amount of time on the forums, but having to read the forums constantly to watch for things like this, in order to prevent your ship from being blown up because of where you logged is total ****ing bull**** and you know it ccp. in the end i agree that the deep safes should be removed. i do not agree with you punishing those who happen to be logged off there with their ships when the patch hits. you want to change something this controversial in the game then you need to handle it with kid gloves.blowing up each others ships is our job, not yours. we pay for that privilege."
4/13/2010,first off... the only other method means slow boating it in an interceptor or some other ship for hours on end... which even then would be a bit silly.at least obviously... feel free to expose other tactics that don't involve leaving the game repeatedly. (bring up the carrier/fighter trick and i'm pretty damn sure that's called an exploit considering what happened to the idiot that tried that in 0.0 space when i was there)and secondly... the reasons to justify this change at just as every bit ridiculous as the reasons to not have the change.and if you had read my post before making your little nice argumentative poke in the side... you'd see i honestly don't care either way... if it happens.. it happens... if it doesn't... so be it.i'm entitled to my opinion... but i sure as hell won't make silly excuses as to why it's needed.people complain and whine about ships repeated logoffsking and being unable to track them down and kill them.how ironic that suddenly everyone want's to keep that mechanic... lets be honest.. deep safe's encourage this... you can't have it both ways...with that i will no longer discuss this topic.
4/13/2010,"i forgot one option to add, instead of killing deep safes and ruining deep space probing and possible exploration, ccp should ponder a bit on it (but proper game designers this time pls, ones with brain).few times mentioned comets and comet mining could become part of deep space spots in systems, this could be a new reason to use 100+au probes, as space is limitless and comets tend to get far away from center of the system"

4/13/2010,also agree
4/13/2010,"not supporting for these reasons.-using deep deep safes is something that only older players have in their pockets. (you can argue that you can make deep safes with interceptors but you won't ever be able to get the 1000 au safes old players had)-ccp is totally in the right to eliminate anything beyond the border (which by the way, it is not a border, you can still fly past 10 au but now it is going to be meaningless to do so) they've given notice.-supercap pilots will be forced to play the game fairer, as now they cannot store their ships 1000 au from the center. even then, they can still put a supercap in an alt and logoff, that is pure invulnerability. so no, supercap pilots are fine.i would however support this initiative if some hard limits were set.-deep space probe buff immediately-super deep safes removed (beyond 100 au or something like that) but safes within 100 are okay.-implement mechanic to create these deep safes (besides slow boating interceptors)."
4/13/2010,"i object to ccp's plans for changing and/or eliminating deep safes, especially for destroying things currently at such safes. i am not in favour of using a log-off trick to create deep safes, but i think deep safes should be possible via an in-game mechanic available to everyone. how about a ""warp beyond"" option where you can warp to an object plus some distance past it (in aus please). putting a max on the distance from the sun is ok, but make it more reasonable than the proposed change."

4/13/2010,"supported, and to toss a few ideas out there...if you have to fix e-warp, and thus consider deep safes unfair, instead of nerfing the sandbox to hell create a way for players to make deep safes.don't delete assets, move them to station or something -if- you are going to do this. (note, this still won't make me happy, i'm 100% against this, but it will make it better... a band aid over a severed artery)if you have to, for reasons of server stability, create a ""wall"" in space, give us room to play, 500au minimum.if you want to actually listen to players but still want us to be able to find -anything- in space (several thousand au deep safes) then give us scan probes that go out to ""infinity"". these give you a basic idea of where an object is with several hundred au deviation, from there you have to get it down with deep space probes to tens of au deviation, from there pinpoint with combat probes. congrats, we now have a sandbox where we can also realistically find anything that someone ""hid"". significant skills to use this of course, maybe a 10 min scan time on these infinite range probes so people can skill hide... you know what, i'll just open a separate topic for this in features and ideas.edit, link to my suggestion"
4/13/2010,ccp get a clue
4/13/2010,"the whole idea behind the deep safespots is using ""techniques"" not intended by the game's designers (read exploit) to make a safe location to store your valuables. before the whole scan probe overhaul it must have been nigh impossible to scan these down and even after the changes having safespots several thousands of au outside of the normal playing field it can become almost impossible.on the whole destruction thing, i find it quite righteous and therefore i'm not supporting this topic. ccp have put out an announcement more than a month and a half before this new boundary is introduced, which i find very gratuitous because you used an exploit (usually a ban-able offence!). so to anyone losing they're stuff, didn't pay attention to forums/devblogs or even chatting with anyone in eve about anything recent then it's your own damn fault."

4/13/2010,"placing an ""invisible"" all powerful wall that limits the astrophysics of the game by not allowing pilots to move in the areas of deep space between solar systems would be a great blow to the realism of eve.if anything you should expand the ability of pilots to fly in deep space with new modules that allow faster travel in these regions and expand the roll of scanner probes to follow. think outside the box instead of creating more restrictive boxes.ccp pull your heads out - this is a bad move."
4/13/2010,agreed!
4/13/2010,"oh yeah and this latest pile of **** with large fleet lag introduced in dominion, that is your priority number one! you really don't want me jumping on the ""give us lag free fleet battles back"" soapbox in the forums, as i've done in the past."

4/13/2010,"i don't agree with not removing anything farther out than 10au, because the only way for new players to have access to that kind of safes is by obtaining bookmarks from other players.however, i would agree with the idea of changing how deep safe spots are created, and give players the ability to create them. if that would hurt the game's stability, then i would accept the idea of using specialised ships or modules.so, i dissagree with your point. i agree with deleting everything behind this new ""wall"", as deep safe spots are now.edit: i like however the idea of evolving the deep safe spots... as in, making them more a part of the game."

4/13/2010,"in my opinion, ships should be able to warp to arbitrary xyz coordinates, provided that it's not warp disrupted. if ccp deems that ships very far from the local star are generally too hard to scan down, then some thought should be given to making deep space scanner probes easier to use."

4/13/2010,/signed
4/13/2010,"i agree that there is an issue with deep safes but instead of nerfing and restricting us ccp should take this as an opportunity to expand the tools in the ""sand box"". if people cant be found then give us a way to find them, that would be a positive change which would be warmly received. justification for the change is laughable when we consider things like t2 bpos. moving everyone within 10au has the feel of a level or area in another game not the immersive sandbox we expect. we already miss much of the feel of the size of space with gates... in real space most of it is between the stars! at a time when large fights are very difficult with lag it sounds like players have found an imaginative way to help themselves. if this change has to come in then this is not the right time and ccp should wait until the severs are at least as stable as they used to be. destroying everything seems very heavy handed and not very ""customer"" friendly in short i find the changes disappointing, unimaginative and lazy....i have come to expect more from ccp tbh and think they can do much better."
4/13/2010,"i go back and forth on this issue...one the one hand dd's seriously have the ability to make life difficult for the truely small corps/alliances; as has been argued by several people above.on the other hand, since moon goo changes were introduced there has been an uptake in the number of pilots from powerblock alliances and/or thier alt corps. anywhere there is a tech moon you will find them. given the higher numbers, it makes sense to let dd's go forward. it provides a means to deter your enemy from using caps (without the supporting fleets like you see in 0.0) to break open your pinata...err...pos (moon miner).kind of funny how ccp listened to its player base and made lowsec more lucrative, only to start getting complaints about how its turning into 0.0.someone convince me to get off the fence and either support or not."
4/13/2010,"the problem here is that they're only asking to add some of the things from 0.0 - specifically things which are seen as extremely negative by the inhabitants! and what makes it worse is that the counters that do exist are naturally weaker in lowsec than in 0.0. yes, hics exist in lowsec and targeted warp disruption works... but you can't use aoe bubbles (including mobile warp and dictors). many of the counters to titans and supercarriers that exist in 0.0 do not exist in lowsec. therefore as long as those ships are ""fully featured"", they are much more powerful in lowsec than in 0.0.you claim that ccp listened to its players and made low sec more lucrative, but that's not really true. the arguments for making low sec more lucrative revolved entirely around the people that already lived there... not the sometimes-residents from 0.0 with massive supercap blobs to doomsday anyone that dares to undock a carrier and run a l5. i mean really, if you want to make lowsec into 0.0... just ****ing do it. don't bring all the ****ty parts of 0.0 into already ****ty lowsec. puh-****ing-lease.-liang"
4/13/2010,"i doubt people are going to vote you into csm with comments like this, though dding should be allowed in low sec.look forward to fools dding in low sec and then get jumped by gang of 100 cruisers faction warfarers etc...that would shut people up for sure..."
4/13/2010,"maybe some small low sec corps want to have fun using big ships, and if they lose the ships they worked hard to get its in a fight, not to a titan? mind you there is a 30 second docking period when you cant dock after you cyno jump, so everything is vulnerable to a low sec dd - even your jf.the 4 big things that make low sec what it is - no bubbles, no dd, sec hits, gate guns.instead of this lame idea how about not making everyone in 0.0 blue? obviously you are hurting for targets if you think this is a good idea. just a thought.on that note, i cant believe i entertained this idea even this much. this thread needs to be buried by good ideas."
4/13/2010,signed
4/13/2010,"giving titans doomsday capability in low-sec is idiocy and highly imbalanced without adding all the stuff which you have in 0.0 to combat caps, which cannot be done without breaking lowsec completely. end of story. low-sec is not 0.0. adding the bad things about 0.0 to lowsec just makes it into a retar-ded version of npc 0.0. if you want more 0.0 space then ask for more 0.0 space. you'll probably nap whoever comes there anyway in a week's time, however."
4/13/2010,"do you agree that with the moongoo changes 0.0 corps/alliances have a much more significant presence in lowsec now? as such it do you agree that it makes strategic sense for titan use?do you agree that people are already rolling around in cap/supercap blobs ganking other solo/small gang caps.... hell even ganking bs (i saw 5 caps get hotdroped on a raven+domi mission running duo a week or so ago)? adding dd's would not do anything except move the balance of power away from carriers/milfs. ::cry::do you agree that the majority of carriers found in lowsec are being used as haulers... ie jumping gear into 0.0 without having to worry about gates?i would be all for limiting carriers, milfs,and titans to 0.0 (as a generalized statement...although specifics do matter). sadly, this is not the case at the moment. i am just saying that i am not adverse to making things more difficult for logistics into 0.0 (both carrier and jf), supplying a counter/ escalation to the hotdrop (as someone said it would be dead easy to bait those arrogant solo titans people seem to worry about), and i am definately ok with nerfing solo l5 mission runners in the process. personally, i am happy as a clam without dd's. adding dd's in low is really a non-issue for me as it would only frustrate my logistics. i am ok with this.-fake edit: also lawlz at vitrolic responses. they made me giggle.-realedit: add time like marlona said....maybe 5min?"
4/13/2010,"no. it has always been like that with dysp and prom moons.it makes strategic sense to deploy my newly invented behemoth class ship that can blow up an entire cap fleet, including the super caps, in 1 shot. that doesn't mean it should happen.yes, but 1 bored pilot can't jump in way out of range of all other caps, kill 1 from 250km and then warp away a few seconds later. you atleast have a chance to fight the blob and get some people out. additionally, if blobbing like that is already a problem, adding an entire new class as viable for that blob does not make sense. if anything, it should mean that fighter bombers aswell get restricted to 0.0, making a new system making more sense and gradually increasing the stakes:high sec: no capslow sec: normal capsnull sec: normal and super capssee the difference there? 5 caps dropped on those 2 people. it would only take 1 titan to drop on those caps.no, they are commonly used for either triage support for bs gangs or for defending towers. even dds would not stop hauling though since just like when undocking on a non-kickout, you can just wait out you invulnerable session change timer and then dock.supercarriers and titans sure (although i'd allow them to enter so that the already risky super cap movement ops don't get insane by being forced to take them trough hostile 0.0), but carriers are the cap most people get first, and as such, are the first introduction to capitals for many. high sec is intended to be the semi-safe first introduction where newbies and casual players get to learn the basics and utilize only sub caps, comparable to a country with a good police force where you only get limited crime and occasionall gang warfare. low sec takes it a step higher by being lawless space where small groups battle for fun with no special reason, and to again introduce people to the next step (0.0) trough the use of the personal normal caps that most single players can afford, compare able to a city where the authorities have very limited power and most cops are bribed, instead leaving the mafia bosses to rule and enforce their will. finally, 0.0 moves over to player enforce law, serious business and no restrictions beyond what your enemy can restrict you from themselves with what was intended to be corp/alliance assets of super capitals. compare this to a full scale war between nations.you wouldn't see assault rifles and armored cars etc (capitals) in small scale gang warfare (high sec) but you might in mafia wars (low sec). you won't see tanks and fighters/bombers (super capitals) in anything but international conflicts though (0.0).each sec level is supposed to be 1 step up in the stakes and what risks are there, and that means that in the same way and for the same reasons normal caps are not allowed in high sec, super caps are end game and should be in the end game area of 0.0."
4/13/2010,"not really, no. they 0.0 alliances have always owned the really profitable lowsec moons.yes, it always makes strategic sense to use powerful units where they're much more difficult to counter. sometimes, yes. sometimes, no. either way it doesn't mean that we need to make the situation so much worse.tbh supercarriers shouldn't be allowed to use fighter bombers in lowsec either. i even question titan bridges into low sec.no, i disagree with that. carriers are used as bs fleet support and for pos defense mostly. i find your assumption that every cap pilot wants to live in 0.0 pretty .... revealing.you do realize that supercarriers and titans are actually more powerful in lowsec than in 0.0 right? kick them out and leave carriers+dreads, imo.the funny thing about that is that l5s aren't worth running if you run them with more than 2 people. you can literally blitz l4s and make both more isk and lp.it would frustrate your logistics... your logistics. you don't live in low sec - so i can see why you might have ulterior motives in making low sec dwellers nothing more than fish in a barrel for your 0.0 alliance. don't you guys have a war to run in 0.0? why don't you go back there?-liang"
4/13/2010,"i thought i would chime in on macro mining, unfortunately the only real solution to macro mining is going to require an investment by ccp. this was a post a few pages back talking about the issue at hand, honestly i dont like the ops suggestion, so i thought i would offer this alternative for consideration.**********as a former wow player, i watched blizzard tackle this problem several years ago by creating a software application called warden, now included with warcraft and periodically updated. essentially the application scans your machine for the common software or characteristics of common software that could be a bot or macro program for the game. specifics on warden are probably readily available and could be better understood by programming types (which i am not).in warcraft, bot / macro folks have the upper hand since you can simply grind up another character in a matter of days on a new account, hopefully dont get caught again for a while or try a different software application. i believe ccp would have the upper hand in this situation as it takes months to get a new account skilled up (not days as you can in warcraft)couldnt they just buy a new character using the player bazaar? swap out a macro program? sure but youll quickly dry up the mining character market in the player bazaar forcing prices to skyrocket. now they are forced to pay rl money to get back to mining. at the same time the isk sellers who use these programs are taking a huge hit because their software may not be running anymore so the cost of buying isk illegally goes higher thus making legal plex card more attractive and without the risk of getting another account banned. or maybe they will look at the price in terms or isk or rl money and say its just not worth it anymore? im not an economist, im just trying process the logic.the real question comes down to development costs, im not a programmer so i cant begin to peel back the layers of this onion. but here are some business issues that come to mind for me.were not blizzard, accounts matter - how many accounts do we lose if we implement this change? 10,000  20,000 accounts? whats the impact to the bottom line?many bot accounts are also 2nd accounts of players, will we lose them possibly?is the investment required to solve the problem going to have any real positive impact on player loyalty or subscriber growth? players will always find something to complain about in the game, look at the forums. what are the ongoing costs to keep the application updated for new bots?the player question, if there really are that many macros out there, mass removal of these macros would send prices for everything higher, is the player base prepared for those consequences. oh and im not talking about the guy with 90 million sps and the equivalent isk gdp of iceland, im talking about that big swath of casual players who most hardcores fail to remember that these people keep the game alive too. personally as a player i would fully support and allow ccp to install bot/macro monitoring software as part of eve online. i dont really think of it as an invasion of privacy, blizzard had a little grief when they did it in wow but everyone got over it.ccp has probably looked at the cost or technical issues of doing something like this already and nixed it for some reason. anyone care to chime in if it has been tabled, i cant seem to find it anywhere. otherwise who supports this suggestion?"
4/13/2010,"some good ideas here.but ultimately, as its been pointed out to me, i don't think the time is right for ccp to tackle the macro issues.sure, they will keep it in reasonable check through unholy rage type iniatives. but right now they a)need the macro accounts for revenue and b)rely on macros to keep the mineral prices low enough to support the massive isk-abyss of 0.0 warfare.i think that eve after d-514 and incarna will present the perfect opportunity to overhaul mining, tweak the economy, and get rid of the macros for good."
4/13/2010,"sucks for the people who own them, but it fixes the game mechanics."
4/13/2010,no. i don't own any of t2 bpos and don't need them. this was discussed lots of times already. if you don't understand how you could earn more than t2 bpo holder - you suck at economics.

4/13/2010,"money generates more money, it has always been that way and it will be until the end (i suppose)this proposal is a lost cause in my opinion"
4/13/2010,"no, just nodont own one, dont plan on owning one.that said, ccp has stated in one of either their dev blogs or in a random post somewhere that they were at least thinking of (if not actively planning) changing the meta levels and bonuses/etc. of t1/t2 mods. that being said, why dont you stfu and wait until after an expansion to ***** and moan that you dont have a bpo, or better yet, qft."
4/13/2010,it isn't fair to us poor new players. they should all be destroyed on the 18th!

4/13/2010,x
4/13/2010,"supporting this idea just because it dare i say it, makes sense!"
4/13/2010,"this topic got some discussion a while back, but then seemed to fall into obscurity once more, so here goes. as a wormhole explorer, i run across a lot of abandoned poses. if one of them has significant structures, then it's sometimes worth rustling up a fleet of battleships to go pound it flat to make off with them, but that's the only option. there needs to be some way for an unaffiliated third party to unanchor an abandoned tower. i hasten to add that this should not become possible instantly upon loss of fuel, but equally a station left abandoned in the cold darkness of unknown space for weeks on end should not somehow be magically protected from further visitors.possible methods of balance:-timer (two weeks? longer? shorter?) begins upon depowering of station-alert sent out to owning corporation (perfect for wormhole stations; if they can reach it again, they can save it)-strontium-restricted theft (my personal favorite. attempting to steal an abandoned station triggers a timer equal to the normal reinforce timer for the quantity of strontium in the tower's bay, but without the pos shield in place. when that timer ends, the station becomes unanchorable by anyone if no one has come by to fuel it in the mean time. this means that delibereately abandoned towers can be stolen instantly, but accidentally-unfuelled towers may be rescued.)this would provide a boon to explorers, something for small operations to engage in, and punish incompetent logistics divisions in k-space. thoughts, comments, and critcism welcome."
4/13/2010,"and just like the many times before this has come up, once you kill the tower, you can un-anchor and scoop all those tower mods to your hearts content. so get that fleet of yours together, kill tower and live the dream."
4/13/2010,"that's a valid counter-argument in cases involving fully equipped stations left to rot, but often in w-space you'll find a naked tower, or a tower with one incapped gun and no other structures, or whatever. there's literally no way, under the current system, to make molesting such a station at all worthwhile, which is a bit out of line."
4/13/2010,"all it needs is 3 geddons afk and a few hours time.not supported. you should work for the spot if you want it.often when you wardec people, where you think they are inactive, suddenly the tower is online and armed again.the laziness of some people is just amazing.oh and if you dont want to do it yourself ... hire people. there are plenty of merc corps, who will happily free the spot for you. for a small fee of course."
4/13/2010,"honestly man, if your not willing to put forth the time to kill an abandoned tower, then you didn't want that moon anyways. stop being lazy and round up some friends and knock it down.four years ago me and like eight friends wanted this low sec moon. there was an abandoned tower on it. so we spent eight hours shooting it while fighting off pirates and such. i don't remember what moon mineral it was but the point is, if you want it bad enough, you can get the job done.your situation would be easier to do. get some friends with some battleships (preferably amarr w/ t1 crystals ftw) go into the wormhole, close up the exits, and go to town. with the exits closed, you only have to worry about those that were already in the worm hole with you."
4/13/2010,"what part of 'w-space' didn't penetrate? the moons are literally 100% worthless anyway, this is about theft and the options and possibilities thereof. and you cannot steal that which you have destroyed."
4/13/2010,well then just kill tower and steal mods.
4/13/2010,"i'm of the opinion that ccp should delete them if they sit for a month without fuel. no one, but the owner, should be able to unanchor them."
4/13/2010,nahh a better option would be for abandoned towers more than a month old without fuel get to spawn a massive sleeper fleet like in the stories :p would then make keeping the tower alive and well for 1 month more worth while so you could have fun killing then farming the sleepers :)
4/13/2010,"yes. belt rats, plex rats, anomaly rats, deed space rats..all npc rats in game."
4/13/2010,"i admit it's been some time since i last was in a wh system.from what i remember, though, it was like this*) deploy drone*) drone gets aggro*) drone is dead upon first shotwhere second and third happen approximately half a second apart.at what point exactly are we supposed to recall the drone?we are talking about drones, are we? not deployable turrets, as the so-called sentry ""drones"" should be named ?"
4/13/2010,"oh mai gawd...how many times do i have to say that i am not suggesting that the npc's in missions and such would be uber powerful alpha shooting dronezor stuff. i am talking about them switching targets, maybe some remote repairing, whatever. everyone is so emo about this, ""but my drones!"" crap."
4/13/2010,"as you may already hear from a devblog and associated threadnoughtccp plans to remove all deepspace bookmarks and also delete all items located there, including ship a character logged off out there is piloting. ""deepspace"" in this definition means that distance from sun is greater then distance from sun to furthest celestial +10 au.such move is unprecedented and comes with a reason that hello? t2 bpos and lots of other stuff you can never have unless acquired from other player is still there.1) deep space probes become pointless in most systems2) there is a dumb artificial limit to where in system you can go, and space is smaller3) players who weren't paying attention lose their stuff4) entering a hostile system via a bridge becomes harder and riskierproposal is to keep existing deep safes and stuff or at least raise the 10 au limit to 150-250 au to keep safes within deep space probe reach and remove the 1000au+ ones"

4/13/2010,well of course it may be easy for you since you have your own 0.0 and can grind sec at any time you want but for people that work biggest part of week havent got the time to grind away :p
4/13/2010,^ pretty much that
4/13/2010,"why not?in worst cases, it took you mere minutes to destroy something the other had to ""work""(as in grind missions, whatever) months to acquire.on the other hand, if what you destroyed isn't worth months/weeks/lots of work (for either side) - then why bother anyway?"
4/13/2010,"the recruitment forum is good and the recruitment channel is good as well and thanx for having those for us ccp. is there any way in the world that there could be an easier way. i was thinking a program on eve online where it is divided into 3 sections characters, corps and alliance. there would be a catagory buttons on there that you could pick from pvp to pirating minning wormhole and so on. but then this program to be connected to eve online in game and it's green when they are still in the corperation they put the forum up for. and red when they change from one corperation to another non-npc corperation. that'd be awesome if something like that to make it easier to find what your looking for and be done with it instead of just spamming recruitment channel and everyone else.thanx for your time-rage"
4/13/2010,"t2 bpo's are gained by older characters that have won them in the t2 bpo lottery. new players do not have the same chance of owning one than older players, ether obtaining it by winning the lottery in the past or paying billions and billions of isk for a bpo. a new player dont have the ability to make the isk that a profitable t2 bpo (like the hulk bpo) cost.people that own a t2 bpo have an unfair advantage over player that dont own them. my proposal is to remove t2 bpo's from the game like deep safe spots ."
4/13/2010,your troll isnt even original anymore -10/10.
4/13/2010,been mentioned in various threads but never actually proposed (not that i can find anyway).let all bonuses currently on ships apply to weapons of same type and of all sizes provided they can be fitted.increase graphics size of small bore guns on larger hulls.example:typhoon:minmatar battleship skill bonus: 5% bonus to projectile turret rate of fire and 5% bonus to missile launcher rate of fire per level.- can use any and all missiles/projectiles without needing to forego a bonus. sacrifices range/damage in exchange for better anti-small-ship performance when down-sizing.example:harbingerbattlecruiser skill bonus: 10% reduction in laser capacitor need and 5% bonus to laser damage per level.(this is actually what it says now but only applies to medium guns )- can use any laser of any size while still enjoying cap reduction and damage bonus. sacrifices range/damage for better tracking.you get the idea.
4/13/2010,"this would be really simple to do and i think that it would actually add alot of fun and variety to the game.. i could name several ways i could see this being usefull but ill leave it to the forums to do that. good idea, supported."
4/13/2010,...no...just no...
4/13/2010,any particular reason or are you just exercising your right to protest?
4/13/2010,how about... a ship that can field 7 weapons that are designed for ships that can field 4 don't need an additional 25% damage boost.
4/13/2010,no. if you down grade your guns you should loose the bonuses.
4/13/2010,"i can see where this will lead... every gang brings a battleship packing 7-8 t2 anti-frig weapons thus making all t1 and t2 frigs worthless, since they cant touch the battleships tank and no way they can tank the equivilent of 3-5 frigs in dps. cruisers and battleships will become the new tackle and make all frig warfare pointless, beyond frig v frig."
4/13/2010,just no - basic eve doctrine: bigger ships dont obsolete smaller ships.
4/13/2010,"are you stupid? yes, i can see it now. battleships, sporting destroyer-sized turret dps, render frigates obsolete."
4/13/2010,"yes, because a destroyer can equal a battleship's ability to tank damage."
4/13/2010,if it applied to all bonus's would i get to have my cruise hound back?
4/13/2010,"are you serious? so, if it gets changed, you would put small guns on your battleship to counter frigates just because of the 25% increase in gun dps? come on, now. that's completely and utterly ridiculous. sure, we may see an imbalance in medium blaster domis and the likes, but the original argument that battleships packing small guns as frigate counters is notably absurd."
4/13/2010,just to give you an example ... light neutron thorax with 1600mm plate. commonly seen. i dont think we really need bonuses applying bonuses to all smaller guns.
4/13/2010,"i agree, small gun vexors and thoraxes, along with some battleships on which medium guns are viable, will be imbalanced. i am simply pointing out the absurdity of the above example (which involves putting small guns on battleships specifically to counter frigates)."
4/13/2010,long overdue
4/13/2010,this proposal was brought up by csm4 and was discussed on the summit.atm it is in development estimation (how much time and scrum teams would be needed to do it) and hopefully one day (soon without tm) we will see it in game.
4/13/2010,i wholeheartedly support this. most rf/domination items are crap. this needs to be fixed.-liang

4/13/2010,"1. nobody wants to limit the sandbox. the csm got it wrong.even if eve is a sandbox, its pvp has some rules that make some tactics and strategies winning while other tactics and strategies are not going to work. so even in a sandbox game there are soft limiting factors and mechanics.for example you can fit you ship in any way you want, but its features and stats will make some setups better than others. this is the sandbox, the sanbox is not ""do whatever you want and it will be ok"", the sandbox is ""do whatever you want and pay the consequences or get your reward"". the fact is that the present mechanic encourages focus fire and blobbing while we need another mechanic that will encourage commanders to split their forces.2. fights with 1500 ships are epic even if they are split into 5 different skirmishes that happen simultaneously in the same constellation between the same two , for example. but if they are split in 5, the server will perform far better.i firmly believe that there exists a natural, sandbox-friednly way to encourage the splitting of a big force into smaller ones.just like some setups on some ships work better than others, a coordinated set of fleets acting on different solarsystem far a common goal should work better than a hypercontentrated blob. here is my proposal, but most important there is my analysis of the problem. i believe this is the only possible, definitive and sandbox-friendly solution to the lag issue. please check it."
4/13/2010,"i agree with this, but i don't agree with his proposal on how to solve the problem. ccp have tried to spread fights out between many systems but it's never worked. it's something that is too complicated to organize, and in the end it's never more beneficial to do that then to simply put all your force into one group and ram it through the enemy group. fighting over multiple systems is an idea that will always be destined to fail, unless it were held up rather forcefully by arbitrary and rather elaborate game mechanics, to enforce that style of fighting for both the attackers and defenders. i think a better way to encourage the reduction of fleet sizes is to base game rewards on who is better at gradually wearing down the enemy. instead of single fights focused on a single goal, base it on some other metric of overall supremacy. i think about the times that we lived out of npc stations and fought enemies that would dock right next door. there were no sov mechanics to support us, but there was a definite winner and everybody knew who that was when the loser eventually got beat down so much they left on their own. it was a ton of fun to play king of the hill in that unofficial fashion- now we are the only corp left in the area, we win! or life is too hard for us, let's move out.sov would have to be less binary in nature if something like that could ever work. stations would need some contested mode where both parties or anyone can dock there, and only when supremacy is achieved can you lock people out of the station.poses would need to be re-worked pretty much entirely, to base its survival or destruction on the overall gain or loss of hp over a period of time. rather then the current model where it just presents a huge amount of hp, and you have to essentially destroy it all in one go.that way, when you do have those 'epic eve fights', the size of them is more based on the natural size of the group, whoever is online and whoever has a desire to play and kill stuff at the moment. instead of the current model, where everybody pressures everybody else, their friends and their dog to log on because they absolutely need tons of numbers right now, and their scheduling is based on some pos instead of when people want to actually play. i definitely prefer the former over the latter, because one is play, and the other is work."
4/13/2010,"dear csmyou are about to start an election/reelection process. i am sure you realize by now that there is quite a few of your players upset with the ccp idea of deleting all ships in deepsafes. to show your value to us - you remember, those people who voted for you - you may wanna actually have to do something actively before the election to show us that you have any kind of even token influence over ccps random decision making process.get it stopped!"
4/13/2010,"it is just another example of ccp siding with the southern coalition.the sc was getting mad at nc using these deep safes to avoid their blobbing so they batphoned ccp to get rid of these. sure it means sc is loosing theirs too, but they are invading the north, so they are not using their deep safes in the south anyways."

4/13/2010,"well ok finally a straight answer. thank you very much ccp diagoras, and i actually mean thank you for telling us how to check. so that endes that part of my rant? tiraid? diatribe? whatever.and honorable freewoman mazzilliu, i am not sure how to accept your question? was it sarcasam or legitmet? if it's a real question i will elaborate further. but seriously look at how the voting is set up and advertised. first off one vote per person is all well and good in reall life where we have legal (well maybe a third of the world does anyway) rights to protect us from being told who to vote for. but in eve no corp can have hundrends if not thousands of members most all of whom are going to vote for who ever the ceo tells them to. with odds being in the ceo as the canident. then facter in allisences and assorted grouping and who do you seriously thing is going to win ever single seat on the csm board? part 2) there is on now central place to find out what csm is, what is dose, how it's done and the results there of. the information is not only scattered all over the forums most if it is also years old and totaly worthles. there was exactelly 2 notices about the election at sigh in that i saw since this whole thing started. people being who they are mostly figured it was sort sort of spam/add wear and went straight to the game. i like and trust ccp/eve not to waste my time or thiers by putting trash on the sign in page so i looked at it. first i ever heard of it and i have been playing for 6 months or more and i have spoken to players that have played for a year or more and they never heard of the csm either or if they had they really trashed it. (proberly since as i said it was dominated by noting but be coeps and at least one of the corps are pirates. and pvp players with no regard or morals for any other player in the game.) so the question is how do we ccp and eve try to resolve this issue and bring trust and respect back to what the csm seems to have been orginally ment to do. represent the players not the corps. amen *picks up soap box and wanders off looking for a really old single malt scotch and a ciger. looks back over shoulder. would it be to much to ask for a spell chk for the forums. the emotes are very cute but not really helpfull, no offence. * starts walking again."
4/14/2010,ok so here is my proposal for people to play with. i am completely willing to entertain reasonable changes:currently reworking to account for objections
4/14/2010,"oh my god! what the hell is going on in this thread?!talking about drakes and passive shield tanking (which i hate)i do agree with playing with the range envelope of rails but i think it should be done by reducing the range of beams over increasing the range of rails. maybe a bit of both would be better. a slight boost to damage i feel should be implemented in the form of a rof increase over a flat damage increase. rails are supposed to be high rof low damage/alpha.now then blasters..... i disagree with a tracking increase to blasters. the mega will become just too good as a blaster boat. i'd say an increase in damage would work better. yes the raven is great at pve. good dps at unlimited range (well as far as you can target) its also exceptional at bs vs bs pvp but this is unfortunatly limited to under 25km. have you ever taken a torp + tp drone raven on? selectable concentrated damage type that hits you really hard.now then, the other problem that really hurts the raven. missiles. they can't be used in sniper fleets because of the reasons mentioned above. missiles can't reach their target in time before the target is gone (either warped or destroyed). i think this is something ccp didn't see would be happening during game design. bs's getting alpha'd at over 150km i don't think was in their dream.now if ravens were effective at sniping with cml's wouldn't that range bracket where the rokh shines become very attractive? ravens dealing 500 dps @ upto 250km with energy transfers and shield rr fitting makes those big shield tanks with a heavy resistance to minnie alpha fire look very nice. and the fact you're untouchable at that range was the vision of caldari sniping. alas, you can't wait for those cml's to reach the target."
4/14/2010,"so you want a, before damage profiles, 340 dps rokh that hits to 220km with 126k ehp?and you think that will be balanced because at that point the mega will be roughly equal to the apoc?the rokh is the rail sniper. balance it first. then modify other ships as necessary."
4/14/2010,"the ""i win"" response. awesome!why are there no caldari bs's on the list if they are soooooo good?"
4/14/2010,"because people are sheep - they're stupid and require absurd amounts of convincing that their preconception is wrong. people (you, in this case) are refusing to believe that any caldari bs is a good pvp ship just like everyone refused to believe that the drake was the best pvp bc. oh man you're so damn foolish. and the really funny thing about this conversation is that ehp and dps have long, long been widely acknowledged as determining fleet combat outcomes. yet a few people here determined to have overpowered caldari ships are insisting that somehow the rules have changed. look, you said it yourself:- you are a mission bear- you fly minmatar and you don't fly caldari or gallenteso... why don't you sit back and learn something instead of piping up with your preconceptions?-liang"
4/14/2010,"your argument has been non sequitur. liang is getting a bit rowdy, but you have no made a cogent argument for him to respond to, and the argument that you have made has been made and refuted many times already.the case of the matter is thissome people think that railguns are bad and need changing.other people think that that is not true.the arguments have been fairly ""technical""(which is to say, both numbers, and not constitutes effectiveness) up into a couple of points.1) those people who think that rails are not fine claim that the actual effectiveness of each ship as figured here is irrelevant.those people who think rails are fine claim that if the rokh is fine then rails must be fine. and if you change rails you will boost the rokh and that will be bad because then the rokh will be overpowered.2)those people who think that rails are not fine claim that the actual effectiveness of the rokh as figured here cannot (or that their interpretations are) be right since players do not choose the rokhthe basis for this argument lies in the various theories of rational decision making (though the people making the claim haven't been formal) and go basically like this. ""if people are rational they will make the best choice given the available information, since people are rational, there is no hidden information, and people are making another choice then that choice cannot be the best"".the other side is arguing that this is not true, along multiple lines. the first is that well, people are not rational, or do not have all the information. this is evidenced in eve by the drake, which is an exceptional ship... but when it was first introduced it was thought of as terrible for pvp. it was then nerfed (twice?) and other ships were buffed. now the drake is seen as one of the best ships of its class. since the drake was not originally utilized and since preponderance of the drake and its perception as a pvp ship has changed, if the rational decision making theories are true then one of the assumptions, either that people are rational, or that they have enough information to make the decision had to have been false at some point.theory of markets suggests that you cannot keep information under wraps(and so gain in that matter). and this is true to a point, but information and skill are, even then, not free resources, and beyond that still require an impetus in order to kick off transmission. (that is to say, an idea cannot spread if no one first implements the idea).specifically its being argued that the same thing with the drake is happening here. the rokh is good but people do not see it(not enough info) and so do not choose it. the drake is the evidence that this can happen. since there is evidence that this can happen, rather than blindly accept that the market is correct, examining whether or not the market is correct is the more wise avenue. and when you do that, you come to the realization that the rokh is a fine ship.the second argument against that is one of incentives. via the same theory of rational decision making, people do not often consider the impacts of their decisions on others. because of this, they tend to see the advantages in fitting for dps(since that always increases the advantages they can see, in terms of damage they put out), but do not see as much the advantages of increasing their ehp (since that increases how long they survive when they're primaried. this is what they see, but what they don't see is that for every second they're alive, every other ship in the fleet is dealing dps, dps that those people realize as benefits that the player flying the ship that gets attacked never sees).because rational decision making requires private benefits in order to arrive at the optimal quantities when benefits are not private actual quantities will be below optimal[/i"
4/14/2010,"what you have done is go back to the ""but people fly"" argument. without actually refuting any of the points that explain why that argument is false.which is why people are getting hasty with you. you're not having a discourse, but rather ignoring the issues that have already been explained."
4/14/2010,it's worth reading the last post of the last page - in case you missed it.-liang
4/14/2010,"1) i used dps wrongly. damage output is the correct term.2) people fly the mega instead of the rokh due to armor tanking and cost considerations, thus the numbers are bloated there.3) if you have a ""product"" with specific characteristics that competes in the market, how do you measure market share and achieve market penetration?measure the response of your ""customers"" (alliance pilots) to the available choices, and observe how the available products are ranked.naturalistic fallacy and moral philosophy have nothing to do with the cold hard data.in the case of the rokh, even with the stated exclusivity of the ship for a specific segment of the market (caldari only pilots), it's utilization remains very low.the logical assumption is that the product's characteristics do not satisfy the ""customers"" enough in order for them to spend resources on them. after further market research the competing ""products"" characteristics that are attractive and desirable where identified and ranked:1) dps2) alpha3) ehp4) resource requirements5) cap duration (where applicable)6) fitting considerations (shield/ armor/ tracking...etc)two methodologies where used: one focused on maximizing dps/alpha for same ehp/cap/ fitting (even if that meant glass canons), the other utilized the metric that seems to affects the decision the most, which is ehp*dps/isk. in both cases decisions and outcomes are derived from consideration of data. no arbitrary decision was made, except for the ehp threshold required for fleet operation, which was based on direct observation (surviving being bombed multiple times/ shot and repped while pos shooting) and application of deterministic models (eft). this is the point of contention the last 4 pages. most people consider the 65-70k ehp sufficient, with a buffer of 14k in either shield or armor. further increase doesn't add value.the same process was done for mega, eagle and deimos.the question we need to answer is, what is required so that railboats become more attractive? the shared attribute in all of them are obviously rails, therefore their performance is lacking.the use of turrets is to apply damage at certain ranges. if the required ranges are achieved, but the performance is still lacking, what else needs improvement?"
4/14/2010,"read the last post on the last page. measuring demand is not the same as measuring quality. measuring demand only measures ""quality""* when benefits are purely private. the wealth of nations is not ""free markets"" its institutions which foster and create free markets. the coase theorem is not ""this **** just works"" its ""when property rights are clearly defined and transaction costs are zero, externalities can be fixed""**resource requirements are supply side and not demand side.you have literally made up false requirements in ""fitting considerations"" when discussing the context of rail sniping. the first methodology is beyond foolish. it necessarily leaves advantages on the table.the second methodology clearly shows that the rokh is best. not only in terms of effectiveness(ehp * dps) but also it is the cheapest since you have to consider module cost in a ships cost as well as insurance payoutsthis is simply not true. if an increase in ehp does not add value then an increase in dps or volley damage cannot add valueno, this is not the right question. game balance is not based on what's ""attractive"" its based on what is good. and if the rokh is good then it matters little whether or not people or organizations are smart enough to utilize them.and the eagle was, by those metrics, found to be just fine. the deimos was found to be ""who cares its not a railboat"" and the mega slightly sub-par.so clearly we should boost rails right? so that the eagle and rokh dominate...*quality is a nebulous term which has many definitions in this context. *basically (with respect to eve) this says that if you had to pay someone for the dps you did while the enemy gang was shooting at someone else and you got paid for the dps that others did while an enemy gang was shooting at you, and that these outcomes were easily identifiable, traceable, and the costs to make those transactions were zero then the market would correct itself. of course you don't have to pay for that stuff, their are transaction costs and there is almost no way to trace or identify who you had to pay."
4/14/2010,"goumindong is trolling every single thread which tries to balance hybrid weapons / gallente for years now.bitterness is strong in this troll... and according to the time he spends in trolling here, he seems to have no life/job/friends at all.there is no way arguing with him, since he fights a holy war against gallente / hybrid weapons.just ignore goumindong -> balancing discussions quality increase -> everyone = happy"
4/14/2010,"are you for real or what?. if you have a single clue on what goum is talking about, then you should know that goum is as right as he can be.this 'boost rails' crowd seems to be somewhat strange."
4/14/2010,tagami wasp proves (mathematically) that something is wrong with rails.goumindong persuades (verbally) that everything is ok with rails.
4/14/2010,"agreed. field command ships are ""pocket battleships"". with the option of fitting a gang link"
4/14/2010,"definitly support a boost to the bc line of ships, especially the commands"
4/14/2010,"it may also make sense to give these ships another set of gang bonuses that are more offensive in nature, but limit them to 1 gang module out of 3 racial choices. so maybe one set of them boost tracking, optimal, falloff... but only 1 fits per ship. one set boost neut/nos amounts, range. one set boost drone damage, tracking, speed. and one boost overheating effects?in other words, very specialized boost, but because it's only ever 1 bonus, maybe these ships are geared towards small gang warfare, and specialized pockets within a fleet. that might keep them as decent pvp ships, but better field command experiences. they're much more offensively minded, and their bonuses are geared as such. but with only 1 mod fitting, it's hard to weigh their benefit to that of the fleet commands that give massive bonuses up to 7x per ship per wing or fleet."
4/14/2010,"i flat don't buy this argument. i don't see the point of flying a 200 mill isk field command when i could just jump in a ~50 mill isk bs. sure, there are advantages in terms of resists and mobility, but there are disadvantages in terms of rr options, neuts, ehp and dps."
4/14/2010,"which part of the argument is not bought? i suppose i dont understand what your objection to my agreement was because it seems like you partially agree as well. as with all t2 ships, they offer increased resists, bonuses, and mobility (particularly in lower class vs. higher) and on a 1v1 basis, most field commands will obliterate a ""~50mil bs"" handily (or at least should, hence a boost request). furthermore, the on-paper dps potential of most of these ships is a lot higher than said battleships (i.e. i can find a fitting that will nudge the astarte well over 1k dps at the cost of ehp) but as with all ships you generally trade off monster dps for ehp, repairing, mobility, remote rep, etc. this is all just a wishy-washy way of saying ""this ship is just like the t1 version, but a whole lot better."" the problem with that is the t1 tier 2 can often outclass these ships by a wide margin hence the need for a boost."
4/14/2010,"they should fix this, re-make that pathetic excuse for ui so it will take about 5 times less space, make customizable fonts, change fonts to something readable and we'll finally have a game with actual user interface (customizable text re-coloring would be nice too).7 years after release is a way too long time for fixing all this obvious stuff. i'd rhather see ccp stop doing expansions and make old things actually work instead (and there's even a work for graphics department: re-drawing pathetic excuse for an ui into something as good as their average eve trailer)."

4/14/2010,"i find this action reeks of laziness, why not level the playing field by making a mechanic to allow any pilot (with correct skills assets or whatever) instead."
4/14/2010,"if these spots are ""virtually impossible to find"" or however ccp said then why not instead of hurting players and removing functionality add functionality and create a mechanic to enable the finding ships at these locations!"
4/14/2010,i can not yet fly anything bigger than a battleship. i find it abhorrent and cruel to destroy ships in these locations.so what if they are exploiting? why give warning then. if you want to punish people for using this exploit then punish equally and give no warning.
4/14/2010,i am running out of things to say about this issue. perhaps because it is simple and clear cut.

4/14/2010,signedthe heavy-handed sledgehammer approach smacks of a knee-jerk reaction with little actual thought put in as to how this actually affects players. do you actually care so little for veteran players who have spent years building up the assets that you may be wiping out with the click of a mouse? a one month warning of destruction of potentially hundreds of billions of isk? are you serious? at the very least run the script in read-only mode and drop all the players an email giving them a months notice. don't expect everyone to have seen the dev blog or in-game news. what if i left my titan logged off at a deep safe and went on holiday for a month?fix the broken fleet warfare before you go breaking a method we have to actually get around your fail and have some fun. continuing down this path of slapping your veteran players will only hurt your revenues in the long run. we are the people who supported you for many years and bring many more players into the game. i for one wonder how much more of this i'll put up with before i just cancel my accounts and stop promoting the game to others.
4/14/2010,signed. ccp : you are putting limits to a universe without limits. the deep safes were created by ingenious players who understood the game mechanics better than the devs. instead of deleting them ccp could have embrace the idea of deep safes and make a legit way of creating them and scanning them. balance this two - creating and scanning - and you get a new feature instead of all this flame from all of us.

4/14/2010,well if your going to say that then the bs have smartbombs/webs/scrams them selves and all 50 web 1 frig/destroyer at a time and use rr and nuets win
4/14/2010,make it easier? hmm. they need to remove the -10 cap. then we'll hear some real whining.
4/14/2010,actually id be up for thjat lol :d
4/14/2010,"no, in the worst case it takes moments to destroy what took years to grind - and the sec hit for that is infinitesimal. whee. and in the most innocuous case, you get swarmed by a bunch pvp 'training' gang with everyone less than 1m sp and end up accidentally podding 20 people in t1 frigs. <--- yes, that happened... sec went from +3 or something to -9.-lianged: and the *really* funny part was that we were doing anti-pirate patrols at the time."
4/14/2010,"i dont know if you have heard, but this is a game... you play a game to have fun, not to spend 2-3 full days of your life boring yourself to death. with that said, just make it impossible to raise sec status again. would make it a real penalty."
4/14/2010,sure it is a game ... but it is also a game living from consequences of your actions. as your (pod) killing can have hefty consequences to your victim ... your sec status loss should mean something aswell. so ratting for a few days to get from -10 to -2 sounds fair.
4/14/2010,but surely easier sec status gain = more pirates = more pvp in low sec?
4/14/2010,you mean those folks who run around with -10 and dont care about their sec status? good argument!
4/14/2010,"awesome wall of text bro.on another note, some better recruitment tools would be nice. for instance, being able to add your corp to some categories, and at the same time allow potential recruits to filter recruit ad's based on those categoties would be a good start.whenever i looked in the recruitment forum, i always saw a bunch of ad's for corps that did the sort of thing i'm not interested in, and eventually gave up. if i could some how filter out these corps, i'm sure i'd be more patient.i'm also certain it would be easier for corps to recruit, as they wouldn't always have to explain to every potential recruit what their corp was all about (i.e: ""we're a pvp corp, and we operate in lowsec, blah blah blah"")."
4/14/2010,"i would love to see ""advertising"" as a new mechanic to eve.kind of like contracts. specify if you are individual looking for corp or corp looking for alliance. which could be sorted by ""type"" and region.each corp/alliance could rent a small ad space in their region to put a short description of what it is who to contact etc.would certainly cut down on those f-ing annoying recruitment cans everywhere."
4/14/2010,"isn't it there already for corps? is it just me or recruitment cans are not suddenly starting to dissapear? ofcourse, re-doing it so that individuals could post too and make it resemble contracts with lots of filtering options would be nice."
4/14/2010,"sub-forums under the recruitment forum would help.like industry, pve, pvp, pirating, etc. would organize the mess that it is."
4/14/2010,"agreed.the in-game recruitment tool is nearly worthless and too costly. adverts should be free within the corp racial profile as set by the ceo skills. recruiting newbie harms standing, a counter balance is needed, bigger corps should receive a slight boost to standing based on their size.newbie often to create their own corps, without realising they are handicapping themselves. a tutorial is needed that introduces them to the recruitment tool would a good idea."
4/14/2010,"most of the ccp main forums are poorly modded as it is, what's to stop a corp from spamming their advert in each of these subforums?"
4/14/2010,"title of thread says it all. the ""apply"" button in the skill training queue should be eliminated. the ""apply"" button should be replaced with a ""skill training begins in x seconds"" countdown function or some such.the justification for getting rid of the ""apply"" button should be obvious to everyone who plays eve, or ever played eve.logging in to eve to find that a skill, which you thought was training, hasn't progressed one second is an all too common occurence. i trained a pre-req for weeks, in order to train a skill that i needed, and when that pre-req was done, i spent 60+million isk on the needed skill, put it in the queue to train, and went out. when i logged back on, some 8 hours later, that needed skill hadn't progressed one second. frustrating.please, liberate us from the ""apply"" button."
4/14/2010,right click -> train to level 1there is your solution.
4/14/2010,"the right-click options don't safeguard against all situations that can arise. its possible to place a skill book in the skill training queue without 'right-clicking' on it and using the options. therefore, it is possible to interrupt the skill training queue and deactivate it. no one intentionally forgets to restart the training queue. my suggestion is to eliminate the possiblity of deactivating the skill training queue by replacing the ""apply"" button with an auto-restart function."
4/14/2010,"sorry, but i think that the need for the ""apply"" button is so obvious that i fail to understand why this thread exists. i see no reason to get rid of it."
4/14/2010,"let me guess...you're one of those people that routinely turn off those helpful messages that pop up as warnings (like the one that says, you have made changes to your skill queue. would you like to apply those changes now? when you exit the skill queue without saving your changes.)not supported due to lack of necessity."
4/14/2010,"station windows would be great. it's realistic, simple and (slightly) rebalances lowsec away from the pirates.supported."
4/14/2010,michael jackson wasnt jinmei he was khand with a facelift you f***
4/14/2010,edited: removed and added to continuing discussion here
4/14/2010,"well, i was simply going to the extreme, but you do have to consider that in any type of 1v1 frigates become worthless if the enemy can field a cruiser, cruisers become worthless if the enemy can field a battleship, and frigates become pointless even in groups against a a battleship. it could just tank then and tear them to shreds.as for the destroyer comment, yes, it can fit the same number of guns, but can you fit the tank of a battleship on a destroyer? can you fit a heavy neut/vamp to a destroyer? can you fit the number of damage mods on a destroyer that a battle ship can? not to mention destroyer get a 25% rof reduction. if you go off the op, you'd have typhoons with a +25% and destroyers with a -25%. not even close to same dps."
4/14/2010,"this is eve where the patently absurd is usually what gets nerfed because everyone does it because, silly or not, it's effective."
4/14/2010,"i play on a laptop in windowed mode, which makes my screen irritatedly tiny and, being a director in my corp, blogger(k162space), also in a null alliance with intel channels, i have enough channels open that they take up a good tenth of my screen, and there's no good place to put them without obscuring a goodly portion of my ship or ui.simple suggestion: have an option for chat channels that are blinking move to the far left of the stack, so if someone says something i can go to that channel, which s moved to the far right of the stack, so once i've read/responded i can go straight to to the next blinky channel without having to have an unwieldy box obscuring a eighth of my screen.if there is already an option for this and i've just massively embarrassed myself, i'd appreciate it if you'd stop laughing long enough to point it out."
4/14/2010,"as long as it's optional, and the default is off, i don't see any reason not to.add it to the list of 10 billion ui improvements that ccp needs to make."
4/14/2010,that is 1 random request.
4/14/2010,this is one of countless things they should fix....
4/14/2010,"i know this would probably take a major, major revamp of chat channels, but hey, that's why this is a proposal and not a demand for instant gratification.i cannot tell you how many times in eve i've been asked something in languages i can't understand, and how many times i've run into non-native speakers that talk gooder than most of the native english player base (c wut i did thar?)it seems to me that learning another language in order to communicate with 90% of the players of a game seems like a bit much to offer, so here's my suggestion:suggestion: add the option for auto-translation of chat windows into eve. basically, look at incoming chat and determine if it's one of three types:some language other than the language chosen by the playerthe language chosenpure insanity i.e. l33tsp34k.not even trying to change the leetspeak, but essentially looking at the unknown language and trying to get enough words to figure out which language, then translating it into the preferred language. the player's reply would then be translated by the receiving player's auto-change, ect, ect.advantages:promoting actual correct grammer \o/breaking language barrier over its kneehelping new players that don't speak english in the rookie channel, ectera.and, above all, removing the requirement of ""speak english"" from non-english speakers if they want to communicate with the american playerbase.disadvantages:learning more about russian insults than you ever wanted to know.ungodly amounts of programming hours.admitted, you could just use a free online translator in the igb, but hey, this is a suggestion for a way to make the game better, not a plea for help.onward!"
4/14/2010,"where is the problem with that?someone wants information from you, so it's their job to provide a question you understand.not yours or ccps to translate.besides, i seriously doubt there are translation systems available (within acceptable prices) that would do well enough to be useful."
4/14/2010,"here are a few of the (new) big points i will be focusing on should i be elected this upcoming term.documentation from ccpsince eve online was released the players have had to practically fend for themselves in learning how to use new features that are added to the game. ccp has slowly become better about informing the players but they still have a long way to go with improvements in this area. the trial-and-error of learning the game is fine for voluntary aspects of the game like researching, manufacturing, mission running, and other similar things. however when it comes to ""features"" and ""changes"" which are forced on the players there needs to be documentation from ccp (more than patch notes) for how everything functions. case in point? dominion. ccp forced sweeping changes on the playerbase with how sovereignty would be handled in 0.0 space without providing adequate documentation on how the new mechanics worked. the story of goonswarm losing sovereignty across delve is a good example of players suffering for ccp's negligence with documentation. players might be more encourages to venture out into 0.0 space if they had this information available too. having documentation ready to go for the release of tyrannis expansion would be a great place for ccp to start. evelopedia would be a great place to host this, contract system improvements there are three big improvements that i'd like to see done to the contract system. first i would like to see the ability to pull a target from the address book when designating who the contract is to. having to type names in repeatedly for same person is silly and it would also cut down on having to select the character when his name is john and you have to select it among every other john***** out there. next i would like to see the creation of special shrink-wrapping from your own hangar. select a bunch of items, right click, shrink-wrap option selected, voila! if you can rename the shrink-wrap it'd be even better! this would make contracting prep work easier as well as dividing things up for hauler/freighter transport. lastly, i would like the option of having contents (which aren't in a container) of a contract you're accepting shrink-wrapped before they enter your hangar. two contracts with similar goods could be safely accepted at the same location without them becoming mixed together. wouldn't that be great?red zealotspos and sovereignty structure managementwith the release of dominion the notification mails for pos stats was improved by the new mail system ccp added. but this is far from ideal especially when you get the dreaded ""couldn't read notification ######### because of bad format, check logs for details."" i want to see a new ui window added to the client where we can monitor: pos fuel levels, pos reinforcement timer status, station & ihub reinforcement timer status, and whatever else deemed necessary for this category. this would be a benefit for all players, whether directly or indirectly.more ui improvementsthere are a few more ways that i feel the game ui can be improved for everyone's enjoyment. one thing is the ability to opt-in for email reminders when your account subscription (via plex or gtc) is nearing an end. this would be a boon for players who don't use all of their accounts frequently and would miss the notification at the login screen. next i would like to see the maximum number of allowable tabs in overview increased from 5 to 10. the overview could also do with having the function(filter) to only show war targets. and finally it would be nice to be able to fit out a ship via a saved fitting without boarding the actual ship.accessibility groupduring my previous term i sponsored a proposal to have ccp create some form of accessibility focus group for the game whether it be in-house or external to the company. i have a personal stake in this issue to insure that eve online remains not only playable for individuals with physical disabilities but also enjoyable. being re-elected to the csm will help me fulfill this. following up on old issuesnow that the csm has been granted stakeholder status within ccp i want to go through the backlog with my fellow csm members and push to get things the playerbase wanted added/fixed taken care of.and much much morei learned quite a bit about the whole csm process during my first term. this experience will allow me to better address the ideas and concerns of my fellow players should i be successful in being elected to serve a second term. i implore you to ask any questions you may have. you may contact me via this thread, evemail, or on my web site. i've also created a channel in-game where i can be reached: avalloc4csm."
4/14/2010,re-energizing the csm election:i've given quite a bit of thought to how i can help generate some excitement for not only my own campaign for csm but the whole process. therefore i am putting into effect a promotion which i hope will have a positive impact for everyone involved in the election.win a plex promotion:each candidate for the csm will hopefully have a thread posted in the jita park speakers corner forum. and so each week until the election ends i'm going to be giving away one plex to two lucky players who took the time to engage a csm candidate (not just me) with a serious question. the questions will be tracked by my web site at

4/14/2010,"dominion had the initial goal of dramatically increasing the number of players that could be supported in a given upgraded 0.0 system through anomalies. the target number per system was repeatedly lowered until it was stated that a system would support 5 or so players running the highest level anomalies (a fraction of the anomalies spawned by an upgrade) at a target income comparable (though not superior) to running level 4 missions in high-sec.the financial incentives dominion offered for the average 0.0 player in 0.0 do not seem commensurate with the higher risks and inherent costs of 0.0, at least to me. what is your take on this?"

4/14/2010,"the election committee have used the millions at their disposal to hand-craft the following interactive campaign website: linkyin a nutshell, i have an extensive technical and legal background and a professional demeanour (when i need to) which i believe will increase the credibility and effectiveness of the csm. i'm used to representing clients and getting them what they want (except when i don't, which is always someone else's fault, probably). staying awake and focussed in long drawn-out meetings discussing the fine detail of technical issues is something in which i have a particular expertise!i am not beholden to any power blocs, alliances or special interests*, and i am not fixated on any specific issues or play-styles (i do enjoy pvp, even though i am hopeless at it, but i understand that other people enjoy other things, and lost ships have to be paid for somehow). i believe it is my role to listen to players' opinions and to represent the most popular viewpoints at csm meetings, whether or not i personally agree with them (although i would always seek constructive ways to improve any proposal if i felt it wasn't good enough).in not entirely sure of the etiquette, but i will be happy to answer any questions here that people have - although i apologise in advance if i'm not on much in the coming days as i am in the process of moving house (er, i mean transporting my personal habitation unit to a new system).* so i'm not overly hopeful of being elected :)"
4/14/2010,"i would like to know your views on power blocks. currently power blocks are a full blown reality in 0.0 they are in fact a necessity to accomplish much of anything.true some of the epic battles are nice but i feel power blocks take away from small scale roams and fights. ships attributes become irrelevant and and it is just a matter of ehp and going down a list of who is primary.what are your ideas on how to scale down the ultra blob and power blocks and have 0.0 more than simply ""team a vs. team b""?"
4/14/2010,"if i was voted onto the csm i would of course want to know what you think :)in a vastly complicated game world like eve, the law of unintended consequences is in full swing so it's difficult to propose a single tweak that would address this and not break something else. there is also the broader question of whether or not most people are in fact in favour of scaling things down rather than going for a more epic scale - large power blocs also require a wider range of skills (diplomacy, accounting, management, leadership, etc) that are not called for in small hunter gangs, and this is a mmo game after all - in which case we're back to trying to minimise big fleet lag and related issues.i think one specific problem is that people in 0.0 blobs don't have on-demand access to small scale pvp without a high risk of disaster (due to bubbles and the like allowing whole fleets to be trapped easily). maybe it would be good to find a way to make it easier for people in 0.0 to dip in and out of low sec or another arena for smaller scale pvp. maybe something like instanced wormholes connecting willing team a with willing team b and a mass limit to keep the gangs small (sort of an instanced area without breaking the eve ethos too badly), but that's not very well thought out and other ideas might work."
4/14/2010,although my first act on the csm would be to get the forum to remember which character i want to post with...
4/14/2010,"apart from figuring out how to scale down blob fights in 0.0 you have to ask yourself the question if the majority of people in 0.0 actually want to.ofcourse, in empire space there are plenty of people who don't like powerblocks, or huge fleet fights, and those people stay firmly in empire space where they earn plenty of money with lvl 4 missions to **** off the people who lose lots of ships in low/null-sec. but those people won't go into 0.0 without radically changing the 0.0 experience, which ccp doesn't want to do. the csm members you'd have to content with for votes to pass any idea you might come up with through the csm are also often pro-powerblocks so even if the majority of players wanted to get rid of powerblocks, you wouldn't get it past the csm.what i mean to say is, you might be asking the wrong question. there are tons of ways in which you can change the game to demotivate people to go into powerblocks and hold huge fights. but how do you get the right people to put it into the game?"
4/14/2010,"so i hate the scan timer message thing, when im tweaked out and trying to spam directional scanner to find a drake in a belt the stupid message always pops up and irritates me.imo their should be a option to allow the directional scanner to automatically refresh discuss"
4/14/2010,a nice idea in principle (with implications for gameplay balance) but auto refreshing scanners - some watched and some not - would probably bring the server to its knees.

4/14/2010,gee and here i thought we were on the same side on this issue vis a vis confirmation or aplications etc. and as for the hijacking comment that is a base canared and i resets the alligation and the alligator whats made it. i have merely elaberated on some points that have been over looked. and i would point out that in fact i was the one hijacked by being moved from the forum i orginally posted in to this one. so there for you are incorrect on all points and i declare that your remarks be set aside and a plea of not guilty accepted. so say we all. so say we all.

4/14/2010,"one last thing. (ok thats a fib since as this goes on i'm sure i will have something else to say but frankly i hope not.)ccp and eve stand on the brink of greatness by making a major and permenate change to gaming by combinding pc/mac gaming with console (dust)gaming and ultimetly adding playing by phone or any other possible internet connection in the future. yet it risks this and everything they have shed blood, sweat, and tears doing for the last few years because they are about to alienate a very great number of players by their disregarding what those players are asking for and not getting and by ccp's standoffish handling of this entire csm election. we have players from the young to the old (like myself 59) and others i know are older than i am. yet more and more of those players are leaving eve even after putting in months if not years building their toons and skills. why? because they are furstrated because the game has become chaotic. pvp players are in every single section of space from 1.0 to 0.0 and everywhere else taking advantage of new players or simply killing and stealing from whom ever they want. so concord kills them so what? their friends are there to collect the salvage and the loot. they use cheep ships for suscide ganging that don't begin to cost them anythin even close to what the honest player has spent just trying to get by. then the forums are so crowded and jammed with old and worthless information that trying to take the time to find out info on your own is actually an exercise in futility. add to that that (lets be real here) very very few people are going to read for than the first 3 maybe 4 pages of any forum looking for what they want, won't find it, and the simply ask their question that has be asked and answered countless times before in the same forum that they didn't go far enough back. that's human nature, come on people wake up! get rid of anything in any forum that is more than 6 months old. no one wants to nor will they read it and it is taking up a hugh amount of server space and no doubt making some sort of impact on lag in the game. and the skill sets are great i totally understand offering as much as anyone could want in skills but are you kidding me? anything that takes more than a week to learn is going to get passed over everytime untill the player relises that he/she needs that skill to advance to something else. this is a game folks not college not work. do away with anything that takes longer than a week to learn or simply cut the time for that skill back to a week. you scare off a ton of people when they see how much they have to learn and then they ask around and find out that it could litterly take years to learn even one races technology completly. they are going to quit before they even start. go look at your stats. or should i say go back and look at your stats and see how many players never get past the free period or if they stick past that point what is the average length of time the average player stays with eve? i bet money it isn't longer than 6 moths if that. no one is going to pay 20 or 30 dollars a month to get killed by buttheads or spend forever learning a skill. if all you have to look forward to is getting killed and robbed no matter how ""safe"" a section is supposed to be and spending weeks and weeks learning skils just to make money to stay in the game. they are going to go run not walk to find something more fun and a damn site easier to play. there is/are and in fact another thing or two i would suggest and proberly something else i have left out of this but if you haven't gotten the idea by now that you need to take a time out and punt, then nothing i will say further will do any good and a wonderfull, incredable idea and dream will simply die because it's to top heavy to float. and frankly in my opion that would be a shame and a crime for all this to have been wasted.fly well fly freeelf lord"
4/15/2010,"actually i proved it mathematically. minimizing the function for an enemy fleet where d1 refers to the damage of the first target, and t1 refers to how long it takes to kill him and the entire thing refers to the damage a gang takes from an enemy gang and n is the size of the gang.(d1)(t1) +(d2)(t1+t2)+...+(dn)(t1+...+tn)minimizes when for any sequence of two ships n and n+1 (shown here in the specific case 1 and 2) where the following is true (where e is the survivability of the target ship)(d1) (e1)+(d2)(e1+e2)< (d2)(e2)+(d1)(e1+e2) in the above conditions, changes to damage and ehp for any ship in the fleet maximize that function when0=a[(.5n+p)%dp-(.5n-p)%tp]where a is the damage the each half the fleet does due to the damage and survivability of the target at the mid point and p is the position of the ship in the fleet relative to that mid point and n is the size of the fleet.since due to target calling and expectations regarding randomness you cannot ever violate the condition of dp/ep > dp+1/ep+1 (or rather, when you can will be random) maximum effective fitting in dps and ehp tend toward the point that for any ship you want as much dps and ehp as possible (specifically %dp= -%tp. which is true when dp*ep are maximized) so long as dps/ehp ratios are similar. since the weighting tends to push ships maximum effectiveness towards a bounded dps/ehp ratio(of the most populous ship*) this condition can be more or less assumed. at which point, p is random and the weighting tends to evenly distributed meaning that for any similar ship type, uniform fittings are desirable and those uniform fittings will maximize effectiveness * survivability.of which we are recording here as dps * ehp. this is a reasonable assumption in a fleet fight because since dps acts upon ehp and since effects that increase survivability that are not directly tanking(i.e. warping out) decrease the effective dps in precisely the same fashion and amount these effects can be removed from the equation. (it does not change the ordinal minimizing/maximizing point, so we don't care)*this point is important because the choice here is an individual choice that produces a maximized gang outcome. if an organization collectively (or individually enough times) chooses a sub par ship, it can be that the sub par ship becomes for each individual a better choice to maximize the gangs outcome. furthermore, the individual rarely chooses the ship which maximizes the gang outcome, but their own, and in those cases the value of their ehp relative to their dps goes almost to nothing (since they don't consider the damage others do as a benefit) unless they're the very first target... which, since everyone is flying low ehp high dps ships is highly unlikely.e.g. with the scorpion example earlier each scorp neutralizing 2 enemy ships. bringing 10 was not enough to win the fight, bringing 20 might be enough to win the fight. bringing 30 certainly would have been. but if you bring only 1, it gets targeted first because it has a known low ehp and gets annihilated...(barring meta fitting tactics which super-tank the ship[hey oh this will be an mixed equilibrum by gangs but not typically for individuals which is why it does not happen as often as it ought to], but that is another discussion altogether and does not have to do with the conditions that are discussed here except as to prove the point that bringing good ships is not always good if the rest of your gang did not get the memoand that is the story of how i mathematically proved that you don't know what you're talking about, routinely make bad decisions regarding the strength of the ships that you fly in gangs, and had a good reason to ask liang if he read that part of that thing i sent him."
4/15/2010,"but you might ask yourself. what if the gang is not completely destroyed. doesn't that shave terms off the end as the fight caps at one sides gangs survival? and the answer is yes, but since we still can't effectively violate dp/ep > dp+1/ep+1 there is no reasonable way of arranging your fleet in such a way that you can deal more damage unless they're not engaging at all.but in that case, the returns to dps are quite marginal and only the returns to holding your opponent in place matter(or a hard time on docking/jumping that you cannot manipulate in any way) buying 3 more seconds before a fleet gets away is as efficient as increasing the dps of your entire fleet by 10% when you're on a gate with a 30 second de-aggro.and for the marginal case where you do increase your returns you similarly make yourself weaker if anyone actually decides to shoot at you. which is to say, generally what people are trying to do in eve."
4/15/2010,"work on that and you can turn it into a formal proof by induction. at any rate, i did read it and enjoyed it immensely. -liang"
4/15/2010,"goumi, you are solving an optimization problem but you take the wrong objective function and forgetting some very important constraints.1) resource constraints.2) threat environment. your formulation is wrong, so it doesn't matter what solution you get.as long as you try to assign value to ehp over 70k for fleet snipers, you will get the wrong results, even if your methodology is right. so you are saying that the problem is defined by fleet composition, thus the preference of the pilots in the fleet, but when i bring this up you don't accept it as a valid argument?[golf clap] way to invalidate your position.[/golf clap]"
4/15/2010,"what resources are so constrained that the effectiveness of rokhs would be affected? are not shield rigs cheaper than armor rigs?large cdfe: 10mlarge trimark: 20mexplain?so explain what the correct one is? imo, goum's formulation of the problem is 100% bang on. notably, its the same one i've been using for a long time - though admittedly his is put together better.no, if the methodology is right, its right. your conclusion may be wrong though.the term you are looking for is ""discrete"". either way, it doesn't affect things as much as you think it does.-liang"
4/15/2010,"that will take much more time than i have, mainly because i will not know how to write proofs until my maths education gets a bit further. i am quite sure it can be done however. no, i am not ignoring resource constraints. the size of your gang is n. that is your resource constraint. no others matter all that much in eve so long as we are within an acceptable range... which fleet snipers are... which we have already shown the the rokh is cheaper than the apoc in ""actual cost"" due to insurance benefits, rig costs, and ammo costs. so that cannot be a bound that would somehow disqualify the rokh. a non-binding bound has no effect.furthermore, target calling based on price always increases the strength of the enemy gang(even if it has benefits, the enemy gang gets stronger as a result of it)would you like another lesson in how economic costs are factored into the market price of goods and that any production rents that are present would only increase its market price over its ""actual cost"" and decrease its production quantity and that any consumption rents would only decrease its consumption quantity and decrease its ""actual costs""the formula is the threat environment so that is right outreally, how so? really? how so. you do realize that if any ehp over 70k is useless then any dps/volley over some value required to kill a 70k ehp bs in your operative time frame is also useless...,,,and that would go down as the number of ships you brought increased... which would eventually make any ship equal in value to any other in a large gang... but we know that is complete idiocy because otherwise no one would ever fly anything other than 70k ehp battlecruisers and we know that 70k ehp battlecruisers are going to get brutalized by a proper sniper fleetprotip: that doesn't matter. you maximize at the margin, regardless of whether or not the margin is infinitesimal. all a non-continuous application does is move the maximization to the closest point possible to the maximization point(in the case of non-linearity you may need to check the positive and negative point, but that doesn't really matter either, there will be a maximum of two points and we don't actually maximize that way anyway because we don't actually have access to a function that defines the change in survivability relative to effectiveness for one fitting compared to another. we only have heuristics and the final combined value, which we can compare against another and simply choose the highest one. the point of the proof is to show that the maximization point is that point where dps * ehp is maximized because that is the point you will see when %dp= -%tp. to compare with something you might have learned in a remedial economics course, this is precisely similar to the effect on revenue(price x quantity) relative to price elasticity of demand[revenue is maximized when ped = -1, transforming the above equation we get {%dp/%tp}=-1 as our maximization point]. just like you do not need to have continuous demand in order to maximize revenue based on the demand function you do not need to have a continuous function of effectiveness and survivability in order to maximize the strength of a ship in a gang)"
4/15/2010,"no actually. people making bad decisions does not invalidate the strength of the ship. nor does lots of people making bad decisions.it does however formalize how individuals can make decisions that, as a group, are better off being being made in a different way(each individual makes a maximizing decision based on what he thinks everyone else will do. he thinks they will do something stupid and so does the thing to counter that)if you want more information on situations like this, google something called ""the prisoners dilemma"". the one presented above is not quite similar but similar enough to workit also formalizes how organizational inertia can have an effect on the choices they and individuals make*. these choices are in spite of the strength of the ship and formalize how the bad decisions get made, decisions that ultimately harm the individual and the organization.*if people flew apocs because they trained them during the age of 8hs geddons and any decent number of people won't train rokhs for any reasons what-so-ever(such as wanting to train recons instead of a better fleet sniper) then training rokhs becomes even less attractive.rather than explain that the ship is bad, it explains how people keep making bad decisions."

(higer base armor, more therm res)it's simple: if you fly a rokh, you die. since nobody likes loosing ships, gallente bs 4 and you may actually whitness the end of a battle. next experience is you die if you don't warp out as soon as you are getting locked. a bit more ehp won't save you. more damage on the other hand will bring you on top of kill mails. i like to be on top of killmails.sniper bs are throw away items. no riggs, so this price comparison between armor and shield riggs is pointless. as someone else said it already: there is no fix for the rokh, it's either overpowered or nobody will ever fly it, since the armortanking/damage mindset rules."
4/15/2010,"no the apoc,tempest,mael is perfectly viable in mixed fleets of todays, but rokhs isnt(even guomi accepts this). isnt this what guomi tells up from the begining that if ppl would be hiveminded and all would use rokhs only in their fleet then rokh would be the best sniper bs. he brought the scorpion example which also requers hivemind, or else your scorpions would just overlap their jammers and be as useless that nearly nobody brings them which is how it is now :) boost/change scorpi as those arent working in fleets.so tell me who would be that stupid to not know from an alliance that they use only rokh fleets they are fighting against?in the end there will be a rokh only fleet(because rokhs only work this way) vs a mixed fleet between apocs,tempest,etc. then if you know they bring rokhs only then you can fit your resist to counter the rokh fleet easily. but you dont have to use only apoc fleet you can mix it up easily with tempest, so the rokh fleet can fit their resist vs aurora only. i think this is perfectly understandable, hope you guys can follow me:pso my problems about guomis ""dps*ehp is what matters"":1. it only takes into account a snipe battle between equal numbers at 190km,but there are many things what your sniper fleets have to do, fighting against capitals,killing pos/sov moduls, fighting against smaller ships than battleships etc. but you only want to say us the rokh is fine on only one aspect of what it has to do.2. battles are nearly never equal in eve , this is also got disregarded3. your test battle needs 400+ ships for one side, what if there is less than 400 battleships on the field?in small fleets alpha matters hugely4. cap isnt taken into account , the example rokh can only fire its guns for 3.5 minutes from 100% cap without using mwd--> i quess all enemy are dead by that time is over...5. ppl cant/wont train for one race,especially for sniper bs as they requer so much sp ,so there will be mixed fleets , where rokh isnt good at all , due to shield tank etc.6. lag , lag hurts hybrids the most because those have the lowest alpha and fastest rof, and empty their clip the fastest7. reload time , it is clear that in such a huge battle they have to reload their guns--> futher lower their dps vs beamsi could write even more..so do you realy think that in a very limited enviroment experiment(which is as far from real eve as it is possible) the rokh's slight advantage realy prooves that this ship/weapon system is fine?i think ,that guomi compared the rokh vs his apoc and then came out a test enviroment where the rokhs can be better to justify his and caldari/gallente and amarr favourism rage.this is hardly enough to disproove tagami's/my examples which clearly shows how bad rails realy are.you can still proove that rails are fine ,but do so in not a such limited steril enviroment as 500vs500 homofleets with hiveminds. btw if a ship is worst of its class for 95% time and only slightly better than the rest for 5% time it is a bad ship not a niche one."
4/15/2010,"who is talking about rigs? fleet bs are throwaway items and every alliance worth it's salt, does not require them to be rigged. look at the bpcs for each ship to see what are the resource constraints. remember, minerals are not free, time is needed to gather them and you always have finite resources.buffer and ehp requirements are there because of threats. before it was dds, now it is sb squads. massive instantaneous damage from a source that is difficult to avoid.well, if you read the whole thread and your arguments, you will see that my formulation of the problem does not rely on the parametrization and calculation of each individual ships attributes in a fleet. i utilise a proportional hazards approach to calculate the effect each ship has in relation to the other to find out how each ship, under the same environmental variables performs, taking into consideration the stepped function that correspond to each ship's characteristics.fixed that for you.i know very well what discrete is, thank you very much, since we have binary decision variables, the problem becomes a bit more complex. the fact that we also have specific values that our variables take should also be taken into consideration, because it alters how the objective function value behaves at the boundaries of the feasible region.this branch of deterministic modeling is called integer programming.back to the problem at hand, liang do you refute the argument that railguns under-perform in comparison to the rest of the turrets? if you fear that rokh will be op, what is the balancing factor that you would insert? p.s. goumi, math based on false premises are still false math. you haven't proven that the rokh is fine, all you try to do is say that under specific and extreme cases, the rokh can perform better than the other ships. my concern is however for the every-day case, the environment all the rest of us operate in. protip, from rl: use reason before you use math."
4/15/2010,dps*ehp=valueuntil you realize you can warp out to avoid incoming fire.
4/15/2010,"rokhs have more ehp vs aurora than apocs and do less dps. if fleet commanders are primarying them they're stupid.more ehp means you have more time to get out.that you like to be on top of killmails is precisely the type of decision making that makes you make bad decisions for the entire gang.no, you do not require ""hive mind"" only sufficient density. incorrect. it takes into account all of those. effectiveness and survivability are defined, when in sniping fleets (which is what we're discussing) as dps * ehp. since all other aspects of the sniping ship make little difference in the battle.no, it did not. if the battle is not equal with respect to an enemy having more then the function works perfectly. if the battle is not equal with respect to you having more and being decisive then you need to read the post where i explained exactly what happens in those situations.you keep saying that shield tanks are bad, but you never actually explain why it is so. there is nothing wrong with shield tanks on snipers. read the thread this is taken into account.actually ""best 5% of the time"" would be a very good definition of ""niche"""
4/15/2010,"if you can warp out to avoid incoming fire then the same effect that increases your survivability on the ehp side decreases your dps by that same percentage.the end effect of this is neutral towards the final value and the maximizing solution.rig your fleet bs. its a good idea. fleet bs are not throwaway items. do not throw them away.with regards to mineral costs, we have been over this. what matters is the final market price, those opportunity costs are priced into the market value of the item. if insurance reduces the real cost to lose then this is the cost you must consider(because your producers will be compensated at the correct rate)that is a lower bound on ehp. since we are above that lower bound, this has no effect on outcome of the function.and has been pointed out many times, your method is terrible.we don't have binary decision variables. our decision variables are effectiveness and survivability. these are not binary(but are inter-related)except that you and only you are claiming that these specific values are correct. the function to maximize the damage that your gang does over the effective time frame shows that you can maximize more outside of those parameters that you have specified. which is to say that your parameters are bunk unless you have some reason other than ""i say so"" for your parameters being ""not bunk""you do not just get to claim that you are right without backing it up.this is not necessary since the function simplifies into percentages rather than explicit effects. i get the feeling(especially given the ""proportional hazards"" approach) that you're throwing out buzz words in the hope that one or a few of them will stick without actually knowing what you're saying."
4/15/2010,"this is incorrect. if ships are not destroyed, and always able to warp off, you do not decrease their fleet's ability to damage your ships by anything more than the ships that are in transit. most dps is wasted on ships that warp out because they cannot be hit hard enough to break them before they react. increasing the damage output of your ships decreases the reaction time the other fleet has to warp.in fleet fights, the people who die early on, usually to mistakes, impact the fleet the most (their dps is removed from the equation for the entire remainder of the fight). they die because they made a mistake and aren't allowed enough time to correct their mistake. usually by a function of overwhelming, insta-pop, alpha strikes. if a fleet cannot kill anything before it warps, it has lost the fight.the key error in your logic revolves around your idea that fleet ehp and dps both aggregate. the reality of eve is that it is a fleet's dps/damage against one ship's tank/reaction time. dps/damage aggregates, ehp does not aggregate.the difference in effectiveness between a ship with 50 ehp and 200 ehp is maybe an extra second or two of reaction time. incoming damage increases exponentially in a fleet fight. so, the longer you sit there, the faster your ehp disappears."
4/15/2010,"amazingly, increasing your ehp has exactly the same effect. who knew? let me ask you a question: if you have 200 max skilled close range battleships shooting a ship for 2 minutes before it warps away... did its ehp matter or was your dps somehow lacking? the edge cases reveal the error in your argument.-liang"
4/15/2010,you formulas describe mostly fleet management. this thread mostly is about rails. it is easy to indicate what is good and effective for fleet fights. just see real ship combination in fleets.p.s. fleet fight depends on many factors which are sometimes unpredictable. effectiveness of a member depends on even fleet fight scale :)funny example. everybody play starcraft. terran marine costs 50minerals. protoss zealot costs 100minerals. 1 zealot defeats 2 marines. 2 zealots defeat 4 marines. 3 zealots defeat 6 marines..... but further n*zealots can not win n*2*marines. because zealot melee disadvantage and marine focus fire start to play role.
4/15/2010,"this cannot be true if increasing ehp also does not increase the reaction time that you have to warp.lets go over this very slowly.the amount of damage it takes to kill a ship = ehpthe amount of damage a ship(or enemy fleet) deals = dpsthe amount of time shooting = swhen dps x s = ehp, damage = ehp and the ship explodessuch ""time to warp"" = ""time to kill ship"" (because you have to warp before that)so if dps x s = ehp then s = ehp/dpsthen an increase in ehp will make s larger and an increase in dps will make s smaller. in fact a 1% increase in dps will make s 1% smaller and a 1% increase in ehp will make s 1% larger! [who would have thunk!]this is true even if you take that and look at volley damage assuming that any amount of time is required to volley. which is a safe assumption.but if you don't make that assumption, if you say that you have enough people volleying the target no matter what then volley damage no longer matters eitherso, if ehp does not matter, dps cannot matter!and any effect regarding warping out is affected equally by an increase in ehp or dps.damage does not increase exponentially in a fleet fight. it steps linearly. if the step is large enough you can vaporize a ship. an increase in ehp that is not enough to stop the vaporization does nothing but so does an increase in dps that does not move a volley from ""not vaporizing"" to ""vaporizing"". and since total damage values will be decreased over the course of the fight there will be points where both of those breaks happen. and because of that they're both important.are you happy now? i've proved it from both sides.the math describes the strength of a fleet depending on the values for each ship. this thread is about the values for ships that shoot rails. therefor its applies.fleet fights depend on many factors which are unpredictable. but since they're unpredictable they do not apply to any ship more or less than any other. such when examining the strength of a gang based on the composition of its ships these unpredictable things can be ignoredyour zealot/marine example is actually very telling. you see, one rokh is not that great, but 100 is fantastic and when discussing the value of ships in fleets, what matters is how good they are as a group.do you wonder why organized gangs beat disorganized gangs? its because organized gangs are maximizing to the above formula and disorganized gangs are maximizing individually."
4/15/2010,"my objection to the ""no-gm"" idea is simply that a field cs without a gm is inferior to a battleship in terms of dps, ehp and gang utility, but costs 150 mill isk more. ships, especially t2 ships, need roles, and field cs don't have one. simply boosting their base stats etc won't give them one."
4/15/2010,"what's the role there? you know, you can fit a bc to have good dps, good ehp and a warfare link and about 1/10th the price of a cs. alternatively if your gang is sizeable enough you benefit more from a fleet cs which loses dps but gains ehp and three bonused warfare links.warfare link is a additional extra when we discuss field cs, not the role, since gang boosting role is largely covered. what i basically envision field cs as is a ""hac on seteroids"" with somewhat less mobility (but more then bs and preferably slightly more then tier 2 bcs) but delivering what is essentially speaking close to bs-level dps and having the option to fit a warfare link."
4/15/2010,"i suggested a proper role a while ago.evidently, the idea itself was just way too good and sophisticated for the average forum level"
4/15/2010,"sure, a bc can fit a gank link. but it's tough on pg and cpu and it receives no bonuses to the link's bonus's strength. a field cs that could fit a link at no pg/cpu cost with a respectable bonus to its strength, while possessing good actual combat capabilities (unlike the fleet cs) would be an attractive option and viable role, i think. i don't like the ""hac on steroids comparison"" because hacs are defined by mobility or range, and field cs have no more of either than bcs. now, i have no fundamental objection to a rework of the class into super-hacs, but i suspect it would be tricky to balance them with hacs and still make both worthwhile. and even then, why not give them a link bonus as well?"
4/15/2010,"yes, field cses should be boosted."
4/15/2010,+45 cpu is too much for a sleipnir but other ideas are decent.
4/15/2010,"this actually seems like a worthy discussion. whats the point of a field cs as opposed to a fleet cs? one can differentiate this in two ways:fleet commands are designed for large gang warfare (sniping, structure bash, fleet battles) whereas field commands are designed for small gang warfare (gate camps, raiding parties, 1v1).in fleets, there is an emphasis on dps and ehp. anything the fleet command can do to increase those is key, and hence needs a lot of bonuses to do so: lock speed, resists, etc.in small gangs, there is an emphasis on dps, speed, and size. the field command can provide bonuses, but its mostly a pittance because more often than not it is more important to bring something fast with high dps. the field command can do this: it has crazy dps bonuses.fleet commands are supposed to hang back and be in charge of fleets, while field commands are supposed to be in the fray and take charge of the situation.fleet commands already do this well. they have three bonuses and (typically, sans eos) have high ehp. they may be primary, but they can (should) take a beating and still provide bonuses essential to the survival of the fleet.field commands do this by providing high dps on the spot when and where needed and have enough ehp to survive until their target is dead. they need to have the highest dps to target variety ratio in the game (be able to attack everything from frigates up to battleships, which medium weapons do a good job of), stick to their target like glue until the job is done (through speed matching, scrambling, webbing, weapon effectiveness), then bail should the need arise.these only exist in philosophical terms of course. camp #1 is difficult because you can see fleet commands filling both roles, but for #2 the case is easy to make. if you look at the bonuses for each of the field command ships you will notice that they all have two damage bonuses, a tank bonus, and a weapon effectiveness bonus (range, explosion velocity, cap use). with the current prevalence of ehp and cap warfare (thanks ccp for the double hp boost a few years back) the repping bonuses on the sleipnir and astarte are largely useless due to high ehp needs in sustained fights. the way missiles work, the explosion velocity bonus is probably useless if it cant help you nail fast frigs (i dont use missiles in pvp). cap usage bonuses are really nice, but there are alternative solutions in quick fights.edit: really only my two cents on this"
4/15/2010,"field command ships should just comfortably fit a ganglink. i believe that would be their role. lead small gangs, where the loss of dps compared to a fleet command isn't worth it.unfortunately that role is already covered by t3 cruisers."
4/15/2010,"or tier 2 bcs if price is a concern. some of them can sport very competitive dps, solid ehp and a warfare link.they need to be first and foremost excellent combat ships, which some of the ships in the class most definitely are not."

4/15/2010,i'm all for lowering the skill requirements on tech ii guns. i personally don't believe that the buffing of t2 close range ammo is going to make the skill gap between a new player and an experienced one anymore than it already is.not being able to use barrage/scorch is a much bigger detriment than not being able to do 5~10% more damage at extreme short range.

4/15/2010,"macros aren't only used for mining, but ratting and scam spamming too.not necessarily. people who use macros have large amounts of passive income to purchase things that they want to use (meta 4, tech 2 and faction gear), and don't really care what they spend on them. removing these (cheating) passive isk fountains will mean that all purchases will have to be made with isk that is earned, and so will offset the lack of mineral floods.another tool to help solve the macro issue is data mining. i was sitting in jita the other day and i could set my watch by the scam spam - one was posting exactly every 73.2 seconds. no human being could do that, and there are many other tell tale signs of macro use. a very basic application to look through ccps logs would reveal macro use, a couple of examples of things to look for would be: 23/7 activity (people need to sleep) and unnaturally consistent behaviour (timings of command sequences being consistent to the millisecond).these could flag accounts to a gm much like an email spam filter with a probability that the account is a macro user, and even have a threshold for autoban to save staff time.i too disagree with the involvement of concord with macro use, as it is highly likely that an empire hulk miner will be afk mining and will miss any request.and as for having software that scans your computer - so long as it is limited in its scope to search for known macro programs, i see no issue. as has been mentioned, many software packages do just that as their primary reason for existing.for ccp this is a credibility issue. if macro use is against the eula, and therefore cheating, it is diminishing the game for legitimate users who play within the rules no matter what positive role it may play (provision of lots of minerals is a pretty poor justification for cheating). if ccp does nothing about it, their credibility is in question - if they knowingly ignore obvious macro use then their credibility goes down the toilet."
4/15/2010,"are you kidding me?so macros are so amazingly dangerous that we should all give ccp permission to install a trojan on our computers, allowing them to arbitrarily decide what processes we are allowed to use. how could anyone believe that is a ""solution"". i think ccp care a little more about their customers then the faceless blizzard.at the end of the day, having some piece of software installed is no indication of macro use."

4/15/2010,in theory each of the 9 full delegates can raise 1 or 2 issues per meeting (due to simple time constraints it isn't practical to schedule more than 15 issues). there are certain requirements that must be met to raise an issue from the assembly hall such as the thread having been active for more than 7 days.you'll notice that not all of the delegates are choosing to raise their allocation of issues leaving some of us to pick up the slack to some degree. hopefully by scheduling the next meeting a week later than usual we'll have more people raising issues for it.

4/16/2010,i think the bigger gang the lower influence of ship type. first role in large fleet plays organization.what advantage do you consider thinking 100 theoretic rokhs are fantastic against 100 theoretic maelstroms or 100 theoretic abaddons?
4/16/2010,"if the bigger the fleet the less influence of ship type then the relative strength of ships is not changed. since the question is ""which ship is best?"" or ""is this ship good enough"". even if larger fleets made ship type matter less (i doubt that this is true) this would have no bearing on the question we are asking."
4/16/2010,"thats it. talking about rails for fleet - maybe it is ok. but talking about solo pvp, pve, micro gang please see first page. there is comparison rails vs other turrets. talking without any complicating factors [of large fleet fights] about railgun weapon. rails have no distinct advantage.in short: lasers - good dps at flexible range, arty - incredible alfa, no cap use, switchable damage type. even rails range is advantage mostly on caldari ships, not gallente.of course ehp plays role also. but amarr ships are very good tankers, and minmatar ships are fastest in the game. so what about rails especially on gallente boats?"
4/16/2010,"but fleets is all anyone has ever talked about because its all people use long range weapons for.(pretty much)i mean, should we care that rails are bad for solo pvp, pve, or micro gangs?oh and the comparisons done compare max attainable ehp and dps which is to say that the fact that amarr are good tankers, that is already figured into the analysis.as to the question of ""what about rails on gallente boats?"" that begs another.should gallente railboats be strong? assuming that is yes, the answer cannot then be to buff rails, since that buffs caldari rails as well, which have been shown to be strong and so boosting them would be inappropriate."
4/16/2010,"agree on this. boost of rails will overboost caldari railgun ships. after that they will have good dps at good range... p.s. in this case i would change topic to ""railgun rebalancing for gallente ships"". because caldari rail boats have distinct advantage - range [because of optimal ship bonuses for optimal]."
4/16/2010,"no. you are still not wrapping your head around some basic fleet warfare concepts.when an fc calls a target, everyone begins locking that target. some people have faster locking time than others, some don't find the target right away. so, you end up with a few people with near perfect reaction and the fastest lock times locking the target and shooting it first. then, in the following few seconds, everyone else gets a chance to fire. this ramp up of incoming fire increases exponentially as you work your way up the bell curve of averages (reaction time and locking time). no sub cap can tank all the incoming fire of a 100+ bs sniper fleet (we're talking millions of hp of damage in one salvo from all the ships). they survive by warping after receiving damage from the fastest end of the bell curve.make sense? now, these same bell curves mean that damage over time will increase in a roughly exponential way (unless you have a tank that can absorb all the fleet's alpha strikes). so, to gain more reaction time, you have to to have an exponentially greater tank.ehp does not aggregate. damage output does. you have to have an exponential increase in ehp to increase value (increased reaction time buffer). value from damage increases linearly. this is why your simplistic formula is not an accurate mathematical representation of the game environment."
4/16/2010,"the problem is that this is not exponential as you believe but rather linear and stepping.you have made 3 errors in your analysis which lead to one common fallacy1. you have assumed that the distribution is normal (it may not be)2. you have assumed that you are always on the increasing side rather than decreasing side of the bell curve3. you have assumed that this increase occurs forever and has no upper boundas such you are exhibiting a logical fallacy relating to size. i.e. incoming damage is very big very fast and larger than ehp(in the instances you view) therefore it cannot be linear.now, the second two are necessarily false. at some point you will have a decreasing number of people adding their damage and at some point there is a flat upper bound where everyone has applied damage and dps is no longer increasing at all, but linear.the reason that this is best examined as a linear function that steps can be seen if you would kindly count from 0 to 100 once each second. so at t=1 you will have just hit 1 and a t=100 you will have just hit 100. you should notice that this count can be expressed as a function of time.you will also notice that this function has no simple derivative. but lets see if we can abstract one by looking at an arc derivative(for lack of a better word).i.e. what happens between t= .5 and t=1? well in that case the change is 1/.5 or 2 since the change in t is .5 and the change in the count is 1. but dc/dt is not 2 if we see what happens between t=.5 and t=1.5. in that case the change is 1.it may not be true that for any dt<1 that dc=1 but it is true that for any dt=1 dc=1. and this is why we know its linear and stepping rather than exponential. after all, you wouldn't be foolish enough to say that you were exponentially counting would you?as such it does not matter if damage is applied very very fast. in the end, its still linear. and any big spike of damage is going to be accompanied by some amount of time in a fixed proportion to the damage where no damage is being dealt.this is why that second part was important.you see now we are dealing with spikes. if the damage spike is bigger than your ehp you die. if not then you live.but that means that for any change in the function dz(where dz is the damage of a ship in the fleet as a function of time) such that sum(d1+d2+...+dn) from 0 to t > ehp. that change in damage has no effect on whether or not you kill the ship.looking at that again, lets assume that you are at the breaking point where sum(d1+d2+...+dn) from o to t= ehp. since we have seen that when one is larger than the other at any step changing damage or ehp will not have any effect unless it changes the number of steps required we know that in those cases both ehp and dps/volley damage do no matterin this case we have two options what happens when dz gets bigger and what happens when ehp gets bigger. if ehp gets bigger than t steps to the next iteration(from 2 volleys from the fleet to 3 volleys from the fleet for instance) and if dz gets bigger it steps to the previous iteration( from 2 volleys from the fleet for instance to 1 volley from the fleet)we can also recognize that sum(d1+d2+...+dn) from 0 to t, when t=0 (assuming t=1 is the point at which volleys hit) is always zero that no change in the damage of a ship upwards can modify t and only changes to ehp upwards or dps downwards can modify t. and we have seen that if we are in a situation where we cannot change t upwards by modifying ehp then we also cannot change upwards by modifying damage by the same percentageso if ehp doesn't matter, dps doesn't matter. but in any fight there will always be points where they both matter, and will always have a linear effect, even if they might not for any particular subsection of the fight"
4/16/2010,"in fact, lets take your case and assume that people are perfect and always get their damage off instantly and never have trouble finding the target etc.first off, we know to things about this condition relative to your ""exponential function"". we know first off that it increases at a faster rate (since everything in the system that causes your function to rise causes mine to rise... but happens earlier and in a smaller time frame and so happens faster.you will notice that if you say ""everyone shoots at the same time right at t=0"" that you're still looking at a linear stepping function, its just that we've changed the ordinal on t from 1 to 0. (and so changed all of our ""target dies at"" solutions down by 1)its ironic then, because the fact that it takes people time to get their shots off actually makes the function more linear than a flat stepping function.to do that i would suggest checking the change in the slope of the line generated by the function with the delayed implementation rather than instantaneous.you should notice that that change is actually smaller than the change in the slope of the line when there is no delayed implementation. all you have done is created some noise around the points where your fleet volleys.edit: never thought i would have to explain why damage per second, a constant value based on the ship was linear with respect to time."
4/16/2010,"yeah ehp only gives you some more reaction time to warp off. if you double ehp you wont double your time before killed due to those bell curves. oh and if you add that due to rokhs huge signature they will target you much faster+ bell curve's will be smaller you will get even less time to react,maybe the bigger signature will completly eliminate the bonus the better ehp gives. after all dps matters always ehp only if they shoot at you.but still guomis test enviroment isnt realistic at all,it is too defined and limited ,therefor every conclusion come from it are false.to rokh fanboysbtw do you realy think rokh is wanted to be a niche? and even if it is then it should be significantly better in its niche vs the ""multipurpose"" battleships to even its dravbacks out. if it is only the ""best?"" at 5% of time and that ""best"" is such small margin as in your example (rokhvsapoc or abbadon)like less than 10%overall,then that ship is a bad desing and should be boosted. as in 95% time it just much worse than an apoc by at least 20%.would you realy use a ship which is only worth to be used 5% of time and even there it is nothing special? i know the answer thats why you use apoc and not the rokh.oh and dont forget that beams still dont have to reload ,wont run out at least the t1 crystals,and can change crystals within 1 sec,what is the advantages of rails again? oh they dont have any only disatvantages-->rails sux.oh last question if you think the rokh is the best and told us that ppl should take the time to learn and use it,why the hell dont you use it then?"
4/16/2010,"how long you survive is a function of dps, actually. in the extreme cases, of course you'll be volleyed. in the other extreme, it'll take ages to kill you. by the time that the second situation happens the fight has normally worked its way to conclusion. ehp starts to really shine once the ""everyone gets volleyed"" stage is over (and it does end).face it - goum has shown that by all reasonable interpretations that ehp does in fact matter. your refusal just because it doesn't fit your preconceptions or biases doesn't really say anything except that you're obstinately trying to justify boosting a ship to being outright blatantly overpowered.amusing fact: fights in eve are won and lost by 2% margins. they really really add up. also, goum has unequivocally stated that the rokh is the best in 100% of sniper situations. i'm not sure i buy it as the gangs get smaller and include rr and such, but at the fleet level it seems pretty unambiguous. the funny thing about the rokh is that it requires fewer modules to hit the requisite sniper range - and thus can focus even more on its ehp.and you claim that the rokh has cap problems... this matters in fleet combat why?i don't know if it's as true as you're making out. you can't change until the gun finishes cycling, and you can't even open the drop down to do it until then either. it's about a 9 second advantage - but not as bad as you're making out. also, this matters when everyone's firing aurora/spike/tremor why?-liang"
4/16/2010,"your idea about fleet battles is that both sides just sits there and pound each other until one side completly destroyed? usually one side will give up way before that,so there is nearly no time when ehp start to ""shine"".face what? that made by bad initial presumtions he showed us that rokh is slightly has an advantage using function based on how ai would fight the battle? yeah it totally convinced us. strange my experience doesnt verify this.your amusing facts about 2% is usually between the same type of ships like vaga vs vaga and such. no goumi doesnt prooved that in 100% sniper situations rokh is the best , it was only limited to that very limited enviroment battle between 500vs500 equal homo fleets.how does it help that it requers fever modules? its ehp advantage is only due to this,why do you want to number that advantage twice? it is not even more ehp it is just more.yeah rokh has cap problems what dont you understand? apoc has better cap stability than the rokh everybody knows that.t1 crytals.fleet combat?:o who said it is fleet combat related? it is an advantage the beams have over rails. in longer sieges it realy is a good one to have, just look at fleet chat how many of your rokh fellows will whine to get some ammo after shooting some pos/sov modules and stations.it is 1 sec reload,how that changes if you have to wait for cycle end? it is there for hybrids/projectiles too,but after their guns arent firing they need at least 10 sec to change ammo,while amarr can do it in 1.it matters... oh because enemy will always be at the spot both of you previously agreed to,yes?example some heavy tacklers warps on your fleet , and fc says kill them first , then you would realy like that 1 sec reload to close range ammo.it is still not proven that in actual eve fleet battles ehp matters as much as dps!!!so maxing ehp*dps isnt what makes a good fleet bs."
4/16/2010,"if 2x ehp does not give you 2x more time before you're killed then 2x more incoming dps will also not give you 2x less time.how so?re: sig. only matters for the first ship. doesn't much matter after that.for the fourth time. i trained for lasers to fly pulse geddons. as a side effect, i gained locus rigged apocs during the age of the locus bug. since i do not do as much fleet work and want to do other things i am currently rounding out my small ship skills(bombers/torps atm, recons/probing next)i find that even though the rokh is a better sniper, i can get more return by training for other things than i can training for another battleship since i have one that, while it might not be the best, is still good enough.if there is no point where ehp shines then there can also be no point where dps shines. at which point fittings don't matter"
4/16/2010,yes
4/16/2010,awesome idea
4/16/2010,"yes, but that's partly due to the teir 2 bc's being a tad overpowered. i mean there's virtually no comparison between what the teir 1 bc were and what the teir 2 became. some of the bonuses on the teir 2 bc's don't even make sense. the drake is the primary example. it is the only caldari missile boat that get's a resist bonus instead of a range bonus. it makes the ship a much harder tank than it really should be. the hurricane and the harbinger are incredibly easy to fit too. compare the teir 2 bc's to the teir 4 cruisers and their much more difficult fitting problems and you really see the imbalance.i personally love the teir 2 bc's and wish more t1 ships were that easy to fit and use. honestly, if the teir 1 cruisers were that easy to fit, i'd use them more often. but that said, it makes the tech 2 field ships and a lot of the tier 1 bc's look crappy by comparison. i wish both sets of ships would get a boost, as well as teir 1 cruisers to make the use of tech one gear even more attractive. that might actually bring down tech 2 cost even more."
4/16/2010,"what is this crap, making bc5 worth training (for pvp), blasphemy i say!"
4/16/2010,how about introducing a new line of offensive gang link modules specialized for different weapon types. field command ships could then have a small bonus to these offensive gang link modules just as fleet commands get the bonuses to the other gang link modules.i'd rather field commands get a niche role rather than try and pretend to be a bs.

4/16/2010,"""this thread is older than 90 days and has been locked due to inactivity.""^^don't exaggerate isostoned.anyways, yes, all t2 ammo should have the penalties looked at."
4/16/2010,"psshhh.... hush, you.in short:a - short range t2 charges (hybrid/proj/crystal) should have their tracking increased considerably, not decreased. i'll say nothing about missiles due to the signature & explosion velocity calculations are just wrong on so many ways. needed, but require adjustments.b - detriments that affect a ship as a whole (speed, cap regen, sig radius) should be reduced considerably or made into a flat detriment regardless of the quantity of weapons so loaded.c - currently there is no advantage whatsoever to selecting t2 short range over faction other than the ridiculous cost for faction. this should be changed to put faction in the meta chain just as modules are: t1, base faction, t2 short range, higher meta faction.d - long range t2 charges far surpass t1 and faction equivalents and could use a balancing modification to bring them in line with short range variants. hopefully not in such a manner as to make them as worthless as short range are currently.e - pos weapons should be able to use t2 ammo types."
4/16/2010,perhaps tech 2 needs more specialisation for its usage with a clear application.type 1- higher dps with ship signature and/or tracking penalties for applying more dps to larger and slower targets but as a draw back you are at greater risk of getting hit.type 2- lower dps with reduced ammo signatures and/or tracking bonuses so you can hit smaller and more agile ships more successfully but as a result you take a dps reductionbut keep cap usage and other considerations in line with the parent ammoa more extreme (perhaps less favourable) alteration as mentioned above - for newer players with insufficient skills to be given access to t2 ammo. perhaps rework the skills so the specialisation skills apply to all turret of that size and have tech 2 turrets accessable at lv 5. however as penace for the loss of the specific dps bonus and higher fitting costs for tech 2 turrets give them fixed reduced penalties/increased bonuses for using tech 2 ammo.edit: crap spelling and grammer but there is most likely more
4/16/2010,"as a pilot who happens to be a member of the gallente militia, a roleplayer, and also someone running a specific group of level 1 agents to trigger a storyline mission once in a while i can speak for experience on the following point.1) mission text and background: mission text for those of use who like roleplaying is fine. it depicts what's happening in the conquered systems.2) locations are fixed: not good, in regular conditions the same missions are spawned randomly in different deadspaces and systems. in my case i ran 3 times the same mission to iges system.3) no entry gate: nugoeihuvi mission has no entry gate, since the mission happens in low-sec, a probed pilot can be ganked with any kind of ship. if ccp is going to puruse these kind missions, use acceleration gates with restrictions for all of them.4) rewards: the hardwirings given are the 3% type, which are valuable, but since it's randomly chosen, sometimes you are given a laser hardwiring, which for most pure-gallente pilots makes no sense. i personally would like the reward to be either a huge lp ammount to the specific npc corp who issued the mission, or the new gallente-set implants (the spur), making these ""dangerous"" missions worthy enough.my personal opinion is that no mission should be based on player-controlled situation. the capture and re-capture of faction war systems reside entirely on the control of players, placing static content such as missions out of this dynamic situation can lead to odd scenarios, such as the one happening right now (iges is under the control of the federation again).i would love to see specific storyline missions regarding the current fw, but that happen in high-sec and have more relation to how the federation npc corps are reacting to this proxy-war or how the government is playing their secret cards, all done with the help of capsuleers of course.i vote for these missions to be removed in their current design, and be re-invented into something more fitting."

4/16/2010,i think you're confusing input macros (which still require a human to initiate an input sequence) for software designed specifically to automatically run an eve online client - which is what the term 'macro' is refering to in this context.
4/16/2010,"not even remotely close to being a true statement. if you are playing the game and docking your ship yourself, you are free to play the game and pay for 1 or a hundred accounts it doesn't matter. if you are using a 3rd party application to perform any task in game you are a macro. that is a violation of the eula.an application to detect a macro is not going to watch what you are specifically doing in the game per-se, it's going to look for the applications or processes that are commonly available in the market that may be installed on your machine and trigger a flag to your account or maybe that ip address. im certain ccp / csm community could do a cost analysis or table a cost analysis on the feasibility in resource allocation, upfront and ongoing costs. remember, throwing resources at this problem really means taking resources that could be allocated to other parts of the game or going out of pocket and bringing 3rd party resources to solve the problem. its a cost issue as much as a gaming issue in the view of business managers.honestly i dont know how bad the problem is, im a relatively new player, i really enjoy the game and im happy two offer my 0.02 isk on the subject. but realistically speaking, you will be hard pressed to find a work-able solution that involves ccp in game babysitters, concord, captchas or any other means. you may get some macros by say monitoring play time, flag accounts for specific habits but the macro writers will just change the habits (random number generators are probably a counter tactic). search for macro programs or components of macro programs to flag the code, macro writers are going to turn their attention to other mmos that require less resources to make profits on.in terms of warcraft, when bots / macros started disappearing from the game, they turned their focus onto key loggers to hack and ransack accounts. logging in to see all your items sold, characters naked and your isk gone is a very traumatic experience. if ccp does look at this avenue i would also suggest looking at implementing authenticators as well since key logger ransacks are probably the next best easy source of money, feel free to reference these authenticators on blizzards site, just dont buy there game (ha ha). it was the best $6.50 i ever spent, i very much recommend this option, they now make the software free to install on several phone applications like the iphone but thats a post for another day.there is no such thing as a perfect solution, there is always going to be someone out there figuring out the next best way to game the system and yes they make figure out a work around. i personally know a developer that plays wow and writes personal bots, gets caught and makes a hobby out of trying to beat the blizzard. hes probably a little more successful because he doesnt market or sell what he makes but there are people out there that will try just for the challenge. its certain that security is a budget item in gaming development but id be very curious to know how much of a budget it continues to get after a launch.java"
4/16/2010,"you didnt get the point.i first want numbers that macro mining really has such a big impact as you claim, maybe you get out the sledge hammer to hit a small bug. i saw people claiming that our solo mining behavior is an indication for macro miner. and then i can just laugh. if your assumption of ""too many macro miners"" is based on similar faulty perceptions, then i would really object it.that said ... ask ccp for numbers. before bringing forward such a big change."
4/16/2010,"wait, mining for 23 hours straight means you are running a macro? what about watching a ship for 23 hours straight so you know they are mining for 23 hours straight? does that require a macro?"
4/16/2010,"a quick note to the op (and anybody else who feels griefed by a wardec) - some corps enjoy picking fights with pansy bullies and will wardec them for the small fee of simply asking (ie, just ask and i'll see what the others in my corp think). short of that, many will do it if you simply pay the wardec fee (can be as little as 6m per week).(further discussion beyond the ""quick note"" follows)all game mechanics in eve have one thing in common, no matter how unfair they may seem, and that is to encourage player interaction and cooperation.i was wondering why the rules about stealing from a container were so unfair in that it allows a miner (in a mining barge/cruiser) to attack the combat pilot (in a combat ship) who is stealing from them (yeah, like that's an option). what i realised was that if you mine in a group with haulers, not only is it more efficient (more iskies), it makes it very difficult for anybody to can-flip you - the mechanic encourages players to work together.the same goes for wardecs. form a relationship with a combat corp which is mutually beneficial - perhaps you supply them with a regular amount of t1 frigs/cruisers/bcs in return for them wardeccing anybody who wardecs you (they may or may not drop the wardec when the griefers back down). you may not be able to mine during wardecs, and therefore won't be supplying ships, but most combat oriented corps will understand this.this is a social mmo. many mmos are criticised for being massively single player - in eve you can always come to an arrangement with players outside any implemented game mechanic."

4/16/2010,ccp has already made their stance on this issue abundantly clear: t2 bpos are here to stay. they'll eventually be culled due to attrition.mods should automatically lock/delete threads like this.
4/16/2010,supported for balance on the same arguments used by ccp for the removal of deep safes.
4/16/2010,"lol i just started inventing last night and have already made alot more than i started with. keep the bpos, they arn't harming me. i can also outproduce a bpo owner as well, even with a -pl."
4/16/2010,no.
4/16/2010,"lets say they were replaced with 2-3 years worth of bpcs; the previous bpo holders will now have the ability to build using all their production slots instead of just one per print.- prices in the short term will crash and inventors are effectively out of business for a year or more until bpcs are depleted.- all that extra isk earned by the flood can be invested in traditional market whoring and make even more isk immediately since inventors are unable to compete due to their isk-flow being crippled, tied up in now worthless invention chains.- with next to no invention going on the datacores and other invention materials will plummet as suplly vastly outstrips demand and it is stockpiled by the previous bpo holder wallets, guaranteeing them staggering profits upon bpc depletion. end result: you have just managed to give bpo holders such an insane amount isk for their bpos that the gap can never, ever be closed and they will increase their domination of the markets, now just through buy/sell mechanics instead of production making t2 prices sky-rocket.do you really want to be forced to grind missions or rat just to make a living for a year or more?i sure as hell don't. my invention, even after i turned it down to a simmer, is pulling in a billion plus per month with hardly any work done."
4/16/2010,"at last a decent idea for station games, the warp scram stopping you from docking was ridiculous and to think the csm suggested it.+1 from me"
4/16/2010,put windows on the station so people can see if the undock is clear and i could care less whether or not scrams would prevent docking.
4/16/2010,"why are you guys making this so complicated. where do station/docking games happen?at stations with 50km docking range. fix - just change the station docking ranges. its not hard for a 3d modeler to change this invisible mesh. base the distance on bs subwarp speeds and the 15 second timer. 15 seconds at 90m/s. so docking point will be 1.5km away from where the ship undocks. hence a plated bs will be on the 0 docking point, making it a rush for seconds for a ship to bump the ship off docking point. cruisers and frigates which are more agile. will travel further out from docking point(as they are faster) and will have to try to burn back to docking range. put due to their agility might be able to warp.that way it all comes down to player skill. for attacters and for defenders.my 2 cents. i've been a merc for a long while in high sec and these docking ranges drove me out of high sec to 0.0"
4/16/2010,bump

4/16/2010,currently the drake is hands down the best battlecruiser in the game. i propose replacing the shield resist bonus to assault missile and rocket rate of fire.this will bring the drake down from being over powered to be in line with other battlecruisers of its tier and keep it in line with the race background.
4/16/2010,is this some lolpost in relation to the rocket drake joke in ships&modules or?
4/16/2010,an implanted ham drake with 950 dps? heh.
4/16/2010,"sc mostlikely ****d nc with a drake heavy gang. ""to the forums, lets nerf drakes!""first it was bombers,then buffing fighters after sc nuked their shiny fighter bombers.and now drakes.anyway ... he always was a troll and mostlikely this is troll aswell. so -1/10(edit: typo)"
4/16/2010,"mmm, not to agree with the op, but the second tier bc's are a bit out of line, a full nerf of them would be better then a targeted drake nerf, this would be balancing to not only the first tier bc's, but also cruisers in general.this is just a vague feeling, i reserve the right to change my wishes at whim and have no clear proposal how to do it."
4/16/2010,never stop posting.
4/16/2010,fyp.op has indicated that he was involved in development for the sega saturn and we all know how that turned out.
4/16/2010,"i never did find out where people get those magic >500dps numbers on the drake. triple bcu, hamii, navy kin ammo .. no where near the god numbers quoted in most cases.even if people implant, rig and what not it still won't surpass the heavy hitting shield harbinger or hurricane, especially not when speed/signature takes its pound of flesh .. not to mention the less than stellar output when using anything other than kin.it is a scary ship but hardly unbalanced, at least not more than any other capless weapon buffer tanking foty fitted ship (i am looking at you nano-cane! ).the pyromancer suggestion:make even capless weapons cease working if less than 5 cap are available (or similar near 0 number) and everything is dandy on almost all ships using capless."
4/16/2010,"dude, enough. yes the sc is at war with the nc. everyone knows. everyone also knows you're in the sc or an alt of the nc. nobody cares. stop bringing caod crap into other forums. i've seen this all over here and even in the test forum...just stop.. keep it in caod."

4/16/2010,"so you finally got the chance to require proper team work for pve (logistic ships, bs for dps, or just rr bs fits)and you ship up to dreads and carriers for getting your easy mode back?all pos modules and cap ships got their sigradius fixed, so that capital torps hit full damage. no further changes needed."
4/16/2010,"yes, exactly, at last pve is not that boring as missions. and i have it, fleet with sc,recons(yea, one of most useful ship class in pve, no joke),logistics,caps...so it's will be ""easy"" anyway, i was just hoping that there is some people who sees a whole picture too, all possible uses of ships. well, fail, yes"

4/16/2010,"how exactly are these ""criminals"" getting inside the pos shield? and if it's one of your own corpmates perpetuating the ship theft, then you've got bigger problems on your plate then simple ship lock passwords."
4/16/2010,lots of corps are infiltrated. the person would work you untill you trust them and then empty your pos. but if you could just lock your ship that would not happen even if they are in a sma. i trust my brother too but i still keep the car keys to myself.in that way you can just choos to lock or unlock your ship to corpmates as you please because you bought it and you are the owner.locking your ship is just the same as locking your car or house. sometimes you dont want your best friend to pop in.and this way you save a lot of missery from people you thought where your friend.why is there apassword on a 275.000 isk container and not on your zealot ????

4/16/2010,"currently the chances of higher success rates with meta items is solidly broken. as a dedicated inventor i have simply stopped using them as my rates have barely moved (with tens of thousands of jobs to use as a base line).where an invention fails there should be a chance toa - recover the meta item (equal to chance of success).b - create a bpc of the meta item used.c - rare named t2 bpc at 1/2 the number of runs of a standard t2 bpc. give inventors an opportunity to reap benefits unavailable to those bpo holders who don't also invent. or higher meta level t1 bpcs (such as faction/deadspace/officer) at commensurately lower success rates. (as an example: -15% for meta 7-9, -30% 10-12, -40% 13 & 14 for an item with 40% standard rates), but not selectable as an invention goal; it merely occurs where the invention fails.using a ship in the invention process should be identical to using a meta 3 or 4 item. this merely to increase the consumption of t1 ships and improve the lot of t1 builders & miners."

4/16/2010,"what do you consider the three most pressing issues for the next csm to address, and your proposed solutions?"
4/16/2010,"i'd say that big fleet lag is the biggest issue at the moment (although i don't myself 'blob'). ccp do seem to be treating this as a priority, so i think the csm can best help by focussing on peripheral improvements to complement ccp's work behind the scenes, such as finding ways to ensure that people who haven't yet loaded the grid can't be killed before it does (in non-exploitable ways), for example. there is of course a broader question of whether big fleet battles are to be encouraged or discouraged, but ccp have invested a lot of development and marketing effort to achieve a more epic scale in the endgame so we have to be realistic about the chances of changing their approach in the medium term at least.a second big issue i think is accessibility of solo and small gang pvp (which i think is an important part of the eve experience) at all levels of the game. instanced pvp is a dirty word (or rather two) in the eve universe, but - as an example plucked from the air - would newbies or experienced 0.0 blobbers do more small scale pvp if they could jump fairly instantly into some kind of 'combat wormhole' with mass limits on the gates so both sides were reasonably matched (avoiding blatantly artificial limitations)? that's just an example - i'm not saying instanced pvp is the solution, and in fact there are lots of other ideas (many good) knocking around here and i think it would be my role to help select the best ideas from other people for consideration by ccp.a third issue i would consider as one of the most important is the need to keep refreshing and adding content to eve for all levels from newbie to old pro. again ccp are pretty well on top of this with the regular updates but i think the csm can really add value by selecting the most credible and popular suggestions from these forums (fora?) and presenting them coherently to ccp. i think the csm also needs to communicate quite clearly to ccp the issues which a majority of players dislike (not least because it is in ccp's interests to take the criticisms into account).otherwise, i would like to be able to propose some grand and exciting ideas to radically improve everyone's eve experience, but the reality is that big changes to eve mechanics can have unpleasant unintended consequences and are, frankly, unlikely to be adopted by ccp and may therefore be a waste of time and effort to pursue during a csm term, so i would prefer to be pragmatic and present a strong case to ccp for implementing a number of smaller changes that gradually tweak gameplay in a favourable direction. as mentioned above, i see a lot of good ideas like these in the assembly hall and jita park channels and i would happily champion them before ccp.of course what is a 'favourable direction' is a matter of opinion, but i hope those issues i picked give a flavour of what my opinion is..."
4/16/2010,"people group together by nature, and it's extremely difficult to drive them apart with game mechanics without changing the very unsharded nature of eve. this was discussed at length in iceland and fact of the matter seems to be that there is no clear solution."
4/16/2010,"its an interesting idea but it wouldn't work or be a good idea with any of the current ships in eve at the moment. first off drone bays on existing ships cant accommodate a frigate sized drone leaving only carriers and mother ships with the right size drone bay. secondly that carrier would only be able to hold one or two of these making them pointless and would make using regular drones the better way to go. so the only way for this to work is if a ship was released made specifically for the task of controlling frigates as drones, t2 frigates excluded of course. this ship would also have to lack the capability of fielding regular drones. this would also mean that the frigs your controlling that can use drones cant use them either.in all this is a interesting idea but too much work would need to be done to implement it.-1 for practicality+1 for an interesting idea"

4/17/2010,"well if your argument is correct, the rokh is already the best in terms of dps*ehp calcs. so 5% increase in ammo dmg + 10% increase in range shouldnt be a problem if you changed its fittings so that it's dps*ehp is smaller.so removing 1 low, 1 mid, + grid or cpu.... or removing several mids and making it armor tank (change bonus to armor) should work right? (i dont have eft available atm so cant check specifics)edit- spelling/grammeredit2- removed unnecessary sentences."
4/17/2010,"only if you believe that the rokh should not be the best fleet sniper. (yes, there is a difference between ""the best"" and ""overpowered"")your proposed changes may make an ok ship, but it also goes against the caldari racial paradigms. what you're doing is complaining that the ship does not do what you want it to, rather than seeing what it does well and exploiting it."
4/17/2010,"first perhaps i should say that i have logged no complaint regarding the rokh. personally, if your going to train guns it makes sense to train other races for the sheer lack of the % of caldari boats that get gunnery bonus's. what i was trying to work around was your comment re: my 5% dmg increase (via ammo) putting the rokh too far ahead of everything else. my comment about the rokh needing a nerf was really uneeded for that purpose and i have taken it out. to keep it ""as-is"" any increase in dps must be compensated for by decrease in ehp...if it is done by removing mids (for tank)it doesnt compromise the ""paradigm"" for caldari (even though the argument can be made that guns on caldari boats already do this..). making it an armor tanker just might allow for the ""incentive"" that other people seem to want."
4/17/2010,"you should not balance ships around what people ""want"", but rather what fits."
4/17/2010,"it appears you are obsessed with the armor tank idea... which i have stated was purely a compromise and not necessary. given that the rokh/moa (hull) are ""odd balls"" already, i dont think its rp breaking to fudge things towards armor at the expense of shields.... but then i am not an rp fanboi so maybe i just dont ""get it""."

4/17/2010,"i read that new blog and it looks better, a compromise. but it is still a bad and more importantly - needless nerf.but it doesn't answer why they are doing this whole thing in the first place.is it really about the scanning issue? if it is, why go with a negative solution of reducing game features and ****ing people off instead of a positive solution to make the scanner better?and why is this kind of ""crap"" is actually being worked on before many other things, things players actually wait 6+ months for.on whose initiative has this whole bookmark process been started? who is responsible?"
4/17/2010,it's not a nerf at all. it's a rebalance.the warp logoff bug (poseidon) will be removed. and all the stuff will be moved not destroyed. and in fact you can now (after tyrannis launches) make bookmarks beyond 20au and warp to them.however you will have to do it with the legitimate game mechanics placed now. this is taking an unfair advantage older players had and bringing them down to newer player's level.this is a good compromise.
4/17/2010,"if that is true then the negative impact of this whole affair will be very small. my primary concern was pvp situations where i warp in large systems and sometimes need to make bms in the middle of warp, which can be 10+ or even 20+ au from nearest object. there are some systems with 280 au warps, maybe with 80 au warps.even so, i still think this whole bookmark business points out to a flaw in ccp's priority list. there's something not right about this whole thing. i don't remember any major threads from the community calling for action on this issue."

4/17/2010,you - and others as well - seem to forget that a t2 bpo owner can do invention as well.it's not like you have to choose between one or the other.just look at it that way:one of your production lines is producing at below 1% waste instead of 20% - 70% waste like the other lines.and not only that you also save the invention costs for that 1 line.still think you're better off without a t2 bpo?

4/17/2010,"it doesn't really matter, what is the average amount of players per system, what does matter is what is the maximum number of players the single system can handle. let me explain this. 1. we have the ordinary system, one of the 6k systems, and 2 pilots inside.2. they found something, lets say the sweet dedspace, and cant share it peacefully. 3. they start to fight, but they are allmost even. 4. they call their friends to help. 5. their friends called their corps to help. 6. each party form somekind of powerblock in that area. 7. all other players in eve hear about this war, and gather to look at it, loot, gank haulers around ets. (to be the part of history)8. the battle begins, and we have 2k ppl trying to jump in system for the reasons above, and we have lag. this process is endless, even if ccp can make like 700k systems, the action will make pilots to gather in one. and the only reason they cant gather in 1 system is the lag issue due to the technical restrictions. judge by yourself, you will never miss the interesting action, if you have the time and there is no lag."

4/18/2010,"this thread seems to have been sidetracked away from balancing rails into a rant about a ship thats only effective in a limiting case, rather then the the majority of gal / caldari ships which are sub par because of them.caldari rail ships basically suck - rails should be balanced around gal and caldari seperatly sorted.i agree that the rohk on eft isn't terrible but given that its never going to be called primary ehp <<< volley / dps. yes if you have a fleet entirely consisting of rohks things change but thats not going to happen - its a hugh amount of effort for something that can easily be countered through the other fleet carrying the correct hardeners for refit and drops effectiveness vs other targets.at the end of the day the rohk is a very poorly designed ship, either it dosen't do enought dps for its great tank to matter - as now useless or it does enough - op. 15% isn't going to put it anywhere near the volley / dps of the other t3's so whatever.without factors such as stealth bombers i've no doubt the glass cannon apoc would be fotm.alot of ""real game"" factors seem to have been ignored;low volley = alot more ships required to alpha any target of a given ehp, seriously volley has a far greater impact on fleet situations then dps alone.low rof = far lower effective dps - assuming targets are popping within 1 cycle 2-3xs reaction time on hybrids gives far lower dps then lasers / projectiles"
4/18/2010,"one question: should gallente boats be *good* with railguns though? for caldari ships obviously it is their bread and butter, but i'm not sure if it's such a bad thing if gallente ships are mediocre using railguns, assuming their blaster role was enhanced. afterall, can't be good at everything and racial choice should matter.just a thought."
4/18/2010,"its an important question, and one i will not claim to know the answer too.however, lets look at the gallente ship line independently of caldari and then find an answer.lets also assume that ""all ships should have a niche""at the frigate level, its ok to not have a gallente rail boat since all ships have an niche and nothing is lacking a role. this is the same at the cruiser and hac and bc level (so long as the deimos is given a clear blaster role)but its not so at the battleship level. either the hyperion becomes the blaster ship, and the mega doesn't have as much of a niche*, or the other way around with the dominix being drones. at this point it seems pretty clear to me that at least one of these two ships ought to be at least competent with rails even if its still ""the worst long range sniper""*or, is ""rr ship"" a good enough niche just like the geddon has the rr niche over the abaddon? i typically side against this since the dominix is so good as an rr ship.this has actually already been dealt with on the last page. you do not need to be called primary first to have ehp make a difference. it doesn't matter how many ""<""s you put in front of it its still wrong.and even if it wasn't true that you are wrong regarding maximizing dps/ehp in these situations. we have shown that maximizing dps x ehp is the best thing to do when you are shot first(technically ehp is better than dps when you're shot at first, but if you have enough ships of that type you're still going to be in the range where its better to maximize the two of them due to the chances you're going to get called first) and apocs will be shot first and when you maximize dps and ehp on an apoc you get a tachypoc w/98k ehp and 312 dps which is actually less dps and ehp than the rokh.the apoc will still be called primary ironically, but not because its better than the rokh.to get a hint of that i would like to take a trip back to when tempests were easily the worst fleet battleship in the game, you could not get much ehp and they had low volley damage, tracking, and range. they were still called primary at the start of the fight. why would this happen if they were so bad? a: because they were so bad and because they were fit in ways that gave them a high dps relative to how easy they were to kill you could take more dps out of the fight faster by killing tempests than you could by killing better ships.in terms of volley efficiency the rokh is actually pretty high.you cannot have 321 dps and low volley damage and low rof if your ""comparison"" has ""much higher volley damage"" and only 10% more dps. you are claiming impossibilities."
4/18/2010,"you've ignored volley again in favor of dps again and gone off on a tangent about dps * ehp thats not really relevant or an accurate analysis.again volley is important.going by the base eft mim are still worse then amarr after the buffs, why are they getting more popular? volley.incidentally it back up a couple of your points as the maels proving to be the main sniper platform vindicating t3 hulls & shield tanking.anway in your example the apoc (failfit though it is) would be targeted before the rokh and taken above the rohk due to its larger volley.low rof as in low duration probably the wrong way of wording it. a mael has what? 6.5k / 17 secs an rohk 1.7k/5 secs. so for a given target ehp you will need nearly 4 rohks for every mael to alpha it. ontop of that the maels have to volley onces every 17 secs to maintain peek dps, a couple of second delay for reaction time knocks the dps down by 12%. the rohk on the other hand has to find targets every 5.2 secs, so given the same reaction time your looking at a ~ 40% dps reduction - yes it sounds like fouey but given lag it'll be better / worse. lasers sit in the middle but have abit more dps to soak up the losses.i could go on about the oversimplification of using ehp * dps in a limiting case environment like a fleet but tbh if your maths that bad & your probably trolling anyway."
4/18/2010,"i never said it wasn't. what i said was that ehp is just as. a volley efficient apoc still has 312 dps and 98k ehp.not sure why you're saying this since that is what was claimed. and since its going to be shot first then having more ehp is a better fit for it...if the mael is becoming the main sniping platform (it is?) then certainly the 126k ehp shield tank has an advantage compared to a glass cannon apoc?why is it so hard to find a target every 5 seconds compared to the maels 17? if your ships are doing the same dps then to be efficient you need to find 4 times as many targets for the maelstroms to shoot at each time they do in order to be efficient. then you need to get your maelstroms to split their volleys in such a way as to kill all the targets such that they can volley the next one.any way you slice that the maels have to find targets faster. if you're shooting one then you've not fired 3/4 of your volleys compared to the rokhs and you need to get a target instantly. if you're shooting 4 then you need to find 4 targets at a time and separate out your damage properly. neither of these things are any easier or harder compared to what the rokh is doing.but ships do not have ""a given ehp"". they have ehp depending on how they fit and what ship they are. such the ehp of the ship that you bring also matters since when its shot by the other side, if its higher then your ship goes down faster.in the end, even if you ignore volley speed entirely as a factor you are looking at relative volley * ehp values in order to maximize the effectiveness of your gang and the rokh is still exceptional at that.really, what attributes of ships then have the largest effect on a sniper engagement? ships mind you not fc's, not player skill. but ships and ships alone.i am pretty sure you're going to wind up with dps/volley, ehp, and range. in these instances we are holding range constant(190km or so) as an ""ideal engagement range for snipers"". ships that do not meet this lose dps/volley at that distance and so lose in final effectiveness. the ship that combines those three the best is unsurprisingly the one with the tank bonus and range bonus."
4/18/2010,"this is the basic problem with your maths, you've missunderstood limiting the case.take one ship with 100 dps shooting at a ship with 1 mil ehp. ((1x10^6)/100)+r = t where t is time till it pops and r is the reaction time for the dps to be brought on target. now r is small compared to t so i can just ignore it and you get ehp/dps=t nice and simple.now swap the values to something resembling a fleet fight, say 40k dps @ 1 sec rof and 40k ehp all of a sudden r is of the same order of magnitude as t, if i ignore it my equation is bs. say the reaction time is 3 secs. my imaginary shippy lasts 4 secs, another shippy with double the ehp will last 5 secs. if both shippies have x dps there efficiency is not dps x ehp its dps x time to die so the one with double the ehp is 25% more efficient.to expand out efficiency you can't write off reaction time / lag as player skill its a significant contribution, and its common to all fleet fights you just end up making up some numbers with some comforting maths behind them. a fleet fight is a laggy cluster**** with 500 guys trying to splat one guy at time you've got to account for that.thats not to say ehp isn't important  it will extend your time to die, but doubling your ehp willnot double the effectiveness of your shippy.if you expand on dps, from the point the fc calls a primary you'll have a few seconds of nothing followed by probably a normalish distribution of players volleying. when the of average volley * number of players f(t) hits the ehp of the target it'll pop. clearly high volley is important for popping a target as quickly as possible both to stop it warping out and well pop it. rails fail hard at this.number of volleys / sec is obviously important, but if targets die before you've got off a second volley for any given dps high volley, high duration is improtant. as i mentioned above you will spend a second or 2 retargeting you guns, more in a lag fest, and with 5 secs rof that hurts hybrid dps far more then arties.in short yes lots of ehp on a rohk is good, but no it doesn't make it twice as good as something with the same damage profile and <U+FFFD> the ehp, also the method by which rails especially on a rohk deliver damage with low volley is craptastic for fleet. ontop of that the fc has the choice of shooting at ships with more dps:ehp .... it makes for a useless shippy."
4/18/2010,"and in that case if you swap the damage, damage increases don't change r and so your effectiveness is still not changed in relation by modifications in dps and ehpbut by the same token if damage has a delay to being applied they are just as inefficient applying their dps(since efficiency of damage is essentially ""how fast you kill the other ship if your enemies have that reaction time adding to your time to kill your effectiveness falls by precisely that percentage that is added onto their ehp due to reaction time and vise versa). this has the same effect on their final efficiency the 5 seconds it takes you to apply dps directly offsetting the 5 seconds you extend your life due to reaction time in terms of ship strength.and if the target dies before you've got the second volley off you just shoot the next target you have locked.read the damned thread, it does not matter that the fc has a choice to shoot ships with higher dps and less ehp they will eventually be shooting high ehp ships and it does make a difference. furthermore, if you bother to follow this to its conclusion you should find that ships that are likely to be targeted first ought to increase their ehp more than their dps precisely for that reasons and when that happens the rokhs final values do not look so badedit:by that same token, something with the same ehp profile as the rokh and 2x the damage is not twice as good as the rokh. but at the end of the day, we don't really care about cardinal classification unless its very very problematic, we care about ordinal classification"

4/18/2010,i agree that t2 ammo should be better than faction but there should be also changes in production requirementsso that at best the prices between faction and t2 ammo switch so faction ammo gets a cheap alternative to t2 and faction doesn't get useless and i think for that to happen there has to be a increase in drop amount of npc's and maybe less lp isk cost in lp stores
4/18/2010,"edit: tl;dr - make 0.5 systems less secure (in conjunction with tyrannis).please bear with me, this is a huge wall of text, but i wanted to put all my thoughts and ideas on the subject out clearly.summary: the crux of the proposal is to increase the physical and mental barriers between empire space of opposing factions. 0.5 system security would be altered to increase the risk involved in travelling through 0.5 systems whereby concord only has a minimal presence in 0.5 space. the only way concord can get into the systems is through adjacent systems which are fully protected by concord. due to this concord would only be able to maintain security of the gates and stations (read: concord gate camps and sentry guns [much more powerful than low-sec]). the ease of travel and resulting trade activities would be heavily affected resulting in a more decentralized universe (less people in jita, more in amarr, rens and dodixie/oursulaert). 0.5 systems would become the new pvp hotspots due to a number of factors such as; more gankers, more pirates, more anti-pirates, lower risk 'pvp training' area for people to practise pvp and no capitals.proposal:we all know that each of the empires is divided by a well worn path between the respective trade hubs, jita, amarr, dixie, and rens with a nice little 0.5 system in the middle. my solution to the problem is to alter the security of 0.5 systems. i believe they would operate very similarly to the way they currently work. but instead of the usual concord response, concord only has jurisdiction of the stargates and the stations, any location outside of the grid of stargates and stations would be free-game (sec hit is extraordinary). the concord that mans the gates should be destroyable and the spawn times are reasonable. the concord response would exponentially increase if sustained fighting is experienced (read: player gate camps). one way to manage this aspect of players vs. concord is for every person that engages in pirate activities, concord would deploy 1 vessel for every pirate (even make a gate activation for such concord jumping in for it to seem logical) to ensure blobs of pirates cant outgun concord, i believe concord should have interceptors in case pirates use kiting tacts and also long range warp disruptors to ensure that the majority of pirates get caught if they engage in pirate acts. i think this would boost pirate activities because it would give a greater involvement on the pirates aspect because they will have to deal with concord and getting away from concord is achievable but would require skill not just hitting f1-8 and waiting for the explosion.this would provide a much more risky situation than it currently is, providing a barrier to entry for the empires and still satisfies most of the player base that pass through the system (if they need to) without being harassed, although 0.5 travel would be considered very dangerous if travelling in anything but a combat ship, because you will be effectively able to fight alongside concord if you are engaged.-to be continued-"
4/18/2010,"reason: the main reason i see this proposal enhancing the eve universe is that it will partition the world of eve more, putting more emphasize back on the eve world and how to get around said world in the most effective way. you would get a far greater achievement / nuisance to travel across and visit each of the four empires. i think this would create a more multi-layered and more immersive game that it is now, albeit a harsher one.quite a few reaons why this change could/should be made:- at this present moment, pvp in highsec is a do or die thing. obviously you can whack an indy no problem or even the odd freighter in 0.5, concord being a 'do or die' approach, if you engage in pvp in high-sec you get roasted. the 4 empires being little islands would be imo the best thing for the game and the sandbox nature creating yet more challenges for eve's capsuleers to smash their head against and eventually conquer.- the difference (as it is now) between a 0.4 and 0.5 is comparing chocalate and baby crap. the difference is extraordinary and as a result, your either are a carebear or you aren't.- with tyrannis and the nerf to t1 insurance, suicide ganking will not be eliminated but it will definitely be reduced as the cost of losing an insured t1 bs will be greatly increased. i think the effects of suicide ganking are necessary and a great addition to the game to enforce the idea of being aware of your surroundings and your actions even in high-sec. with a debuff to suicide ganking, high-sec will become more safer, the introduction of these 0.5 systems will give a more pronounced piracy zone, so for all intents and purposes if you go in there, you know this is a known pirate zone and you only go into this dmz (dead man zone) willingly. - safe high-sec have a green icon, low-sec has red icons, why cant 0.5 systems reflect that yellow icon and have a turbulent war zone in which concord provides some degree of security. (yes concord has spawn times, but if you shoot someone, you die.)- from a rp pov, why do each of the 2 respective factions maintain a war with each other and why do they have bordering gates but no conflict arises.- although there is nothing constraining everyone to go to jita and trade there, people naturally tend to congregate in the one place to maximise their trading efforts, one mega market is easier to manipulate than 4 large markets. jita is the place to be if you want to do any semi-professional trading, creating more significant market hubs i think would be beneficial to the eve universe with more options for the budding trader to make an entrance into the trading world.counter proposal:the counter proposal of this idea is to not implement it in fear of increased pirate activity on people who do not wish to participate in pvp activities, my proposal will make a much more designated zone of pvp (and suicide ganking) but still in highsec such that any people entering 0.5 space will have to be on their toes.another important fact is that eve will be decentralised and many people have assets scattered across the eve universe, the fact that your freighter is on the other side of a 0.5 system could pose problems.other such splitting of the empires ideas generally include putting 0.4 systems in between the empires but i think this would lead to a lot more piracy as people will have to go through such 0.4 systems to get anywhere where in my proposal it should still be possible to do but with much less risk than trying to pass through a rancer style 0.4 system, my proposal is a compromise between this and the system as it stands today, a little harder to implement but will not be as harsh as the other calls for split empires.-to be continued-"
4/18/2010,"desired outcomes:-the change would lend itself favourable to a lot of hit and run tactis being employed, and the very real option of escaping concord in said 0.5 systems if you wait out the gcc.- 0.5 system travel would still be considered compulsory (even if just in shuttles and frigates) this would increase the large population of eve experiencing pvp and also just forcing them to travel through these dmz's would allow them to view/experience some of the pvp in the game that they wouldnt otherwise experience, apart from a discosmartbombing and cracking typhoon landing on the poor badger 15kms away. this would expose many of the carebear types to pvp, and i think exposing them to pvp may be all that is needed in order for them to gain an interest in pvp and the rest is history, they will be hooked on the adrenaline and excitement of pvp like all the rest of us did and go pew pew more often. (the more ships going boom in eve, the better it is!) even passing through a 0.5 will be considered great excitement.- 0.5 systems would become the new training ground for entry level pvp'ers and obviously the gankers would have a field day. this i think would entice a lot of anti-pirate types who hang out for people to engage other people and assist concord in the dispatching of the pirates and getting on the km (yaye for km rowers.) this would essentially create a 'lower' risk area for people to practise pvp and get their training wheels on.- also why 0.5 would be the new haven for the budding and entry level pvp'ers. no capitals!! no cyno butt socks for you. this might lead to more gf's being experienced in the 0.5 systems but obviously will still be at the mercy of blobbing- 0.5 systems wont be gridlocked, some indy's would still be able to get through but you would actually have to have a scout, and some actual support would be helpful. you know the times when you have a bs guard with your freighter, but it can't do anything because once it gets engaged, its already dead? this would provide a playground of pvp which would still favour the aggressed.- this extra barrier to entry for budding traders will at the same time discourage and promote inter-regional trade and the expected benefits of inter-regional price differences. freighters will actually be one of the 'more' safer ships because it has a greater buffer, but that does not stop the same mechanic happening to them as it is now. a fleet of 20 raven/armageddons opening up a can of charon flavoured loot in a matter of volleys. but losing 20 bs in tyrannis will really start to hurt a lot more-to be continued-"
4/18/2010,"undesired consequences: - lots of pirates would hang out in 0.5 systems. given that a lot of 0.5 systems are often in a sea of highsec there would be islands of 0.5 with -10 pirates hiding out, obviously they could use shuttles to get around, but i think 0.5 moons will become the base of operations of a lot of squads, this would lead to an increase demand in 0.5 system moons and probably lead them to be fully used up. - the issue with that is that they are harboring pirates and although that is fine, the problem that is then created if pirates are using pos' to base out of, how do we kill said pos. it is after all still 'high-sec' so i think attacking the pos without a wardec would result in concord coming to say hello. you would then have to incite a wardec against said pirate group and take down the pos with bs's only!!! that would obviously cause a lot of problems; anything above a medium pos with any sort of guns would require a huge and organized fleet of bs to effectively take it down. and all the while they are completely vulnerable and undefended while they are taking down the pos because anyone who engages them at the pos can do so without concord interference. then there is the issue of getting ooc alts to shoot the pos so that concord spawns near the pos which would then 'defend' the attacking group of bs against any other 3rd party pirates that might want to have some fun times.- so, essentially med and especially large pos's in 0.5 would be invulnerable due to no cap support.- travelling through 0.5 systems would almost require the use of other characters/corpies to scout industrials through a system, this will undoubtedly increase the popular belief that you need an alt to play eve.implementation:if a revision of the ai in-place of the current concord in 0.5 systems cannot be altered, can you if possible create a new concord entity that combines the ai of sleepers into the models of concord ships and a trigger of (if agrression, attack)?holy wall of text batman.i don't really mind if this isn't implemented despite the time i put into this, but i think it would improve eve as a more complete and immersive game, even for the casual gamer."
4/18/2010,"way too friggin long and i'm not going to read it. 0.5 systems as is are not that secure. suicide gankers can agree on this. we do not need to change 0.5s period. your kidding yourself. also, this proposal is so complicated that you might as well throw out eve and make that a game. no support."
4/18/2010,this change would only be effective with tyrannis and the reduction of suicide ganking due to the proposed insurance changes. otherwise i agree 0.5 is already unsafe.
4/18/2010,"it is interesting, but i am a bit fearful of its results"
4/18/2010,if i understand correctly it would be lowsec with beefier consequences for engaging on stations and gates.the almost complete stop in mining and mission running (effectively lowsec in these areas) in 0.5 space is a good thing in your opinion?the tears would drown us all.
4/18/2010,"when i got ""troop buildup"" while running fours in sinq laison, i thought ""ok, this is a right pain in tha arse, 16 jumps and dodging pies fw nitwits in black rise"" but i ran it anyway. mission itself not so bad. getting to/from a royal pain in the keister.now, i get this same damn mission while running fours in solitude ffs. now it's thirty bloody jumps, through not only pie and fw nitwit infested fw losec, but now throw in the fun of bubble camps in nullsec.what crack pipe smoking imbecile thought this was a good idea?seriously?make everyone have to have this kind of fun, or get the hell rid of it. wtf is it with just harassing the gallente folks anyway?horse****e is what i say."
4/18/2010,"while they are checking (and hopefully deleting) the gallente experimental missions there's also another mission with similar problems: ""the scavengers"" - level 2 fw mission that for some bug sometimes you can receive from regular level 2 caldari agents."
4/18/2010,"i would much prefer they fix the real problems of this game rather than safe spots.like lag, rockets, ridiculous gallente storylines, crap tier 1 bc's. etc.this is space, space has no boundaries, isn't this what eve is all about?infact i think all should be able to use deep space spots, but make deep space probes more powerful."
4/18/2010,"signed.while the methods that have been used to create these spots are questionable, and should perhaps be addressed, removing whatever is there and ""shrinking"" space by making it impossible to go beyond a given distance -- when there is no technical requirement given to do so -- is a bit silly.the epic proportions of this game help make it interesting. a better solution would be to improve deep space scanner probes. would everyone be able to easily scan out those sitting at deep safes? no. should it be possible for a dedicated scanner to do so? absolutely... with some tweaks to the scanning system."

4/18/2010,"no.i'll support it if they remove all capitals, supercapitals (especially!), and wallets over 5b isk, and any sp over 35m too, because i don't have any of those and it's also unfair somehow. what? it creates a division between the haves and the have nots!"
4/18/2010,"let's remove the unique ships too since those are worth too much money and it's unfair to new players since they can't obtain the unique ships.while we're at it let's just remove anything that's really hard to get.an even better idea, how about ccp just give everybody 100 billion isk and all level 5 skills then things are really an even playing field."
4/18/2010,i do agree but keep all the options as there now also
4/18/2010,fix this over powered flavor of the month ship ccp!
4/18/2010,"personally i've seen heaps of dramiels lately, but i wouldn't call them overpowered. there are plenty of counters to them so go figure out what one is and use it.no way i'm supporting any change to the dramiel."
4/18/2010,"put the ships/items that are targeted into a resizable, relocatable window. not only is it irritating when targeted items appear over something else and you have no control over where in the window the targets appear, it's inconsistent human interface design to have (almost) every other human interface element in a window except the target list."
4/18/2010,you do know you can move where the targets appear in the ui since quantum rise came out right?
4/18/2010,"no, honestly i had no idea. how would i? there is not once single user interface element that would scream ""you can relocate me"" (the way there is with every other ui element on the screen), and this absolutely reinforces my point that it is totally inconsistent user interface design. but thanks for the heads up. i'll start looking around for whatever hidden way that exists to move the targets around."
4/18/2010,next to the list of locked items you got a little cross hair. grab the cross hair and start dragging it around.also right click on it is a good idea.hope this helps.

4/18/2010,"i'll support this, but on the condition there is actually something there to see/do, and not just empty space. on a side note, i wonder just how far out from the main eve map this safespot is?"
4/18/2010,"+1 for the lolz (like everyone else so far).i do pity the gm's though, who will have to deal with the droves of dimwits who will try warping to it before having an idea about how long that would take."
4/18/2010,"actually this sounds like a good idea.the players of eve often stretch the limits of the sand box in ways the devs never imagine. a monument of some kind would be a fitting tribute.heck you could have the monument dish out worthless tokens like you get at real tourist sites ""i visited the 95k safe spot"" keyrings."
4/18/2010,"while lurking in the ships and mods forum, the number crunchers there were able to determine how long it would take to get to this safespot.16 - 20 years depending on your ship so ya, maybe saving this safespot isn't such a good idea"
4/18/2010,"supported, but in w-space only. add a minimum of one-month delay after the fuel runs out. perhaps make the would-be finder-of-dead-poses have to run a codebreaker for an hour or so to introduce an element of risk to the operation -- in any event, they should also have to un-anchor the tower as well one they have ""hacked the security code""."
4/18/2010,having to shoot destroy all the mods before being able to take the tower is also a good idea so you have to weight out whats more worth tower or mods and i also think that the anchor timer should be quite long maybe 1 hour or so and the owner/owning cooperation should get notified supported
4/18/2010,1. you cant kill pos mods as long as the tower is there. they just go into incap.2. normally people try to reuse as many modules as possible. so you only shoot the really needed mods and unanchor the rest after the tower is gone.did you ever shoot a tower?
4/18/2010,ccp bombers are completly overpowered and are just ruining conventional fights in eve. seriously 10 ships at 35 million each can insta pop a 200 man bs fleet? what kind of nonsense is that?
4/18/2010,they are something to teach you that you should not hug too close to each other.
4/18/2010,"it means that if you fly your 200-man fleet with bad fittings and poor tactics, then ships that are specifically intended to counter blobs will do a pretty good job of doing just that.why not ask your allies how to deal with bombers? we do rr bs gangs a lot, and we know how to deal with them."
4/18/2010,moving this back to the top for great justice.it is not fair that a 20 man gang can kill at 200 gang.
4/18/2010,"facts and real (ie. virtual) world metrics beg to differ. the number of pilots involved in this new fad of mass-bombers is evidence that it is indeed ""that easy"".if it actually required lots of practise and coordination there would be very few crews able to consistently pull it off properly, not everyone and their alts.it should be a highly specialised enterprise to warrant its immense power, since it apparently isn't then something is broken."

4/18/2010,to make jumping through risk free?
4/18/2010,"it seems people didnt read the op properlywhen you scan a signature, at 25% strength you get a description of what type it is (radar,magent,ladar, unknown-wormhole)when you scan to 75% you gert a better description of a sig (like ""barren deposit"" for ladar) so you know what it is before you get it to 100% and can warp to itbut with wormholes you get no aditional info at 75%, so you have to get it to 100% and then warp to the signature to see more info about the wormholeop is asking to get atleast some info (wh type) at 75% scan strength, and i agree that would be usefull, and consistent with the way other signals are scaned"
4/18/2010,warp to them? wormhole space is supposed to be a challenge. what's wrong with warping to a wh to check its id?
4/18/2010,"the drake can hit 700 dps easily at nearly 20km. sure other bcs can do more dps but not when fit with a comparable tank. the raven and rokh are also great at pumping out dps with blasters or torps. the sniper rokh when fit for max range and standard frentix can do 440 dps at 153km optimal / 58km falloff using navy thorium. thats with no tank other than a dc and a field extender rig, but with the shield resist bonus and tier-3 base hp it still gets 80k ehp if you have a vulture boosting it with a siege mindlink. caldari are hardly underpowered.that said, i still don't think the drake needs a nerf. it fits in well with the other tier-2s imo. the tier-1 bcs could use a boost, as well as the tier-2 cruisers."

4/18/2010,this seems like a no-brainer and something that should be wicked simple to do. let players resize the lp store windows.
4/18/2010,freck yes!!!
4/18/2010,"you can resize it, in the corner, but only there. i support making it a regular window."
4/18/2010,"i got this idea when helping new players. i was thinking that it would be great if you could sort of send a link to the window you want them to open, instead of having to guide them there with any amount of misstakes possibly happening on the road.so my idea is that you can take any window or tab in the game, right click and select ""copy link to clipboard"" or something similar. you can then paste that ui link in any chat, and whoever clicks it will open the very same window on their client! alternatively it could flash the buttons needed to click to get there (like in the tutorials), this would possibly be even better as you learn better if you do it yourself.i think this would be a great tool for anyone wishing to help someone else with eves advanced ui. i also think customer support could use a tool like this. and the great thing is; it's all in there already, thanks to the tutorials! all that is needed is to implement the actual hyperlink mechanic."
4/18/2010,"you hatred is funny.funny you should mention electronic arts. they are a great company to work for. been there for several years now.oh, and don't be mad if ccp comes under our company umbrella. we have been taking a serious look at them.if it's in the game!"
4/18/2010,wow. what i find ironic is that joke candidates like emo tj are still better than some of the serious candidates running for csm.you've got my vote. mainly to help keep the legitimate idiots out.
4/18/2010,"another goal of mine is to help balance the csm in terms of agendas. currently there are many csm's that are there and only push the topics that their alliance/power block wants to help them out. there is not enough balance.i will be there to represent the new people to this game. if you are tired of the bitter old vets that hate new players, vote for me."
4/18/2010,get out.
4/18/2010,how do you propose you fix mining? would you like to reduce drone mineral loot and mission loot?
4/18/2010,you should give some examples of this imbalance you are claiming exists. otherwise it is just an assumption or even worst a horrible misconception on your part.
4/18/2010,"do ccp know how involved you were with kugutsumen in the ~good old days~ or have you neglected to mention that?either way i am voting for youe: really that name is blocked on these forums, really?"
4/18/2010,"yeah they knew, but i never mentioned that. it was really funny talking to some of them irl, one of them walked up to me and was like ""you're **********'s friend aren't you?"". i told them yeah, and i'm going to hack all their eves. later on at fanfest i spent a day walking around in a ********** / pl phage shirt some icelandic pl members made for me(those guys are awesome). the devs were really thrilled about that. thanks for your vote :3"
4/18/2010,"i believe lowsec needs some loving from the game design department at ccp. but the problem is ccp has to be careful in how they improve this area of the game. in dominion they attempted to boost individual income for pilots in 0.0 while increasing the cost of maintaining sov too. i wouldn't call what they achieved to be a success. so any increase in income potential for lowsec might be better than what 0.0 is right now.lowsec right now is where the protection of law (concord, etc) whittles away until you hit the threshold of 0.0 space. i say add some mechanics in there where players can influence it in either direction. an organized crime/pirate syndicate could strip away station and gate guns for an area and truly make things seedy. where on flipside players who want more protection could boost it. there was a great player-created suggestion for lowsec created at evevegas09 and you can read writeup at the following link:"

4/18/2010,thanks rokkit. ad submitted.i'd be happy to take part in an e-mail interview. sounds like a good idea.
4/18/2010,"i'm not a csm hopeful, but i thought i'd throw my 2c in any way.i have never been a part of a powerblock in 0.0, as someone looking in from the outside though, i can see how the current state of affairs is not a happy one.large fleets cause lag, but are a necessity in the kind of warfare that taking and holding sov in 0.0 requires. it has become a case of 'biggest fleet wins' instead of a case of 'most cunning commander wins'the requirements of sov warfare in 0.0 need to be scaled down, a mechanism that allows small gangs to be useful needs to be introduced as should the tools to allow fcs to manage many small fleets simultaneously.if a system can be taken using a bit of thought, smaller cheaper fleets and base cunning then the blob will no longer be necessary.things cannot continue as they are, the 'endgame' of eve is currently broken as demonstrated by the need to use an exploit (deep safe cynos) to have a fair fight.power blocks are important, they are part of the social and political fabric of new eden. they are worthy of being thought of on the same level as the 4 empire factions. i don't particularly want the powerblocks to dissappear but the necessity for their huge fleets should be phased out.look at the cold war for example. it was actually pretty hot, with the usa and ussr going at each other through proxies, such as in vietnam, korea, afghanistan, and many many other 'little' wars. there was never open hostility between the two superpowers but they fought nonetheless. this is the role i would like to see the powerblocks taking in the future of eve. supplying smaller factions in order to further their political and economic ends.we should start thinking of lag as the mutually assured destruction of the nuclear age. no-one wants it, war is no fun when it happens, and so it should be avoided at all costs. this means smaller fights on more fronts, and the mechanics of sov need to be changed (again) for this to happenthat was more like $1.50 but there you go :d"
4/18/2010,"just off the top of my head: what would happen if we limited the amount of mineral resources available to the players? no resources means ships become more valuable and harder to replace, which means losses mean more. fielding a huge fleet, and then losing some ships, would mean that those ships can't be replaced by the next encounter. as powerblocks slowly burn through their reserves, engagements become smaller simply because there aren't enough resources.just a thought."
4/18/2010,"it would become interesting if battleships weren't as easily replaced as they are now, but i think it would either just cause a move down to bc, or simply fewer fights, not smaller ones."
4/18/2010,"if they move to cheaper ships, smaller corps will find it easier to keep up with them.weapons like bombs will become extremely feared as those will be able to bring down bcs but capital ships aren't brought down quite as easily by them.it'd mean that blobs become very vulnerable to small bomber gangs."
4/18/2010,"personally i hate bots they ruin the belts for us honest miners , ive just come back to empire space after awhile in 0.0 to find it worse then ever before with em. ok so we can partition to eve to report the miner, but as said before this is a paying account and what are ccp goina do as money talks. personally i think we should have the option of reporting them and once this has been succesfully investigated we should get kill rights on that playerall them in favour say i"
4/19/2010,yes it would be 3x as good :)
4/19/2010,so the most commonly flown bs in the game is caldari which means it's the most commonly trained bs skill in the game which is incentive to at least try and use them in pvp sometime in the last few years and yet in all this time the only two people who know the truth about the greatness of the caldari bs fleet is you two trolls?lol
4/19/2010,"possible. but we are talking about a fairly tight distribution, maybe 15-20 seconds tops. with an n of at least 100, even with the uneven distribution of gun cyclic rate, the distribution will be fairly normal. assuming you magically survived the bulk of incoming fire? show me a 1m ehp sniper battleship and i will accept this as a possibility. because i can show fairly small bs fleets that have 1m+ damage output salvos.the upward bound is your ehp, which is far less than the total potential damage output of a 250+ bs fleet. even an extreme bs buffer tank would pop before half the incoming damage reached it. unless you post a 500k+ ehp sniper bs fit to disprove this."
4/19/2010,"the tightness of the distribution has nothing to do with whether or not its normal. the distribution of reaction times does. if you have a 1m+ damage output salvo then each ship could reduce its dps by 75% and you would still volley a 125k ehp bs twice over. such in that situation your ships dps does not matter.but you know, fleets do eventually get down in size.in which case dps doesn't matter and neither does your entire complaint, because the 250+ bs fleet is going to volley anything and they could have 1/5th the volley damage each and they're still going to volley it in roughly the same time.with discrete damage increases you're either in a situation where both damage and ehp matter or neither matter and both will always matter in equal amounts. there is simply no way to deny this."
4/19/2010,"i'd like to see a ship-transport ship, but have some of my own thoughts....i propose an orca equivalent. another sub-capital ship, called a fleet maintenance ship or somesutch.it would have a large ship hanger. refitting ships would be possible. it would provide bonuses to logistics modules including remote hull repair (don't believe any ship does this at present), though not energy transfer arrays. however there would be no range bonus. thus this ship does not compete with logistics ships for combat operations. it would however be useful for recovery after combat/patching up pos etc.if it can be used for ship refitting/transport as well as repair of ships etc without competing with logistics ships it should be generally useful without being imbalancing. and thematically i think a ship transporter/repair unit works, especially if it looks like a space junk minmatar ship."
4/19/2010,you are trying to solve an already solved issue.freighters+courier contracts.
4/19/2010,"i agree with this point. no new freighters are needed, just the right cans. i do not support the idea of another t2 freighter which i'll have to buy just to haul stuff."
4/19/2010,"~ = aboutcharon can do 981,250 m3. that would be about 1m. the fenrir only can get to 900,000 m3. i suppose it would've been better to round it to ""~950,000 m3"" so no one would get the idea that they could put two assembled bss in on.i have a charon. i would much rather fly two battleships individually rather than haul them in that thing. i mean it takes almost a minute to align for warp, plus a minute or so in warp for each system. you can easily move two battleships that are travel fit (with a shuttle ride in between) in less time. not to mention there already is a ship that can move two bs, called the carrier.the freighter is a larger version of the hauler, not a dread. a larger version of a ship hauler would be a multiplication of the cost of a carrier.i'm rich. freighter ganks aren't going to impact my coffers much. i've been involved in ganks though, don't get me wrong. but i made my isk playing the market and hauling (mostly ships, in fact).from your list, i am confident i have more ships than you, and have had to move all of them more than once, so i know how unpleasant that is. additionally, i haul ships often in that ship hauler... oh, what are they called? a carrier. if a larger ship hauler were introduced in the game, it would likely be used to haul ships (like the ones you are talking about, faction ships) that would make them prime targets for ganks. as to the idea that t2 resists would prevent it from being ganked... wishful thinking. if there was the possibility of a fitted bs dropping, let alone a faction one, it would be worth the dozen or two gank bs required to pop it.no, the op wants it to be the price of a jf. i have said already that it would cost more. eve does not have ships that follow an efficiency of scale. damage output, hitpoints, cargo size, etc increase slower than the cost of the ships to promote group effort. 100 cruisers are far more deadly than 10 bs despite the same cost. 600 haulers can move ~10m m3 for the same cost as a freighter moves ~1m. so, just like everything else in the game, this proposed ship isn't going to more efficient."
4/19/2010,bagehi: the align time issue can be solved with a corp mate in a rapier/huggin:)
4/19/2010,sort of. it reduces align time to somewhere around 30 seconds. still better off with travel-fitting 2 bs over flying them in a hypothetical 1m+ m3 freighter.
4/19/2010,more like 5-10s if at all... :) with double/triple web you start warping at roughly 15-19m/s :) (tested with obelisk) and you start with something like 10m/s when you issues the warp command.

4/19/2010,"all we know that the most of people solo missions and anomallys, because it is the best way to make the best profit in general case. and here it causes quite bad problems. if you have a rich experience in solo null anomally, or mission farming, you might agree with that it is soooooooooo boring. especially for anomally, people shot rats at the same sequence, wait the spawn ,and start shotting again. it is so boring but sometimes you may need to do. it just makes this part of the game work-like but has no benifit to anyone. then some people bored with this and ****ed off.it is quite rare to see people do it together because it is not efficient. alought you may like to do it with others buy they may not happy towhy do i say do mission or anomally together is not effcient? two reasons: firstly, it is always hard to find two at a similar skill level, so the slower one will share the faster one and the faster gets his income lowed.secondly, travel time and action delay makes the total time little a bit longer. yes just little a bit but the bonus of double firepower can't cover this loss. because there are no bonus to the doubled firepower, or the bonus is too light to be seen, you can hardly see two bs killing a rat makes more isk/hour than solo.how could this be sloved? eve should not be a solo game.yes you can do solo but the teamwork ought to be more efficient. if you make noobs have to solo their lv.2 lv.3 missions, and nobody like to do with them just because it makes less profit, some of them may quit, to other games which they can get more interactions from players much easier.so here is my suggestions:1, invent team missions(could be just derive from current missions). the ship restricted missions, hold by different agents, rich reward and not difficult at all, but have two spawn points which are far from each other or missions need do ratting and courier at the same time lol: or just two deadspaces or two accleractors need to be finished both,and so on. ehhhh i don't think you're so lack of imagenation :)2, the main point of this is making the doubled firepower earns more isk/hour than solo. how could you achieve that? we have different anomallies in null sec,for different factions, but basically they are similar.one way to do that,could be use the one already works in wh space. the highest anomallies will spawn extra bs rats if there is a second player enters. yes some people may ask people to come to their space just once then leave for the bonus, but this is an interaction.:) use alt? no i can use my alt do another one.i hope you guys could give me more ideas, it is never good to let people solo too long,they will lost much fun of the online game.btw,i've thought about increase rats' repair rate,but it may makes solo harder,if reducing the ehp for a balance,mrauders get more bonus also"

4/19/2010,all my votes belong to you
4/19/2010,"personally i'd like to see mining become a little more interactive. add in a mini-game for the player who is mining which could yield more rock if they play well. csm3 asked ccp about what happened to the promised ""industrial expansion."" hopefully tyrannis helps things followed by incarna whenever it is coming out. so yes, i believe the industrial gatherer profession needs some attention and i will support any proposals that help this."
4/19/2010,"given the though on structure management, what are your ideas when tyrannis comes and you add to the mis the pi structures, which from initial testing they are going to be lots of them?"
4/19/2010,"i don't want to see blobs dissapear. fleet fights make eve the great game. roams are fun from time to time, but fights without some strategical objective to fight for, soon become boring. i would like to see more ship diversity in the fleet though, not just battleships and dictors."
4/19/2010,could a mechanic be introduced to disadvantage large fleets?gang boosts can benefit fleet members.how about a disadvantage to being in a fleet proportional to the size of the fleet?for instance warpspeed reduction - moving a large fleet must be slow so provides incentive for smaller fleets in some circumstances?signature radius increase - in a big fleet there may be a greater chance of stray shots hitting somethingalign time reduction - coordination of large fleets more complex than smaller ones
4/19/2010,"i think there is allready a natural disadvantage in terms of speed for a large fleet. a fleet can only move as fast as it's slowest ship, or it'll split up, making it vulnerable. but currently faster moving small gangs have few ways of cashing in to their advantage other that being able to get away from a large fleet.there is no 'guerila' way of conquering a system so even though a smaller gang might be able to stay allive in a system patrolled by a larger fleet if they're carefull, they can achieve little by doing so."
4/19/2010,this would cause more blobbing not less. people who are afraid to lose therir ship join blobs not small gangs or solo.
4/19/2010,"it's the combination of people switching to the smaller bc and weapons of mass destruction like bombs that'd spell doom for the blob. if the only thing blobs where used for was to destroy poses, and people would avoid using them elsewhere because of the high cost of losing ships, the battlefield would become more varied and interesting.what i'm wondering is, why aren't bombs allready being used like this on a large scale as it seems to be a relatively cheap way of doing a lot of damage to blobs?"
4/19/2010,"i see two reasons why this is a bad idea.when u report an isk spammer, it most likely logs system, and probably copies the chatlog from local. if you end up reporting a raven in 0.0 that cloaks when u enter the system. there's nothing saying that it's not just someone watching local. or paying attention to scanner, which is the only way to successfully make isk ratting in null sec.due to the fact that macros do the exact same actions a player would be doing the only way to seriously check whether it's a macro or human is if actions taken (locking, activating mods, warping) are done in an exact timed repetition way that ccp could justify as not being human.the second thing i would mention is the ugly truth that the eve economy has grown accustomed to the existence of macros. ice fuels, minerals, and etc flow into eve because these macro's are running. now i'm not condoning macro's just pointing out that the eve economy may well already be dependent on them. minerals don't suddenly become more valuable without an adverse effect on the prices of other things.depending on the ratio of 'real' miners and 'macro' miners, this could have a major impact on the current balance to things, it could be positive, but most likely would be negative. 'real' miners wont suddenly be generating more minerals to fill the gap, and not a lot of people will suddenly go roid crazy.last thing is that this would just be used as a griefing tool. gms have a terrible track record when it comes to actually investigating anything. if you want anything done you have to escalate for 2 or 3 weeks until you finally get to a senior gm just to get a decent answer. adding a tool that will get people suspended/banned from playing this game with such a thing as macro use that requires a fairly in depth investigation is not something i would like to see implemented with the current gm track record for in depth analysis."
4/20/2010,and again forgetting that it isn't dps = ehp. a sniper fleet fight is a race between getting enough damage on a ship before the ship can warp out.
4/20/2010,you are aware that what you just said supports everything that goum has said right?-liang
4/20/2010,what ?looks like you are not clever enough to understand why the rokh is the best sniper bs in eve....np not everybody can be demigods like guomi and liang lol.the funny thing they have never flown the sniper rokh themselves but it is awesome so you should fly it :dwhat??? it is clear that whatever bagehi says supports guomi's ...
4/20/2010,"goumis already won the internet .... whatever you say supports him whatever you think .... hes that good.anyway.dps doesn't = volleyehp / volley how many ships you need to pop something.why would an fc target anything like a rohk which has good ehp, poor dps, poor volley?if a rohks small volley mean's you need 2x+ as many to pop something.... would you fly one?the answer for eve-1 is no."
4/20/2010,"everything that i have said applies to volley damage as well. you're just adding small complexities into the system that don't actually change the answer.the rokh has a small volley damage compared to an apoc. true, it volleys for 1800 or so (iirc, don't have eft here), and the apoc volleys for 2600 or so (in the fit you guys want to use, slightly less in mine). and the rokh, in exchange for this 30.7% less volley damage has some 32.5% more ehp (both numbers figured at a % of the highest).as you glass cannon the apoc the rokh gets better. as you add more range into your fits the rokh gets better(and worse as you reduce it). as you increase the number of maelstroms the rokh gets better.and that is just pure volley/ehp efficiency.if the answer for most people is no, then its out our fault they do not know what they're doing."
4/20/2010,"you are aware that everything goum and you say in this post keeps it on the first page of assembly hall. regardless of how confused you are about the mechanics of the game, or how much you simply love to troll, it supports boosting railguns?see how i did that?"
4/20/2010,"are you truly as stupid as you appear here? let's go over this one more time for mr. stupid:- goum's fleet math is correct. fleet effectiveness = ehp * dps, and you should call targets according to their dps:ehp ratio. when ehp doesn't matter because people are instapopping, neither does dps or volley. when either of them start to matter, they both start to matter. (as a side note, high volley puts you at a slight disadvantage in a fleet fight because of overstriking the target and it puts a much higher strain on your fc's target calling)- the rokh is, therefore, the best fleet sniper - not because of its dps... but because of its ehp.- however, the gallente rail boats aren't all that fantastic with rails. it can be argued that gallente ships shouldn't necessarily make good snipers (because they're oh-so-awesome up close ), however i don't think that this level of suckitude is really justified. so, rails need a bit more damage (but absolutely nothing more than 15%). but the problem is that this will boost what is already the best fleet sniper!- but boosting the rokh is ok - would you not expect a ship with two bonuses to fleet sniping to be the best fleet sniper - perhaps even significantly?yes, a perfect example of how to look like a complete ****ing idiot that hasn't actually read the thread and lacks the brain power to understand the obvious.-liang"

4/20/2010,they need something. battlecruisers perform nearly as well for a small fraction of the cost.
4/20/2010,"i will probably get flamed somewhat, but is not part of the problem the tier 2 bc's? if i compare them, they do tend to stick out a bit on the upside of the power level.i'd say turn a bat in that direction, perhaps a 7,5% reduction in armor, shield and cap."
4/20/2010,"they are, but the changes you mention won't mean lot. heck, the 7.5 percent cap/armor advantage is already built-in for those, you'll just bring them down to tier-1 level in that very area, while tier-2 will still enjoy abnormal slot amount."
4/20/2010,"it's not the slots that are the problem, it's the bonuses and fittings.harbinger: high gun damage and a large drone bay and a ton of powergrid. drake: high power grid, shield resist, and damage bonus with 7 launchers for decent to high damage. sleipnir: fast, high dps, decent drone bay, and incredibly easy to fit.compare any of those to the teir 1 bc that are always short on fittings, much lower tanks, and much lower dps except the brutix. but the brutix is a paper tiger on tank even if it does have nice dps. people don't buy this, but the prophecy has almost no advantage over the harbinger. harbinger has higher base armor, shields and an extra mid. it also has way higher powergrid and a larger drone bay making fitting a large tank plus guns pretty easy.i played with eft last night and got a harbinger to about 135k ehp with a damnation. it also did about 550 dps. i tried something similar with the proph and got 159k ehp (*a whoping 24,000 more), but lost a ton of firepower and had huge issues on fittings. so why on god's green earth would i ever choose to use the proph when the teir 2 is so much stronger. that imbalance directly relates to the imbalance that was created when teir 2 got released and became the ""almost as good as t2 for way less"" choice."
4/20/2010,"yes.thought you should always put an idea through f&id before here, to get the little things like abandoned drones out of the way."

4/20/2010,"considering the rather overdone nerfs, t2 short range ammo should far surpass faction. or have the nerfs removed and leave it as it is... slightly less worthy than faction but at least usable.long range, for the most part, achieves a workable parity so should merely have the nerfs removed with no modification of damage."
4/20/2010,"i really dont understand why there is a penalty anyway! i mean you trained for t2 weapons, you also trained for t2 ammo, your penalty is the time it takes to train them, there shouldnt be a penalty for using t2 ammo with the t2 weapon!simple! only penalty should be stacking penalties and difference one being long range one being short range.."
4/20/2010,"1. with tyrannis less people will be suicide ganking (not removed) the -10 typhoons won't be ganking as many people because of the insurance nerf, the 0.5 systems i think will counteract the loss in ganking2. no ship! areas off the stations and stargates will not be touched, any person with half a brain can see that.3. who said i wanted to nerf ganking, tyrannis will do that.4. hardly, i have a 2~ sec status and generally only kill pirates who are stupid enough to engage people on low-sec gates. yes this would boost my gameplay because i would prey on pirates who engage in said 0.5 systems.i agree that the loss of highsec will be bad, highsec will become smaller and options would decrease. a more adequate proposal would be to add 0.4 systems in between the current main trade routes but then alter the 0.4 systems to be what i have described. at the moment, 0.4-0.1 are very similar in the way they operate anyway, 0.4 systems would become the 'somewhat' concord protected systems, and everyone keeps their 0.5 systems. now the new 0.4 systems would merely create another system who's sole purpose is to travel through. no ratting no mining or anything, unless you have a deathwish.0.3 - 0.1 system are then scaled accordingly to accomadate the loss of 0.4 systems.edit: imo also make the new 0.4 systems 'high-sec' such that capitals can't be cyno'd in."
4/20/2010,"1. care to link the devblog that has the supposed insurance nerf? 'cause the one i read only buffed it.2. so what u're saying is u only want part of a system to be completely safe by separating little zones within only one system designated for only certain functions? l2dock.3. wrong--tyrannis will only make blobbing easier with removed deep safespots but that's another issue.4. that's what u ppl always say--""i'm really not x even though i'm proposing x."" news flash, u can already ""prey"" on pirates in low sec so what's the problem in sticking to low sec? seriously, at least be somewhat convincing if u're gonna outright lie, especially with a proposal to change high sec choke points into low sec. and i'm sry if it's so difficult for even one of your blob to spot a cyno in the overview. anyway, there r plenty of pirates that r more than willing to prey on u as well--u're either not even trying or u're just another one of them who r only capable of easy ganks."
4/20/2010,"1. read, it helps.2. your trolling, grow up.3. this is high-sec, deep safespots were only really a mechanic for 0.0 fc's to get people into a system, why would you even bother using dss in highsec?they were used so that fc's could bring in their own fleet, +1000au away from any hostile ships so that the forming fleet may have enough to for everyone to load grid and get into system with a sufficient time buffer for the hostile fleet not to arrive at the cyno field and have free reign over the ships which still havent loaded grid.edit: who the hel even mentioned dss? please stop posting before you embarass yourself more.4. refer to 2.i have never been cyno blobbed, stay on topic."
4/20/2010,"don't agree with this at all, your post sensor dampened my ability to know where to start even responding on this, but it's low sec lite. bad idea.java"
4/20/2010,"1. u do realize that t2 ships r getting 20%-60% and t3 r getting 100% right? where's the meaning in blowing up those ships now?2. every time i post something someone can't argue with, they play the ""troll"" and ""grow up"" card. amazing.3. actually, they want to remove anything that's more than 10 au from the nearest celestial i believe. so basically, a blob can spread themselves out at every celestial, directionally scan u down, and pinpoint your location with scan probes much faster. hope u got tons of bookmarks for that one system or like playing cat and mouse all day. and u were the one that thought tyrannis would nerf ganking. 4. refer to 2.5. then why would u want to nerf cynos in the first place if they're no trouble at all? again with the ""i'm not x but i propose x"". anything original u wanna try this time?"

4/20/2010,"i don't know who would buy them at current prices. with it taking literally years to return the investment, i don't ""get"" anyone who would spend that much isk on one, since you can get much much better return for little risk once you have that much capital.plus, with such a long-term investment horizon, real risk in owning t2 bpos exists since ccp might introduce more changes to t2 production/etc, lowering the margins and increasing the time to pay off a t2 bpo even more. people who bought a t2 bpo just before invention hit definitely got majorly shafted; this sort of thing could happen again when you look at 3-4 years time."
4/20/2010,i endorse this product and/or service.
4/20/2010,tbh i'm fine with it as it is now. that's not what sparked this proposal.this proposal was sparked by a serious csm proposal (that i gather got as far as ccp) that warp scrams should flat-out block docking. something that might have just about been ok if you removed aggression timers (so you can kill/jam tacklers and then dock) but tbh would be sort-of-sucky even then.
4/20/2010,"how could that be seriously considered by intelligent people who understand the game?i'd expect that sort of thing from noobs or the regular crazies.even if someone seriously believes that docking should be limited by a module, it would go without saying that new scouting tool would have to be added - to allow docked people to check for campers outside the station. failure to recognize such a simple common sense thing would be a sign that the person is not qualified for design decision making.if we get past that, there's still a big question whether warp scrambler is the right module for the job. logically it doesn't make sense, but may be seriously considered for lack of better options. following that, other modules should be seriously considered, such as stasis web. logically it makes more sense. from game balance it would also be a better idea since web has become the ""lesser"" tackle module since the great nerf, with warp scramble and disruptor taking primary roles.having said that, i'm against modifying docking mechanism at this time. but i would be understanding of the change if i could see it was done by people who show clear understanding of the game. i just hate seeing people in charge show bad judgment and lack of understanding on things they are supposed to be good at."
4/20/2010,"it obviously was not considered by intelligent people who understand the game, then."
4/20/2010,actually ccp brought up the idea of warp scrambler blocking docking. iirc
4/20/2010,"part i: problem and exampleslogistics ships. great idea, right? that's what ccp thought, that's what the players thought, and that's exactly what the players who use neutral remote repair think. logistic ships can be used aggressively and defensively, but when abused, the scale only tips one way. that is, of course, to the side of the ones using it. this has been an increasing problem, getting to the point where both sides consider or even commence in it. to lay it down with force, neutral remote repair does not need a nerf, as some may think, what is needed is a fix. the fix is simple, and will be brought to topic shortly...lets look at an examples:scenario*corp a wars corp b. corp a aggressively combats corp b, cutting off their trade routes, picking off stragglers and luring corp b into low-sec. corp b, fed up with losing ships, goes to one of their favorite hang outs, a trade hub with a major station. corp a, finally thinking they'll fight a large, intense battle, coordinates a major fleet to chase the enemies into their system. big mistake. outside of station, both parties begin engaging each other. corp b, however, has a trick up their sleeves. as soon as one of their heavy dps battleship is nearing destruction, 5 players, all in random, possibly npc-run corps, begin to remote repair said battleship, thus negating all damage taken. corp a's fleet sees this, and begins to set fast-tackle and sentries on the neutral remote repair. as soon as the neutral rr sees this, he dock up, for he is at 0 meters off the back of the station. corp a then proceeds to die and/or retreat.*more than not, the corps swap places. sometimes corp a wars b, but corp a gets beaten back, and results in using neutral remote repair themselves.so what exactly is the problem here? there is no chance of winning now, for corp a. one may not see this as a major problem, but it is now at a point that corp b is nearly invulnerable. enough times it has been said that there are ways to combat this. we'd all like to think this, but it is not very likely.after the its not a problem solution, the first argument people have is finding theories to combat it. for example, in theory, if you come in storm with a fleet of 20 interceptors, you can go straight after the neutral remote reps. well, with many high-sec wars (and bare in mind this is almost solely a high-sec problem) most corps cannot get more than 20 in a fleet. so if your whole fleet is composed of interceptors, how can you fight the war targets? and on that note, if, for example, all 20 catch a neutral rr, but how could they kill it when 4 others in their chain are repairing said target?another argument would be to never fight them on a station. as this problem has been increasing, though, you see more and more getting away from trade hubs and stations. especially if the warred or warring corp has a separate remote repair corp of their own. and even on a gate, for example, either the neutral remote repair is 60+ km away, aligned and ready to warp if needed, or on the gate, and can instantly jump with no delay.the final argument that comes so often compares the difference between logistics ships as neutral or in the warred or warring corp. some say that there is little to no difference, because when the neutral rr repairs an enemy of yours, they're open game. that position is looking at the situation very blindly. when you have a logistics pilot in the warred corp, they are open game, any time, anywhere. not only that, but they can also be podded when caught. a neutral remote repair can only be engaged when they're repairing the enemy, and because of the abundance of them, you may never know who exactly will be repairing your enemy."
4/20/2010,"part ii: solution and commentsand that leads to the solution. what can we do? well, neutral remote repair has become so abundant that, as said before, this problem needs not a nerf, but a fix. and the solution is very simple. remote repair becomes an act of aggression. if you remote repair someone, you cannot dock for the default 30 seconds. if they're not in your corp (or alliance, which alliance aggression is a separate issue,) just as if you shot them, you will pull aggression from concord.there is currently talk on the table of doing only half that, making any and all remote repair cause station aggression. although it may be a step in the right direction, it does not, by any means, solve the problem at hand. if that happens, many neutral remote repairs will switch to buffered dominix's, en masse outside of an undock or gate, with the ability to not only repair, but kill anyone who engages them.and now for my final thoughts. this has been an increasingly growing problem since the release of the logistics ships. it only seems that the opponents of this issue are the ones using this tactic, and everyone else is left behind because of the failure ccp has done to not only fix, but even recognize the problem. think about it, and try to grasp that with the current system, there is no chance of winning. i'm not saying you can win every battle, but when facing neutral remote repair, there is not a slim chance of winning.and thus, i will leave you with something to keep in your mind. every experienced pvper knows for a fact that remote repair, whether from logistics ships, or even from a spider tank, can be a key turning point in any battle. every experienced pvper also knows that jamming, from, for example, a rook or falcon, can be a major turning point as well. so ask yourself this. why can i as a player freely remote repair someone without any repercussions, yet, when i try to jam someone, concord engages me?"
4/20/2010,"unlike the post from bellum, your posting doesnt really provide a solution"
4/20/2010,"i apologize, i forgot to add in the solution part, because i had to do it in two posts. but thank you for noticing."
4/20/2010,bellum's solution is better.making the person a valid target while the war lasts.
4/20/2010,"how so, and how far does it go?i understand bellum, and have discussed that idea well before. that solution does not work, however. with that solution, it would stem off even worse. individuals, when they rr, will be considered a wt for the duration of the war, with that solution.so, player a rrs player b, who is at war with a corp. player a is now a valid war target. so, take an alliance of 100 active players. each one of those players rrs player b, so now the corp that warred or got warred by player b's corp now has 100 new targets. now, this can be abused even more, to avoid the alliance war dec fee. a 1 man alt corp (a) wars another corp (b). alliance c as a whole rrs the 1 man alt corp. its a continuing cycle of backassward killrights/war targets and such.this will keep spiraling off, making the situation worse for everyone, not solving the problem at hand.rr drastically changes battle, and should (in my opinion) be treated just as jams, damps, scrams, etc, all of which pull concord aggro if you proceed with the action against a neutral.edit:and another situation that bellum's solution wouldn't help at all.a player infiltrates a corp, and starts killing their members. normally, you could kill/fight that member, or wait the time it takes to kick them out(possibly 24+ hours.) but, for the sake of argument, say that player is outside a hq where most people operate, getting rr'd by 5 neutrals. so, there is no way for retaliation, except for having to wait out the time it takes to kick that member out."
4/20/2010,"oh pretty simple, it will make all those folks who think ""i just rep a friend during a war"" stay away.especially people trying rr in faction warfare."
4/20/2010,"what you said doesn't address a whole alliance rring a warring/warred corp, making the whole alliance war targets.i understand it may be broken in fw as well, but that is a separate issue, along the lines with alliance aggro. i can see that if you made all of fw able to rr each other, it may be a problem. but i have a fix for that, as well. normally, fw will be able to act just as a corp, all normal aggro, players can rr other members of their navy, or the corps under the navy. however, if a corp under the navy is warred, then they cannot be rr by other corps or the navy themselves.additionally, another solution (and imho a better solution) would adjust factional warfare in general. the navy corp would operate just a corp, all members would be able to rr/spider each other. and, as we know, that corp cannot be warred. independent corps under the navy, however, would operate as sole entities. sort of like ""mercs"" working for the navy. those corps could not either rr or get rr by any other corps or the navy itself, and if in highsec, will be concorded, and if in lowsec, will take a sec hit and pull gcc."
4/20/2010,i recognize this as a broken mechanic. harold also has a colostomy bag.
4/20/2010,bellum's solution is elegant in its simplicity but lacks the aggression component which is by far the biggest issue.only way to defeat docking/jumping logistics is to blob hard as hell with dps/tackle or swamp the area with ecm. neither makes for interesting game play.if concord was to get involved you would kill off the handful of friendly people who enjoy assisting newcomers with missions by providing logistics support.low-sec shin-digs would be pure disco with flashes going off everywhere whenever a coalition (aligned corps/alliances) faces another (concord = gcc).
4/20/2010,"first, i do appreciate your comment.in theory, it is possible to swamp and blob, but like i said, and looking at the situation in practice, you cannot achieve such a goal in high-sec wars. and i'm talking about the majority, not when 2 big alliances go at it.second, it is nice to see people helping each other, but there is a major problem. using the fact that a few corps or players like to help beginners should be noted, but the major imbalance of the situation when neutral rr comes into wars should override that. when it comes down to it, maybe it should be suggested those beginners join the corp with the people helping them.and yes, i understand concord aggro in high-sec means gcc in low-sec, and like i stated before, the whole alliance aggro mechanic needs a rework. and, hopefully if ccp does release a new coalition system (which they have talked about) the same aggro mechanics we see in corps will apply with low-sec/00 based coalition. (and, on a side note, you can always set up your overview so blues supersede over gcc)i understand and acknowledge the points you are trying to make, but the overwhelming need for a solution is more important than the small details. yes, we'd all like to believe that there's always a counter, and in theory there is, but in practice we're all out of luck (if you're a smaller corp/alliance.)"
4/20/2010,"this has already been brought up during the current csm council period. i believe the vote that a remedy is needed was unanimous. what those changes would be, as proposed, i don't at this time recall.a: neutral ship receives the same aggression timer as any other ship getting involved in a firefight. it can't dock/jump for 60 seconds, per current rules.a1: neutral ship is flagged as criminal and concord gets involved.b: neutral is flagged as 'at war' with the enemy corporation of the pilot they were assisting. this flag persists until the end of that corporation's current war cycle - the entirety if it, even if the aided corporation withdraws early. it does not carry over into additional war periods unless they continue to aid the corporation. neutral repping multiple factions gains additional flags.c: neutral parties are not able to activate logistic modules on non-allied targets in high security space where their target is engaged by player aggression.regardless, this little feature has completely killed the pvp side of eve for me, as has the blob mentality. i've found myself either not logging in, or shifting to more 'carebear' activities."
4/20/2010,"overview is the least of the problems, gcc means 15 minutes docked or at safe spot and it means a security hit .. that is an absolutely massive penalty for otherwise ""law abiding"" pilots.a single gcc in a gang has a tendency to spread like wildfire once rr starts rolling around, it is an ugly thing to behold and puts a serious dampener on things if one has to wait for 15 minutes every other system.i beg to differ. since we all pretty much agree that something has to be done, all that is left is the details making a neutral rr pilot a valid target for the duration of a war and denying him docking ability through aggression mechanics would solve the issues in empire (believe it or not, that e. includes low-sec ) and null-sec both.question is if it is possible to differentiate between docking and jumping aggression since the main culprits in that regard normally operate with the un-/dock gimmick whereas the jumping is far more rare and strategic/dangerous in nature."
4/20/2010,"agression timer for remote repair would be welcomed. making it a hostile act (edit: towards the recipient) is unnecessary, and wouldn't be effective anyways (all i have to do to get around that is drop a can with the logi alt and pick it up with my combat ship).edit: by hostile act i mean making it a hostile act towards the pilot receiving the remote repair in an attempt to cause neutral remote repairers to get concorded. this is how i interpreted the op, and such a change would be ineffective since it is possible to give your alt aggression towards you main to escape the concord response."
4/20/2010,"ok ur missing the point in this respect,the ""agro"" is not incured against you when he reps you, but against your agressor,if ur logi-alt takes ur can or u take his, neither of you will have ""combat agression"" only ""theft agression"" but if your logi-alt reps/cap transfers or uses anyother ""non concordable"" remote affect projector on your combat-alt whist it is activley enguaged in combat or has ""combat agression"" then your logi-alt will incur its own ""combat agression timer"" meaning it cant dock/jump for 60seconds, also if u log it off it will remain in space for the obligitory 15munits.i personaly agree with the op in this matter as i also belive that the current mechanic is in need of an urgent fix.to my aliance fu just making a point and i know my spelling is crap lol"
4/20/2010,"as i understand it the op wants ccp to make it a criminal act to use remote assistance on a neutral pilot and thus invoke a concord response. he proposes to do this by making remote repairing a hostile act to the target of the remote assistance (simply change it so that using an rr mod on someone has the same consequences as using a gun on them). i was simply pointing out that it would be simple to get around the concord response by giving your alt aggression so that you can legally ""attack"" them with your remote repair. and yes, you will still be unable to dock for 60 seconds, which i think is a good idea. i just don't like the whole ""criminal act"" idea since its easy to exploit and circumvent. i suppose they could somehow code it as a criminal act against anyone that is fighting the pilot you are repairing, but that would be a major change in the base game mechanics, not a simple change like making rr hostile to the target just like a weapon. it would cause many side effects. for instance, lets say one of your corp mates loots a neutral wreck, and then 10 minutes later you start fighting war targets. you remote repair your corpmate during the fight against the wartargets, but you end up getting concorded since your corp mate still has an aggression timer against a neutral corp, and you just ""attacked"" that corp using your remote repairer without legal permission and went gcc.personally, i don't want to see repairing a random neutral become a concord event since i love to stick a light armor bot on any random pilot i see fighting in an attempt to get their opponents to attack me so that i can smash them with my guns. i would however welcome a change that makes it impossible to dock for 60 seconds after using any sort of remote assistance module."
4/20/2010,"i can see what you're saying, but it dodges the fact that alliance aggro is a seperate issue. and, looking further into your point, i understand that its an inconvinence if blues couldn't rr blues, but, as an example, if i rr someone with gcc, i take a sec hit and get flagged myself. and this happens more than not in low-sec, for example in a belt or on a pos siege. this may even get the ball rolling on the talk of super-coalitions/super-alliances, where the aggro would work as the corp aggro does. i agree, and this is why we all need to figure out the fix and not a nerf.thanks for the explanation, but i already know what empire is =d. and i pointed out earlier that making them a war target makes the problem/imbalance worse. if that is the only change, we'll start seeing large alliances rring a single 1 man corp that warred another. then the warred corp will have hundreds of targets, and they'll only be paying 2mil a week. neut rr will merge into one super-group with tons of other pvpers and get around the war mechanic in general.and what about the 5 to 15 neut rr chains that often hang around station hubs? more than not i have seem them rr anyone they please, not just aiding a war. for example, player a and b are having a skirmish, whether it be from kill rights, loot aggro, or anything else, and player b gets rr'd by this chain. it may be because the neut rr group has a problem with player a, or they just feel like making sure player b wins. the war-target mechanic does not address this issue.i can see how this makes sense, but the obvious and easily accomplished work-around would make anyone be able to war for very cheap. and, it would not even address the other instances of rr. it starts a bigger problem. if these weren't possible, this would be a simple fix."
4/20/2010,"you are basing the argument on people not using the gun slots which can be done for a massive amount of ships.as part of a larger round of balancing perhaps, but not on its own. small selection of ships in similar situation:maller.augoror.scythe.bellicose.probably loads more if one goes through the complete roster looking for ""useless"" bonuses."
4/20/2010,i'll support this. but only on one character to keep it fair.
4/20/2010,"...that said ""this is the single most pointless bit of computer programming in the history of pointless things. and computer programming."""
4/20/2010,"~signed~ i absolutely agree to this, there should be a gate to the spot, with a nice view of the eve universe from afar, like you guys said. such an attraction would be epic. seriously, this would commemorate not only the farthest object ever made in eve, it would commemorate the absolute farthest distance a video game has ever created, and prove how us players can push a sandbox to ridiculous limits"
4/20/2010,"yes, by all means set a cyno or gate there and then when players load the starmap, not the system map, they should see all the eve galaxy as just a tiny dot far, far away."
4/20/2010,1
4/20/2010,except it is in the same galaxy as the rest of eve. just in the jove part of the galaxy.
4/20/2010,+1it's things like this that players can tell other people that make them want to join. player accomplishments that are made into monument make for great stories.
4/20/2010,"agreed completely.something about the exponential climb and exponential drop at the start and end of warps needs to change. they should still be exponentials of some kind, as having the nearest objects fall away from you as you enter warp, followed by more distant objects falling away from you, followed by the rest of the solar system moving past you is an important part of the ""feel"" of eve. however, some kind of change is needed such that they don't contribute as much to the overhead in how much time a ship spends in warp. right now, most ships take about 10 seconds to ramp up to full warp speed, and 20 seconds to drop down from full warp speed, and this time doesn't feel very different between cruisers and hyperspatial-rigged covops/interceptors. i suspect it doesn't feel very different between freighters and hyperspatial-rigged covops/interceptors, but i don't fly freighters.maybe make that overhead time somehow inversely proportional to the max warp speed? all ships would still follow an exponential ramp-up and ramp-down, but the duration of the exponential ramps is shorter the greater the max warp speed. make it so that cruisers take 0.75/3 times as long to ramp up/down to/from full warp speed as freighters, frigates take 3/6 as long to ramp as cruisers, covops and interceptors take 6/13.5 times as long to ramp as frigates, and hyperspatial-rigged covops and interceptors take 13.5/19.44 times as long to ramp as unrigged versions.finally, it would also be important not to make some ships have too little overhead in warp speed, or multi-jump chases will run into the session change timers, thus resulting in a ""session speed"" above which all ships take an average of 30 seconds per jump because they're all waiting on the session timers on every stargate."
4/20/2010,supported
4/20/2010,"as has been already stated, acceleration and deceleration are an exponential process. each ship increases its speed by a constant factor each second until it reaches its top speed.the simplest solution, to me, seems to simply make this constant factor a function of the maximum warp speed. a 9 au/s interceptor should (acc/dec)elerate at triple the rate of a typical 3 au/s frigate.this should be relatively easy to fix. simply change the multiplier in the code with a variable that reflects the ship's maximum warp speed. simple.as a bonus, this is also a minor buff to the warp speed increasing rigs, which almost nobody uses."
4/20/2010,"nerf mining? are you kidding? what are you some kind of mission carebear? what? you want to make it so exhumers are totally defenseless? we can't even survive a properly fitted suicide gank, and even a tank that can take on low/null belt rats is hard to fit.not to mention, mining is pretty much the only profession that seems to have gotten less and less viable the longer eve stays around. so if anything, it's already been nerfed (by the free market) meanwhile missions are untouchable since most of the reward comes from salvage, tags, and direct isk.mission macroing is just as big of a problem as mining macroing. also: thread doubly not supported still because it is a stealth gallente nerf."
4/20/2010,"ah come on, no serious mission runner uses gallenteit's ravens and navy ravens all the way."
4/20/2010,"1. u supposedly can't survive yet what r all the other thousands of exhumers still littering the belts have to say? that's what i thought. 2. it's less and less because everyone is oversupplying ore and ice to death with those thousands of exhumers still intact to mine some more. and it's still afk and therefore, effortless--that's why it appeals to ppl this way and that's why mining shouldn't be as rewarding--it's really not a hard concept... 3. that's hilarious 'cause out of all the threads i see complaining about macro mining, this is the very first one i've ever seen about macro missioning. maybe it's because, once again, mining is effortless and therefore, infinitely easier to macro? u don't have to take my word for it--check the mineral prices."
4/20/2010,"maybe you haven' noticed it, but loot dropped by npc will be nerfed in tyrannis explicitly to boost mining.if that will be enough, seeing how at the same time insurance will be reduced, lowering the floor for the minerals basket. it is something we will see after some time.i think that high sec mining will suffer and low sec/0.0 will not gain, but that is an opinion.that you and him are speaking of 2 different situations. it is easy to suicide gank a hulk and it will not tank easily alone 0.0 rats. the large number of barge and exumers in some high sec belt show that suicide ganking isn't common enough to stop people from mining but that don't make the ships suicide proof, it only means that the potential targets vastly outnumbers the gankers."
4/20/2010,"i do run missions frequently, and i fully support this.as the others said, would need some balancing though."
4/20/2010,this clip is on topic and worth watching. check it out.fanfest 2009 pve
4/20/2010,"nevertheless, it's still not even remotely bad enough to need a nerf 'cause u said so yourself that it's not common enough when the large numbers of mining ships still exist. r the high sec belts deserted like low sec? no? ok then. htfu. ppl take these player-instilled risks for their added rewards ('cause face it, belt rats don't do anything). and the only ppl who cry about it on the forums r the ones who lost that gamble 'cause they got picked out of all the 20+ exhumers that were with them. u gamble, u lose, your loss, your fault. deal with it."
4/20/2010,"interesting vid. so basically they need new a.i. for missioning. different a.i.'s depending on level, rats, where it is (belt, plex, mission level), faction would be interesting."
4/20/2010,"huh? what are you smoking? sleepers still go after your drones even if your turrets are all on them. which means gallente, which rely heavily on drones, have just become the pvp and pve failures. putting current sleeper ai into missions makes using drones nearly impossible to tun missions in any efficient way.i'd personally rather you take away the aggressive option on drones than put sleeper ai in missions to control afk drone mission farmers.with that said, i do think missions would be better if they were made a little harder. just don't nerf gallente mission runners in the process"
4/20/2010,"we have done class 5s with domis and vexors in gang, without much of a problem."
4/20/2010,"well, they will have to, it's time to give pve a small facelift.no need to balance them, we are only making them smarter then my calculator, , there stats stay as they areif in low-level missions there is only one ship to shot- the player ship, the sleeper ai isn't going to do anything. we are talking about ai here, not making every frig in mission as tough as the sleeper battleships in wormholes, so canot see how it would do anything to new players. well, maybe ccp needs to fix the lag so we can actually pvp in this case, huh? no use of me jumping into a system, dying wihought loading grid and calling that pvp. i and you pick the csm, they are elected, they have to care about what i and you care. if that isn't the case, we will take extra care next time in electing those that do care. again, that does not mean ai become stronger, only smarter, meaning ninja salvagers get shot, remote reppers get shot, suiside gankers get shot, pirats get shot, you friends get shot, cannot see anything bad about that!we need to do something about ai vaporising drones, because the current situation is unacceptable. untill that is fixed, you cannot let the ai shoot drones, otherwise noone will ever run missions for gallente any more."
4/20/2010,"not supported. i would prefer time be spent on the fun aspects of this game (pvp). for me personally pve is something to do to pass the time and generate wealth.unless the proposal is to vastly change for the better the whole pve experience in eve, the change you propose will not make the game any more fun imo. just more annoying."
4/20/2010,"so you are against everything that doesnt directly benefit you? serious wtf? (and this would vastly improve the pve experience).btw i never got this sleepers instapopping drones. granted i have done only a handful of wormholes, and no high level ones, but there when a t1 ogre got agro and was 30km away it still made it back to the drone bay usually. the drone agro was really reasonable. now i am sure in some wormholes (harder ones?) the drone agro is much worse, but this only indicates that they can easily change the priority drones have for sleepers, which shouldnt be too high (but still it should sometimes happen, just within reasonable limits, no instapopping of drones, etc)."
4/20/2010,"a few things i have been thinking about warp bubbles - these are just lazy, ccp introduced hics and dictors , if we want people to play more and be more interactive then allowing people to camp gates, stations, and allow corps/alliance put a billion bubbles arond a station to keep the enemy camped in then go away to do something else isnt correct. if people want to do this then make them make the effort, you want to camp a gate then you must have a hic or dic, same with stations, etc, there has got to be a consequence, not just plant 10 warp bubbles say 90km from gates in systems and then just sit and wait cloaked etc, do this do it in the ship, you want to camp a station with 20 bubbles, you must make those people be in ships and make the time and effort to camp in people cloaks - again we have specialised ships for covert ops, why be able to put a cloak on any ship? you want to run around cloaked get a coverts op, you want to rat in 0.0 well thats the risk, learn to align and keep an eye out on local etc, you want to avoid gate camps, well tbh you aint going to do it in anything but a covert ops anyway - another lazy featurenos - neuts - again havent ccp intoduced ewar ships? or again specialised ships to do ewar, well dont allow any other ship to fit this stuffremote reppers - again havent ccp intoduced logistics ships? to do thisthis is a recurring theme, yes ok you get extra bonuses for using specific mods on the specialised ships, but there is no penalty for using them on other ships which i think there should be or dont allow them. thus this way we get more people using more kinds of ships for specific purposes, you want to rep then you have to have a logistics in your fleet not a groups of rr bs, bs should be for dps. we need to get people to make an effort and have consequences. i think at the moment about 50% of ships are hardly getting used, and thats possible the same for mods.cap - allowing pretty much every mod to be linked to cap is crazy, along comes a nos ship, takes you out completely, cant fire, cant tank, cant get away, cant do nothing! passive mods wont save you, just prolongs your inevitable death[*] moon gold - stop allowing alliances to again be lazy and make a mint from just moon mining the same moon forever, randomise moon gold on a monthly/quartley basis! make them work for it and go search for it. this will also help with pos wars! in fact may put an end to them yay!i have more but i think thats enough to discuss.."
4/20/2010,"just because there are specialized ships that excel at one job, doesnt mean you have to take the general availability of a module from the rest of the ships.you got a very weird idea of balancing."
4/20/2010,"that was one suggestion my friend, i did state however that perhaps a penalty could be invoked instead."
4/20/2010,"the bonus for one ship is basically the penalty for another ship. (if you view it from the maximum reachable output e.g. rep power/range)1. anchorable bubbles can be a strategic asset e.g. to secure other ships from people warping in2. cloaks. did you notice that cloaks come with various penalties, and that ships with cloak bonus get those penalties reduced/removed? scan res, sensor recalibration delay, speed under cloak. you will notice that all recons/covert ops/blackops got bonuses that reduce those penalties.3. if you look at the max nos/neut amount/range, the normal ships fitting those are pretty ""gimped"" compared to the recons. neut also penalizes your own cap. all in all i think neut is a very valuable ewar for larger ships to fight smaller ships4. remote reps ... 8.5k range (iirc) is a large remote rep without any bonuses. that means you are right in the middle of the action. you got to watch range all the time. they are also pretty cap hungry. compare that to the performance you can achieve with logistic cruisers. highly increased range and reduced cap usage.5. nos..... couldnt you really find something less important after the nos nerf?6. moon goo - those towers give people strategic objects they can fight over. if you hold them you can make your profit. if you want them, you can fight for it. did you take a look at what happens in the north atm?all in all ... from a view that covers all aspects of the game ... all your issues, seems to be balanced to me."
4/20/2010,"this is about ensuring people stop being lazy, make people at least make an effort and think, and also helps more ships and mods get used, hence helping the market. i dont think what im suggesting is inherently a bad thing..do you?"
4/20/2010,"so you basically want to make eve internet spaceships with an easy mode button? no customization, no free thinking, just ""hurf blurff durr hurr i fly ship gewd?""get out.also, come on, making a christmas tree around a gallente station with bubbles is entertaining!!"

4/20/2010,this post was recently locked on accident. it has now been restored.
4/20/2010,"since most afk cloakers are actually afk for a good portion of the time when they're in a solar system, most of their kills happen because ratters and miners get conditioned into thinking it's safe to make isk while hostiles are in local. the afk cloakers essentially create a pavlovian response among their victims, and the less astute ones ones don't align to celestials or don't tell their buddies when they're being attacked.thus, i propose that ccp manufacture a real-life brain implant available through your local surgeon or national healthcare service that would lobotomize the part of the brain responsible for pavlovian responses. this would keep people who don't know how to call for backup or align to celestials out of harm's way while there are akf cloakers in system.you can't patch stupid, but you can nerf it so that it has less negative effects on the players afflicted by it."

4/20/2010,"the problem currently with pos management in combat is the limited number of structures that can be controlled by a given gunner.gunnery commanders should be able to manage groups of structures, not just one here and one there.or they should be able to directly interface with the tower and control it as they would a ship, but limited to one target at a time.another thing i ran face on into when i was managing guns: if your ship lacks the range to lock a target you can't do anything about it (i had come to the pos in a freighter, with no other ship available to switch to, and could not lock anything even after assuming weapons control). luckily the hostile was merely probing the defenses and escaped with no followup thereafter."
4/20/2010,come on. it is really how you sound in this thread to be honest. i expected more from you.
4/20/2010,"yes for decent dps from a pos you need 5-6 pos gunners (if not more). hence everyone in our corp has to train for it. so we always get plenty gunners online. a single pos gunner controlling like 20 guns would be overpowered imho. your effort to defend your pos wouldnt really match up the work people would need to put into killing your tower.the targetting thingie sounds strange though. i saw plenty people pos gunning in frigates, and they were hitting 100+km easily. maybe report that as a bug."

4/20/2010,"communication and tranparancythe csm exists to represent the players to ccp, and relay information from ccp back to the players. in the first two terms on the csm, i have answered hundreds of emails from players, which resulted in many issue documents submitted to ccp. feedback from many players was listened to, regardless of corp or alliance the players belonged to. to establish a platform for players to provide feedback and discuss issues, take care was formed, which has held a seat on all the four csm councils, thanks to the work of erik finnegan and z0d. have issues or concerns? send me a mail and i'll do what i can.the second part is the transparancy issue. players often claim that issues vanish into a black hole after the csm submits them to ccp. for this purpose, i had set up my csm wiki, which was later adopted and integrated in the evelopedia. however, the evelopedia lacks a lot of features my original wiki had (categorizing per csm member, integrating ccps replies back into the issues, etc). when elected, i will do my best to organize and structure all this information so that players can easily see what the csm has been doing.in csm2 i have proposed a q&a session between the players and ccp. we have had a few of these towards the end of csm2, but the questions submitted weren't up to standards and neither were the answers. i'd like to see more communication between the players and the developers, by this or other means.other issuescsm as stakeholderswith the recent changes to the csm, the csm became stakeholders in ccp's scrum process. i plan to use this influence to deliver quality feedback during the development stage. one of my main complaints with the csm was that ccp did not make much use of the expertise of the csm during the development stages. under the new system, there will be much more communication between the csm and ccp, and it is here where i will shine. as game designer, i use exactly the same work methodologies as ccp does. both ccp and my fellow csm would benefit from my expertise in this field.no free tripsi believe ccp should stop giving the csm free fanfest tickets. it attracts the wrong type of people, gives wrong impressions of the csm, and csm do not need to be at fanfest as they do not need the roundtables to talk to ccp, can watch the videos, and have other means to poll player feedback. the csm is work, not a party!old stuffa lot of valid issues from the past csms currently hang in limbo, somewhere in ccp's backlog. i'd like to go over them, see if they are still valid, either remind ccp or scratch them off the list. this can be organized through the wiki, no need to waste ccps time resubmitting a hundred issues.past track recordtake care has held a seat in every csm to date. each of our representatives has raised numerous issues. a lot of game usability issues were raised, with issues such as the skill queue and import/export of overview settings making it in-game. since factional warfare issues were not raised by other csm, we specialized in this section, which is why you will notice many fw-related issues in the list. balance is important as well, hence the assault frigate, black ops and destroyer balance requests (unfortunately my request to look at hybrid tracking did not make it a year ago), and the request for drone implants and modules. we are a bit carebeary at heart though, thus you will also find requests for dynamic missions and concerns about suicide ganking."

4/20/2010,"faqq: how can you be independent, with your involvement with cva?a: i run as csm on personal title. i have had no influence or leadership role in cva, nor do i have any ambition for such a role. take care does not care for corp or alliance. in the past, i have consulted hundreds of players, from all kinds of corps, factions and alliances. even goons and aaa members have participated constructively in discussions. through cva i learned a great deal about eve's game mechanics outside my own area of interest. i will listen to all players and consider them equal, regardless of corp or alliance background.q: no personal agenda? you are a carebear and you want to kill suicide ganking, how about that?a: i believe my concern about suicide ganking is valid. i do not plan to turn high-sec into a 100% safe zone nor render suicide ganking completely impossible. however, the balance is currently way off, and suicide ganking is still too easy with too little consequence. and no, i have personally never been suicide-ganked. this issue does not affect me in any way.q: during your first two terms on the csm, you were sometimes rude towards ccp and other csma1: that's because they were either ignorant or good-for-nothing slacke.....a2: i've become older, and i had a crash-course in teamwork in my current position as game designer. i learned to be more diplomatic about my viewpoints and will contribute to the csm even better. that said, i will remain goal-orientated and present a critical viewpoint, and will try to move people forward and getting things done.q: aren't two terms on the csm enough for you?a: i am personally very sceptical to lifting the term limit, and was rather enjoying my vacation. however, the csm have now become official stakeholders. while i was on the csm, my influence was marginal. there are many open issues which i wish to resolve, and in the upcoming fierce competition, i stand the best chance of getting elected for take care.q: will there be another movie?a: it is currently in production.q: you just want to get a job with ccp and use the csm as a stepping-stone!a: i am very happy with my current job and do not seek a position with ccp at this time. thanks for the shiny medals and nice addition to my cv, though.q: i want to talk to you, but you are not online in eve!a: drop me an eve mail, if you want to speak face to face i can give you my msn. we're currently in crunch-time at work, which is why i'm not in eve much.by popular request:q: waaah waaah eva wants to kill all suicide ganking! a: my problem with suicide ganking is several fold. known criminals are hiding behind concord and thus are not at risk until they strike. the person getting ganked has little means to strike back. the costs for suicide ganking are still low thanks to the sponsorship from insurance. sec status hits are quite meaningless and overcome in a mere hours.there should be more ways for the victims to get their vengeance. i prefer player-driven systems for this over artificial games mechanics. tradable kill rights and bounty hunting would be a step in the right direction, putting law-enforcement in the hands of the players."

4/20/2010,"what do you say to the allegations that you used borderline exploits while part of the gallente militia to gain rank, lp and capture points for your faction?"
4/20/2010,"i support ankhesentapemkah in these elections and take up my role as advisor on trade and industrial matters. the take care platform has proven its worth, the past 4 csm."
4/20/2010,"i have been a supporter of take care from the beginning. they strive to do right by the little guy in eve and don't have any large alliance agendas to pursue. eva was a csm member before and did a great job, i know her out of game too and fully trust her to represent the people of eve."
4/20/2010,"grumpy much that you are not allowed to run for csm5 due to the stuff you pulled?i have reported all fw issues back to ccp and did not abuse any exploits, but reported them all instead. i have exactly zero loyalty points for the militias as capturing plexes does not yield lp. i did not abuse the mission exploit in any way, and thus didn't earn a single isk through fw. unlike the highly controversial methods used by some other fw players to achieve the same, my behaviour did not negatively impact the overall game experience.unfortunately, fw remains a heavily exploitable and bug-ridden environment, but i will do whatever i can to set that right."
4/20/2010,got a link to any such announcement?
4/20/2010,"u mad?i would call sitting cloaked in fw plexes to cap them and earn yourself rank and influence within the fw community a negative impact but i digress.i find the idea of take care laudable and found erik finnegan to be a very pleasant fellow, i've only talked with zod in game and he too seems to be a nice chap. you however do not...i take it that if offered you will not take up the offer of a free trip to fanfest and will pay your own way?also, thanks for biting"
4/20/2010,"i have never capped a plex while cloaked. not on ankh, and not on any alt. it is one of the exploits for which i was in direct contact with ccp to get it fixed, and kept mailing them about it for over 3 months.glad to hear the feeling's mutual, i don't think too highly of you either. depends on the circumstances, and the contribution of each individual csm towards the whole and whenether or not ccp needs me for a csm stage performance. i can't comment on it yet until i know the details, but i am considering putting my ticket up for a contest. but ccp might not allow that. thanks for the free bumps i thought it was public knowledge that lark isn't allowed to run again after he shamed the whole csm for his own pathetic selfish greed, and that he is lucky he isn't banned?"
4/20/2010,"i thought it was public knowledge that ccp stated he could run again in future. in fact here is the announcement in a dev blog.it is true lark wasn't allowed to run for csm4, because it was ""too soon"" but there was never a statement from ccp to state he couldn't run again.however you seem totally certain he isn't allowed to run for csm5. in the absence of any official ccp statement i and others will have to assume you are party to privileged information on this subject which you thought you would use to get one over lark on a public forum. isn't using privileged information inappropriately what got lark into trouble in the first place? sets the tone for your campaign"
4/20/2010,the tiggy shows his support!
4/20/2010,"i don't know anything more than you do. i must have mistaken the csm4 ban with a complete ban for the csm.not that i care, if you can run, all the better, as it would only split up the opposition's vote. we're certainly not fishing in the same pond."
4/20/2010,you can fish in my pond any day. woof!srs post. how do you see eve evolving over the next 12 months and how does that match up with your 'vision'. also how do you view suicide ganking as being 'unbalanced' especially after you pushed for the castration of the profession even after several nerfs over the years and as someone who has never been a victim or a victimiser how do you feel qualified to comment on the subject?
4/20/2010,free bump.hope you will make it into csm
4/20/2010,eva jobse i've not known her long *little under a year* and from our talks she knows a good few things about eve and what needes to change to help the common pilot.now goon fleet are no longer able to vote ***** i think its time we have some fresh blood amongst the csm members.i hope you get in and that when you do we get to see what you have in store for us all :-)
4/20/2010,"what i fear most is that tyrannis will introduce planetary interaction in a bugged and incomplete state, where people poke at it for a few weeks, before deciding it isn't worth their time, and pulling out disappointed. but not long afterwards, ccp will announce the next expansion, leaving planetary interaction in an unfinished, broken state for the years to come. that is what i think will happen if the csm doesn't intervene and ccp continues like a runaway train.i notice this mistake in my company as well. as mmo publisher you have the luxury to push content out of the door, and patch later. and producers will always choose for this option, instead of delaying. but there is more content planned, and often bugfixing gets a rather low priority, as the programmers are needed for key features in the next update...i want to change ccps attitude and make them deliver quality expansions. make sure tyrannis is finished and polished first. meanwhile, fix the most urgent bugs and exploits in factional warfare, and the lag issues currently plaguing many. then backtrack to the last expansion, dominion, and fix the 0.0 mechanics, so 0.0 is less about blobs and more about players actually living there.as major features in the next expansion, i'd love to see a full ui revamp, dynamically generated missions, and a factional warfare overhaul.since i do receive feedback from a lot of players, i do feel more than qualified to take a position in this matter. it doesn't bother me as much that people can gank, it is the fact that it is so easy, guarantees profit, and has no meaningful consequence. yes i tried to get feedback from the victimsers, but all i got was ""waaah you nerfed my easy income, i made 100 mil an hour ganking indiscriminately!"". threads like this don't help much either to get my sympathy.ccp would look into more permanent consequences for criminals, so far this hasn't happened. probably because everyone with a few destroyer alts can do it, and punishing too harshly will only result in character recycling. i must admit i am very fond of ultima online's justice system, where murderers could lose 20% of their stats and skills, and criminals tossed in jail for several hours or days. there are even games, where pk characters are deleted if they are caught within a certain time after the crime. now that is consequence. if you destroyed someone's hulk, setting him back 15 hours, then you shouldn't get off the hook by whacking rats for an hour. now as i said i don't see it practical to implement an uo-style system into eve, but things should be brought more into balance, and there should be more long-term consequence to crime."
4/20/2010,"the csm is two years old now. how have you prevented them from doing this so far. are, to name the most egregious example, poses fixed yet?the suicide part is easy. the gank, less so. i've been hit by 3 suicide gankers over the years. only one actually killed me, and that was because i tarded out(got called afk while flying a covops to jita, stuck it on autopilot, woke up in station). my corpmates have similar histories. as for making 100 mil an hour, i don't believe that for a second.""i am shocked, shocked, to find that max/minning is going on in hre!"" ""your maxed-out fw standings, madam"" ""oh, thank you very much""you want players banned for piracy? how about we make gross stupidity a bannable offense instead? that seems much more in keeping with how eve should work."
4/20/2010,"i've raised issues concerning the unfinished content they pushed out of the door, eventually cumulating in an overall issue regarding unfinished expansions. unfortunately, ccp did not listen, nor did they listen to the other csm. i wasn't the only person saying these things.in the past, all we could do is raise issues, which ccp ""adds to the backlog"" and we never hear from most of them again. with the csm being a stakeholder in the scrum process, i believe the csm finally gets the influence it needs to change things at a fundamental level.the guy sounded pretty believable, although it is hard for me to get exact numbers.and your comment is relevant, how?i said not once, but twice that i don't want to see this in eve. i included my text so you can read again."
4/20/2010,i'm sold. you have my vote. this is the best 'running announcement' i've heard yet.the worst however remains very contested.
4/20/2010,"seems pretty easy to get exact numbers, really. just give it a shot. make a few mil(or a few hundred mil, if the guy's right), and learn something about the profession you'd like to see neutered. it's not like you don't have the sec status to burn. also, i should clarify. i don't doubt that there was one hour-long period of time where the dude made 100 mil. it probably happens semi-frequently. the part i doubt is that he makes 100 mil an hour in the same sense that a paladin pilot makes 40 mil an hour. the income has high peaks, but it's not at all reliable. people, hardcore gamers especially, tend to be heavy optimizers. they figure out what they want to do, and then they figure out how to wrap the game mechanics around their little finger to let them do it as effectively as they can. in one context, you're a master of this - what is it, three factions you hit maxed fw standings with before you quit? in another context, you find it appalling and abusive. same action, different ends, and you choose to spit on it when those ends aren't ones you like. a bit of inspector renault seemed appropriate there. so okay, not that solution literally. you just referenced it approvingly, and said that eve needs to move more towards a system like that. you'll pardon me for not being enthusiastic about such sentiments among someone who wants to be my elected representative. your mental model of what eve is simply does not match my own. this is not reality, and as such it doesn't need to conform to the behavioural norms of reality. theft, assault and murder are commonplace here, and that is entirely intentional. you're trying to ensure fair sentencing for criminals, i'm trying to ensure good gameplay. yes, attacking someone and taking their stuff is mean, and it costs them more than it gains you. where would the fun be otherwise? if i wanted protection from this stuff, i'd go play a well-designed mmo. i choose to embrace it, and so i play eve. what's your excuse?"
4/20/2010,"why do i want to serve as a csm delegate? its simple: because i love eve online and want to be an active contributor to its evolution. free trips to iceland are a great perk but even without them i would still seek a csm seat. who do i represent? during my 3+ years in eve i have triedin addition to the low sec piracy for which i am best knownexploration, wormhole living, pos anchoring and maintenance, corp and alliance management, invention, manufacturing, mining (srs!), trade, missions, combat plexes, heists, scams, suicide ganking, high sec war decs and (more recently) mercenary work and sov-related null sec activities. this diverse experience combined with a lively in-game social network that regularly discusses and debates game mechanics, tactics, and play styles has allowed me to be view eve through a wide angle lens. so--even though i focus on pvp and piracy in-game, i am well-positioned to represent a broad spectrum of players.what changes or issues will i champion? you, my fellow players, will ultimately determine--through posting and support of assembly hall proposals and discussion in other public venues--which ideas gain traction and get my support. that said, changes which i personally intend to pursue are:low sec content for outlaws and changes that reflect low sec's outlaw nature and will create a more vibrant, compelling environment for all who live and operate thereoutlaw or not. the ""outlaw expansion"" proposal, lana torrin's bounty system, the ""corruption expansion"" from eve-vegas, and liang nuren's observations about low sec are rich with fantastic ideas for doing this.ui improvements to streamline routine tasks and tweak needlessly cumbersome design. i will request a session at one of the iceland summits to discuss planned ui changes, learn where they are in the backlog, and push for sharing a ""backlog summary snapshot"" with the player base on a regular basis.continued balancing of logistics and e-war, particularly harsher consequences for remote-repping neutrals and more diverse options for countering ecm.discouraging blob tactics by removing some of their advantages--perhaps by subjecting fleets over a certain size to ""stacking penalties"" tied to the ship types in each wing/squad.more timely communication from ccp, particularly in response to en masse negative reactions from players to dev blogs, game changes, and game-related events. i believe the csm should be tasked with a more active role in assisting with this and will push for discussion with ccp about it.what else do i bring to the party? done right, the csm job takes time and effort. i am committed to doing that job well. my real life work experience in training development, software design and programming, project management, and technical communications will contribute to my ability to do so. i understand business processes, communicate well, and am able to work effectively as a team player to achieve specific objectives. i can calmly defend my own opinions during ""enthusiastic"" discussions while remaining open to the opinions and ideas of others. i favor finding creative workarounds to problems rather than whining about perceived obstacles.give me your vote! i will do my best to represent our shared interests to help make eve online the best game it can be.more info: life in low sec"
4/20/2010,that's all you need dear. mammaries aside i think mynxee is one of the better 'new' candidates on the block. given the amount of poking and prodding she's given me about the process and procedures she certainly seems keen to give it a good shot.
4/20/2010,"i suspect the csm5 candidates roster will have heretofore unseen levels of mammary representation, so that particular differentiator has probably lost any advantage it may previously have had. i likely couldn't even compete in size, either guess i'll have to fall back on the use of actual brainpower.  for your supportive comments."
4/20/2010,you have my votelosec need a good looking at.
4/20/2010,"i hope to have you as collegue on csm5, and support your efforts to revitalize low-sec!"

4/20/2010,"i think one of my votes will head your way, it's about time lowsec get some attention."
4/20/2010,"while i dont engage in lowsec myself, i will be the first to admit it needs a good kick in the pants. also your other credentials seem quite good (computer/software experience, commitment to the game and it's community, etc) . you have my vote so far."
4/20/2010,you have my vote!
4/20/2010,"love your blog and your attitude toward things, good luck!"

4/20/2010,why would you link such a ****ty proposal for changes on info links when there have been several others that received far more attention and thumbs up?
4/20/2010,"there are many proposals that i supported but didn't make it into a csm meeting yet, i could hardly list all of those :)"
4/20/2010,"although i don't know sokrats personally i do know him from csm4, and i could count on him voting as i would have if i'd been a real csm and not a lowly reserve. even when the topic wasn't within the scope of his experience he was open to discussion and research before making an intelligent decision. one of my votes belongs to him.-t'amber"
4/20/2010,i'm glad to hear you are aiming for one more term.
4/20/2010,im a gimp.
4/20/2010,"**** em if they can't take a joke. ccp's done a lot of silly things over the years, and a lot i poke fun at, but that's the only one that they really ought to be truly ashamed of."
4/20/2010,"mazziliu, with dominion one of ccp's strategies was to try and get more people into 0.0, people who wheren't directly affiliated with the great powerblocks would have been able to find a place there. do you feel this strategy is a valid one, or would you prefer to see ccp take 0.0 in a different direction? and what do you feel they can do to get more people who currently stay in empire, to go to 0.0 instead?"
4/20/2010,"after having some chances to play with the post-dominion sovereignty mechanics, what is your opinion of them? do you believe that they still need work going forward, and if so, what direction do you believe that ccp should go with future improvements to the system? best of luck on your campaign."
4/20/2010,"i love your 'win a plex promotion' idea. although i wonder what you will do to make sure the whole playerbase knows about this contest, as the people that come to this section of the forum are usually allready politically active."
4/20/2010,then people would just make three small fleets rather than a large one so it wouldn't solve anything.and as soon as you start putting limits on people per system it becomes a race of whoever gets there first.
4/20/2010,"and how about smaller disadvantages like your signature radius going up depending on how many ships per square kilometer on the battlefield there are?even if you spread out during an engagement, when you warp in you should be relatively tightly packed with your blob. this does give an advantage to the blob that got there first, but they allready have an advantage by not being the one who has to load a new environment as they warp in, slowing down their pcs for a few seconds.if the engagement has to spread out, it effectively becomes multiple smaller engagements, as the other ships in the blob will be mostly out of range to be effective, unless you have a sniper gang, which brings weaknesses of their own."
4/20/2010,how about people just accept safety by numbers is human nature and will always exist so stop thinking up dumb ideas to try and delude yourself from it?
4/20/2010,"i think you are misunderstanding my point. my point is, that a lot of ship bonuses only matter in small scale combat. currently with this 'safety in numbers' tactic, the deciding factor on what ship to fly is based on effective hit points mostly.but hell, the only combat you seem to have experienced was in rancer, losing your shuttle and pod. no wait... could this be... could this be an alt of yours your posting with?"
4/20/2010,heres a question to the people who are complaining about large powerblocs and why they are evil and shouldn't exist...what do you think should be in its place and why do you think your idea should be more valid than others?
4/20/2010,wait i lost a pod and a shuttle in rancer? i dont even remeber that my poor k/d ratio
4/20/2010,"this is so blindingly obvious it shouldn't need restating:large powerblocs = boring. eve and especially 0.0 has the potential to be very dynamic but large entities effectively prevent smaller ones from competing even on a minor level by just throwing everything they have at them, crashing the node and ruining the game experience for everyone before returning to their belts and plexes. it would be a good thing if these large entities were somehow replaced by multiple smaller ones, who could align with and against each other more dynamically than is currently the case.there are many smaller entities who have to varying degrees of success (depending also on how you define that) competed in 0.0 in the past but 'the blob' is always strong against them.i guess in the end its a problem of player mentality. there are too many goddamn bears in 0.0 who would rather mine/rat/stationspin til they die of boredom before fitting a pvp ship."
4/20/2010,oh dont get me wrong i think 0.0 is far too static and it would be nice to see alot more 'emergence'. the difference between my thinking and the idealists preaching 0.0 being goodfights till the sun goes down is that with the way eve is structured on a barebones level there is no way to accomodate the idealists way of thinking.the way people are going off in this thread it sounds more as if people want an 'arena' type of combat while still having an effect on the eve map. am i right or not? or do people want 0.0 to be filled with unorganized carebears that come to fleets with ravens which they can roam and gank easily without risking the backlash of being blobbed to death by a larger alliance?
4/20/2010,"i fully agree that while it is a great ideal, implementing it fairly is extremely difficult, and many hours were wasted discussing this at ccp's in iceland. planetary interaction is one of the things aimed at making 0.0 more dynamic, profitable and vulnerable at the same time, and i really hope it works out."
4/20/2010,"i'm not against the existance of powerblocks. but it does bother me that they have a tendency to overrule the existance of everything else in 0.0if powerblocks didn't occupy all of it, which i believe was the idea behind the introduction of upgrading 0.0 space, then there would be more space for other things to emerge in. but if i look at the eve map it doesn't appear to have worked quite as effectively as i would have liked.i suppose it might be possible to simply make so many 0.0 starsystems that there aren't enough players in eve to occupy them all effectively, but that might create issues with server costs and such. i'm no it expert, so i don't really know.another thing i thought might be usefull is if the starsystem upgrade was ballanced in such a way that it is more profitable to have one super-upgraded system than many less upgraded systems. this in combination with a tax for moving fleets through unclaimed systems might mean that fleets won't patrol a too large bufferzone around their super upgraded system."
4/20/2010,"i had the idea about slowing the movement of capitals around which got mostly rage reviews but i still think there should be something to slow down the insanely rapid movement of the biggest ships in the game to be more logical considering what they do.others argued that the blob would just bring a battleship fleet instead of the capitals and it would solve nothing. i for one would rather fight a blob of battleships than a blob of capitals.i agree that there are an insane amount of bears in 0.0 that would rather stay docked and play spin the ship rather than deal with a roaming gang in their territory. this is simply because that roaming gang can't do anything of any worth to their home that would affect the bears.the station services could be attacked but that would require bring a massive force, only for it to be repaired in a few minutes when they leave, so it would just be a waste of time and ammo.the only damaging thing you are doing is keeping them from ratting/mining. they would rather lose out on some ratting time and play the waiting game till you leave or till they have enough to blob you out so they don't lose any ships.besides doing something that requires you to bring a blob, what could a smaller force do that is not simply neutralized by just warping to a pos, cloaking, docking up, logging off?"
4/20/2010,slowing down capital movements in a reasonable way might have some interesting consequences. the matter of station services was discussed in iceland and the idea to greatly reduce their hit points so they can more easily be destroyed and repped was met with approval from ccp.
4/20/2010,"if you were given the task of implementing this, how would you go about it?did they say when they would implement this?"
4/20/2010,"there will always be power blocks. people group together, safety in numbers and all that jazz.right now there's very little that a 'small gang' (or even a medium sized one) can do in a hostile region apart from kill some ratters and keep people docked up for a while. doesn't really affect anyone even in the short term.destructable station services were supposed to give 'small gangs' more objectives, however anyone who's shot station services will tell you that you need considerably more than a 'small gang' to knock out station services if you want to move on to the next system by tomorrow.i'd like to see the hp values of things like station services and certain infrastructure mods (cyno gens, jump bridges, scanning arrays, perhaps even individual targetable mods on ihubs) massively reduced but give them decent resists so your 'small gang' of say a dozen hacs can cruise through spend half an hour brassing up your station and move on but it only takes a single logi a few minutes to rep them back up, add in a cooldown period of some sort before the service can be used again and it causes a bit more grief and damage to the holders, might even promote a bit more 'active defence' as opposed to docking up and letting the bad guys pass through.saying that there are still plenty of 'small gang' :goodfights: to be had in 0.0, it's not all blobs and lag. i'd just like more to do when there aren't targets to shoot or the sov holders are unwilling to come out and play."
4/20/2010,whoever makes this their main goal and other small scale pvp related things where ehp of the ship you fly is not the most important part gets all my votes.
4/20/2010,"someone suggested in the assembly hall that ratting and mining index contribute to the general system index. so if they drop, the security index drops aswell and you might loose your cyno jammer or your jump bridge. that way disrupting the carebearing would have a meaning and it would also lead to people fighting people in their systems. maybe that could be a way to go?"
4/20/2010,"frankly i have no idea at this time, reducing the jump range by any decent % would make certain areas of space all but inaccessible. cost could be a factor - if jumping a cap one jump would cost 10 mil on average, people would think twice before derping all over the place.soon(tm) :("
4/20/2010,"i don't think direct isk to jump would be a good idea. that what the isotopes represent as well. i am more interested in the whole 'derping all over the place' part. moving capitals should have more strategy involved and such than it currently does.the fact is, capitals are the fastest ships in the game for traveling across the universe. seems backwards don't you think?"
4/20/2010,what i meant with the isk was an increase in fuel use ;)and yes it's rather unnerving how easily one can cross dozens of lightyears in the blink of an eye with the biggest of the biggest

4/21/2010,"have just skimmed through the thread but im sure many must have pointed out that in many sniper situations, what one really want is to dish out as much damage as possible the first seconds, ie alpha.looking at this schematically, you have a weapon system that deals 6000 units of damage every 18 seconds (artillery). another weapon that deals 3000 uod every 9 seconds (beam lasers), and finally a weapon that deals 2000 uod every 6 second (rails). hence, all weapons have equal dps.now you're in sniper fleet and a target (targets) of opportunity present itself where you have a window of w seconds from first shot to keep pounding the target(s). comparing each system to artillery damage which i normalize at 100%:if w < 6seconds:rail dish out 33% of artillery-damage to that target and beams deals 50% of artillery-damage. if 6s < w < 9s; rails 66%, beams 50%9s < w < 12s; rails 66%, beams 100%12s < w < 18s; rails 100%, beams 100%18s < w < 21s; rails 66%, beams 75%so while dps is equal, a fleet armed with artillery have a huge advantage in this type of short engagements which are fairly common. in fleet battles that last longer, this effect have less of an impact of course. still, artillery is the sniper weapon of choice reference:nuren., liang, goumindong, 2009, the great projectile debate"
4/21/2010,"i would not go that far. both in that high volley damage allows you to tactically limit the engagement time frame, and in that more constant dps can be more easily avoided. it is certainly can be a disadvantage in a theoretical clean and even fight until all ships are dead if its too high(there is an advantage in that extra volley damage allows you to kill ships faster all other things being equal, there is a disadvantage in wasted volley damage, there should then be some theoretical efficient volley strength)both the ehp of the ship and the volley damage matter. since you have to volley through a targets ehp. ironically, if the mael then (the best artillery ship) has very good volley damage, the rokh is uniquely suited to be strong against it, since it has high ehp, its all in shields, and the rokh easily out-ranges the mael.(rokh has nearly 154k ehp against tremor, mael has 66k vs spike, mael will be in deep falloff by the time the rokh has any damage lost)"
4/21/2010,"that is the problem with your post - even theoretically they don't. top it off with fixed damage types (em/thm, kin/thm, exp/kin) and that certain weapons systems may be well into falloff and you begin to see an entirely different picture.otherwise, yes, of course a weapon with high alpha and the same dps would be advantaged as long as the fight goes on and they aren't overstriking too badly.-lianged: none of this is new. goum and i went round and round over this during the great projectile debates."
4/21/2010,"the purpose of my post was not to infer that those weapons are equal in dps but simply to illustrate that, given equal dps, high alpha have a huge advantage in this type of short engagement.and i knew this isn't anything new though i never took part in the great projectile debate. i edited a reference"
4/21/2010,"ahh, the heady days of the great projectile debates. remember when i said that tracking enhancers getting falloff wouldn't be a good idea since it would be another low slot damage module for the majority of autocannons and how wrong i was proven (/fits te's on everything shield tanked)"
4/21/2010,"it is necessary for them to be on tcs and tes. as it stood, even unbonused tds could superbly **** over falloff bonused ships - and the penalties of falloff made it even worse. the really amusing thing is that you seem to think that they're somehow the equal of ships operating in optimal. ;-)the te change by itself isn't what what makes or breaks minmatar these days. the purification of damage types combined with the higher damage ammo tiers is what really makes it powerful.-lianged: that isn't to say that tes aren't really nice - they are. but they're not even close to the biggest thing that brought minmatar up to amarr standards."
4/21/2010,a discussion for another thread perhaps. no need to derail this one.
4/21/2010,"it is slots (dronebays including) combined with extra fittings.abaddon's got 'the best' set of bonuses you can ever think of - resistances plus damage. it has 8 guns, but in no way it is imbalanced in comparison to geddon.i wouldn't care all that much about harbinger, should it have 4 lows or 3 meds/5 lows. instead for some weirdest reason there are 6. as tech1 ships have always been basically free and it doesn't matter whether the hull is 20 or 40 mil isk, the huge increase in perfomance comes at absolutely no cost. imagine battleships being done that way, - abaddon then easily could have 2 extra meds"
4/21/2010,"tier 2 bcs are fine.as for the ""they do xyz on the cheap"", nerfing them would do nothing for field cs. why would i still fly a field cs over a hac (more mobility, equal midslot/lowslot count*, less dps/ehp though) or, eg. shield tempest (cheaper by miles and miles, almost as mobile, generally speaking more dps and ehp, heavy neuts, etcetera). a tier 1 bs will dominate a cs about every time, and in most cases without breaking a sweat (eg. failstarte).*which is probably the best argument for giving field cs a extra low/mid - they share mid/low slot amount with the ship half class down. tiers on all sub-bs ships are broken, really. the stabber is inferior in about every way bar speed to the rupture. the breacher/slasher is inferior in every way to the rifter. etcetera."

4/21/2010,"thanks for the response.i see your point, and it is a valid one. however, making it a hostile act will reduce drastically the problem we have. its about the closest we can get without making it a full-on exploit. and on the exploit note, neut rr is already being exploited far worse than the scenario you brought up.explaining it that way you've made it easier for me to figure a work-around, though there are some problems. first off, any in corp (and hopefully alliance) will work just as if you shot a corp mate. you can't dock or jump, but there's no concord aggression. with your point of the possible exploit of dropping cans, there is a trickier, but possible solution. it doesn't drastically change the mechanics as you said, however.we know that without any work done, if i flip your can, you shot 1 shot at me, i will now be able to rr you. that would need to be fixed. explaining the fix is simple. remote armor/shield/cap and any other ""positive"" mods would not work the same as ""negative"" mods like guns, jams or points. positive mods would be freely independent of the aggro timer, therefore it would remain that you can only rr corp/aliiance or fw navy members without aggression. it would take some time for the coders to work in, but all in all not too difficult, because you're not changing aggro as a whole.and yes, this poses an inconvenience for low-sec coalitions. as i've stated before, maybe it will start enable the ""super-alliance"" idea. and all in all, the only time it would be a problem is if there is no gcc to pass out, but sometimes to fix a major problem, you have to sacrifice some smaller perks with the current system.your opinion is your opinion, because this is a discussion. reading what you have said points out that you're using the problem to your advantage. are you abusing it like some? i don't think so, and if all you're using it for is trying to pull aggro, thats not bad on your character. one of two things happens in those instances, though. either the rrer leaves when they can't pull aggro, or continues to rep one side, making it an unfair advantage. either the losing side will die, get away just before death, or aggro you, and die regardless. you're obviously taking a coin toss, because i'm sure more often than not, they don't aggro you. so, if you're trying to pull random aggro, and you're not making it an unfair advantage, maybe a aggro can would have the same luck"
4/21/2010,"i just don't think making people get concorded for remote repairing is a good idea. the problem isn't as bad as you make it out to be to begin with. logistics cruisers are easily countered with a couple sensor damps, and logistics fit battleships can be bumped out of rep range easily by a nano-battleship. i myself have used such tactics as well as just overwhelming firepower to defeat people who called in neutral remote assistance. and that is just me and my alt accounts not even relying on outside help from corp-mates or friends. with good help its not that hard to defeat them. if they bring friends and you don't, and if they use unconventional tactics and you don't, then you should expect to be defeated. that said i still think it would be a good idea to make a pilot unable to dock for 60 seconds after using any type of remote assistance. its just that most people are making this neutral-rr issue sound much larger than it is, and a lot of the proposals (like yours) will only create larger problems."
4/21/2010,"well, you have the right to your own opinion. i honestly feel that i'm not making it bigger than it is. after have witnessing multi-chain neutral rr in dodixie and jita, with 5-15 chanied guardians, its not easy at all to kill, especially for most highsec corps at war. most high-sec wars are 20 on 20 or less, so you have to deal with your enemy, and 5 guardians or more (i have seen a 15 man chain,) so there is no way to defend it. if you sacrifice your ships or slots to combat the rr, you're vunerable to the war targets. and as i've pointed out, even if you engage the rr, its hard to kill with all the other rr ships on the one being engaged. i've also seen a player solo combat 2 neut rr, but in practice, especially in wars, its slim to none to successfully defend against.and with the logic you and others have helped me come up with, i don't see any problems, they're more minor inconveniences."

4/21/2010,just to be clear: your solution involves anyone rring someone in another corp getting concorded? wtf? -liang
4/21/2010,"i fully and unequivocally espouse the stance that neutral rr should pull concord aggression. the utilization of neutral rr only displays the fact that those who partake are cowards and cannot engage in a battle under their own accord. in a sense, it is very similar to a child who will not jump into water without some sort of flotation device for assistance. it exasperates me even further when the corp/alliance employing the neutral rr is in fact the one who declared war in the first place. therefore i believe that harold pitts is correct in stating that the issue of neutral rr needs to be fixed and that fix needs to be that neutral rr pulls aggro from concord. thank you.love,lord sphinctanus rectanus of mianus, ctp.s.""ut sitius ut a snow drift"" is not proper latin, and you should never get that phrase tattooed on your left shoulder because it will make no sense."
4/21/2010,"um there seems to be an easier way for this to work, making rr an aggressing act would screw up everything, it is not an aggressive act in reality, when fighting with logistics in gang most logistics pilots take great care to not get aggression, ie not mounting a gun or only using logistics drones, this means they never have an aggression timer and can jump through gates if primaried etc, this is a valid tactic and should not be changed.the downside of this is that idiots in hisec use this to their advantage, using neutral out of corp reppers.the way to fix this is to only allow logistics to rep someone if they are in the same fleet and if in fleet they have the same tags as the fleet, ie flash red to the other fleet as the wt's do already, so when logistics appear on field they are targetable from the go.although maybe this idea needs a bit more fleshing out i believe it has merit."
4/21/2010,"this sounds good, until you read up on something called the lofty scam, or something similar to that. unfortunately in the end it will cause more problems than it will solve.lofty scamalso, the op is an idiot."
4/21/2010,"yes, unless they're in your alliance (which needs work) or in your ""super-alliance,"" a proposed idea.its a major battle changer in war and pvp in general, similar to jamming and full out shooting. the only difference, as i like to put it, its a ""positive"" effect (it aids one side, therefore hurting the other) and not a ""negative"" effect (which hurts the other side, therefore aiding the other.) some people see the problem, some people don't see it as a problem. however it seems the majority of the ones against it are using it to their own or their ""allies"" advantage. i can't judge you, but i'd say about 70% of the people against it are the ones using and usually abusing it."
4/21/2010,*snip* well that wasn't very nice. shadow. . not supported. fly safe.-lianged: and for the record i have in fact been in a highsec wardec corp and we encountered one usage of this - and we utterly crushed their ass for it.
4/21/2010,"thank you for your input. i can respect that, although i don't appreciate the personal attacks, but this is an open discussion."
4/21/2010,hey come on now your forgetting the most useless ship of them all! (and most ugly) the osprey! unless your a miner....
4/21/2010,"i understand what you are saying, but i was really wanting to focus on a t2 ship that would be more easily changed than try for some massive broad stroke on all kinds of ship bonus changes.if they only have to worry about balancing one ship then the chance of it happening is much higher than say, 10 ships or something.we need more love from drone users in this thread people. where is the support?"
4/21/2010,leave the bellicose. need that to kill dramiels lol. :)
4/21/2010,would approve again.
4/21/2010,"either trade the bonus for some other useful bonus (resist/rep/drone mwd speed/drone tracking/etc) or give it the fittings to do something with those turret slots. also, 4 turrets not 3.-liang"
4/21/2010,the 4th bonus is pretty much wish full thinking ... an ishtar can already sport 600 dps from drones and guns (light tank though)it doesnt need more. other hacs barely scratch the 450 dps the ishtar gets from drones alone.
4/21/2010,"*scratches head* thats what i get for posting with a hangover i guess.in any case, the gun bonus can prove its utility in certain cases particularly when you want to up the ganky-ness of the ishtar. the problem is that you are unlikely to use rails and will lean towards blasters which have their own set of problems. in all seriousness, the mwd bonus sounds nice in theory however it seems marginalized by the fact that once drones are on target, it goes unused. it would be interesting to see how often the drones need to pulse their mwds in pvp to keep up with an equivalent ship, such as a vagabond. if the ishtar can get berzerker iis to do proportionate damage to the vaga, then you have a useful bonus."
4/21/2010,"i mean no offence, but please post your non-fail ishtar fit that utilizes the +5% to medium hybrids."
4/21/2010,a gank ishtar with electron blasters and 800mm plate?:prelies on rr though. the less dps fit with 1600mm plate and dual light pulse.i left out the remaining drones. 631 dps. sounds respectable no?:)
4/21/2010,"yes, i always like comparing pure gank ishtars that get one volleyed by ac hurricanes to all the other hacs in pure tank configuration. -lianged: seeing your ishtar fit that uses the 5% hybrid bonus: it's a fail fit. first, electron blasters are pure utter fail because of low damage combined with incredibly low range and insufficient tracking for that range. second, it's armor tanked - which totally invalidates any purpose you might have in using an ishtar for this."
4/21/2010,even with dual light pulse lasers the ishtar has 540 dps. and 450 dps without any extra turret. mind to share e.g. a cerb fit that gets anywhere near that? best i could get was about 440 dps with scourge fury and 3 bcs. did you notice i said ... it relies on rr ... and people use armor tanked ishtars with rr a lot. dont tell me you still live in the pre qr time with shield extenders and nano.
4/21/2010,"now please show me a cerb who`s dmg can be killed by the other ships like the heavy drones, and then realize that heavys arent always the best since you will be attacking smaller ships...cerb or zealot or any of the others can hit them.your comparisons between things suck darius...im sorry but instead of comparing apples to apples you are always like apples to the banana boat"
4/21/2010,cerbs damage can be destroyed by enough smart bombing. (yeah for missiles dying to smart bombs)you can tracking disrupt the zealot.oh and yes drone users are really penalized by the fact that they can choose the correctly sized drones for a target. i feel sorry for you!
4/21/2010,"yes, and drones are destroyed by smartbombs and guns.or you can damp it or jam it or disrupt it or just volley it.yes, because missiles have such trouble dealing damage and only drone ships have a drone bay. -liang"
4/21/2010,too awesome
4/21/2010,this is why this is a awesome idea.
4/21/2010,"the idea has merit.... not sure about a window....would be good to be able to define the limits of the box, to control when it takes a new line.currently it's possible for targets to get hidden under the cap dial depending on positioning and how many targets are locked.being able to define the width/height of this area would allow you to keep targets away from cap dial and other ui.as far as moving it, my guess is 0.02% of eve know that lil tiny invisible crosshair exists."
4/21/2010,yeah you can also make your targets line up vertical which i find far superior.so not supported as it seems the op had no idea on the customisation possibilities.
4/21/2010,how about having the option to remove the pictures and only have text based information such as ship type and % readout on shield and armor and structure intestead of the red/gray bars.would decrease the amount of area the targeting information takes up.
4/21/2010,"unless you're told, or extremely lucky you'd never guess it was there, or was important in anyway. why cant ccp just do an expansion that cleans up their crappy ui? i'd even pay for that."

4/21/2010,ive seen and dealt with ccp on a nomerous occasions and tbh there is a big lack of communication from there part in what is going on with cases.the problems ive seen so far is the lack of information one gets from ccp regarding banned accounts for example.recently a friend of mine bought a char and played with it for a week and following day he gets a mail from ccp in his mail account that he has registered with saying that his account is banned permanantly and the funny part is the subject of the mail was suspended.now 3 days after they are accusing him of hacking this chars real account transfered his 13 billion to that account and then proceeded to transfer the char with a visa card that isnt even registered on him.id like to see if its regarding banned account or real money issues that the person in question gets a personal(generated) email that the person can actually feel that he or she has a line of communication.today u get a mail saying that u are banend and no reason why nor any person to contact.they tell you to post a petition on the webpage but since u dont have a account anymore u cant track it properly.i feel this is something very important since people spend real money to pay for their accounts and then have it removed cause ccp finds that the easiest way.i know they have a long investigation time for such issues but thats even more important to maintain contact and informing people whats going on.
4/21/2010,"everyone, who was in dominion fleet fights, have seen that fleet, which jumps in, is in disadvantageous position. i think it would help, if post jump cloak timer was dynamic. make it twice as long, or even more, if large fleet jump occurs. maybe it should be dependant on traffic control. if traffic control kicks in, extend cloak for those who are jumping and those who jumped in few seconds ago. this change would even the odds and maybe we will see more fights, because now smart fleet commanders avoid to jump in to the system with enemy fleet present on the gate. i don't blame them. it's so easy to lose your entire fleet, while everyone is just loading."

4/21/2010,"lol wut? ever heard of hulkaggedon? whenever there is a coordinated effort to go out and kill exhumers it is always successful and easy. why? exhumers are easy targets. are you kidding? half of the problem is over supply from mission runners. mission runners and drone regions provide more then half of the mineral supply in the market! less so for the low ends, almost 70-80% for the high ends. why do you think nobody mines in lowsec? because all the mins you find in lowsec ores are provided by missioners! do you live under a rock or something? macro missioning is incredibly prevailant. programs are out there that run missions for people. there are plenty of threads about macro missioning. and that same afk missioning floods the market with reprocessed loot and ruins the profession of mining. and, lol missions take effort? lololol if anything, lvl4s require less effort then mining! all you need to do is get a permatanked raven or dominix, get aggro, go afk, and let automated machines like drones or fofs to do the work for you.at least in mining you have to check every 4 minutes to move the ore to the can.you're an idiot."
4/21/2010,"and how often does this happen? once a year? u're crying about a yearly event that's posted on the forums well in advance and u're too damn stupid to listen? lol is right. lmfao wow--no one mines in low sec because it is too unsafe. that's why there r thousands of exhumers cramping up high sec belts, namely 0.5 systems. look around u, moron. idk where u even get your info but u might do better by not talking out of your ass. 1. again, lmfao. link me some of those threads then. go ahead.2. right because all that reprocessed loot will outmine a hulk. that's why there r still thousands of exhumers infesting the belts instead of ""macro missioning"" it up. 3. let's see--what's easier to macro? click and drag to a jetcan every few minutes or aggro every single reinforcement wave, recall drones to drop their aggro then target since even aggressive drones don't aggro after all the rats r already shooting and to top it all off, fit enough of a tank to survive the entire pocket's aggro long enough for the drones to slowboat their way to every target? do u even know how fofs work? no u don't 'cause u don't know wtf u're talking about. and lmfao what a baby to be crying about clicking and dragging every few minutes...seriously...4. try not talking out of your ass before u call someone else an idiot. seriously, u got anything that's even remotely convincing 'cause u're lucky i can't sig your entire post."
4/21/2010,"what? when did i say im against everything that dosent directly benifit me?right , changing the ai of rats to sleeper ai dosent change the nature of the pve experience, just the difficulty of the rats. what you have to do in said mission dosent change, you will still be saving the same boring damsel in distress yadda yadda. so it will be the same crappy mission script with harder drones. why would i want that change? like i have told you personally i like pvp. why would i want a change that would make the way i make income in game to do pvp harder and more time consuming than it allready is?"
4/21/2010,"you really implied that with your post.it does change it.it doesnt (necesarily) change it.if the goal was just making the missions harder you can also double the dps dealt by each npc ship.'because npcs that do more than orbit and shoot would be nice.and why would that be the case? the idea is giving all npcs sleeper ai so they arent as completely mindless as they are now. apparently you prefer afk mission running, since that is the only reason i can see why you prefer the ai in the current state. but pve is an integral part of eve, and it shouldnt be a stupid grind it is with normal ai. so sleeper ai would make it way more fun and some other stuff more balanced. nowhere it is said we should make them the equivalent of class 6 wormhole sleepers."
4/21/2010,"this change, if implemeted, will make drone ships essentially useless.to clarify (and for that hyperactive commenter that seems to be posting in every topic): you can't recall drones when they have addro, because you dont know when they have aggro.you only know when they receive damage, and that's already late to recall them.however, adding a simple yellow(circle)/red(cross, for color-blind people) indicator in front of drone would make such change healthy."
4/21/2010,they like making (this amount of) money.
4/21/2010,"came up with this little gem while mulling over a thread in f&i. after some additional thought i think it has some merit and warrants a proper discussion.the problem: for all their immense power, super-capitals makes the use of alts practically mandatory due to their non-dockable nature.the product:- super-capitals (sca) can be anchored. it requires 30 minutes to anchor and 60 minutes to un-anchor, similar to a medium pos.- to board or un-anchor a sca a password is required, similar to containers.- when anchored all modules and functions of ship are unavailable. hull hitpoints are doubled for the duration (because honour tank is the biznizz!).the value-added:- an anchored super carrier (when in open space) acts like an automated rr station. all ships (standings based) within a 25km radius are applicable recipients. - ten ships can be serviced at a time, each receiving the equivalent of a single capital rr module. service is on a first-come basis, so once repped move the hell out so a new client can get your slot!+ an anchored titan (when in open space), can be paired with an available jump bridge within range (5 ly) and effectively take the place of pos+bridge without requiring sovereignty or necessary strategic index.+ anchoring and bridging bypasses sovereignty mechanic completely! it is possible to use it to bring ships into a hostile cyno-jammed system if need be.the consumer protection:- anchored items (including containers) can be hacked. done by use of a mini-game that requires both real-world and eve-world knowledge, with in-game skill influencing difficulty and time allowed .. sca hacking obviously super-hard.nb: failing a hacking attempt prevents that pilot from trying again until item is re-anchored. so bring uber-smarts or friends!- with no modules active an anchored sca has a fairly limited tank and can be killed quickly even by sub-capital forces (theoretically anyway).- gives titans something to do after conquering space that has been ""salted"" while leaving them very vulnerable.the fine print:all numbers open to tweaks and discussion./end"
4/21/2010,"no, they're ships..every once in awhile someone proposes a 'safe' way to store supercaps totally forgoing the fact that the only reason that they are still rare (!) is that they can't be stored 100% safely without the use of a dedicated character."
4/21/2010,"i was aiming for making them more vulnerable, ie. opposite of ""safe"" while making them semi-functional/beneficial during this time.how would this make them safer? if they are anchored in a pos they are dead .. 1 hour to un-anchor is more than enough to bubble it entirely thus preventing escape.if they are outside a pos you are shooting an immobile, unhardened tank with a massive signature.and if you want to call 300+ and counting titans ""rare"" then i would love to hear what your definiton of ""common"" might be"
4/21/2010,"no...black ops are rare, supercaps....not so much. all you need is an alt to park the ship.i think you should add on that anyone in the corp with starbase config roles can unanchor it (but not board it) or that if the pos is reinforced it unanchors."
4/21/2010,it is password based so no need for role definitions. spread the password around to relevant people if you want access for others (also increases chance of theft which is a good thing ).

4/21/2010,agreed. i guess.
4/21/2010,"not supported. your suggestions are absurd at best. you would have ccp remove all customisability from the game. if flying x ship you would have to use y fit. utility high slots would become pointless, empty highs. i don't want to play an eve where all i can do is select a ship out of some rts, with set abilities and modules. i want to play eve in all its versatility and originality, where you can do whatever the hell you want with your ships. the specialised ships are there because they do their thing better than a normal ship. a geddon with one rr had 8.5k rep range and reps for what, 600 a cycle? a guardian has four rr, 70km range, cap stability and huge rep cycles.anything can cloak, but the incur severe penalties for the ability, unless you are flying a covops.anything can fit ecm or damps, but they are going to be horrendously ineffective unless you are flying an arazu or falcon.following your logic normal ships would not be able to fit webs, because that's a rapier's job, so no other ship should be able to use them. only arazu's and inties should be able to use warp scramblers, because thats their job. only hyperions and maelstroms should be able to fit active tanks, because thats their ability. i can continue if you like. you'd end up needing an entire gang because only one ship can tackle, one can web, one can shoot, one can rep, etc. do you see my point? trying to limit what players can do with their ships is simply foolish. this game would become boring and linear."

4/21/2010,"that suggestion is highly immoral and not something i am capable of.this is still totally irrelevant. my point was that there is not enough consequence to crime, not that someone found a quicker way to the cheese.i said no such thing.no doubt that my mental model doesn't match that of you or many other people, for that matter. every individual is unique. fortunately there are thousands of players out there that can relate.i don't see what you attempt to accomplish here.if you are concerned with me, you're more than welcome to join the discussion about these issues after the elections and get your voice heard. i try to include both sides in the issue documents where possible, which is why an issue about l4 missions also mentioned that some players think l4s pay too much and should be moved to low-sec (met with laughter by ccp), and reprocessed loot might be injecting too much minerals into the economy (something they claim they're looking at).oh, but i ensuring good gameplay before anything else. it is entirely in the spirit of eve as well, your criminal action will have meaningful consequence (which it currently does not). as said in the past, i strongly prefer a player-driven justice system over artificial game mechanics/restrictions. which is why my own ultima online server ran on a modified felucca ruleset where pvp was allowed, not a trammel one. but anyone belonging to a town militia could toss a murderer in jail for three days, if they managed to kill them.now once more to be clear, i don't say that such a system should be implemented in eve, but eve should have more consequences for crime, and more ways for players to police themselves. we all know the current bounty system doesn't work.did that just imply that you think eve is not a well-designed mmo?"
4/21/2010,"you're just digging your own grave here, not long now before you reach the bottom."
4/21/2010,"oh wow. this is why you will never see a vote from me or anyone of my ilk (ie, people with a bit of grey matter). if you are unable to explore or even educate yourself about the very issues you seek to bring change to then you really have no place in the csm process. you could even do a 'dummy run' and sit on gates carrying out 'mock' suicide ganks for an hour or two and go off a 50% drop rate from your 'targets' to work out your yield with docking up for 15 minutes after each 'strike'.if at all possible could you link us to a character of yours that you have 'experienced' 0.0 in because what i've pulled up is most unimpressive both in terms of knowledge of how to fit ships and depth of experience."
4/21/2010,lark and me agree? stop the presses
4/21/2010,"my track record proves that i am easily the csm that educates myself most, due to all the feedback and player communication take care provides. there are many people that can contribute in a constructive fashion, which resulted in quality issue documents. instead of only seeing issues from the perspective and interests of a large 0.0 alliance or a limited playstyle, i am unbiased, as proven in the past, and raise issues in a manner that benefit the overall eve community.i find speaking of your character, when you insinuate 0.0 is only about pimping your killboard stats. oh, just because some 0.0 elitist thinks so? i think the majority of the eve players will think, and vote, otherwise."
4/21/2010,"this kind of crap is one of the reasons i would never vote for you, despite the fact that you are a woman.good luck, but i sincerely hope you do not get voted in.jen"
4/21/2010,"you forgo the fact that explosions are what runs the eve economy. no ship losses = no market for your loot, lp or minerals. the 'moral highground' you claim to possess does not exist in eve - it's the very nature of the game. play or be played, eat or be eaten. the eve you envisage lacks everything that makes the game exciting."
4/21/2010,"and where did i say i don't want any pretty explosions?with player-driven justice implemented correctly, it will lead to more pvp. things like tradable kill rights, bounty hunting, player policing enrich eve, and certainly make it more exciting for everyone.what i do believe is that some part of my vision scared you off, which is why you engage in this mudflinging here:""ohnoez don't touch my exciting 0.0 capship blob """

4/21/2010,"doesn't that show a lack of attention to detail?you and i must have a different opinion of ""fresh blood""so far ankhesentapemkah has been in csm 1 and 2 and has been in csm 3 and 4 via proxy (in many cases drafting issues for her selected proxy and putting them on the wiki for them - no attempt made to disguise this behaviour).""fresh blood"" would imply somebody new to the process.sceptical of the term limit removal but you are running again anyway. i guess the temptation of holding power directly instead of via proxy was too much for your distaste of the limit removal.you are not independent at all, just you represent a group of people without an easily identifiable corp/alliance affiliation."
4/21/2010,"considering it take an hour of hardcore grind (the trick with multiple missions against multiple faction rats in multiple systems, few hours of 0.0 ratting or more hours of empire missioning or lowsec ratting to offset a single gank if people still make 100m an hour despite that surely some stupid bears should start to tank their haulers no?or are you simply lying?and no i never suicided for isks, all i ever suicided was obvious macros and recently people with which i had a disagreement on local etiquette."
4/21/2010,"excellent body swerve, you would make a smooth politico irl. you are anything but unbiased and most of your knowledge of issues seems to come from the rabid frothings of aggrieved carebears. you may have a great team who are able to feed you with the information they want you to have but until you have some actual experience of how things work then you should steer clear. when i was on the csm i never raised pos or industry related topics despite how well read on the issues i was or how much things were explained to me unless i had a grain of experience in the topic. no, 0.0 is not just about pimping killboard stats but unless you can show some sort of proof of your experiences with lag, large scale fleet warfare, small gang pvp, sov mechanics then i'll ask you to please refrain from pretending you have any sort of knowledge of how things work. the fact that i can't find any evidence of any pvp activity in the past three months and prior to that the majority of your losses consisted of stabbed, cloaking probing vessels (perfect for capping those plexes) says to me you have no idea of how things work.edit: the income gained from suicide ganking is variable. it's boring and you're at the mercy of the loot fairy. eve has always been presented as a game of risk vs reward. the victim is taking the risk by flying afk with high value cargo in an untanked ship. surely if he loses it this is his punishment for his stupidity. the risks are well documented and if people educated themselves or stopped making the same mistakes over and over again then incidences of suicide ganking (which is not a widespread problem despite what the hardcore of whiners would have you believe) would drop overnight."
4/21/2010,"more permanent consequences for criminals, you're very fond of criminals losing stats and skills and deleting the characters of people who violenced your boat?i think those fw exploiters could do with a ban, you know. you'd be a good start."
4/21/2010,"putting something like that in a game where character development is defined by a timer and the server, rather than how much time to grind a character has is complete mmo suicide.a hulk takes a couple of days to raise the cash to buy if you have the time to play long enough, hell, it takes 5 minutes if you sell a couple of plexes or gtcs. it's not a hugely important or valuable asset, just like any other ship. the imbalance comes when you have stupid ideas like this put forward, which could potentially destroy up to seven years of character development for blowing up a spaceship in a pvp centric game.pleasant girl and all that, spoke with you briefly at fanfest and you seemed nice enough but i'm sorry, you don't have the slightest clue about how eve works.for the sake of us all, please stick to mainstream mmo content development."
4/21/2010,"for gods sake, how many times must i repeat myself that i don't want to see that in eve? i mean, it was only included twice in the original post, then clarified three more times.yeah, could kinda expect the campaign thread to be trolled to hell, but it would be nice if the critics would make some sense. instead of repeating eachother over and over over something that has already been answered several times."
4/21/2010,you said it was impractical in eve which suggests that you'd really like that sort of thing except it's a problem to implement. which is every bit just as disqualifying.
4/21/2010,*points you at faq**points you at the three clarifications in the post above*
4/21/2010,"ok, let's pretend your discussion of deleting pvpers characters or removing sp as a punishment for criminal activity was nothing more than a somewhat unfortunately chosen example. what *would* you consider to be a reasonable consequence for crime? is your focus restricted to highsec-dwelling suicide gankers, or do you think the blinky denizens of lowsec also need further constraints on their behaviour?"
4/21/2010,"lol after reading all this, could you, if you win a csm place, please suggest an iq test after hitting post reply button?^^i like your ideas and will support you if possible."
4/21/2010,"tradable kill rights on criminals.bounties paying out based on loss inflicted.game mechanics supporting bountyhunting/vigilante officer as a profession.implementation of a criminal record.reduction in insurance payout for criminal acts. not that that will do much against suicide destroyers, though, and it is an artificial game mechanic, while i prefer player-driven mechanics.absolutely not. the agression mechanics can already be restrictive in low-sec, with players suffering sec hits because they strike first against known enemies. any further restrictions there can and will only be gamed, and solves nothing."
4/21/2010,"sure you're capable of it. you just don't want to. but if it's your morals you worry about, limit yourself to suiciding yellow ships and ransoming red pods. they deserve it, right? same difference. the consequences are supposed to take 4 hours to work off, but players figured out how to game the system and do it in one, so now you want to punish them harder because the people who are pro at fixing their sec are too good at it. consequences are reduced by players figuring out how to minimize them - it's a normal part of all games played by geeks, but you take offense because they're doing it to aid in a profession you dislike. then why did you even bring it up? we all know that other games have more consequences for pvp than eve does - heck, it's why a lot of us choose to play eve. what was the point of mentioning uo's rather over the top punishment system?elections matter. putting you on council puts a voice for a viewpoint i don't share into ccp's advisory council. thus, if possible, i'd like to see to it that you don't get elected. i know you'll probably win, but it's worth a shot. i actually do agree regarding the bounty system. it needs serious work. but saying that there's no consequences to crime is silly. the consequences are fairly serious, you're just annoyed that people know how to minimize them. here i thought i flat-out stated it. yes, this game is deeply crap in some important ways. the ui was designed by a drunken excel macro, half the features are obvious abandonware, and it's been seven years without them being able to code a bloody chat channel or webforum properly. the reason i play it is because it's unique in a few regards - the sandboxy empire building, the hilarious backstabbing, and the fact that it actually treats its players like adults and expects them to take care of themselves."
4/21/2010,"the intention is there regardless of whether it's practical or not, there's no need to throw your toys from the pram. that alone gives a good idea of your mindset and attitude toward pvp without mutual consent.to me it just seems like you have it in for pirates and nbsi pvpers, and can't accept the fact that aggression without mutual consent is one of the cornerstones of eve's gameplay. you need a wakeup call that eve's economy is built on the action of nbsi pvp. people like us create the demand for hardware."
4/21/2010,you still want to turn eve into hello kitty online?
4/21/2010,"go over the track record. you will find all issue documents unbiassed and balanced. you'll also find that a lot of these issues have been approved unanimously by the other csm, including the suicide gank issue. so a disagreement with the way i have proposed issues is not just a disagreement with me, but with every other csm that worked with me.what my own personal view on these issues is, is actually completely irrelevant. i have and will always represent the players, and not an agenda of my own. that is why take care has been so succesful, and held a seat on every csm to date. it is a prime example of direct democracy in action, with players retaining their voice after they have cast their vote."
4/21/2010,news: ten carebears care more then one carebear.

4/21/2010,"worth a vote for this reason if no other (though your in-game views are complementary to my own).it would be excellent for someone with training and experience in the field to provide guidance when the inevitable, generic calls to ""fix the @#$%^&! lag ccp"" get called out. you have at least one vote here, hope you make it to iceland ;)"
4/21/2010,i fully endorse this...dee
4/21/2010,i would like to make clear that this:
4/21/2010,currently there are a couple csm who seem to be pro-attack in 0.0defenders should always have the advantage as we can see from all aspects of history. so i will be there to make sure some issues that push for attacking being more powerful than defending never reaches csm summits.one example that was whined about and pushed for that sent the ship insanely overboard for invaders was bombers. stealth bombers were perfectly fine when they had cruise missiles. one could rat and one volley other frigates with them. now they are abused left and right. just an example of one thing i will fight for to get fixed.
4/21/2010,"haha well, as this is a videogame i really dont care one way or the other. i know if i was running a videogame i would be spawming money to sell for real money. i dont think they got too ****ed off though, since im not banned and all.(yet, heh heh heh)i think that mechanics to encourage renting is a huge factor in getting population into 00. it serves as both making it easier for powerful alliances to reach out to potential renters, as well as raising awareness that this is also a valid way to get to 0.0. i dont have any hard numbers, but i believe that the numbers in 00 are growing and that 00 is getting more populated over time. also renting has a psychological effect of giving carebear alliances the safety blanket of having a pvp alliance watching over them, it makes the transition less scary. i think the things they are doing is helping, but i think most of the credit for getting more renters out there is deserved by the big alliances that encourage it.i think that adding more entrances from highsec/lowsec to 0.0 is a rather easy fix that can increase overall activity by removing chokepoints from logistics routes, i plan to push hard on that issue because i think it has a very good chance of passing.another big issue for 0.0 is increasing the income you get from ratting there as opposed to highsec lvl 4 missions. its going to be hard to find a proper solution for it because the highsec dweller is a huge part of the playerbase. any change that makes them feel screwed over probably wont happen. so it will have to mean a 0.0 boost, not a highsec nerf.i think that ccp so far has mostly done good things on this issue, but i dont think they've done enough and i would try to divert their resources towards working on this more.edit- i think lowsec needs a boost as well, but i think that some of these 0.0 issues(especially the increased entrances idea) will have a secondary consequence of getting more population to lowsec, so things with two benefits like that ought to get the most attention."
4/21/2010,"i encounter a lot of people who say that they shouldn't bother to get more people from high-sec into 0.0 because 0.0 is 'fine the way it is'. this mostly in discussions about the powerblocks and how they are being considered by some as the reason not to get into 0.0. it seems you do not agree fully with this? (or not at all)when dominion came out, i was hoping it'd mean that the alliances wouldn't be able to hold all of 0.0 anymore because it wouldn't be cost effective. it seems however that this wasn't the case if i look at the eve map as by far most of 0.0 still seems to be firmly occupied. would you want there to be more unclaimed parts of 0.0 or do you feel there is no harm in having all or by far most of 0.0 be claimed by the alliances?"
4/21/2010,"i don't know who these people are that wish for 0.0 to be unoccupied. but i totally disagree with them. the more people that are in 0.0, the more fun that hunting for people in 0.0 with small gangs(and any size gang, in general) will be. we need to get newbies out there, and it will not only provide more action but also crowd out the macroers and make it less possible for them to function(auto log out isn't so great when someone is entering local once every few minutes)before the new sov mechanics came out, a lot of space was claimed solely for the fuel bill benefits. many systems were claimed because of a single pos, set up for an individual's benefit, possibly subsidised by some minor moon mineral. it's not like big alliances were intentionally claiming huge space for no benefit- mostly it was because for most systems, there is no opposition for a single individual's sov claim(with their ultimate purpose having more to do with rorqual safespots and very little to do with sovereignty). it was a byproduct of the emptiness of 0.0. nowadays, the same poses for ratting and moon mining still exist. sov is not the sole indicator for determining if a space is really occupied(or who lives there), and i think any discussion focusing entirely on sov largely misses the point. i think a better metric to follow is ""pilots in space in the last 30 minutes"", ""jumps in the last hour"" and ""pirate ships destroyed in last 24 hours""."
4/21/2010,"in my view, eve faces two major problems that must be overcome for it to grow, one short-term, and one long-term. the short-term problem is (no surprise) lag, and the long-term problem is that the eve user interface is broken. without a significant commitment from ccp and from the user community, these problems cannot be fixed. i am running for csm because i believe these issues must be solved in order to ensure the healthy future of the game, and that the csm can play an important role in facilitating that process.the tl;dr version of my manifesto can be found here.the eve tribune interview with me can be found here.a little about memy rl name is robert woodhead. i am the author of the first 4 games in the wizardry series of rpg games, as well as one of the first anti-virus programs, virex. i am also a founder and ceo of animeigo, the oldest surviving anime company in the us. in my spare time, in addition to playing eve, i also build and fight combat robots, write the occasional bit of free software, and i'm probably one of the few eve pilots who actually knows what zero-g feels like.solutions to lagthe current design of eve encourages bringing extra people to the fight. in other words, ""fleets expand to fill the lag available"". the only long-term solution to lag is going to be game design changes that both preserve the ability to have large-scale fleet battles while at the same time rewarding tactics within those battles that allow the devs to cleverly eliminate, or hide, the lag. getting this right is enormously challenging, but i think it is possible, and i think the csm has great value not just as a way to make proposals to the devs, but also as a sounding-board for the devs to bounce ideas off. in my manifesto, i discuss an example of a game design change that might accomplish this goal - warp cores interfere with sensorswhat's wrong with the eve uieven at a glance, the eve ui is dated. furthermore, with each new feature release, it becomes denser and more difficult to use effectively. a cursory glance at the forums proves that just about everyone agrees there are serious problems -- and just about everyone disagrees on what they are! this is, actually, entirely predictable. the eve ui attempts to be all things to all people, and fails, because this is simply impossible. even two players performing the same role can have very different concepts of the most efficient interface -- and they may both be right. so what happens is that everyone whines about the things they hate the most about the interface, and ccp looks at the big pile of different, often mutually inconsistent complaints, and says ""we can spend all our time for the next two years fixing all of this, if indeed it can be fixed, which will be so mind-numbing that half our devs will drunkenly wander out into the tundra and throw themselves into active volcanic vents, and the other half will spend their days pining for the fjords. or we can forget this stuff and implement something cool like wormholes."" guess which one they end up doing.the key to fixing the eve ui is to understand that no standard interface can be optimal for all players. in order for the ui to meet the needs of the players, it needs to be extendable by the players. in other words, ccp needs to implement addons as part of a comprehensive rewrite of the presentation layer of the client.there are many good reasons for doing this apart from the obvious utility to the players; i discuss these in the manifesto, but one of the most important from ccp's point of view is that it makes it much easier to port eve to new platforms -- devices like the ipad immediately spring to mind."
4/21/2010,"(continued from first post)what else will i advocate if elected?i intend to represent the entire eve community on the csm, with a focus on issues that affect everyone. as both a published game designer and a professional programmer with 35 years of experience, i believe i am capable of appreciating both the needs of the community and the practical realities of software development. of couse, lag and the ui are far from the only problems that eve faces. some specific issues that personally concern me are:the pos dead horse. having had the job of managing pos's, i am all in favor of this one. if the full dead horse redesign turns out to be impractical, then i would lobby for relaxing some of the pos module access distance constraints and/or remote moving of materials between modules. manufacturing interface. having personally run a 3-orca production pipeline for almost a year, there are some rough edges in this interface that need filing down -- with an industrial grinder. in fact, if addons do get implemented, this is probably something i'll personally tackle. corporation interface. while i have not had to use it a lot, much of my knowledge of danish profanity is a direct result of my ceo having to struggle with it.in addition, i will of course carefully consider issues that are brought to me by members of the eve community. my goal is to help make eve better, and if someone comes up with a good idea, i will accept and champion it, without any ego (well, without much ego...) in conclusion, it is my firm belief that killing lag and reinventing the eve ui are crucial factors in the game's long term success, and i will work hard to stimulate discussion of, and find solutions to, these and other problems of concern to the eve community, and act as a forceful advocate of their concerns. if you agree with me, then let ccp know by giving me your vote.i look forward to your comments and suggestions. thank you for your time and attention."
4/21/2010,"(reserved)and meh, add ""have the forum settings page let you preview changes to your sig"" to the list of issues i'll bring up if elected"""
4/21/2010,"what are your hopes and expectations for tyranids?where do you see eve 12 months down the line at the end of your tenure (if elected) and how do you hope to influence this?what are your thoughts and feelings on dominion and sov warfare? what do you like, what would you change and how?what do you think about the current state of 'small gang' pvp and the strategic objectives that can or can not be achieved by such groups?"
4/21/2010,"disclaimer, i have in the past bought and enjoyed animeigo products on a broad overview i agree that lag, pos, ui and other things need to be sorted, however that is a shaky campaign platform simply because it won't differentiate you from any other candidate.whilst you have posted a couple of ideas on reduction of lag i'm not convinced that trying to work out what overview data to send to each individual client as hundreds of ships move around would reduce the load on the server over the current system. also any scheme that reduces the number of ships available on grid will simply punish the newer players such as myself who are not capital ship ready or cause issues like we recently saw where whoever loads up the grid first will win.the eve ui needs work. again nobody will disagree with this and ccp themselves at fanfest stated they want to throw the ui away and rebuild it. i'm not convinced the csm will be able to prioritise this over any other changes and it is a one meeting issue. csm: fix the ui. ccp: we'll look into it. again this doesn't differentiate you from any other candidate.ccp have stated repeatedly (again repeated at fanfest) that a modable ui is not going to happen. i suppose as a csm delegate you could raise this a number of times but i'm not convinced ccp will budge on this. the pos dead horse has been brought up many times and again this doesn't differentiate you from any other candidate.lastly whilst it is a noble sentiment to want to represent the whole of the eve community i'm not convinced it is possible with all the different playstyles. it also gives the impression that you'll sit on the fence.for example, what is your stance on suicide ganking? no matter the answer you will upset some of the player base.i wish you luck but would encourage you to pick issues that will differentiate you from other candidates and not pick the safe topics of lag, ui and the like."
4/21/2010,"+1 from me for now.i'd rather have someone who has the experience, knowledge and potential imagination to bring ideas for the real problems (lag and ui problems among other things) than someone campaigning for having boobs or waste time on low-priority me"
4/21/2010,i agree.. it's nice to see someone who's actually written nationally distributed computer games running. it should make it a lot easier for you to talk to ccp and actually talk in meaningfull terms. and understand their responses when they give back their excuses.. err.. responses.. and btw - i still look at your zero-g flight video whenever i need a laugh.. bangerx

4/21/2010,"prior to dominion sov relied on pos towers and the timing of stront. there was a strategy to it as a defender or attacker that no longer exists. the attacker had to consider whether the tower would be ""timed"" to come out of reinforce at a timer beneficial to them or the defender. with dominion the attacker has no control over when the station or ihub (which control sov) leave reinforced state. and now it is truly a timezone war. americans will have a hard time taking sov from russians as an example. so unless you are facing a foe in the same general timezone the defender has a huge advantage. especially with there being multiple reinforce timers to overcome before the attacker can take sov in a system.so yes, i believe the system still needs work. they need to figure out a way to give attacker the possibility to influence reinforce times without screwing the defender. how do they do this? i don't know."

4/22/2010,"no, it doesn't seem terribly strange to me. as i said before: the reason that people don't fly the rokh is because they are conditioned to think that it is bad - regardless of whether it is or not. i even went so far as to provide historical examples of this happening in the past - and how the ship could never have been as bad as it was initially claimed. however, what you just said is that you place no value whatsoever on ehp - which is a mistake.also, you are grossly misunderstanding my argument - and this is because you apparently have no reading comprehension. i'll try to use little words for you to follow below - but really attacking someone that's arguing for your point of view is ****ing stupid. and see, this is really where the rub is. it's not that way at all. let's first agree that this is the way that things actually are:rokh > apoc >> megathron - this is because ehp actually matters.so let's look at the applicable bonuses to a sniping situation:- rokh: resist bonus to ehp, optimal bonus to ehp- apoc: optimal bonus to ehp.- mega: damage bonus, tracking bonus to damagenow, as goum is so fond of pointing out, range bonuses are damage bonuses. however, i'd argue that they are conditionally damage bonuses - and this is why i've said above that they are in fact bonuses to ehp. see, range in excess of your fleet's range is only situationally useful - so you would in fact be better as a rule to have fit the highest damage ammo that you can and still hit the designated fleet range - since that's no situation bonus but a real one. however, neither the apoc nor the rokh have sufficient optimal bonus to use a higher damage ammo - so their optimal bonus really gets optimally traded for better ehp using lr t2 ammo like everyone else.but, looking back at the bonuses... the mega has two damage bonuses to the rokh/apoc's one. i would expect the rokh and apoc to be drastically outgunned as long as they are confined to the mega's range and cannot use better ammo. but - that's not the way that it is. and it's the most damning evidence that rails need some help. so, suppose that we boost rails...rokh >> megathron = apoc (perhaps)but now the rokh is overpowered right - due to the dual ehp bonus and reasonable damage? no... because it is dual bonused for this specific situation. imo, it's fine. so like i said - boost rail damage by no more than 15% for gallente, and perhaps increase the rokh's optimal bonus so that it can actually use the damage bonus as a damage bonus instead of ehp bonus.boost rails. move along.that's the funny part about it - i do. i have awesome skills for a rokh - and i even have a fleet fit rokh fit and waiting until the day when my 5 man lowsec pirate corp is in a massive npc 0.0 lagblobfest battle. -liang"

4/22/2010,"wow man, learn the game before flaming.ok, insurance 101 for dummies.the way it stands at the moment is:all bs have a fixed payout for platinum insurance. for example; the rokh has an insurance fee of 49.5m ok, are you still with me?the payout for said rokh if it goes boom is 165m (fixed price in dominion)the current price of a rokh is 116m, ok.now if you can do math this equates to a loss of 500k.so, you can blow up a rokh for guess what? 500k (not including modules).that is how current insurance works ok.quotes for people who haven't read the blog yet:now taking into account the future of insurance, most of the valid points are quoted above.so, the insurance quote when you are buying insurance will now be estimated, right so this means the payout is going to be equal to the mineral value of the ship. this means that if you put 116m isk minerals into said rokh, you will get a payout equal to 116m isk, omg yaye, i just proved myself wrong, thank you for correcting me.but no, you fail to realise that you pay the same fee for insuring said rokh. guesss what? you dont lose any money on the minerals that were used in the creation of the rokh, but you do lose the insurance fee you payed to insure the damned thing. and if it has similar rates to the ones currently insurance will cost about 50m. now, if you are still with me, you will now realise that losing a rokh in tyrannis will cost 50m, compared to 500k like it is now in dominion."
4/22/2010,"insurance 101 for dummies:your entire post hinges on whether or not the ""100%"" is in relation to the ship value itself or the value of platinum payout + isk required to buy that insurance. guess what? the 100% platinum payout u would see if u were to open up the insurance purchase screen would be the 165 mil, the combined total of the platinum payout + isk spent to buy the insurance, not the 116 mil spent on only the ship. in case u haven't figured it out yet, that percentage ccp is talking about is how much isk u get back from the grand total spent on ship + insurance, not just the ship's value! therefore, 100% = zomg, roughly the same payout as what u put into it! do you get it now? the prices being changed to match mineral value is simply to adjust according to the rise and fall of mineral prices so if it falls too low (and it will), ppl won't get a profit from buying a ship at a low price, buy the insurance, then self-destruct it for a profit. and if i were to buy a ship that dropped in payout, it's because it was already cheaper to begin with.ty for an epic fail yet again because u failed to read the fine print...or in this case, the print itself--u could've just opened up an insurance quote to check it beforehand and find out the easy way but that would be expecting too much from a moron like u, wouldn't it? here's a little piece of advice for u--stay away from contracts, in-game and irl! and by all means, plz keep it coming. i'm sure everyone else is enjoying this as much as i am."
4/22/2010,"read most of it and i like the ideaboth risk's on carebear side and pvp side examplethe sec hit would be greater and like you said there is concord on gates to fight against but would be able to kill them which is a good idea there fore risk been sec hit, concord and reward would be what ever you kill/ransomon the carebear side you can still run missions but be ready and awake for someone probing you out and trying to kill you but at least you can still mission and for miners well this would bring the hiring protection in more as you would hire someone to protect you and so you don't have to sit alone and wait for someone finding yourisk of the carebear in 0.5 are beenprobed and killed in mission/belt, not been able to afk you missions and miningrewards of this are, been able to still do missions (as long as your awake/in a silent system), been able to still mine but need to hire protection (if necesery)been able to fight with concord (id love to do this lol)all out goodness for 0.5 would be that it brings protection hire back into the game more so more merc corps and such, brings piracy into the game more instead of bored all time from low-sec been dead, can actually pirate without been hotdroped"
4/22/2010,"why is it that everyone automatically assumes that when you suicide gank someone, you do it to make a profit? :)"
4/22/2010,"not necessarily, but most of the suicide gankers in the 0.5 systems are doing it for profit. being able to lose less isk per battleship used means gankers have more targets available to them and can lose more bs before hitting the jackpot.obviously hulk gankers do it for the lols and this wont change. but might help to discourage it."
4/22/2010,"in the light of the upcoming insurance changes, those profit gankers will get a harder time."
4/22/2010,"yes anna, my belief is that insurance rests on the fact that the insurance fee will not be taken into account from my interpretation of the dev blog, i could very well be wrong, lets stop fighting have a big hug, and wait for tyrannis to come out to see who is right."

4/22/2010,"i love scanning, it's decent money, easy to do, and pretty safe in empire the problem with it is the annoyance of sigs that appear below the horizon of the system, when moving he probes the shadow from the x axis makes it ridiculously annoying to click probes to move them anyone who scans will probally notice it, but other than abundance of random wh's that i dont want to go into it is the most annoying thing about scanning ( at least to me)in short,either remove the shadow when probes are outor make it alot more transparent, at least when probes are out."
4/22/2010,"as a 6-month occupant of wormhole space and now frequent hisec exploration junkie, i am begging you...please let us remove that ****ing shadow!"
4/22/2010,thoroughly supported. it's manageable with high shader quality but this is quite an unnecessary strain on resources when you are trying to smoothly run one account let alone two. i am forced to run high shader on my probing account*. medium used to be fine but that is a thing of the past and it makes the resource strain more of an issue.i know ccp don't officially support multiple clients from one pc but it's such a common practice i think this deserves investigation. it should be a simple fix for the art department.* due to a proposal thread i made recently and the amount of wild speculation around the issues involved i must add this disclaimer: i only run a covert ops account for reconnaissance or for locating exploration complexes. i have very rarely run a covert scout for pvp purposes.

4/22/2010,"yes, you are right. this is not caod. as your own name indicates, keep your emo away and try to deal with the reality of this game next time your alt gets blobbed.i don't see anything abnormal on the killmail you posted. and no. people are not exploiting them. they are only using them in accordance with their capabilities more frequently than other pirate frigates."
4/22/2010,"the revised solution is still hitting them on the speed which i still think is the wrong tree to bark at. limit the ability to fit whatever they want when they want and it becomes balanced .. it is the complete lack of an achilles heel that makes them broken.that carrier probably would have survived or killed a lot of them if it had 1-2 smartbombs and a buttload of warrior iis to remove the high dps bombers.in its current form it is the ultimate cowards ship. speed/agility to avoid any credible threat and dps/tank to kill everything else .. no other ships has all bases covered in a similar fashion, so yes they are used in accordance with its capabilities"
4/22/2010,"ok lets see ... people killed dramiels solo with:- cruors- navy comets- bellicose- brutix with blaster!- tempest- 2 rifters - not really solo ... bit given the whine the dramiel should have killed them before hitting 90% shield.thats the stuff i have seen so far. now i wonder ... if everyone and their mother is flying dramiels atm ... why arent you prepared to kill them?thats the nice thing about fotm, you know you will run into them so you can prepare."
4/22/2010,you all do realize emo tj is a troll right?
4/22/2010,"why are you quoting me when your post has so little to do with mine? you trying to con-fuzzle me? but you are right, fotm attracts a lot of fail-pilots who promptly die to the first ship they encounter.problem is the 50%+ that are not fail and know how to fly a ship without thinking that ""approach"" is the solution to everything.saw the exact same trend during the nano-age, the skilled pilots were able to dominate anything they wanted at will while the band-wagoneers died horribly.the only thing the fail-pilots are doing (besides throwing isk away) is postponing the inevitable adjustment .. same as for the nano crap."
4/22/2010,i am not a troll fool. i am simply pointing out all the imbalances in this game so they are fixed to keep people from exploiting them to gain an unfair advantage.your the troll!
4/22/2010,"pl have made their funny money from the isk prints ccp gave them after the win, they could give two tinkers about a tiny little trophy.ccp should certainly look into the allegations, to be sure, but unless they're willing to yank every mimir et cetera from the game, it won't mean squat all. banning them won't hurt, either, the exploiters will have long ago squirreled away their assets."

4/22/2010,"i don't see banning the whole legion is needed. if it can be proven that they used hacks/exploits during the tournament, then pl should lose their title. if not... they keep it, despite what they may do elsewhere.as for the ""elsewhere""... if hacks and exploits are being used, after they have been recognized as such, i would support the ban/penalising of the individuals for sure. corp and alliance level bans should only kick in if the leadership has been complicit in the verboten actions.i believe investigation is needed to determine the extent of their actions; how and where they have affected other parts of the game - including the tournament. then, appropriate punishment for the ""crimes"" must needs be meted out. while i agree with many of the ideas put forth here, i cannot lend my support until such time as the mob mentality cools and saner heads prevail."
4/22/2010,"by extension, the whole of eve should be barred from playing because they're a bunch of cheats, liars and malcontents.that's the only way you can protect the peaceful macro-ratter.supporting the motion to ban everyone."

4/22/2010,"when they killed macroratters, no one cared. but when the monkeysphere started to kill normal players - everything came to light."
4/22/2010,"alright, so i think the best solution to this would be instead of making it concordable. you must be apart of the targets alliance/corp. the reason for this is wars will no long have un aggressed targets changing the tide of the war. concord is a little overkill for the solution and aggro timer makes it worse."
4/22/2010,"yes, concord is just a ""little"" overkill. i'm all for fixing the problem of empire neutral rr, but **** man. concord... really? giving someone aggression is plenty and is already a massive nerf to current reasonable usage of logistics ships.-liang"
4/22/2010,actually now that i think about this. just giving someone aggression doesn't help the problem and actually makes it worse. this will nerf spider reping more than it will do anything against logistics. because even though logistics can't dock they are some 70km away and can warp off if anyone targets them or even remotely looks like they are going to engage.
4/22/2010,well if people are idiots and just join fleet without checking where that invite comes from it is their own fault.making it so that you can't rr unless in the same fleet and that fleet is tagged from any fleet members aggression would fix the problem.
4/22/2010,"drone rate of fire bonus?either way, supported."
4/22/2010,"no offense taken. i actually havent used an ishtar lately entirely because they are difficult to fit in the first place, as are most gallente t2 ships for that matter. i can understand wanting to replace the gun bonus, however i dont know what would be a valid thing to change it to. it might just be easier to propose that ccp up the powergrid and render the argument moot.edit: if anyone is -really- trying to counter a cerb with smartbombs (or even defenders for that matter) they deserve to die. getting the pulsing timed right for smartbombs to hit citadels is tricky enough, i seriously doubt it would be feasable vs. heavies or heavy assaults.edit 2: using eft dps for drones to balance the ishtar in dps vs other ships is mind-numbing. drone dps is rarely fully maximized, even vs. ships the drones were designed to hit. without an omnilink, you can pretty much shave about 50 to 100 dps off the top of heavy drone potential, much less with the travel time with or without the proposed mwd speed bonus."
4/22/2010,"i always loved the way eople argue- some are complaining about a bonus that is useless- which is true, others are saying that the ship is ""good enough"".. you do realise that has nothing to do with the topic? the topic is not asking for a buff. the topick is saying that one of the bonuces is badly designed and is nearly useless, therefore it should be changed which is completely logical. therefore i support this motion."
4/22/2010,5% damage to hybrids isn't that bad a bonus. no one says you have to armor tank and thus have the pg for guns. it's not useless if you decide to use it...3x heavy neutron blaster ii1x core probe launcher i (offline)1x small 'solace' ... armor rep (offline)1x warp scrambler ii2x large shield extender ii1x 10mn afterburner ii1x fleeting propulsion inhibitor i1x damage control ii2x power diagnostic ii2x shield power relay ii2x medium anti-em screen reinforcer i5x valkyrie ii5x hammerhead ii5x ogre ii5x warrior ii5x vespa ec-6005x light armor maintenance bot i(ii)this fit is great cause it uses my caldari skills and fully uses all the bonuses of the ship.also boost hybrids!!!
4/22/2010,"the m in mwd stands for mandatory........ hi failfit, nice to meet you! may i kindly suggest replacing that with a pair of magfield stabs - though i understand your caldari skills may have taught you to fit a full rack of sprs on all your ships.-liang"
4/22/2010,"god liang nuren, ... especially in times of warp scrambler nuking mwds, the ab makes a lot of sense. especially in lowsec. there are a lot of viable ab setups now.ab helps you sig radius tanking (especially against bigger targets)you can try speed tanking even with 2 pt scram on you.just a thought."
4/22/2010,"no, there really aren't a lot of viable ab setups. see, the big problem with them is that some jackass in a plated battleship is gonna be going twice your speed... and you will not escape. furthermore, that particular fit was utter garbage.yeah - especially with those shield rigs and extenders! really makes for an awesome sig tank! awesome!dual prop if you're really that concerned - but an ab means that you're not only going to be facing a 2pt scram but a dozen webs from the battleships that are outrunning your slow ass. careful - efforts like that may hurt you.-liang"
4/22/2010,show me the plated bs fit that outruns an ab ishtar when the 2pt scram switched off the mwd.even with 1 web you still go 212m/s if you get caught by more than one web. bad luck.but then it is also safe to assume that you got atleast one 2pt scram on you. that means your mwding ishtar is even slower than the ab ishtar. doh.sig radius increase of the 2 lse/2 shield rig fit is 145 -> 214. which is still ~50% of the sig radius of bs weapons. so you still get 50% dmg reduction from sig radius. your mwding ishtar has 870m sig radius.enough number crunching for today. time to blow up some sh*t. see you in space.
4/22/2010,"aha, i heard that works p. cool on hacs with their 125m sig radius and 500m/s speed on ab.you have two options:(a) a bc catches you, and you die.(b) a bs catches you, you become immediately capless (as in do not have any cap) and you die.(c) a nano bc catches you. it flies circles around you until you die.(d) a nano hac catches you. it flies circles around you until you die.flying hacs in scrambler range vs non-failboats is a preety cool way to produce expensive losses.battleship fitted with:heavy energy neutralizerheavy energy neutralizerderp derp"
4/22/2010,hahaha what? that would never happen because i wouldn't fight that battleship unless it was in scram range. if it's not in scram range then i'd warp out/dock/jump through a gate.if i get into a unfair situation and blow up it doesn't make the fit bad.just because i use a shield power relay doesn't make it a fail fit. mag stabs require more cpu and are less useful because more damage can be outputted by my guns and drones with the recharge then with 3 boosted guns. the cap recharge reduction isn't a problem either.
4/22/2010,"i don't know; when i fit a battleship which is not only for use in the blob, i start with this:heavy energy neutralizer iiheavy energy neutralizer iirest of the fitmaybe they fit heavy daffodil launchers in your part of space."
4/22/2010,yes. yes every fit is meant for solo pvp.and yes ab hacs can make expensive losses.i am kinda sure the targets in that video had neutralizer fitted.
4/22/2010,"ok, yeah that's a problem. it's also a problem for anything that needs to warp scramble the battleship. unless they have a cap booster i guess."
4/22/2010,i am all for this. i went looking for this cross-hair and was not able to find it. if it does truly exist it should be easily identifiable. hell i would really rather have the who ui be script-able/mod-able so we can actually make the ui look the way we want. i guess the engineers in the eve universe have not mastered or developed xml/css like technologies for information.

4/22/2010,supported.just make it a thing you can warp to in the overview.how was this bm created?
4/22/2010,"i can never tell where my ship is pointing.make a hud mode like the tactical overlay which projects a cone to infinity (size relative to directional scan) and a ray to infinity (straight line along which the center axis of the ship).additionally, this mode could have a adjustable size/magnification picture-in-picture (a new window in the game client) with a camera originating from the ray location containing a reticle with relative radians along the outside edge, and a bar (imagine the current hud for capacitor, this bar might resemble the hull bar). the reticle would allow you to point your nose in the x and y axis by clicking in this window, the bar would allow you to rotate 360 degrees in the z axis by dragging (or some more easily accomplished and less awkward method like holding a button and dragging the mouse from left-to-right on the reticle itself).add to this the ability to move along an axis not in line with this ray (e.g. 25 degrees) but nerf it with skill requirements and ship equipment (e.g. ""rotational thrusters"" which allow movement along a maximum devatiation from ray of 25% + 5% per level of 3d navigation at some reduced speed) and you can reinvent warfare in eve in a hundred ways.and no this is not just orbiting with fancy cameras added."
4/22/2010,"first, if you don't know which way your ship is pointing, zoom in. hint, it'll be the direction the nose of your ship is facing.second, in order to implement the basic feature your second wall of text asks for (facing in a direction different from my ship's velocity vector) would require you to, essentially, change the way ships move in eve."
4/22/2010,"first, be constructive instead of critical and insulting.second, it's called a paragraph. to the unitiated in the intricacies of language it might appear obstructive, like a wall, so i can't fault your primate-like fear of thoughts packed into words, and applied to structure and all the fancy shapes that entails.and to the point veiled in your sarcastic repartee about changing the movement system... yes exactly. it's an attempt to make the navigation more precise and immersive, as well as adding some more usefullness to manual piloting for purposes of scanning and (especially) combat than just double-clicking and hope mixed with overview commands and straight-line travel.if you need an image to help sell the idea of non-linear movement imagine being in wide orbit and aligned to a gate/celestial/station/whatever. or strafing while aligned. or customizing your approach to a target to maximize transversal velocity via more than just guesswork.consider building or changing ideas with logic instead of breaking them down with your dull, patronizing ""wit""... or go read something awful and stay out of it.edit: added ""<3"""
4/22/2010,"i had to laugh. i suppose i asked for that.i'm going to apologize, since you're absolutely right, my original response was dull-witted, patronizing, and snippy. that's what happens after a year of reading a forum populated mainly by trolls.constructive then.the problem with making ships in eve fly like real starships (which is, in essence, what you would end up with) is that a real space simulator in terms of physical motion would make the game much less appealing to non-hardcore science folks.i will admit that i'd like to see more realistic motions for starships - my original reply to your proposal was not generated from a lack of desire, but rather from a feeling that we should balance what's ""real"" with what's playable. zooming in at 2km/s only to have to turn around and apply your braking thrusters so you could slow down to something approximating combat speed would detract severely from the playability of the game.(also, see i can build walls of text too. )edit:unless what you're aiming for is some kind of hybrid flight engine that works like a cross between what we have now (lol-physics, if you will) and real space-flight style physics. if that's the case, i'd have to actually fly a demo of it to decide if i liked it or not. unfortunately, my guess is not, simply because it's not what we're used to, and flying your ship is such a fundamental part of the game that changing the way it works might be catastrophic."
4/22/2010,supported!no one is saying to remove clone costs just make them a bit more reasonable.
4/22/2010,supported!!!!
4/22/2010,"if u want to press a point and emphasize yourself understanding something, u might want to read it beforehand. u were saying?a lesser isk penalty upon being podded is a lesser risk that's being taken. u're like the millionth person who fails to understand this simple concept. your argument is null because u're rewarding stupidity. simple as that, yet, as expected, u still can't understand.no one said u're not allowed to train past 20 mil sp or so--u just have to deal with the consequences for the extra effectiveness that's apparently well enough for u to willingly risk...and by dealing with it, that means not *****ing about it, considering how much more experience u should have by now."
4/22/2010,"not only is your critique illogical, it is also barely legible and has no line of argument, thank you. yes, skill training rate stays constant, so do laws of physics, i cannot see any reason either should charge. higher level players should be risking the same amount of isk low-sp player is risking in pvp, or any other activity for that matter. i phail to see any reason why we need clones in the first place, they are utterly useless, they do not add any dimension to the game-play, and only lead to player frustration, and never to player satisfaction. (one time in a million- maybe less, because there is no way of knowing the other guy lost sp)additionaly, it forces higher sp players to fly heavier ships, as it is illogical to fly a ship that costs less then your pod, further encouraging capitals and ships with high survivability. since they are scared for there pod, they will tent to participate in blobbing more, and less in high-risk scurmish warfare, and eve needs more of that, and less capitals and bs bolb.it is not uncommon for a high-sp char to have a clone worth 50 million, that is more then value of most ships in eve, and makes flying those ships pointless for them. i find that extremely unfair."
4/22/2010,the character huhuhuhuhuhuh has posted video evidence of his ability to exploit the eve client in order to mask his appearance in local. this gives him an unfair advantage over others and until the exploit he discovered is fixed i propose that he be banned from the game. this also goes for anyone else that has demonstrated their participation in this nefarious breach of the eula. proof
4/22/2010,i mask my presence in local by not logging in.
4/22/2010,"that's a good tactic boss lemming. it also stops you getting killed as easily, just watch out for micro smartbombs when you log off.obligatory support your own thread"
4/22/2010,"and the inquisition continues, burn them all.i thought we grew out of that when we left the middle ages, but i guess i was wrong."
4/22/2010,since you're still allowed to post i see no reason for ccp to stop huhuhuhuhuhuh from playing either.
4/22/2010,"yes, ban him from test server !"
4/22/2010,lmao
4/22/2010,"while monkey is not banned huhuhu can not be banned too! we have evidence that monkey used this exploit on tranquility!!! and there are no bugreport from him! but huhuhuh reproduced it on sisi and bugreported this exploit to stop monkey from doin it on tranq! kill monkey!!! kill! ps: and if we want to be serious, ccp server logs don't show anything! no evidence from server logs on monkey or huhuhuh... screenshots and fraps are not permitted by ccp"
4/22/2010,huhuhuhuh reproduced this exploit for bugreported ban monkey !!!
4/22/2010,there is only speculation surrounding monkey's use of no local while huhuhuhuh has discussed and been caught on fraps with the ability to bypass local.ban huhuhuhuhhuhuhuhumonkey has not claimed the ability to exploit while huhuhuh has.
4/22/2010,"ok. you may continue it as long as you like just for you to remember - player may be banned only by server logs, no screenshots, no fraps... good luck with it!"
4/22/2010,so that monkey and lolinternet were farming russians like crazy is no proof?but as i said ... the inquisition is running! get the pitchforks and torches.
4/22/2010,i'd hate to have you as a judge.
4/22/2010,"i can use gm-console!!! i need to be banned!!! i claimed the ability to use it!!! i need to be banned as soon as possible or i'll use my ""i-win"" button on any target i like! remember you maybe my next victim! you need to hurry! send new petition!"
4/22/2010,i think it's fake. you easily can do it in any video editor. you look like fools guys.
4/22/2010,"totally agree. also i demand to ban all bh team on sisi, since they probably will try to reproduce this exploit! and qa team too.just joking, of course."
4/22/2010,can we ban all idiots from the assembly hall?
4/22/2010,easily! just need to send petition.
4/22/2010,"or even better, ban all posts in the assembly hall. they're utterly useless, anyway."
4/22/2010,post evidence plzkthx.
4/22/2010,don't forget to show your support for this important issue please.
4/22/2010,i am suprised this thread is still here...
4/22/2010,i hereby suggest to ban all posters above me!
4/22/2010,speaking of posting evidence. why don't you tell us one of your cool safe cracking stories?
4/22/2010,"the citation (vovick 4/22/2010, 11:49) *to simply i see that is not enough of it, and the variant of threats of public distribution can and not go on.the citation (****)*what else threats? anybody also did not think to threaten ccp. simply if it not fixed a bug within one and a half weeks, prompts something to me that exploit will appear in open access as separate tool => it will begin in large quantities will use => ccp is compelled to correct a bug.this citations are from eve-ru."
4/22/2010,"ccp has stated that local was never intended to be used as an intel tool. i have therefore petitioned everyone, including myself and my alts, for exploiting local in this fashion. our imminent permabans shall be a sharp warning to all other would-be miscreants!"
4/22/2010,perhaps an exploit like this (if it gets out of control) will force ccp to make changes and/or fix local. similar to the way that the pos bug (which broke the stranglehold on certain types of moon gold by certain entities in 0.0) led to the ability to synthesize moon gold with more common moon gold.
4/22/2010,"didn't huhuhuhuh do it on the test server? which isn't considered exploiting? and just like monkey, until we have hard evidence, and nobody claims its faked, he won't be banned****** (re-tard)"
4/22/2010,"stupid, fat pl troll. huhuh is just reproduced on test server and bugreported an exploit that was used by pandemic legion's the monkeysphere to kill common players on tranqulity for years.not supported."
4/22/2010,"i'm not pli'm not trollingi know it was on the test server, my point is he has this knowledge at his fingertips and shouldn't be allowed unfair advantage.please reconsider as you seem to be against exploiters.i'm not fat either, please leave personal insults out of this."
4/22/2010,"so huhuhu brings to light a potentially game breaking bug and you post this worthless stuff here?you never seemed very surprised about the local exploit being real.did you use it on tq? maybe with your other account?other than that, do you want exploits to remain in game?or do you just like trolling so much you know no limits?seriously spank, either get back to normal, or quit eve. please."
4/22/2010,"i didn't believe the exploit existed at first, you can check my post history for that information if you made a little effort.considering how bad at pvp i am i don't see how you can accuse me of cheating.this is a genuine petition and the best you lot can do is accuse me of trolling. how can i be for exploits when i am petitioning against them?"
4/22/2010,"because the existance of the local bug was generally disputed until huhuhu showed it exists.pretty much as a good bh could and should have done on sisi.are you also asking for the banning of ccps bhs on sisi?what in the world is in your head, i wonder."
4/22/2010,u mad?
4/22/2010,"it's bughunter's duty and purpose defined by ccp to detect, reproduce on test server and bugreport exploits and bugs."
4/22/2010,"i think if genuine bug hunters find exploits they wouldn't discuss them publicly on the forums. the thread discussing this issue was a witch hunt to have someone removed from the game for ~maybe~ exploiting. don't play the good customer bug hunter card here. this bug hunt was not done out of generosity or concern for the game, it was an attempt to get someone permanently banned.i'm pretty sure they didn't want people posting and discussing exploits on the eve general forum. this is very unprofessional 'bug hunting'."
4/22/2010,"the hunt for the bug started because of the forum thread, not the other way around.meaning the thread was there first, then the bug hunt started.the only ones who can move threads to other parts of the forum are ccp.on a personal note:do you think it is good that this bug has been reproduced and brought to ccps attention or not?just wondering, because you honestly leave the impression on these forums that you would rather have seen this bug go undetected by ccp."
4/22/2010,"the existence of the thread does not justify the posting of video footage at a later date.the latest video as posted on youtube shows clear determination to pin this exploit on a single player rather than any attempt to bug hunt for peoples benefit. you can see this by the comments therein. i think it is best that exploits are reported to ccp and not showcased to the public. discussion to a certain degree is fine naturally. in fact, often it has been necessary to open discussions up to the public in order to force ccp into action."
4/22/2010,"why not first answer me if you think it is good that huhuhuhu was able to reproduce this serious bug or not.(and let the players and ccp know about it.)btw, the public videos only show the bug on sisi - not how it is achievedas far as i know ccp was informed on how the bug is achieved. not the playersalso in one of your earlier posts you are complaining about witch hunts...what do you think you are doing in this thread?or what about your involvement in the thread about siig?spank, you make no sense."
4/22/2010,<tinfoil>maybe she wants to move the attention from their pl witches to the huhuhuhuh witch?</tinfoil>
4/22/2010,"the logs show nothing so surely nothing happened and since when does ccp accept evidence which is not the logs?you are surely delusional. the logs show nothing.edit: no seriously, what proof does ccp have vs huhuhuhu and it doesn't have vs monkeysphere? the logs show nothing. the rest is just heresay and trolling and the logs show nothing and you cannot go around believing stuff which is not in the logs, which show nothing. since the logs show nothing the video is obviously a fake.if ccp reproduces it, then they cannot prove huhuhuhu did it in that precise way, as the logs show nothing.tl;dr version: the logs. they show nothing."
4/22/2010,"it's unfortunate you have issues perceiving what i am saying here. i thought it was quite clear.i do not appreciate your divisive question. i have already stated that i wish this exploit to be looked at by ccp. i also stated that i have no issue with genuine and bug reporting. if you need further clarification, i believe that bug reporting should be kept discrete. in short, not good that he can reproduce it (hence this thread), good that he reported to ccp, bad that he reported to the players.this is not a witch hunt. i just believe that anyone with access to an unfair advantage should not be given that opportunity. as such, the only person proven to have this advantage is huhuhuhuhuhuh.my involvement in the thread about siigari is certainly not appropriate to this topic. perhaps you could question me on that over in the relevant thread."
4/22/2010,"personal attack removed.applebabebecause you're proposing to ban player (huhuh) who helps ccp and community to find the bug, not the one (pandemic legion's the monkeysphere) who exploited this bug in silence for years against real players.just shut up and do something useful and good for community."
4/22/2010,huhuhuhuh self admitted to knowing this exploit.monkey did not.please do not troll my thread and use personal insults when you cannot grasp the concept under discussion here.
4/22/2010,"was not clear to me if you appreciated the bug being found or not.in fact, you left the contrary impression.ok. we agree on this point then.ok. good to hear.in general i agree. we both know though that this topic was very indiscreet before the bug hunting actually started.here is your main misunderstanding of the bug hunting process.actually it is good if the bug can be reproduced by the bughunter.this helps in the bugreport, as the various steps needed to reproduce the bug can be passed on to the devs.if the reason for this thread realy is that someone who hunted a bug could eventually reproduce it,then this thread realy makes no sense.agreed.many players in the main thread, especially those from pl, tried to ridicule the topic.it seems understandable to say the least that the evidence was brought forward, effectively proving that the ops point was valid.also, as i said earlier, what was reported to ccp and the players is quite different to my knowledge.ccp got the full bugreport including steps on how to reproduce, while the players only where shown that the bug is real (without steps on how to reproduce)if you say so...by saying that person should not be given the opportunity you mean that person should be banned?that is how i understand what you are saying, please clarify if you mean differently.it would be bad news for bug hunters if anyone who can reproduce a bug (on sisi) would have to be banned from tq,since part of bughunting is reproducing the bug. meaning all good bughunters would eventually have to be banned from tq.i doubt this is what you want. maybe you should think this through again.it is a witch hunt as well so there is a similarity, but i agree that this should not be further discussed here."
4/22/2010,"the logs. they show nothing.no, seriously; if we are going to go by ""we need definite proof to ban monkeysphere"" since he's just doing, i don't know, a clever logoffski with perfect timing then we also need definite proof to ban huhuhuhu and his video is a shop and he's just trolling he can do it, right?the standard of proof is the problem; ccp's policy has always been (and in that way the petitions by the guys who got killed using the exploit were handled) is that if logs show nothing, you **** off.so using that standard of proof, please prove huhuhuhu was hacking."
4/22/2010,"knowing the exploit is not punshiable, only using of it.and the monkeysphere used it for himself on tranqulity for years, but huhuh just discovered, reproduced it on test server and bugreported it.you're troll or idiot if you think bugreporting of exploit is possible without discovering or without knowing it. you're even more idiot, because you're effectively propose to ban any bughunter on basing that he, by sole discovery of the bug, have the opportunity to use it."
4/22/2010,"you're a troll or idiot if you insist on claiming as fact what is only speculation.i don't want bughunters banned but it sets a very bad precedent for people to be uncovering and discussing these exploits on the forums. that is the purpose of this proposal, that is based on fact. your accusations of monkey are based on speculation.you have proven yourself incapable of reasonable debate.no respect. this is a very reasonable point. thank you for not resorting to petty name calling and speculation like others here.respect."
4/22/2010,"if the goal is to allow ""100's"" of players in a single system, multiple stations will make this actually desirable rather than merely possible."
4/22/2010,"now i finally see why so many people hate the idea- it would not let them station flip any more! ow my god! you would actually have ti fight? isn't that what nulsec warfare is about?? thanks for being honest at least, 0 times suported. you are not suppose to be able to take over any system yourwhat easelly, if someone tok there time and invested money into building up 12 stations, they are suppose to be harder to take over. maybe we should not allow people to get together in big fleets because they are harder to kill like this, huh?"
4/22/2010,you know it already takes a few days of fighting to take over a station system? i wouldnt call a few days of almost constant fighting an easy take over.
4/22/2010,"i'm not sure if it's still true that titans are more widely used than black ops ships, but unfortunately these battleships are still underused and overpriced for their lack of versatility. clearly, they're less viable in combat than their tk1 equivalents. this is by design - and i'm guessing ccp is going to keep it this way, not wanting to create a line of flavor-of-the-month solo gankboats. but their specializations have to be expanded, to make them worthwhile. i propose that ccp give them a new 'theme' - tactical and strategic mobility. to that end, the following changes might be implemented:~change covert jump portal implementation. instead of limiting this by ship type, place a mass limitation on the portal - like a wormhole- so that only a very limited number of ships can move through. being able to hotdrop small gangs would be a useful asset, and if properly balanced, help to make pvp more interesting.~increase jump range. this plays into the previous proposal. by boosting base jump range to 3-4ly, ccp would give black ops ships more mobility and versatility, and a greater ability to infiltrate heavily garrisoned hostile areas of space.~slightly increase speed/agility of black ops ships. this might make these highly expensive ships a little more survivable and useful on the battlefield; tk2 battleships are flying bullseyes, and black ops ships might degenerate to logistics platforms without a few token tactical enhancements.i think this has the potential to make both pve and pvp more interesting, and more importantly, it might make it worthwhile to undock in a black ops ship once in awhile."
4/22/2010,"1: noi'd rather see them pick up covert ops cloaking abilities to make them fall in line with there smaller brethen.the whole point of the covert jump portal is for black ops deployment of covert ops ships such as stealth bombers.they already buffed it with the ability to reach standard cynos (unless that was just a rumor >.>;)2: yes!3: yes! but i think most people would prefer a weapons boost or some such.black op's is supposed to be hard to catch and hard to kill.it never made sense to me why they never could use covert ops cloaks yet all the others can.what good is it to buy a ship that is nothing more than a fancy/expensive jump bridge for smaller ships capable of warping around while cloaked?oh and ""up yours"" to the afk cloaker whiners... grow up and get a damn backbone.: o pi intend to get one... but it is just simply too expensive to use other than a fancy bridge tool.so yes.. i agree with all but the first point... no-go.so i won't support until then. :)"
4/22/2010,not supported. please don't make any more ships useful; it just means more training.
4/22/2010,"imho ... the covert ops cloak might make them a bit op, as the ship got quite a bit more ehp than e.g. a recon or covops."
4/22/2010,"i do not support exactly your idea. however this ship really needs improvements.i support the idea of a hit and run covert ops cloaked ship, high dps, low hitpoints, but as expensive as it is now, and a bit more of agility too.cynos on a bs class ship? it looks more like a miniature titan, i'm tired of these ideas."
4/22/2010,"no covert ops cloak on black ops!would make it waaaaay over powered. besides, there is plenty of warpy cloaky crap in the game.there is so many other things that can be tweaked on these ships to make them worth flying that simply slapping on a covert cloak and calling it a day."
4/22/2010,pls discuss in here
4/22/2010,"this x1000.stop the irritating habbit of: when in doubt, lets give it a cov ops cloak."
4/22/2010,ccp has already agreed they will make an effort to rebalance black ops. read the csm minutes please so we don't get useless suggestions like this.
4/22/2010,hmmmm covert ops cloak + t2 scorpion... aka the falcon of old. how this won't be op is beyond me.
4/22/2010,"if i understand correctly, insurance will soon cover ship loss and little else to fix exploits etc. as i've heard nothing concerning ways to recoup equipment and mod loses, may i propose that adding an equipment insurance option backed by current market prices of current ship fitting might help. of course, it would be a one time deal for current fitting value. if you upgrade and value increases, you buy another policy. this might also help with the possible mineral price drops that might occur etc. maybe even increase demand a little. yay!"
4/22/2010,"tl;dr: suicide ganking should be as cheap as possible, plox ccp."
4/22/2010,"dude you should wake up, it is time for work. you can dream more in the evening."
4/22/2010,dreams =/= realityand your sense of economics is fail tbh...
4/22/2010,"actually, if you are destroyed by concord there should be no insurance payout. no insurance company ive every heard of would remunerate the losses incurred during illegal activity."
4/22/2010,"by that logic, low sec piracy gets no insurance either and neither would 0.0 because why would an insurance company reiumburse u for taking a vehicle into a war zone and inevitably losing it?as for the op, not supported because it violates the risk vs reward rule. u want the added effectiveness of t2 mods, deal with the consequences of losing them."
4/22/2010,"no, i do not like the increased insurance on t2 and t3 ships let alone adding it to modules"
4/22/2010,noi wish all insurance removed and i think the new system with higher payout for high risk ships is plain stupid so plese stop moving to the wow direction.
4/22/2010,nope.
4/22/2010,"yes!! please ccp? maybe while developing planetary interface you can think about this type of thing, and re-apply it to the pos interface."
4/22/2010,just supporting my own proposal.
4/22/2010,i agree
4/22/2010,what about emergency warp though? wouldn't that break the cloak if it gets really messy?
4/22/2010,"emergency warp happens from time to time, but i wouldn't call it a problem. the main point is to equalize attackers and deffenders in high lag situations. yes, there are fights, when you can not load grid at all or it takes more than 5 minutes to load. i am not talking about those now. extended invulnerability cloak in a large fleet fights will minimalize free kills for the defending force."
4/22/2010,"i've not been e-warped myself very often but i heard from others that it happenes to them 'every time'.either way, this sounds like a good idea, except it will do nothing for people who get bridged in, or capitals jumping in, but that would be a different matter to solve i assume."
4/22/2010,good idea
4/22/2010,people who get bridged in or go through a gate should simply not appear in the system until the grid has loaded (put them in a limbo?)i guess it's a good temp fix.
4/22/2010,"a good short-term solution, but a little late the lagtastic conditions introduced in dom are supposedly being sorted in tyr, so even if this was done it would have a few days or a week (going by normal ccp speed) at most before being superseded by the actual fix.but supported nonetheless."
4/22/2010,"this would be better. but anything would be better than dying because the grid didn't load and your ship sat there uncloaked, immobile, unresponsive. even fish in a barrel are harder to kill."
4/22/2010,"ii would like yo have a mechanism where you d not appear on grid at all until you have loaded completely. would be especially important for cynoes. either way, something needs to be done."
4/22/2010,delete
4/22/2010,"ok. so i can keep ratting in my tengu with covert reconfiguration. goodie.also ... wasnt npc aggro already reduced to 1 minute in the past?(marlona ... this is one of your worse suggestions, as it will only feed logoffski)"
4/22/2010,not supported.it might not be fun to you but it's fun for the bombers. also it's not easy. bombing runs take a bit of coordination and finesse to pull off without taking losses.
4/22/2010,"mate, have you ever done any bombing runs before? or have you at least flown a bomber? there not that easy to fly or coordinate a bomb strike. in my experience as piloting s.b.'s and being on the side that's being bomb. they pretty much feel right at the moment."
4/22/2010,"not supported. stealth bombers are a fairly lengthy skill train to fly properly, and the coordination and practice necessary to be successful should be rewarded.next to smartbombs, they are currently the only area-effect damage element in eve. bombers represent how tactical squadron deployments can be an effective counter to a larger fleet. in an eve that is currently struggling with a blob/lag problem, they're vital.also, stealth bombers look wicked awesome. go pandemic legion!"
4/22/2010,"ok, when would you like these implemented? and does anyone else have a say in this? what else do you want changed?"
4/22/2010,edit - forgot to support this post.
4/22/2010,"would support if you could ""salt"" moons too."
4/22/2010,"no, it isn't. it's a disagreement with you.i can see the way you're trying to spin it, but i'm not talking about the things that have been suggested that you've agreed with, i'm talking about your own agenda that you've put forward regarding hammering people into the ground who promote non consensual pvp.it's wholeheartedly and completely relevant as it gives us an insight into what eve will be in your eyes. you'll always have your own agenda and regardless of how unbiased you claim to me you'll always pick a side, it's human nature to do so.as for ""take care"", it's not an example of anything, other than the fact that highsec mission runners and miners are an abundant species in eve and will stick together and blob vote for their own benefit when it's needed."
4/22/2010,"while nobody can be entirely unbiased, there are several parts of this manifesto that i would like to show support for.good luck!"

4/22/2010,"in your innitial post you talk about bringing back to the table old issues, but considering the timing, i'd think that ccp will also want to talk to the csm 5 about planetary interaction a lot. what are your thoughts on where they should take it, and how high the priority should be of pi development in relation to other things in the backlog you spoke of?"
4/22/2010,"planetary interaction and dust are going to be high on the priority list for ccp regardless of what the csm says. i forsee any csm feedback getting drowned out by feedback from bug testers and devs that have their own ideas. i think it's something that i really should be working on most after the first iceland meeting and before the second online ccp meeting- after i've gotten a handle on how the situation is internally, then i can think of the best way to make suggestions to ensure that this won't just become another fancy moon miner borefest, and make sure that the proposals themselves have a high chance of making it reality. i'm definitely going to be doing thorough testing of the planetary interaction mechanics on sisi especially before the iceland trip though, its too big of an issue to ignore.tl;dr it's something that definitely needs csm attention just because of the amount of ccp attention it's getting, but it's too early for me to say too many concrete things about it."
4/22/2010,having fun talking to your alt?
4/22/2010,"are you aware of the fact that the csm has already requested a moddable ui, and that ccp specifically said that it wasn't going to happen(6.58)? if not, does this change your platform? if yes, how do you intend to change ccp's mind?"
4/22/2010,"dee tarant: ""what differentiates me from the other candidates?""more than anything else, my experience as a computer programmer and game designer. i believe this gives me a great advantage as a csm member because the job of the csm is to help interface between players and ccp. i've been a dev (and a gm), and i've been a player.with respect to lag, one of the reasons my proposal could work is that while it can be difficult to parallelize the updating of the game state, i/o filtering (ie: deciding what each client sees) is easy to make parallel, which lets you load-balance the io. so if being io-bound is significant part of the lag problem, that's a big help. if lag is overwhelmingly compute-bound, then the issue becomes ""what gameplay changes are needed to allow optimizations on the game state update?"". but either way, without gameplay changes, lag is never going away for long.individual issues: obviously, i could state my position on a bunch of individual issues, but as you quite rightly point out, all that does is lose you votes!(this, btw, is why i won't answer larkonis' transparent questions -- sorry lark!)what i can guarantee, however, is that i will approach every issue on a factual basis, listen to all sides, call them on their bs when needed, and render a considered judgment. and if new facts come to light, then i'll adjust my position.now, having said all that, i'm going to commit the sin of actually stating a position on a specific issue, to illustrate the way i think about these kind of things.let us consider t2 bpos. my position on this issue is that i have no strong opinion on whether or not it should be done, but i currently have a very strong opinion on how it should be done if ccp decides to do it.if ccp decides to remove t2 bpos from the game, i would consider this no different from when the local council knocks down someone's house to put in a bypass (i limit myself to one hitchhiker's guide reference per posting). it is an involuntary taking and as such the person whose property is confiscated is due compensation. therefore, ccp should determine what the fair value of the bpos are, and buy them out at a premium to that value -- so the happiest guy in eve should be the guy who bought his bpo the day before ccp decided to yank them.furthermore, one thing that should be carefully considered before t2 bpos are yanked are the overall effects on the market. at first glance, i would expect that the price of t2 items will go up due to reduced supply and because inventors no longer have to compete with lower-cost bpo manufacturing. invention might have to be tweaked to lower the cost of production if price stability is a concern, and of course there is the issue of the overall inflationary effects of the isk that's injected into the economy. the implementation would have to be carefully designed so as not to inflict pain on the consumers of t2 items in the form of a hidden tax via higher t2 prices.the ui: dee & herschel point out that ccp has said ""no"" to addons before. actually, in last year's csm meeting, ccp said ""ccp sees the potential, and regularly revisits the idea, but they don't like the security issues it poses, and it creates more problems than it solves. the current answer to the request is no.""that is why i specifically addressed those issues in my manifesto addon proposal -- i want to change that ""no"" to a ""yes"", and the fact that ccp wants to rebuild the ui anyway means this issue is crucial and has consequences that will be with us for many years.the bottom line is that i'm running for csm because i really like this game, but there are things about it that make me weep.ps: according to my wife, my boobs are very nice, if somewhat hairy."
4/22/2010,i'm very sorry but that won't happen..'fix the lag' is of the same order. there is nothing dramatic that ccp can do about the lag and small improvements have been made left and right over time. putting your fist on the table and demanding they 'fix' an issue as complicated as that is not going to help.
4/22/2010,it will never happen if we no one at least tries.this is internetz spaceships. anything should be possible.also - get rid of those freakin learning skills. what a pita they are.

4/22/2010,"though an interesting idea, dont you think that if an organized crime/pirate syndicate could strip away station and gate guns for an area then it would soon become one avoided by pve'rs, upon who many of these seedy players rely on to come to lowsec as a source of amusement and income?my other thought (especially for 0.0) is that plexing drops should increase slightly as with officer spawns. as the numbers in 0.0 have grown and there are numerous players myself included unfortunately who can spend hours plexing and get multiple crappy drops (or none at all). perhaps the chance of drops for plexing at least should increase for each plex where no drop occurs (then reset once a faction drop occurs)? the counter argument is that it would drive prices lower if the drops occur more, but at least more people get a piece of the pie. your thoughts? ps. you have my vote mate."

4/23/2010,yes completely true ... aslong as fleets consist of 100% the same shiptype.but .... asoon as you have a mix your ehp doesnt count for squat because you will be targeted last.this means the fight will be decided before your targeted therefore your hindering you gang by not bringing a higher dps ship.simples.
4/23/2010,"that's not true at all. see, if ehp doesn't matter at all, then the fight is still sufficiently large that neither volley nor dps matter either. think about it this way:you have a pair of massive heterogeneous fleets of similar size shooting each other - except that one has rokhs (high ehp, middling dps) and the other doesn't. ships are popping on both sides as fast as the fc can call targets and people can lock them. ehp, volley, and dps don't matter in the slightest - either from the perspective of the fleet or personally.then...- the fleets whittle themselves down - at the same rate v until volley, dps, and ehp start to matter. a ship with high volley and low/middling dps will matter for the next 3 minutes or so.- the fleet with slightly higher dps will begin to pop the other fleet very slightly faster - remember we're talking about less than a 20% dps difference here on the ships with high ehp only.- the ships you claim will be targeted last, and as a result you'll have like 45 fleet1 (high dps) ships vs 40 fleet2 (high ehp) ships (yes, the difference is that small). at this point the high ehp ships will begin to kill the high dps ships at odds of about 3:1.i don't have the time to do it presently, but i'm fairly positive i can present a mathematical proof that your assertion of heterogeneity marginalizing ehp when dps matters is false.-lianged: and the hilarious thing is that people are asserting that ships like the tempest and maelstrom are somehow awesome - despite being at about optimal + 1/2 falloff at sniper engagement ranges. they don't do noticeably more damage than a rokh."
4/23/2010,"i don't see what you've written as far off the truth but your missing a couple of points which don't come out from pure dps vs ehp calculations. in the second phase of your example volley ships are key in the second phase.... fights on tq are decided reasonably quickly so the odds are the matters decided before you reach the third phase admittedly normally by factors outside of ship selection, theirfore maxing your dps you give you better odds of winning.volley is tackle, any fleet with a low volley : high ehp ratio will see a larger % of their targets warpoff.you also taking into account only sniper vs sniper fleets, vs a short range fleet max dps inbetween warps is key."
4/23/2010,"that might be true if the dps difference were really that great - but it isn't.and amazingly the ships with high ehp have a much better chance of making the warp out themselves. ;-)at any rate, i contend that my post above still stands (the one detailing why rails need a boost despite the fact that the rokh will become ""even better"").-liang"
4/23/2010,"that assertion is not wrong.example:lets say we have two variants of sniper battleships.type a: 2d dps and 1e ehp.type b: 1d dps and 2e ehp.a fleet of n battleships of type a engaging a fleet of n battleships of type b will kill each other at the same rate and therefore, theoretically, the battle should turn into a stalemate. now lets say the first fleet have n type a ships while the second fleet also have n ships but a 50/50 split between type a and b. so the first fleet have 33% more dps while the second fleet will have 33% more ehp.but, as long as the fleet with only type a ships targets the type a ships in the second fleet they will kill 4 ships for every 3 ships they lose. this is the minimum rate but their kill/loss advantage will increase with time. so when the second fleet runs out of type a ships they are stuck with <U+FFFD> n ships of type b that will face a lot more than <U+FFFD> n ships of type a and they will continue to lose as they need the same number to force a stalemate.this example should be enough to realize that grunt is right about mixed fleets."
4/23/2010,"your example goes wrong right there - because it's much more like:type a: 1.0a dps and 1b ehptype b: 0.8a dps and 1.5b ehp..-lianged: in case you missed it, you asserted that the dps ships are rated equally on the ""fleet effectiveness"" scale as the heavy ehp ships. they aren't - and the difference even on the dps side is pretty minor."
4/23/2010,"but here we were talking about whether a mixed fleet is at a disadvantage vs a uniform fleet. that was the assertion and that is what my example illustrate. the math doesn't change just because the ratios become smaller, the effect will just be less pronounced. two fleets that are uniform but with different types will have a stalemate. if one of the fleets are mixed that fleet will be at a disadvantage as long as the homogenous fleet targets in the right order. i don't think you can mathematically prove this to be false."
4/23/2010,"you contradicted yourself, as well as assumed overall equal fleet effectiveness. specifically, the second quote is outright false.-liang"
4/23/2010,your argument here is to claim im wrong? perhaps you dont understand the example. please show me the contradiction.
4/23/2010,"your lead up does not imply the second quote - if they have fleet equivalence and the high dps fleet kills 4 for every 3, then at mid point the higher ehp ships kill 4 for every 3. the winner becomes the one that shot first.-lianged: i'm going to leave this here for posterity, but a toy problem is incoming. you should withhold your response until then."
4/23/2010,"you missed the point of the example and i suggest you read it again.if a uniform fleet of type a ships will have a stalemate vs a equally large and uniform fleet of type b ships, i would assume that type a and b would be of equal fleet effectiveness. even if you define fleet effectiveness in some other way, it will not change the fact that a mixed fleet will not fair as well as a uniform fleet even if the sum of fleet-effectiveness for each ship in both fleets are equal."

4/23/2010,"thanks liang, and nice program also note that a uniform type b fleet also will win vs the mixed fleet (with correct targeting order). if both fleets are mixed, the one with the highest number of type a ships will prevail, assuming they are mixed at equal ratio, (ex: <U+FFFD> a + <U+FFFD> b vs <U+FFFD> a + <U+FFFD> b)."

4/23/2010,"first of all thank you for being gracious, i flew off the handle a little since i'm not used to posting... until very recently i was just an observer... and overreacted a bit because i saw my precious thread turning into a ""no you!!1!"" contest in a hurryat any rate, to the points!i'm less interested in extreme reality than i am in micromanagement. i know there are a lot of little aspects to it that make it more involved, but my thought was that navigation remains the same unless you activate the hud/overlay and have the ""rotational thrusters"" or what have you. so for the multitudes it remains the same, but for those who want it, it exists. it's probably impractical, i admit!i think it would take some getting used to, but as above not everyone would have to use it and those who do would probably quickly learn how to do it. for the record i've never played a flight sim but the more i think about it the closer to this it sounds lolthat is the closest you've come to what i was imagining, and a great word for it/way to describe it. a demo would be awesome but like i said the popularity of it would prolly not match the resources of creating it.please forgive my editing, this will prolly be ugly since my browser was bugging out when i wrote. thank you again.p.s. now that it seems you're human i might have to contact you in game to make sure you're real lol"
4/23/2010,"it amazes me that when someone flames someone else on the forums for anything regarding spelling or grammar, they end up failing.it is uninitiated, not unitiated. frankly, i would love to give constructive criticism to an idea, but it being the only type of criticism you seem willing to accept, i feel i must inform you that it is not the only form of criticism there is.aside from your idiocy in matters of spelling (i only say so because you immediately turned on someone who didn't think your idea was the ""bee's knees"", and then included a spelling error in your tantrum) the idea seems convoluted and unnecessarily complex.what i got from your idea was that you want the ship to be pointing towards an object and moving through space at a different vector. i have to ask why. why would it matter what direction your ship was pointing. the vector that it is traveling on is the only thing that really matters for alignment. last time i checked, your guns shoot at targets regardless of your ship orientation and vector.the only thing about your idea that seems to have any merit is having a line pointing out from the nose of your ship. it's almost as useless as passive alignment (which is only an indication to fleet commanders that their boys/girls are awake) but it still could be nice to visually verify alignment.now unless i have missed something, and your idea actually involves some sort of flight pattern with this 3d cone and ""alignment box"" in order to, say, add transversal velocity when approaching an enemy, i would still veto this one. the mechanic for that is already in place and it involves you clicking to set your direction and speed. with a mechanic that automatically moves your ship there is no skill."
4/23/2010,"you missed the whole point of and purpose behind that exchange so aside from saying that i'm gonna go ahead and ignore the first three paragraphs of your post.to your points, if you read carefully (since i mixed my ideas together kinda awkwardly) you'll notice there are two things here that happen to work together:1) d-scan cone and nose ray with the p-i-p view of what's being viewed as well as the ability to modify the angle of view, and2) non-linear movement using that same p-i-p was more of the afterthought than the purpose of my post.the first is just for precision, and could probably be accomplished with an overlay-type thing similar to the tactical overlay.the second is this huge and mostly unneccessary change to the game which has only limited application for few people and which i mentioned immediately afterde'veldrin's second post. i can imagine using it to mostly align to objects while moving in a different direction, useful in limited situations like wide orbits in case you need to bug out quickly from an engagement, or when you're approaching at an angle to increase transversal velocity but worried that if the bs or whatever you're approaching gets good shots you might not be able to totally realign and jump in time to save your ship. limited. like i said. and de'veldrin already convinced me.carry on."
4/23/2010,"ok, the first three paragraphs were basically about a spelling error, which i see so frequently perpetrated by someone commenting on a spelling error/grammatical issue. that being said, it just annoyed me and i flamed.on to your idea, i now have a better idea of what exactly you were getting at and i have both positive and negative points to make. first the good stuff.this would be a very handy feature to have. it would allow you to basically set up and alignment vector, fly around wherever you wanted, and not have to remember where you were planning to align out. you would have a picture in picture window and probably another button on the top of the overview designating, ""align to ray-vector"".heres where the bad stuff comes into play. i still don't really see the widespread application for this, and neither do i see the point. unless warping to a very isolated safe spot, most alignment is done towards celestial objects, and all that needs to be done is right-clicking, finding your align point, and clicking align.alternately, if specific alignment is needed, you can always double-click in space.i understand where you are coming from in that you can align your ship without having to break visual on an enemy, but the application of this seems like it would be much more confusing than simply turning your camera, double-clicking, and then re-focusing on the battlefield.lastly, i still like the idea of a ray pointing out from your ship and a visual cone of the d-scanner."
4/23/2010,"1. why shouldn't higher sp chars have more risk than a newbie when higher sp chars already have steep advantages, ones that they acknowledge themselves as steep by continually training them? oh right because your stupidity should be rewarded, correct?2. clones add risk to high sp chars--simple, no? risk vs reward. the risk of losing the clone vs the reward of combat skill advantages that stay with u no matter what ship u're in. without clones, podding becomes meaningless and eve takes one more step closer to being world of warcraft. do u see now or r u just that stupid like the others?3. it doesn't take high sp to fly a frigate, u know (hint: alt), unless u need all those extra sp support so badly, which u probably do since u willingly fly it with that char. in that case, risk vs reward again.4. fyi, ppl blob not because of their pod--it's because everyone's too scared to take one damn loss on their killboard they're trying to perfect. and there's almost no mechanic that counters blobbing, which guarantees a win because the game heavily, if not, completely favors it.5. the only thing that's unfair here is morons like u who think they're entitled to easy mode to eliminate risk from pvp, to be more precise, eliminate only their own risk. and obviously, u r one of those morons who just repeats everything everyone else said that i already refuted but plz continue. all of your crying could've been remedied by a little thinking but u, along with others, have proven u're incapable of this."

4/23/2010,"most of this post is copied from my jita park campaign thread. csm issues are generally not supposed to be feature requests, and this is definitely a feature request, but if there's enough interest in the idea i think that ccp might pay it mind- especially when they have been openly seeking for feedback from the csm on how to improve lowsec and npc missions.i had the idea some time ago, and only casually mentioned it at fanfest to some devs but never thought to push it further: the subject of discussion was about making missions better, and i suggested that competitive or co-operative missions be introduced. it would have to be limited in certain ways to prevent people from beating their alts over and over, but the missions could be set up to include the unpredictability and variation that eve's famous pvp offers. both participants can get a mission reward if it was actually run through, but the winner gets a bigger reward(or if its co-operative, the reward could be based on how well both players worked together).for example a mission could be created to match player a and b against each other, and they would be sent to a deadspace area that only allowed the mission runners and nobody else, and you had to kill your own npcs while remote repping the enemy's npcs so they can't kill them.or maybe you could create an eve-ified version of competitive games like capture the damsel, or football, or soccer, or chess. the possibilities for fun are endless. some of these missions would definitely have to be in highsec, but they can also be in lowsec and 0.0. the security status of each area could interact differently with the mechanics of each mission in that the penalties for shooting your competitor differ greatly(in one you can do it no worries, or you can lose sec, or get blown up)and it affects your tactics. it allows for great variation in a mission system that is currently stagnant and well known for being repetitive, and it could be used to revitalize lowsec and give highsec carebears another avenue to have fun.i think that if there's enough interest in the idea, it could maybe be presented to ccp and the csm could convince them that this significant undertaking is worth it. but it would need to be really supported, this would require ccp to dedicate programmer time as well as content creation"

4/23/2010,"now that i have put more thought into it why not make it a entirely new mechanic.based on the propulsion strength(old onused attribute) and the current shipmass,this way fleet discipline and fleet warping will also get a slight boost."
4/23/2010,why is it only turrets and lasers etc shoot from the actual mod on a ship and not missiles? we should now do this for missiles instead of it looking naff and missiles coming from underneath ship from one pointproposal - update to show missiles firing from launchers..plus it would look pretty cool :)

4/23/2010,"discussion on this exploit started not by huhus, but due to the monkeysphere actions (legitimate or not) and whine of his victims. also huhus haven't disclosed to players how to use that exploit. so in what are you accusing huhus?on what ""fact""? you're accusing huhus basing on video, but there is screenshot from the monkeysphere (lol internets is his alt) where he is not in local, which means that he is using exploit on tranqulity.but, anyway, it doesn't revokes the fact that your proposal of banning bugreporter instead of exploit user is just idiotic. understand that."

4/23/2010,"thank you, i try my best to remain objective with my posting. as a bystander i believe i can maintain this stance. as for your personal threat it is not appreciated.i believe huhuhuhuh can create a new character if he chooses but with limited skills his exploitation will be less effective.a signed nda would be acceptable had he not already made significant information already available for people to act on. regardless the key point is he has demonstrated his ability to exploit local to his advantage and must not be allowed to use this. the only fair way is to ban him temporarily while ccp quickly implement their emergency solution.of course the fix for this exploit huhuhuhu is in possession of is of utmost importance. again, hence this petition."
4/23/2010,i see no point to this thread. ccp will have to respond themselves and decide what's to happen in this exceptional situation. you seem to be only looking for some false glory attention by even creating this petition to ban someone who's endeavoring to make this a better game for the public.i vote: fail post!

4/23/2010,"are there any attacks by huhu reported with questionable local availability? i think that if he wanted to continue using this exploit, this would be a very bad way to do it, and do not believe he did it for anything else then to prove it exists (and an inch of e-peen).the video was cried for in literally dozens of posts, and in my opinion needed.if this holds true (which i believe), there is stormy weather for eve, i do not believe this is easy to fix.not supported"
4/23/2010,"until we can get definite irrefutable proof via the system (and not player testimonials) that someone is using a exploit, we cannot ban them unless we accept that player testimonials (in whatever form) are valid proof that someone is exploiting.either proof beyond reasonable doubt is the standard or it is not.plus, we have a extra problem here. if we establish that knowing a exploit warrants a ban, then this leads to the following situation being possible:(a) i uncover a exploit.(b) i use my alt to send you a ingame mail detailing how the exploit is done. (which is logged somewhere, so proof exists)(c) both my alt and your main get banned for knowing a exploit.knowing how a exploit is done becoming a bannable offense is definitely exploitable itself. for instance, imagine if he posted how the exploit is done in the thread; should not every single player who read the thread get banned for it?another thing - if knowing how to get a advantage by subverting the client in a way which cannot be proven is a issue, and a player needs to get banned for knowing this, then we have two possible courses of action to eliminate the issue of one or multiple players having a unfair advantage:(1) ban the player. aside from this being exploitable (see above), out of game communications exist, and therefore we are not certain how many players exactly have this advantage.(2) give everyone the exploit until the exploit is fixed (or, for instance, disable local until the exploit is resolved), thereby certainly removing any possibility of one or more players having a unfair advantage.logically (2) is a better choice, being non-exploitable in itself and insuring that regardless of how many people are informed of the exploit, the exploit itself does not give you any unfair advantage.how is this different then taking his word that the exploit exists and he didn't just shop the video?"

4/23/2010,"awesome, well i'm sure ccp will ban him if they want to but seeing as you've wasted about 10 minutes of my life reading this waste of drivel then i'll make a note that this can happen.monkey did not show anyone how to do it, nor has done it to benefit himself on the live server.he did submit a bug report and inform everyone that the exploit exists.if i gave people knowledge and proof such an exploit existed after notifying ccp i'm pretty sure i'd make it public as then ccp has to check the logs and will ban the people who use it in malice.now go back to your mining ccp has work to do on dust and the planets... not to mention fixing what is broken."
4/23/2010,"besides the fact that you are either hopelessly stupid or just trolling these poor people,no, honestly you don't. there are witnesses to monkey's exploits (not discussing their credibility), and no witnesses to huhuh's use of the exploit. coincidentally, bugs that exist on test server exist on real server. because one proves a bug to the skeptical population and to ccp, does not prove that they use it and abuse it on the real server. you have no proof of that. and until you have video evidence, or any evidence, you can't condemn him because of his knowledge of the bug. you can't condemn him based on the fact that he knows how, and you think he would use the exploit.now stop trolling, you have no argumentedit spelling"
4/23/2010,i think lady just dosent want to listen. huhhuh putthat video up to show the people that monkey could do it. he hasnt usedc it on tq. so if anyone needs banned its monkey and we dont have entire progh that he should be banned so this entire thread is pointless
4/23/2010,"i would support a suspension of his account.on the one hand, he discovered a game-breaking bug that is ""probably"" being used by certain parties who shall remain unnamed. however, posting exploit info on the forums is not allowed.the youtube videos are specifically targeted at a specific player, we shouldn't encourage people uploading videos accusing individuals of cheating, whether or not it is true.my thoughts: suspend huhuhuhuhuhuh's account until the bug is fixed since he clearly can not be trusted to keep his mouth shut and just /bugreport. permaban monkeysphere if convincing evidence is collected (shouldn't be difficult)."
4/23/2010,a interesting question; do you consider that ccp should implement a policy that people who provably have knowledge of how to exploit get banned until the exploit is fixed?
4/23/2010,problem still exists and should be fixed.
4/23/2010,so they fixed it. but we've to tell them if they didn't fix it. sounds reasonable.
4/23/2010,do it.
4/23/2010,absolutely not. i'm sure others before me have stated the obvious but more than 1 outpost per system provides a massive benefit to the defenders.2 additional semi random reinforcement timers per additional station.
4/23/2010,propose this again when every single 0.0 system has a station in it?
4/23/2010,"background:the assets window can be used to view contents (including fittings) of a ship in any station other than the station that the player is currently docked at.a ship in the player's current station can be right-clicked for a repair quote to view the fittings, but if and only if the station has a repairshop.problem:however, there is no way to review the fittings of an inactive ship in the same station as the player if the station does not have a repairshop. the ship must be activated to review the fittings, and this incurs a 30-second session timer.request:please change the assets window to allow a player to view contents on ships and containers in the same station as the player."
4/23/2010,"supported.i've been using jeveassets for this purpose and have felt the same way. i see no reason why ccp would not want this feature, and even if it is intentionally so then other techniques should be cleared. as its unreasonable to not display ship fittings when (for example) creating contracts i believe a simple implementation like this would be a valuable ui implementation.i can't see any real reason not to implement such an option other than feature priority."
4/23/2010,definite plus.i'm guessing unnecessary session changes are a waste of resources at both server and client end.
4/23/2010,"supportedby the way, it is possible to see fittings using eve asset manager software and full api, but i should really be available ingame."
4/23/2010,i have already raised this issue and it was passed by csm4 at the last meeting.
4/23/2010,redeemer ftw biatches!!!!!!
4/23/2010,"i'll give my take on black opsas a small gang fighter, i really don't care about their bridging/jumping abilities.as someone who likes flying in expensive ships, i have to compare black ops with faction bs and marauders.right now, black ops have 1 significant advantage over the other 2 bs groups: cloaking speed bonus and locking speed. it plays critical role for surviving gate camps. it has a small offensive advantage too, due to ability to lock target right after decloaking.but in my experience, those advantages are not quite on par with advantages of faction bs or marauders, so i'm more likely to use them than black ops. from a purely selfish pvper perspective, what i'd need in order to choose black ops over other expensive bs is either significant improvement in speed - ability to nano that would be unmatched by other bs. or i'd want stronger offensive capability - more important than stronger tanking. if only tanking ability was improved, it wouldn't really sway my decision.aside from speed and gank, the only other possibility is adding some completely new role to the ships, something nobody else can do better. like having ability to use short range cyno jammer module. or some new ew.edit: from purely selfish perspective, having covert ops cloak would make me use black ops more often. however i don't think it is good idea for overall game balance, so i don't support it."
4/23/2010,"^^this! what's the point of asking csm to raise an issue that's already raised, minuted and on ccps backlog list."
4/23/2010,"1. no covops cloaks2. better jump range3. t2 resistances4. better targeting range, at least match original hull target range or increase it.4. better bonuses i.e tracking, noone is really using cloaked velocity bonus i don't think"
4/23/2010,so basically if you pvp you never lose isk?!!!!i love it supporting*troll face*
4/23/2010,only if insurance costs more than the equipment your insuring
4/23/2010,"no. you can pretty much get insurance for anything regardless of the risk - it just costs a lot more. however, committing a criminal act would be against the policy contract and would void it."
4/23/2010,"and what is this supposed policy contract u're referring to? u mean the one where if u get your ship blown up at all while in your possession, u get the insurance payout, regardless of how u lose it?"
4/23/2010,"since i do receive feedback from a lot of players, i do feel more than qualified to take a position in this matter. it doesn't bother me as much that people can run missions, it is the fact that it is so easy, guarantees profit, and has no meaningful consequence. yes i tried to get feedback from these players, but all i got was ""waaah you nerfed my easy income, i made 100 mil an hour ganking npc's indiscriminately!"". threads like this don't help much either to get my sympathy.ccp would look into more permanent consequences but so far this hasn't happened. probably because everyone with a few destroyer alts can do it, and punishing too harshly will only result in character recycling. i must admit i am very fond of ultima online's justice system, where players could lose 20% of their stats and skills, and ultimately tossed in jail for several hours or days. there are even games where pve characters are deleted if they are caught within a certain time after the crime. now that is consequence. if you destroyed someone's npc's, then you shouldn't get off the hook by whacking off for an hour. now as i said i don't see it practical to implement an uo-style system into eve, but things should be brought more into balance, and there should be more long-term consequence to running missions."
4/23/2010,"if there is possibility to get isk by killing other players someone will do it.if you make hard penalties for killing other player, people just make alts and invent other ways to avoid penalty on their main.it seems that you want to get rid of alt suicide gankers, making penalties harder does not help on that at all.you want to do this game isk without risk game, and that kind of game is not the game i want to play.so not vote for you on this time."
4/23/2010,if you want to eliminate suicide ganking then you have to eliminate stupidity. perhaps you could lobby ccp to distribute iodine supplements to subscribers?
4/23/2010,"dohohohomy bold. the source is, unfortunately, the site that can not be named. if this is the level of respect you show to your fellow take care representatives i shudder to think of the contempt you hold us mere mortals in."
4/23/2010,"good catch, my hat* off to you good sir! and just to confirm, only one doing standing exploits on our front was ankh herself and few gallentes (both sides did cloaking exploit on some level when it was still possible).damar rocarionbrigadier general*very nice old style black hat"
4/23/2010,so basically we have a known exploiter which is asking for players using legitimate mechanics to be more sternly punished and that is their election platform? amazing.
4/23/2010,"you forgot to mention that, to add insult to injury, she's also ignorant of just about every aspect of the game other than missioning. from her own admission, she only got into fw to ""get the medals"". pathetic really..."
4/23/2010,"i feel pretty, oh so pretty. shadow. your other name is quite incomprehensible. in any event, i would like to understand why you refuse to participate in certain aspects of this great game of ours. surely participating in 0.0 pvp would give you a better understanding of the problems associated with it. you were okay with joining factional warfare in order to exploit the system and get medals, why not 0.0 or suicide ganking? furthermore, i've noticed that you have joined cva. what happened to your pledge to stand up to the giant 0.0 entities for the little guy? i don't understand how you can stand up to something you belong to. please enlighten me."
4/23/2010,"hey now, be fair. she tried to get in on pvp, she just joined cva by mistake. and she did try to stand up to the big 0.0 alliances, but it turns out that sitting in a plex for 15 minutes and hoping nobody kills you doesn't stop an outpost from getting conquered. who knew?"
4/23/2010,i will give you my vote and steal as many as i can for you.
4/23/2010,"thanks for your declarations of support, everyone! i have refined and expanded my campaign message in the op. discussion and questions are most welcome. call for focus group participation!i would like to conduct a two-hour round-robin style focus group for each key platform issue (low sec, ui improvements, logistics and ecm, blobbing, and ccp communications) before csm voting ends on 19 may. the point of these focus groups will be to identify key issues, brainstorm solutions, and identify the best ideas out of those discussed for potential submission as proposals in assembly hall.if you would like to take part, please let me know here or via evemail. we'll aim for 6-10 participants (randomly selected from a pool of interested parties); discussion will take place on hellcats ventrilo server and in an accompanying in-game chat. after each focus group, i'll summarize results in a blog post and link each post in this thread so that further discussion can ensue."
4/23/2010,"we are surprisingly alike - even living on farms and working in tech industries. i will vote for you.-lianged: formatting. i'll probably save one of my alts for voting for sok because i like his vision of cap ships. also, if you wanted to champion and push for"
4/23/2010,"i'm not her alt, i'm quite happy to be my own person. i actually ran for csm myself last term (unsuccesfully) and ccp would have not allowed us both to run if we had been the same person."
4/23/2010,"no, joke's on you aynen, you are my alt!i got the ccp confirmation e-mail for acceptance of my csm application. i'm going to take various questions sent to me here and elsewhere, put them in the format of an interview, and release the response as a video. if it turns out okay i will keep doing that."
4/23/2010,if that means i get into pandemic legion that's ok with me :)
4/23/2010,"ok, but alts dont get roles, and they also dont get forum access so :pi'm also thinking about this idea i've had some time ago, and only casually mentioned it at fanfest to some devs but never pushed it further: the subject of discussion was about making missions more dynamic, and i suggested that competitive or co-operative missions be introduced. it would have to be limited in certain ways to prevent people from beating their alts over and over, but the missions could be set up to be similar to pvp, but not focusing on killing other players. then both participants can get a mission reward if it was actually run through, but the winner gets a bigger reward.for example a mission could be created to match player a and b against each other, and they would be sent to a deadspace area that is divided into two sections with one ship allowed in at a time, and you had to kill your own npcs while remote repping the enemy's npcs so they can't kill them.or maybe you could create an eve-ified version of competitive games like capture the damsel, or football, or soccer, or chess. the possibilities are endless, and i think that if there's a lot of interest in the idea, i could present it to ccp and maybe be able to convince them that this big undertaking is worth it. some of these missions would definitely have to be in highsec, but they can also be in lowsec and 0.0. the security status of each area could interact differently with the mechanics of each mission in that the penalties for shooting your competitor differ greatly(in one you can do it no worries, or you can lose sec, or get blown up)and it affects your tactics. it allows for great variation in a mission system that is currently stagnant and known for being boring."
4/23/2010,good luck treb also:bring back screamer killer!
4/23/2010,"this. sitting on the fence isn't going to do you any favours and my questions were just about as neutral as they come. it shows either an unwillingness to 'get involved' or ignorance in those areas.having coding and programming experience is great but as far as the csm goes it plays second fiddle to communication skills and game experience, neither of which i'd say you are demonstrating so far.you can scream 'fix teh lag' as loud as you want but it won't get it fixed any faster. given the effort ccp have been putting in to trying to resolve the issue post dominion i'd say they're working pretty hard at it. i know you think you may have some great coding solutions but i'll tell you now, it's probably been tried. as far as a player moddable ui goes we've already been told 'no dice', however a general reshuffle of the ui is possibly on the cards.walls of text are great but you won't get any real votes without a proper opinion on issues or some real content."

4/23/2010,promoting it will pose to be a challenge because word-of-mouth advertising will hurt a person's chance of winning. every person you tell (if you're participating) hurts your odds. there were seven entries for week 1 and two of them won a plex! i'm working on ways to get the word out on the promotion.if it only brings a few players into the whole voting process that normally wouldn't have then the promotion is a success in my eyes.

4/23/2010,"my name is ashina sito and i am running for csm, why should you vote for me?first a little about who i am. i ran for csm4 last november. my main involvement in game covers an area that has been left out by previous and current csm. entry level pvp within eve. for the past two years i have used my in game time to expose new (and old) players to pew pew pew pvp within eve. both with fleet/gang support and experience as well as basic pvp class instruction.you can check my blog for more detailed information about the planks i have for my csm candidacy platform. a brief rundown follows.- more ""incubator"" systems/constellations/regions. places in 0.0 for new players/corps/alliances can start out.- the ability to activate plex from the web site (or eve gate).- more development of anomaly's in 0.0- basic ui fixes- a strong desire to beat to a pulp the designer of the font used by the eve ui. also a strong voice to have that font changed so you can actually read what it says. (while csm4 put this on the table i would continue to push for something to be done.)a link to the interview eve-tribune had with me last csm election.election web site since little has been done with the planks i forwarded last election i have let the blog stand (note: i did remove some cloaking and eccm issues since they are moot atm)the greatest advantage i bring as a csm candidate is that i have a greater interest in seeing the game develop and improve as a whole. while my perspective does provide a guide to how i see the game, my personal gaming experience does not interfere with my belief in balance. if anyone has any questions about my candidacy just make a post here and i will answer it."

4/23/2010,"that's actually a very tricky question.the current issue is that lowsec is not very profitable to be in for carebears/industrial types. however if you make it more profitable, 0.0 loses value in comparison, so it's a difficult balancing act.pvpers (a.k.a. pirates) have no issue there, other than the lack of targets, depending on the locations.the increase in rat bounty value (by adding bses to belts) was a step in the right direction, it is however by far insufficient. increasing rat bounties further is however not a good idea.the best idea, in my opinion, would be to introduce things in lowsec that are unobtainable in 0.0 or highsec. ccp tried that, to some extent, with boosters, but not to a degree that's in any way useful for the average player (booster manufacture is complex). the reason it has to be unobtainable anywhere else is because if it's available elsewhere, people will always prefer to do it there.i don't know exactly what it should be, but there's a number of things that are requesites. it needs to be in space, not in station, not at a pos ( or else there's no targets). ideally it should be doable solo or in small groups, it could require both industrialists and pveers, but at least require combat, otherwise the ""pure industrialist"" carebears (not degregatory term, i consider myself somewhat of one) won't go for it.an idea that was floated around during a brainstorming session on this very topic was pirate agents in stations that would require smuggling or acquiring ""illegal"" goods in space. i think that idea has merit because it requires both space and regular visits to stations, thereby making the ""people flow"" visible. what to do with those things however, i don't know, i don't much like the idea of it being transformed straight into isk.does that mostly answer your question or would you like me to elaborate on the subject?either way, should i get elected, be sure to convo me to share your thoughts on the topic."
4/23/2010,"i am sure it has been mentioned somewhere, but...what about sleepers that occasionally venture into low-sec? maybe if a worm-hole is in this low sec, a predetermined sleeper gang roams that system here and there? like everywhere there is a celestial could be a possible warp in for them? except moons. not a great boost but would definitely add some flavor to low sec.just thinking out loud."
4/23/2010,"we've made that suggestion to ccp (in the general context of improving the pve experience) and they basically said they want to leave sleepers in wormhole space (a point with which i agree), we however suggested ""super rats"" with sleeper ai. ccp said that wasn't going to happen in highsec and that they were contemplating adding it to 0.0 and, possibly, lowsec.my position on this is that it'd be a good idea. however i don't think that'd solve the ""population issue"" in lowsec. there has to be more than ""random"" spawns to lure highsec dwellers into lowsec, which is what is actually needed, not only making it better for the current inhabitants."
4/23/2010,"ladies and gentlemen of the eve online universe.it's time for a new csm member!!!!i am esharan, and i need your vote! firstly a bit about myself: i am a 22 year old student from the states studying business finance and marketing. i am an avid gamer, i have played multiple mmo's and fps games and after it all i find eve to be the most stunning and alluring. what do i love about eve? i would guess many of the same things you do, the excitement of combat the thrill of exploration, and yes the economics of the universe from mining right through productionand trade... eve to me is a total package, it offers what many games do not a chance to really carve out your own existence, and follow your own path. this is part of my reason for running for csm, i love the game and want the opportunity to be part of it, and help shape its future in a more in depth and meaningful way. i have not served on csm before, and therefore do not have a long history to show you or brag about but i can be a new face to the csm with new idea's and perspectives and ""shake up"" the already established members.you may be asking yourself, ""why should i vote for this relative unknown"" and ""who the heck is this guy anyway...."" well! the fact that i am an unknown is exactly the reason why you should give me your vote. here is why! i have been playing eve online for several years, and have been part of large corporations, and large alliances as well as small corporations and small alliances. i have seen many different aspects of the game and can relate to many different player types. in this respect i am fairly unique, i am not one of the most hardcore gamers, i love eve for what it is a game and therefore i play it as such. my position as an average gamer in eve will also allow me to maintain my unbiased opinions of eve, and keep an open mind to all potential changes that are presented whilst serving oh the council. i owe nothing to anyone, and therefore will not be seated as a puppet of any major alliance, organization or other group within in eve that may seek to push their own agenda's. furthermore, although i am your average gamer i have been exposed to all the same issues within the game as most if not all of you i understand your same frustrations, and can empathize with your opinions of the game. with this in mind i will be able to present changes and idea's to the council with fervor and passion and hopefully move the game forward and seek improvements that will benefit all of eve not just the elite few. essentially i will be a conduit for the players of eve to get thier messages, and idea's to the dev. team. that is what being on csm means to me. if elected to the csm i can promise my full dedication the ""job"", my availability to the community will be complete no one will be denied talking to me or presenting their thoughts, and i will put my full effort toward executing the will of the community. i will be able to put forth the necessary time, and am ready to make the commitment towards this council entirely and looking forward would be able to make all the meetings without any issues.i want to be your representative, not for some faux sense of power, not because i think it will make me better than ""you"" but because i think a player like me would be a solid addition to the council, because it will be fun! finally i want to be on the csm to represent you! all of you! from the casual gamer to the hardcore and i believe i can do that.vote for me, because i love eve and i want eve to be everything it can be and remain the best mmo possible. i honestly believe that i can make a difference on the council, i can be that level headed unbiased, member with no hidden agenda that just wants to make the game more enjoyable for everyone. furthermore, vote for me so i can go to iceland, and drink some beers with the development team!!!"

4/23/2010,"excellent ambiguous post. now allow me to make a few statements/questions.first, what evidence can you provide us that you will truly represent eve as a whole and not the interests of your corporation, your alliance, or 0.0 in general? will you represent all playstyles, or just the ones you have a great deal of experience with?tied in with the above, what areas of the game do you have experience with and which are your favorite game activities? what biases do you hold, and which areas of the game are you weaker in?you have stated that you're in it for fun and drinking with the devs. you apparently have no clue of what it means to be a csm delegate. when i was in the csm, i spent a great deal of effort in the project, whether in discussion with my constituents or working on ideas or compiling threads on the ah forum. what do you have to offer to tell us that you won't be a joke candidate like so many others before you (pattern, lark, mazz, etc)?lastly, what changes do you think need to be made to the game to improve it? what are your platforms on key issues from the ah (removing t2 bpos, suicide ganking, fw, pos mechanics, etc)?i haven't seen anything in the ah or f+i forums, so i do have some serious doubts about your abilities. this is why i'd rather give you this chance to prove yourself to non-nc members. best of luck.edit: removed errors in statement due to lack of information."
4/23/2010,"ok since your first comment is wrong (i am not a member of the northern coalition) i think i'll stop there... nor will i get into bantering with my potential working partners. if you can't take a joke (drinking) for what it is i am sorry. i really have no interest in getting into some sort of he said she said dirty campaigning etc. with you or anyone else, if you feel the need to put down my post thats your perogative. i plan to work hard with the other council members. like i said i have not been on csm before like you apparently and to me your post has one purpose - put down my post and make yourself look better. my platform remains/agenda remains to be a conduit of the average gamer and all thier idea's presented to me whilst on the council will be fair game and brought up.no matter what though i will remember, that eve is a game and meant to be fun for everyone inclduing csm members. i hope you havent forgotten that!"

4/23/2010,"you'll get my vote.i've only played this game for three months, and in that time i've had nothing but help, advice and friendship from esharan, where others in this game sought only to put me down because i was new and not as highly skilled as they are. because of esharans help and advice, i've spent most of my eve time in 0.0 space, and plan to stay there for a long time yet.don't let the haters put you down esh, if they feel the need to try to undermine you, then it's them with the insecurity as to wether they're as worthy of the position.good luck, and see you in space."

4/23/2010,"amanda, the post right above yours goes into detail about the problem you're describing, and what might be done to counter it. have you found any potential problems with the other proposed ideas?"
4/23/2010,"on voting rewards:there are a number of drawbacks on voting rewards, the one having been opted before in this thread being that it can turn into who can supply the greatest reward, making it more a bribe.on the flip-side, once you got people voting, even if it is for a bribe, the chance that more people will then start to become more politically active would increase, atleast in theory. not changing anything will however most likely see a further decline in the number of votes, which means that the votes that are made will represent less and less a complete picture of what the players want as a whole. to me, that drawback of doing nothing seems to far outway the drawback of bribes, which on a large scale noone can really keep up with anyway."
4/23/2010,"impeachment: far, far too easy to abuse, even with your proposed nerf to alliance voting. coalitions exist too, you know. so do informal groupings with no in-game affiliation. i don't think anyone wants to see what happens to the csm when 0.0 rage and a carebear stare collide. you'd be lucky to have one guy left. ingame reward for voting: no. any reward for voting other than the pleasure of a job well done tends to have terrible consequences. i'm fine with only the people who have actual opinions getting involved. veto: no. plenty of game design decisions are unpopular but necessary. and ultimately, ccp is the company with tens of millions of dollars invested in making eve work properly. we're just the customers. we can walk if they screw it up, but if we screw it up for them, they go bankrupt. the csm does not decide, it advises. exploration: yeah, i'm cool with seeing more of it. but this is a single issue, and not the most important. and new ships are cool, but there's a limited amount of design space, and you don't want to burn through it all right away. better to hold some things back so that the game can still get new ships in five years."
4/23/2010,"your arguments are rock solid but on the other hand i'm thinking, nothing brings out political activism like being able to complain about something you don't like, especially if people believe they have actual impact on things.how else do you entice people to get involved without destroying anything you want to keep around?"

4/24/2010,"only if they're even in raw fleet efficiency.however, consider the problem with three ships a,b, and a1 where fleet efficiency runs a<a1<b and dps runs a>b>a1. consider that a1 is perfectly substitutable for a such that people who would bring a could always bring a1 if they wanted and vice versa. since a1 > a a fleet of a1+b would always beat a fleet of a+b or a. but would lose to a fleet entirely of b.in this situation, adding b is always better than a or a1, and a1 is always better than a. this is the situation that we are in. and so long as your fleet does not go ""full ******"" and choose the fit a as standard, b is the best, both as a personal decision and as a gang decision.iirc fleet efficient apoc is 312 dps/98k ehp(a1 to the higher dps lower ehp a's) and the fleet efficient rokh is 321 dps/126k ehp(b). apoc is probably slightly more volley efficient(but has an ehp problem vs maelstroms that the rokh doesn't have)this leaves the rokh as pretty clearly the best sniper. i don't think it should be boosted from that position, liang does. not much argument can be had there."

4/24/2010,"there is a serious problem to overcome before implementing this proposal.currently when you stop research with a r&d agent you lose all the accrued rp.if this proposal was implemented without changing that mechanic people whose account lapse for a few days for whatever reason would lose all the rp, potentially months of them gathered while paying for the account. so the new mechanic should a way to keep the accrued rp or the rp should be automatically converted to datacores in the agent station."

(signature radius, cap recharge, speed...)2. balance optimal and tracking penalties.3. increase raw damage of ammo.

4/24/2010,"agreed. unfortunately this will lead to some pretty extreme cherry picking of missions.when one is declined it should receive a flag that makes it, say, 20% less likely to occur than any other mission, and that flag only lasts for four hours from the time of its decline whereupon it increases in frequency. declining again only reduces it to its normal frequency, so it may actually pop up immediately afterward. this will prevent overmuch cherry picking, and limit a lot of mission runners to four hour stints before they start getting the 'sucky' missions every time and go do something else.all declined missions are given refusal counters - this will let ccp review them after a given amount of time, to understand why they were declined and in what frequency, and perhaps make changes to them.they also need to fix story-line missions. nothing is more annoying than a manufacturing mission runner getting combat storylines, while a combat mission runner gets 'preparations for war' yet again..."
4/24/2010,"change it so you only get worlds collide, enemies abound, vengeance, angel extravaganza or storylines tbh all the other missions suck"
4/24/2010,"between this, your factional warfare exploitation and your confused message regarding 0.0 life and politics you seem very confused and inconsistent.i think even pointless forum alts like cat and that emo kid have a stronger campaign."
4/24/2010,"yet more trolling and insults removed. if you want to direct questions to the csm candidate, debate her stance on game issues, and so on, that's great. but you don't need to be a troll or a mud slinger to accomplish this."
4/24/2010,"good to see you running for csm again ank. good chance i will be voting for you again, as i've been voting take care from the start :)"
4/24/2010,"well, i can see that you are able to rattle a lot of people i consider to be jerks, so you can't be all bad."
4/24/2010,"anti-pvp, and therefore anti-eve"
4/24/2010,you'll likely get my vote. good luck.
4/24/2010,"got my vote ^^, low-sec is boring enough at the moment to make me want to go back to empire :("
4/24/2010,"mynxee,i would love to participate in these discussions. i will check back here, but please advise me by email when you post a time/date so that i can schedule around my out of game activities.claire xxx"
4/24/2010,"lowsec.. a sensitive issue for many and a part of eve that i think has potential but requires a lot of potentially difficult balancing to become 'good'.planetary interaction promises higher rewards in low- and nulsec, this could be an important new drive for industrialists to go there, but we will have to see how it works out.a whole lot has been said about this subject already but personally i feel that the 'gatecamping mentality', together with the lack of financial incentive, is too much of a killer for many potential lowsec residents. if you can't even get there even with a marginable degree of safety, people will not do so because of the small rewards. but let's hope that will change!"
4/24/2010,"you can't draw lots of people to lowsec, it just cannot support a lot of people per system. which is fine; the introduction of fw has imo turned large parts of lowsec into a counterstrike-style ****hole. the isk-making activities in lowsec (complexes largely, and a few other things) require privacy (as does the traditional way of pirating really). what we could first use imo is more lowsec, and of the non-fw variety.anyway, confirming sokratesz is a good candidate."
4/24/2010,"i want to start by saying i think the eve community will end up with the best csm to date this next term. the candidate list has some of the best csm members ever. a more talented and dedicated bunch has never been assembled before. so please take the time and learn what the candidates are about and please please vote this next election!so what am i offering as a candidate:1. past csm experience! csm2 and csm3 (fill in) member. i understand the csm and how it benefits all the pilots in eve.2. i am commited to the process. i will make the meetings. i will have an opinion. i will represent the folks that vote for me in every way i can.3. i am a software engineer with games industry experience. i have a real understanding of the trade offs any feature might involve and i can call ""bs"" if we are told something is either ""easy"" or ""hard"" to do if the argument isn't supported with the hard technical realities of game development.4. i have played eve for 5 years, have run a corporation i created for 4 years and run a small alliance i founded several years back. i understand the challenges of trying to motivate players to unite for a common purpose.5. i love eve from a more fun and low key focus. i know not all players want to be in giant 0.0 power blocks and fly nothing but t3. i know there is a great time to be had mining a 'roid, to experience the thrill of your first batleship, to experience solo ratting, low level missions and just ""havin fun in the 'verse"". i want to be the voice of the pilots that just want to find a place in eve on their own terms, be it npc corps, solo play or more intense play.6. i recognize a lot of people see eve as best experienced in ways other than the ones i like! eve's strenght is the breadth of experiences. so i respect players that pirate, gank, play the eve ""end game"", that live in wormhole or want to take their eve experiences to another level. that matters as much (but no more) as that new player in a bantam dreaming of being able to fly a commorant!.7. i believe eve is the only game to date with a real working ecconomy and that preserving that is key to perserving the wonder that is eve.8. i am approachable, open minded and smarter than the average picnic basket. i think as a csm member i am a representative of the folks share the 'verse with me. if you have an idea, an opinion or just want to chat, i am available! i will listen let you know in a clear manner what i think and if i can do someting to move your ideas forward.9. i am not nor will i ever be one of the ""cool kids"". i could never get a job at a record store! no inside dealings or elite perspectives from me. so i'll never make a decision or offer an opinion to better some ""clique"".10. i am not doing this for attention or a free trip to iceland. i am doing this because i love this game and i want to be part of helping the players make it even better!11. i am not going to over promise. i won't claim i'm going to get your favorite feature in the next expansion. i also won't ever take credit for any aspect of eve. what you see in eve comes from the best and worst ideas of a lot of folks. all i will promise is i understand what being a ""thought leader"" is and i will try to get ccp moving eve in a direction consistent with the values i'll openly share in the course of this election.12. i am about fun, eve should be fun, not silly, but rewarding in the end. i hope to help make that happen with my own humor and sensibilities, space needs a little more randomness and moments that bring a smile.13. it is now time to reveal 13! the video! tada o campaign advisor aiissler dainzecsm 2csm 3founder and ceo tadakstu obata corporationfounder of the honda accord"
4/24/2010,"hi issleri think i voted for you in the last csm, i like your calm and considerate 'everyone counts' approach, even if i forgot the details. but you made up a lengthy (pdf?) file last time and i was just wondering what kind of things changed or were proposed from that list of things, now and for the future :)i don't really read up on a lot of things so i'm not always up to dateto our everchanging evegood to see you back anyway!greets,mercurye"
4/24/2010,what a joke. get out.
4/24/2010,"larkonis, apart from your reprehensible behavior when you were on csm, your latest post in which you blatantly misrepresent my position on lag is just another example of why i won't waste my time getting into pointless arguments with you. go away, little troll.for the benefit of those who might be confused, my position on lag is simple:* lag will never be fixed without gameplay changes.* the nature of those gameplay changes is something that needs to be carefully and broadly discussed, especially considering eve is a game where unintended consequences are the rule.* csm will play a crucial role in that discussion. csm has played a useful role in bringing 'micro' issues to ccp's attention, but imho it needs to shift a bit more in the direction of the 'macro' issues."
4/24/2010,"so you don't want to fix the lag? you may want to go back and edit the op. lark's a touch unkind, but a troll he's really not. and if you're going to be this touchy about someone asking you perfectly reasonable questions, why should we assume you'll be any less unreasonable as a csm rep? so let's bring this out of the realm of platitudes. what gameplay changes do you propose that will make it such that a fc will say ""okay guys, that's enough in gang, the rest of you can go back to ratting""?"
4/24/2010,"hi cat,what have you done besides fly your ibis around rancer.i wish you good luck because you're really going to need it.seconding lark while i'm at it."
4/24/2010,"agreed.plus, cat kinda annoys me. like, to the point where i wish she didn't post in threads,"

4/24/2010,"hello cat,i have no questions to ask of you, just wanted to wish you luck in your csm run."
4/24/2010,as u might know cat has very gud ideas and tho u wont believe (its a bit of a secret lol) dont want to stop piracy for good cuz then we wouldnt have nething to do xx
4/24/2010,how do you respond to evidence suggesting that you are co-operating with the united in taking down innocent sightseers?
4/24/2010,confirming i am voting for cat good luck with the csm campaign
4/24/2010,i would have voted for larkonis since everyone deserves a second chance to get away with something without getting caught but now i will vote for cat unless someone convinces me of a better candidate or unless another candidate will promise to advocate for the implementation of parrots as a ninja utility ship class.

4/24/2010,"real name scott manley, born in scotland and moved to california in 1999, i'm a sci-fi fan and was a professional astronomer before i moved to the us. why do i want to serve on the csm?* because i love eve, it's the spiritual successor to elite, the favorite game from my youth, it's unlike almost any other game out there and plays by its own rules. i want to see it continue to thrive, and believe that i have qualifications that would make me a clear asset to the csm.why i'm qualified for csm* 2 years of eve, an encyclopedic knowledge of game mechanics and history.* i know all about real space science, i spent a decade in astronomical research, specificly in the field of asteroids, comets and the kind of mess they make when they hit planets.* i'm a software developer by trade so i understand all the technical stuff that makes eve work, and what goes on to make the technical stuff that makes eve work.* i've been a sci-fi fan since i was taken to see star wars when i was 4 years old. i'm a big fan of ian m banks.* more than just a consumer of sci-fi, i've provided technical assistance to authors: in particular i provided technical details for a comet impact on pern to anne mccaffrey for the bestselling book 'skies of pern'.* i do everything in the game - 0.0 pvp, hi-sec mining, missioning, exploring, market manipulation, theorycrafting, and dreaming up cunning plans. i generally suck at all these things.* i can be a serious player, cooking up spreadsheets for my industrial endevours to maximize my profits.* i can be a sneaky player, roaming around undetected and scouting stuff.* i fly every t1 sub capital in the game, so when people whine about ships sucking i can say i have first hand experience.* i can be stupid, running missions in a hulk, spelling out song lyrics using ship wrecks, or just creating fireworks for new years eve.* i like going back to noob characters, doing noob things and answering questions in the rookie channel.* i can detect a forum troll at 50au.* i play eve with my 5 year old daughter, so i'm supremely capable of dealing with people who think they know everything and act like children until they get their way. i imagine this is an invaluable skill for csm duties.what kind of issues would i like to see addressed. (in my wildest dreams)* local chat as an intel source - intel tools need to be promoted to being more than a side effect. * bookmarks visible in space and on the overview: this would help the elite pvper warping around grid and the 5 year old who has trouble right clicking through cascading menus.* server side storage for all those client side settings that keep getting lost: i just reinstalled a system recently and find myself having to setup everything again.* noob ships need balancing: no other csm candidate will champion this, but that doesn't mean it's not true.* t2 ammo: except for sniping t2 ammo is generally fail.* assault frigates: still waiting on a bit more awesome.* ease of use: automagic group weapons command, simplified drone controls for ships with small numbers of drones. make this stuff less of a chore.* periodic logging of structure hp to the server: because it sucks to have a 350million hp outpost reset when the cluster crashes.* give small gangs more things to do in alliance warfare: shutdown planetary production, structures to shoot with less than 1million hp. * player bounties: make it impossible for the target to benefit.tl;dri'm a smart guy, i do lots of stuff in eve, so i have experience of almost everything, i'm not affiliated with any massive power block.i don't want to give advantages to one particular play style, i'm not looking out for the industrialists, orthe missioners or the pvpers, i'm looking out for the people who like flying big spaceships and using them to blow up other ships or build more ships (to be blown up)."
4/24/2010,"i would sincerely like to second illectro's/scott's candidancy for csm.no one i know in game has a more encylopedic knowledge of so many different aspects of gameplay than he. besides truly caring about the game and its development, he is always trying to help others by fielding questions from from noobs to experts, thereby improving the game experience for them.having recruited him to our old corp and having gone from high, low, and 0.0 together in different alliances, i have gotten to know him well, although i never knew he was an astronomer?!?i have been truly lucky to experience the game with him around - so should you by supporting him for csm. i can't think of anyone better to represent the true spectrum of players in eve!check out his blog, eve ilectrocuted!"
4/24/2010,"confirming that he really does love his noob ships, and that his 5 year old pwns him on a regular basis... in all seriousness though, he is the real deal, and you can take him at face vvalue. he is a hardcore player, even running a client while at work all day long (i hope your boss doesn't read this) and that his word is as good as gold."
4/24/2010,this man is okay at playing eve.he usually flies ibis's and kinda sucks at pvp but overall hes a good candidate
4/24/2010,all of eve would be benifited by a csm such as this man!bump!
4/24/2010,a good candidate
4/24/2010,"i know illectroculus defined is the best candidate for csm bar none. he is by far the most driven and determined player i have met in my 6 years playing eve. his technical knowledge and willingness to help has greatly attributed to his alliance. illectroculus defined brings things to the table that none of the other candidates will, and he is in my opinion the best and only candidate for csm."
4/24/2010,"don't knock the ibis, it can snipe ships out beyond 50km and has a bigger drone bay than most caldari frigates, but it really needs a missile hardpoint to make it a proper caldari ship. the impairor on the other hand needs changed, a laser cap bonus doesn't help if you can't fit enough lasers to stress the capacitor."
4/24/2010,"my name is alathus christensen, and i support this message."
4/24/2010,"that is why ccp should allow for multiple ways to influence a given constellation (or system) in lowsec. 0.0 right now is purely pvp for determining who controls an area. why not create a mixture in lowsec where industrialists can assert influence just as much as pvpers.how? the transporting of trade goods (or supplies) into the system which impacts concord's logistics in a positive way. the progression or deterioration of a system would be a slow one which might take a month to swing any large amount in one direction. the more hospitable an area is the better the reward/standing for mission running could be too. this could be a way for 0.0 empires to have some influence over their lowsec supply systems. and on the same count a way to make those systems harder for those entities to operate from if you're a pirate.i'm going to expand on this whole line of thought on my web site this week, so stay tuned if lowsec development interests you! if it can be tracked in a reasonable manner then i have no problem seeing the drop rate increased. the problem i forsee however is multiple people running a plex together and the potential to game system if it guarantees a drop after x number of completed complexes."
4/24/2010,"eve is known for it's learning curve, i think we've all seen the humorous graphic about it. it has always been a stumbling block for many of my friends i've tried to introduce eve too, and they never was able to get past it and continue playing, they've time and time given up. do you feel ccp has done enough in recent expansions to address this stumbling block for new players, and if not what do you think they should do to increase new player retention? specifically what comes to mind is the new pi for the next expansion adding an addtional layer of complexity to the game. it seems every expansion adds something more complex, and increases that learning curve."
4/24/2010,thanks for the support! :)

4/24/2010,you got my vote..... cinori for csm
4/24/2010,as a person working alongside lycanthis on a daily bases my opinion is probably biased however i think with his knowledge and experiance in eve over the years and the fact that he has some plans i strongly agree with he would be an excelent person for csm5.also he spends a huge amount of his time (even when he should be working) and his love for the game speaks for itself.+1 vote from me :)

4/24/2010,oz did a good job as a secretary and csm member. for the candidates i have seen so far it is my best pick and i think that we really need someone dedicated to the industrial part of eve in the csm. he will have my votes.
4/24/2010,supported! woo!
4/24/2010,"do i have a campaign focus?? yes, a very simple one. i listen (or read as case may be) to the issues, problems and wants of the eve community. but listening alone is not enough. from what i hear, i sift and mull over until i have a workable solution - either my own or the ideas of others. then, i get it done!! this is what i intend to bring to csm5 - the focus and determination to bring our issues to ccp, and see them through to fruition.i have been playing eve since 2005, with wide experience ranging from pvp, mission running and blob warfare to serious mining, expert building and a little wormhole dwelling as well. with this range of experience, i have the knowledge and expertise to view the issues from many angles; perhaps seeing solutions where others have overlooked them. i am good at finding workable compromises as well, which usually leaves all sides happy with the outcome. this too i will bring to the csm5.greymouse for csm5"
4/24/2010,"i was looking back over the list of candidates and realized that, once again, i am the elder of the group. when i ran for csm4 (and lost ), it was the same way. that gives me a perspective gained from experience (graduate of uhk - the university of hard knocks) that few other candidates can claim. perhaps it means something; perhaps it is meaningless. either way, i bring many, many years of gaming as well as rl experience to the table. greymouse for csm5grasp it - grok it - do it!!(whew... does that date me or what??? )"
4/24/2010,"i'm right there with you sister, just a couple of steps (years) behind! best luck in your campaign. perhaps we will both have the good fortune to be elected and work together on the csm and bring our decades of wisdom (or is that cynicism?! ) to the table!"

4/24/2010,"hello there, i see you have stumbled upon my humble little thread. many of you know me as the maverick navy's ceo, or perhaps a leader in it alliance. i come to you as a fellow player, concerned about where eve is going and looking to perhaps throw my own two cents into melting pot. i, much like many of you who fight and live in 0.0 and low-sec not to mention empire space have experienced the pleasures, and pains of playing this game we all cherish and love (sometimes hate) called eve online.we hear of the many new ""additions"" being brought to eve, some seem interesting - some even groundbreaking, ""bleeding edge"" sort of material we only salivate about in reading the next generation of pvp-oriented mmorpgs. but there are also things that disturb me while we read about all of these additions that seem like vaporware, such as ""walking in stations"" and the ""improved"" ui which has left mailing lists and corp tabs in shambles.i feel things such as the basics have become neglected. servers crashing, ""stack-less io"" suddenly not making 1200 man fleet battles lag free anymore, we are in a rut. eve is facing stagnation - the homogeneous nature of 0.0 in the past year has led to a sense of complacency in eve, perhaps on the part of the developer's who feel that we, the consumers will continue to fill their wallets with money even as ""greener pastures"" of ""superior"" mmos come to the forefront. leaving eve, archaic and barren.while this is a wall of text, i'm trying to articulate on a finer point. eve needs to focus on what it has, and fix the problems that have been here since launch, and incorporate more quality content at all levels.here are few of my ideas:1. user interface / fixing the games ""bugs"" - it's clunky and sometimes hard to work with, especially when working on the corporation management side. i've had times where i've been worried about trusting pos towers even after they had been set correctly. i still remember being shot at by cva's towers in r3, even through i was in the bubble and +10....2. game immersion - ccp claims it wants to ""immerse us"" into the world of new eden, it does a very good job - however i feel they perhaps shirk the responsibility of delivering content to the level it's customers (especially those who enjoy this sort of content) deserve. we see npc regions in 0.0, but they have ""regular"" stations in them, no unique models for their outposts or special gates - i feel this is a minor work that can ""go a long way"" in fleshing out our game universe better. eve tv and the old school isd really helped turn eve into something you can ""live"", i'd like to see more of this back. eve is so much more than just a ""mmo"" it's an experience.3. faction capitals - we have amarr navy apocalypses but we do not have amarr navy revelations! i propose a ""easy way"" to add new ships to the game and ""spice up"" capital warfare - faction capitals! take a ""regular"" capital, throw it back into the cooker (with a blueprint) for a period of time, and you get a superior version of of the capital much as you would do to a regular pos tower. same thing could be applied to super capitals even however this is just a idea. i'm always open to ideas and will never shy from a good one. i'd like to think i'd make a capable csm, i have a clear understanding of the game and as one of the preeminent leaders in the largest alliance in the game, i think i have the right perspective to see the ""big picture"" if you will, about eve in general. i ask you for your vote, i promise i will do my best - regardless of what side you are on - to ensure that your interests as a paying customer are upheld to the letter.i've also participated in eve's 2008 alliance panel, i'm the guy who represented huhu. i have my fun, i hope you'll join with me to making sure we all have it together!"

4/24/2010,"i will be joining this channel as well. i welcome all questions to help me show that i am the very best candidate for the job. i also welcome all the emo hatred questions from all these fail csm representatives as they try and sabotage my candidacy.sorry csm, but the people will see right thru your lies."
4/24/2010,the mouse will be hanging around the channel as well. it is definitely active.greymouse for csm5listen! think! do!
4/24/2010,"yep, i'll be there too. it'll be an interesting atmosphere with so many competitors in one place."
4/24/2010,"or should we consider each other potential future collaborators? :) i'm in the channel as well. depending on what i'm doing in-game i may or may not be highly active there, however. i find it difficult to chat while shooting things in the face."
4/24/2010,i thought women are supposed to be good at multitasking
4/24/2010,"there's only so many slots for tasks, man, even in my bonused female brain! loading weapons, maintaining range, watching local, spamming the d-scanner, shooting drones, painting fingernails...about the only coherent words i can spew out at such times is ""boom headshot!"" (or as likely, ""<expletive>, go go go warp warp warp.... phew, got my pod out!"")."
4/24/2010,"agreed. unfortunately this will lead to some pretty extreme cherry picking of missions.when one is declined it should receive a flag that makes it, say, 20% less likely to occur than any other mission, and that flag only lasts for four hours from the time of its decline whereupon it increases in frequency. declining again only reduces it to its normal frequency, so it may actually pop up immediately afterward. this will prevent overmuch cherry picking, and limit a lot of mission runners to four hour stints before they start getting the 'sucky' missions every time and go do something else.all declined missions are given refusal counters - this will let ccp review them after a given amount of time, to understand why they were declined and in what frequency, and perhaps make changes to them.they also need to fix story-line missions. nothing is more annoying than a manufacturing mission runner getting combat storylines, while a combat mission runner gets 'preparations for war' yet again..."
4/24/2010,"change it so you only get worlds collide, enemies abound, vengeance, angel extravaganza or storylines tbh all the other missions suck"
4/25/2010,"i want to make some changes to the back ops as part of my csm campaign. i want to give the black ops ships covert ops cloak capability, increased jump range and remove the targeting delay. it might also benefit from a marauder style bonus of 100% to weapons damage and limit the weapon slots to 4. this ship could them be used for raiding more effectively, hit and run on outposts and jump out before your enemy can respond seems like a good role for this ship."
4/25/2010,"/signed if i haven't already.also bump for the old, cool effect"
4/25/2010,stupid jump effects have to go.
4/25/2010,"the difference here stems from the tier system. long range is the niche for caldari turret-ships and caldari is the only faction that have their tier3 bs designed as an pure sniper. its by the same token that the tier1 brutix falls flat when compared to the hurricane or the harbinger. in sniper works, the rokh should have a clear edge vs the tier2 apoc, imo."
4/25/2010,tier differences are not a good idea and most players are quite against them. i don't think you're going to get any sympathy by saying that the tier 3 ship should be strictly better just because its tier 3.
4/25/2010,"let me put it this way; as long as there is a tier system, the rokh should not be an exception from it. considering that long range is the niche for caldari turret-ships and they are the only faction with their tier3 bs designed as a sniper; it should not come as a surprise if the rokh have a clear edge in long range engagements."
4/25/2010,"the rokh isn't exempt from it. it receives all the benefits that all high tier battleships get. edit: and they do have the clear edge, the question is simply how much of a clear edge."
4/25/2010,supported
4/25/2010,this is an example of why i don't think this should be implemented. with the current game mechanics a ratter/miner can be safe. we don't need bookmarks on the overview or ability to align to bookmarks to make it even safer.
4/25/2010,"i'm mixed on this. if one sets their prefs correctly, bms show up in the celestial maps. taking a moment to bring up your map, align, then drop the map usually won't put you in major danger.... if you are mining or ratting that is. in warfare situations that moment can be the live/die factor since you are blind in a visual sense. still, well-configured overviews reveal dangers far quicker than eyeballing space can.i'll support this for two reasons. the first... i'm basically lazy. being able to configure my bms into the overview would be a definite time-saver. secondly, i feel this should be debated by the csm and ccp. so../supportedgreymouse for csm5**pushing issues like this***onto the table"
4/25/2010,"this is a good idea, supported"
4/25/2010,100% supported! come on ccp - colony wars on the playstation 1 had better sound than this!!!~edit- clicked on support this topic this time heh...
4/25/2010,i think they did.
4/25/2010,"the reason is simple, each drone is an independent entity. the server sees your drones as in independent ship when it comes to damage. each drone would get it's own combat log. additionally drones are bugged enough. i would hate to add another layer to it. the final issue is that ccp hates drones. from the node management position +1 drone is basically the same as +1 player. more drones = more lag.even so, i would very much like to see what my drones are doing. although the coding for this may too complex to deal with."
4/25/2010,if your sensor strengt is bigger than your sig radius your inprobable. its a exploit and it should be removed and people using should be banned.
4/25/2010,not an exploit.it's like the soon to be dead deep safe spots your still killable you just can be scanned.
4/25/2010,not supported. just as the cloak nerf.
4/25/2010,strongly not supported.
4/25/2010,"first:just because you don't agree with a game mechanic doesn't make it an exploit.second, you haven't presented any coherent reasons why this should be removed aside from the obvious fact that you don't agree with it.no support"
4/25/2010,"just make it harder by tweaking the probing mechanic so that not every ship in eve can pull it off. should be possible for recons, t3, coverts and even blackops but not for bog-standard bs and the like .. makes no sense to arbitrarily forbid it after probing has become a 5-6s affair.ccp should expand on the whole subterfuge part of eve like they did with the new bombers and the covert bridge. gives the ""little guy"" a weapon to use to kick the ""big guys"" in the balls and get away with it."
4/25/2010,that is how it currently is ;)
4/25/2010,hirana: you already gimp your fit quite a bit to get that.
4/25/2010,"making yourself unscannable strains the fitting of your ship in such a way that you cannot be very effective in any other area - i consider it a tactical choice between role effectiveness and sneakyness and i don't have any problems with that (yet).(show me an affordable fit that is unprobable, has a mwd, disruptor, reasonable buffer and some sort of dps on a ship class of your choice, and i might reconsider)"
4/25/2010,you can get reasonable active tanks/dps for pve on t3 cruisers. though i think that fits normally have no mwd/ab.atm the 2 big things people whine about:double eccm t3 cruiser running missions in lowsec/nullsec.double eccm t3 cruiser with gang links.but well.
4/25/2010,"still, i dare you to show me a ship that fits the criteria listed above. passive tanking a lvl 4 in a tengu while being unscannable doesn't ;)"
4/25/2010,"fw implants + 2 eccm + 2 remote eccm pushes a navy armageddon to 330 sensor strength with a 370 signature, well beyond ""normal"" probes (non-maxed, implanted, sisters etc.) ability to track down. that is before any gang-links are even added to the mix.hardly a gimped fit unless you consider tackling bs an absolute necessity.isn't that a bit too easy?"
4/25/2010,2 remote eccm means no solo fit .... and a quite quite hefty price tag for the whole combo if you ask me. :)
4/25/2010,"i have to agree, the concept of t3 cruisers running 3 heavily bonused warfare links, having cov ops cloak and nullifier subsystem to traverse systems easily, and provide their bonus without the need for a pos or station to be 100% safe from being probed and killed is a bit odd.then again thats pretty much the only useful thing they do in pvp, so meh.not supported, though individual scenarios might be a bit off i admit."
4/25/2010,"while i do agree with this the better fix is to make it so that command module bonuses only work if your on grid. as to the topic i agree with quote above. a cloaked ship is far more of a threat. the main complaint seems to be that players can not scan down mission runners. as many people have said, you can catch them at the gates or stations.my only real concern is that i do want to see eccm rigs put in game and that would make it even easier to get a ship into an unprobable state. adding a rig option may allow for usable, affordable, ships that can not be probed. that would be a bad thing."
4/25/2010,"you are aware that doubling the sig res of a gun is exactly the same as halving its tracking, right? you're proposing a 50% dps increase in place of the current 17%, and having the only additional penalty be a bit of tracking. that's just silly."
4/25/2010,"as much as i love more gank in the game, this would overpower battlecruisers to the point where they outdamage gank bs."
4/25/2010,"supported.short-short: i see this as useful versus hulls a size up from your own.long-short: the bonuses need to be in line with why you would want to fit short range ammo in long range weapons. namely your sniper fleet got compromised, or something smaller / faster than you has got under your usual range."
4/25/2010,"supported, it is teh suck."
4/25/2010,i have no idea why they ever created that stupid bloody shadow.
4/25/2010,"im bumping this since there is alot of support and no one has said ""no"" so i guess its somthing ppl want just under the radar."
4/25/2010,supported
4/25/2010,"the shadow is there to give orientation of the bubble on the plane of the system while at a vantage point that is not directly above or below. however, it is extremely frustrating and hides the probe movement boxes, so i agree. maybe it should just have a faint green circle where it would intersect on the solar system plane."
4/25/2010,"it's frustrating, thats why it should be removed."
4/25/2010,i support this. only the priviledged few in the higher echelons of pandemic legion have been allowed access to the sphere application when it should be shared with all.
4/25/2010,"sounds awesome. if designated fc starts a fleet, the button flashes. nice i like."

4/25/2010,best idea ever and i would totally raise it to ccp if i got elected
4/25/2010,"hey all, i've played eve on and off for several years now, and one of the things i thoroughly enjoy is the opportunity to craft and eventually sell goods on the market. as many industrialists and manufacturers will tell you though, this crap weighs a ton!during my experiences, it seems to me that eve is lacking a certain middle ground in terms of maximum cargo capacity, speed, and durability for its proverbial beasts of burden. on one end of the spectrum we have the iteron mark v. with a maximum cargo space of around 25k, or a tad more if you're using secure containers, we have the pinnacle of cheap hauling for the average high-sec industrialist. for those who produce way more than typical while also using millions of materials to boot though, this ""little"" ship just doesn't cut it. the next obvious choice, which also happens to lie on the extreme opposite end of the spectrum, is the freighter. for those who do intermediate hauling, for instance in the 50-250k weight range, the mighty freighter can feel a little overkill. to put it even simpler: like using a hammer to swat a fly. i feel like i'm wasting my time hauling goods that only take up 10% of my maximum allowable cargo weight to a local trade hub. some have mentioned the orca, with its warp speed of 2.7 au/s over the freighter's 0.75 au/s, but it's really not the greatest alternative. and it takes nearly double the amount of training time to get into as the freighter.this is where i feel that eve could greatly benefit from a new industrial ship line. perhaps ore or the four main factions have been holding out on us and now finally decide to divulge their secret hauler. i'm not quite sure what ccp could call the new line, as i've never been great at naming things. perhaps heavy industrials or something as equally uncreative. see, i told ya i sucked at naming things . basically, a new ship type that holds more than the itty v as well as being slower, but nowhere near as much or as snail-paced as the freighter. in any case, i figured i'd bring this idea to the csm and see what you guys thought about it. since ccp is kinda boosting the industrial side of the game with the new expansion, the timing seems to work well here.anyways, cheers and fly safe. oh, and thanks for reading. tldr - a new, middle-ground hauler that can handle heavier loads than the lowly industrials.note - updated with my thoughts about the orca"
4/25/2010,the problem was solved with the introduction of 132 714m<U+FFFD> hauler.also the armor tanked transport ships can easily reach 39k m<U+FFFD>. though they are dirt slow then. so i still prefer the orca.and the 2.7au are faaaaaaaaaaaast compared to the 0.7au of the freighter. last but not least ... if you web the orca/freighter the ships suddenly align plenty fast. but yeah not exactly afk hauling anymore then.
4/25/2010,the orca is the ship you want. you do not need to ask for a second orca.
4/25/2010,"thank you for your response darius, i'll go through your post bit by bit. sorta kinda. to me, the orca doesn't fulfill the role of ""hauler middle ground"" all that well, despite the cargo hold. let's look at the skills necessary to fly both the orca and the charon. according to the skill plan i created with eve mon using the most basic of characters, it would take someone approximately 61 days before they are able to pilot an orca, while it would take a fresh character only 32 days to jump into a freighter. (i didn't include learning skills in my computations) obviously the times will be slightly different based on implants and skill layouts, but the general idea remains the same.while the orca can fulfill this role which i believe is missing, it really wasn't designed specifically with this in mind, hence the increased skill cost. i appreciate this info as i wasn't aware that the transport ships were capable of this capacity, but needing only 1 different skill to pilot, it takes just as long to get into as the freighter. although it's definitely a viable alternative to use over the itty v if you're able to pilot a freighter, it's a shame it doesn't have a bigger cargo space. but, as you know i'm sure, the transport ships were mainly designed and revamped for low-sec and 0.0 hauling because of the cloak or the resistance to warp jamming. based on what ship you flew anyway.yep, i mention this in my op, but as i explained in my response to you, the orca takes nearly double the time to get into. i wrote the op geared more towards the solo industrialists, but yep that does work. and yea, not exactly afk hauling :d.thanks for the response, i appreciate it."
4/25/2010,your conveniently leaving out a few key details in your little comparison.the orca is cheaper for one.the freighter is not.the orca is more flexible in functionality than the freighter is.all the freighter does is haul goods in mass.the orca can load and unload cargo in space... the freighter can't.so in all honesty what your looking for is an orca sized hauler that can haul more stuff and not take so long to train.not going to happen.... no ship will ever fit anyone's needs perfectly... that's the point.eve is not supposed to be easy... its supposed to be a challenge.transport ships also double as better/stronger hauler... not necessarily a bigger hauler.as everyone says.. adapt or die.personally the orca is the perfect middle ground for all things hauling... if it could carry more it would be too powerful.there are times i wish it could hold more... but then i realize a lot of it is me making the problem and not the other way around.so in conclusion... not supporting... at least for now.
4/25/2010,i just throw this into here cause i feel no one has noticed it so far.well the orca was never a hauling ship it was intended to be a mining support shipand thus i think there is still space for a med sized hauler which should have around 1/3 of the cargo space of a freighter and requires something like transport ship to 4 to get the orca back to it intended role you could limit the orcas cargo to ores onlycrazy
4/25/2010,"1. the orca is a multi role ship2. even when we assume, its primary role is mining support, nobody stops you from using it outside of that role."
4/25/2010,"the orca was designed specifically as a small freighter. yeah, it helps with mining, and the skills go in a different direction, but it's a small freighter."
4/25/2010,there is no need to make a medium weight hauler when you can use the orca. qq moar about training time. this idea is redundant.
4/25/2010,"ok if you dont want to train for an orca and maybe cant afford a freighter, exactly what are you looking for in this new class of transport ?i think a smaller freighter has been looked at before and i think that is where the orca came from anyway, that and the need for a better hauler for mining ."
4/25/2010,"hey all, just wanted to thank you guys for your thoughts and criticisms. i'll go through each of your posts and respond to them accordingly.well, it really wasn't out of convenience, more so out of forgetfulness . nope, no arguments there.while true to a certain extent, the freighter can unload and load at an online pos. but that's not really the point of my post. well, that is the point of my op. the reason the orca takes so long to train in comparison to the freighter is because of all the extra stuff it can do. in reality, you can only use a percentage of the orca's maximum cargo bay, due to hold restrictions or what not. is there really a problem with having a mid-sized hauler that just hauls without the trimmings? this is a misnomer as there wouldn't be any role-specific ships such as e-war, mining, hauling, recon, logistics, etc. when did i say it wasn't? was this the reason people gave when they were asking for a high-sec version of the rorqual? thanks for your input! thank you for your input. for me personally, the increased training time isn't a big deal. but in the big picture, it doesn't make sense. does it make sense that the middle-ground freighter, as you've put it, takes much longer to train than the best hauler in the whole game? i understand it performs other roles than just haul, but it wouldn't make sense if the osprey took longer to train than the covetor, just because it can fit missiles, armor, and is better at using shield transporters as well as being able to mine well. this is not a post about me, me, me. i can fly the iteron v, the orca, and freighters for both the gallente and the caldari. i wasn't creating this post in a selfish attempt to better my specific situation. apologies if you feel that way. anyway, thank you all again for your comments and ideas."
4/25/2010,"hey centurax, as i mention in the post that came just after yours, i can fly all three ship types. apologies, i didn't see your post before i put mine up. basically, i'm looking for a simple ship that can haul anywhere from 50,000m3 to 200,000. simple as that, nothing elaborate or anything that hurts the other ship types, specifically the orca. non-mining traders and industrialists gain little to no benefit from the ship maintenance array or the corp hangar, and they're left with a 90,000m3 cargohold. which isn't bad in the least to be honest :). the orca was merely a response to the rorqual, as high-sec miners wanted something that could fulfill a similar role, corp-based mining ops, but one that is allowed to enter high-sec. i'm just looking for something simple that just hauls mid-level cargo. nothing more, nothing less. training times can be anything, the ship could need race-specific industry to 5, but a cheaper skillbook to use. the ship can cost from 100-200 mil. didn't really think that specifically.anyway, thanks for the input."
4/25/2010,"false. the corp hangar gives you 40km3 of storage(better than an itty 5), no matter what you're hauling. corp hangars can be used by the pilot, and have zero restrictions on what can go in them. the ore and ship bays are limited, but the cargo and corp bays are open."
4/25/2010,"oops my mistake. apologies, long day today ."
4/25/2010,before i forget it again ... try an orca with 2 istabs in the lows.^^

4/25/2010,"hey centurax, as i mention in the post that came just after yours, i can fly all three ship types. apologies, i didn't see your post before i put mine up. basically, i'm looking for a simple ship that can haul anywhere from 50,000m3 to 200,000. simple as that, nothing elaborate or anything that hurts the other ship types, specifically the orca. non-mining traders and industrialists gain little to no benefit from the ship maintenance array or the corp hangar, and they're left with a 90,000m3 cargohold. which isn't bad in the least to be honest :). the orca was merely a response to the rorqual, as high-sec miners wanted something that could fulfill a similar role, corp-based mining ops, but one that is allowed to enter high-sec. i'm just looking for something simple that just hauls mid-level cargo. nothing more, nothing less. training times can be anything, the ship could need race-specific industry to 5, but a cheaper skillbook to use. the ship can cost from 100-200 mil. didn't really think that specifically.anyway, thanks for the input."
4/25/2010,"false. the corp hangar gives you 40km3 of storage(better than an itty 5), no matter what you're hauling. corp hangars can be used by the pilot, and have zero restrictions on what can go in them. the ore and ship bays are limited, but the cargo and corp bays are open."

'cause 10 seconds is too fast for u to even react?u ignore parts of my posts u can't refute and call it ""illogical"", ask for a reason to deny this change because u ignored the reason i already stated (many times), and on top of that, claim u're not a high sp char and would not be affected, yet the tone of your post suggests otherwise, so either 1. u're lying with the ""i want to buff x but i'm not x"" routine or 2. u're too stupid to make enough income to afford a 20 mil sp clone. either way, u're the troll and/or moron who wants that easy mode so badly 'cause u're incapable of playing without one. at any rate, keep it coming plz...next!"
4/25/2010,"hey look. i can respond to you using your own quotein short, you may want to research rate and what it means. they understand we want nothing less than a linear rate for sp saved vs isk cost (meaning stays the same) and that a non exponential curve would even be acceptableah, so loss isn't a part of the game. it's just pure stupidity. thanks for clearing that up i understand now way to respond to my signature that was in no way part of my argument. the fact it didn't show up in 'quote' but you had to copy/paste should have been a hintas for the ""experience u should have by now"" are you suggesting that the skillpoints directly correlate to combat effectiveness and experience?skills obtained past 40mil or so rarely translate into any sizable combat effectiveness... we all know what risk vs reward is despite you refuting we don't. the key to that idea is balance of risk verses the reward gained. do you actually have any argument explaining why the current r.vs.r. system is more balanced than what i am suggesting? or are you just going to keep saying things like we want easy mode or a hand out and other knee jerk responses?you could make the argument that your paying for versatility! but... you didn't. and i thank you for explaining how we should stop *****ing about it and deal with it. it's all becoming so clear nowno, i won't keep it coming. it's obvious your here to flame the topic and posters, not discuss it and responding to you was likely a waste of my time.please don't come back until you can discuss the issue like an adult instead of just flaming"

4/25/2010,"ahahahahahaha brilliant troll, brilliant!correct occupation should read: super, insecure, terrified carebear, specialised in fw expploitation and reporting of those who exploit better than myselfyou're that person they turned to at the csm for faction warfare advice, until they realised you know absolutely nothing about it. you just exploited, instead of playing, and embarrassed yourself.and then you come up with the idea to punish empire suicide ganking? this game will never turn into hello kitty because pvp is what drives this game. without (empire) pvp your 'achievements' are meaningless, like the pvp in wow and games that have been nerfed to oblivion (uo & eq). you desire pvp to be outlawed full stop, so, you can mine and mission to hearts content, not realising that there's nothing you can do with all the money you hoard. look at all the pvp-free games, like wow, where people have all that gold but do nothing with it. you say you oppose the idea of ban but you'd like us all to buy a ship once and never lose it, not realising that nobody would build ships or mine, because it'd be pointless. look at professions in those silly carebear games, there is no market to speak of and people do nothing with their obtained goods.you refuse to learn about pvp and suicide ganking, not because it's against your morals but because you're scared of losing things. you're so scared you won't even fit a tier 1 bs, fit it with smart bombs and crash it into a group of miners. you've never tasted the thrill of watching other peoples ships go boom and all you know about pvp is what you've read. i have been suicide ganked and have lost billions in the process, but i have also done it to others and see the fun in it. you lie about the 100m/hour suicide gankers make because i've seen empty freighters blown up, simply for the fun of it.it's tragic and sad that you just don't understand a thing about eve. you are the worst possible candidate for csm but you will get on the board, no doubt, simply because there're enough people who just don't realise that pvp is the beating heart of eve.my advice to you: join the great institution that is eve-uni and learn how to pvp before you make an even bigger fool of yourself."
4/25/2010,/signedthat someone like this could ever be voted into the csm scares the **** out of me
4/25/2010,that so many people who cant read are allowed to vote scares me.gets my vote.and everyone who thinks eve needs free suicide ganking without any significant consequences is just plain stupid.
4/25/2010,"here we have a player who has been active in eve for several years and still hasn't the slightest clue of what this game is about.there is a deeper problem here that is nicely illustrated by this.eve, as every serious player knows is about risk, none consential pvp, the possibilty of a really crushing, heart breaking blow if you're not paying attention. at the very heart of the game design is the pvp mechanics. eve won't take you by the hand and protect you from being stupid. it will reward you for going out and do stuff and will punish hard for not paying attention.now comes the high sec crowd, who are paying subscription fees etc. you see we can't blame ccp for indulging these players with lvl 4 missions and mining mechanics. they are a very substantial part of their income... but they are inbalncing the intended gameplay.ankhe here is part of this group of players. the people who feel they are entitled to safe risk free gameplay in a game that was never intended that way. tbh we can't blame people like ankhe for feeling entitled to this, besides for being too stupid to realize what kind of a game they are playing. we have to blame ccp for that."
4/25/2010,"not too interested in a long reply, but something at least:risk works two ways. right now suicide gankers also dont have any risk at all. hell when doing lvl 4 missions you got higher risk than when suicide ganking. and no, losing your ship to concord is not a risk, it is something that just will happen and doesnt cost you anything. if you call that a risk, then losing your ammo would be a risk of running lvl 4 missions.the second part i want to mention are the targets, and this is more something in general. the ganker crowd who does everything as long as it gives them kms, since that makes them horny, usually are whining for easier way to get ganks. removal of wtz, no more local, ships instaploding when you come near them, etc. this stuff is usually proposed by those who have themselves either alts which make their isk, since apparently just doing it on your main is not done, or they sell plexes for their isk. one day, hopefully for them, they will realise that making it easier to gank pve'ers does in fact not give them more kills. usually they just seem not able to grasp the idea that not everyone uses their alts to make isk in high sec, the ship they just ganked was used to make their isk. if you make it easier to gank the people who do have the balls to make their isk in 0.0/low sec (compared to those who use alts in high sec), you only chase them back to lvl 4 missions (and no moving lvl 4 missions to low sec wont work either). doing it the other way around would work way better, make pve in 0.0 and low sec safer. (the idea already will make some go emo). then you get more potential targets, with each a lower chance to be killed, but your total amount of kills shouldnt change. since each is killed less, they are more likely to stay in low sec/0.0 instead of doing lvl 4 missions.and when i say safer i dont mean implement bacon (hmmm bacon) for everyone or make instanced mission sites. a (imo) better solution would be changing more rats to sleeper ai, and in general make the rats more pvp like, so i can fit a mwd on a ship to run low sec missions in, which makes sure i am not a sitting duck at the first gate camp. the sleeper ai might just decide to bbq the ship you just wanted to gank the pve'er with. then at the same time you can make changes to local (which i agree shouldnt be an intel source) and to the directional scanner (removing local and forcing you to smash a button every 15 seconds is ******ed). this way you would get more fights, and less easy ganks.additionally i would like to see that in low sec the fights are moved away from the gates and to the belts, missions, etc. one of the main reasons many never go to low sec or 0.0 is that the time they went to low sec they got bbq'ed at the first gate. now surely in the mindset of quite some pirates that is awesome, since it yielded them a tristan killmail, but in the long run that isnt good for your profession.so from ankhe i would like to know what your opinion is about more sleeper ais (and in general this post)."
4/25/2010,"i guess i could see myself as a 'high-sec dweller' with occasional fun trips to low-sec , but i darn well know the risks and responsibilities that come with it ;0if you ever run for csm and intend to get rid of these kind of players i would gladly vote for you: that would save me a subscription fee after all ;)"
4/25/2010,"you lose your ship. you can't undock in anything bigger than a pod for 15 minutes. you take a sec status hit. your target gets the right to kill you in highsec. you can't attempt another serious gank in the same place until after downtime. and for this you get a chance to kill the target, a chance that the stuff you want will drop if you succeed, and a chance that your alt will be the one who manages to scoop whatever does drop. you can argue that this is too little, or too much. but referring to it as ""no significant consequences"" is, well, just plain stupid. as for that second post, i have no idea what it is you're trying to say."

4/25/2010,"my ability to make good on my promises is unrelated to results achieved (or not) by csm predecessors--whether they are in my corp/alliance or not. as far as convincing folks that i will follow through on my pledges, i can only hope that ongoing discourse; proactive efforts to engage members of the community who share an interest in the issues i am championing; and endorsements from respected players who know me is sufficient to accomplish that. i wouldn't presume to promise to fix anything--no csm has the power to make good on such promises. i do promise to make the best case i can that well-supported proposals related to my campaign platform be on the roster of issues for presentation to ccp in iceland. whether or not i succeed, you can bet i'll be actively engaged in discussions about those proposals in these forums, on my blog, and elsewhere. thus, my csm activities and ""promise fulfillment"" will be easy to observe and assess by both supporters and non-supporters alike. i'd like to see low sec content added that ""rings true"" for outlaws and the seedy nature of low sec. for example--what if there were npcs who specialized in ""arranging"" hits on outlaw (-5 and below) characters? maybe the ""territory"" for each such npc is a constellation, and they move from system to system in their territory somewhat randomly. to interact with them, you have to probe their (invulnerable) ship at the safe spot where they are chilling. when you find them, you can ""arrange"" (pay isk) a hit on an outlaw or ask for some work (a ""contract"" to hit someone on his hit list). targets are selected randomly from this npc's list, trending toward lower value targets. to improve the odds of getting a higher value contract, you could ""call in favors"" (via spending favor points earned from successful completion of prior contracts with this npc). upon reporting completion of a contract (maybe requiring the provision of victim's corpse?), you get some percentage (50% perhaps) of the contract price plus some number of favor points with that npc. this is a very rough idea that's been simmering in my mind, but it covers some interesting territory: could augment/replace the current broken bounty system, encourages more pvp between players, incorporates a small isk sink, puts outlaws on center stage, and possibly might be implemented using some modified version of already existing mechanics for interactable agents and missions. i'm sure the idea as stated is full of flaws, potential for exploits, and issues that need analysis and refinement. unlike proposals for discrete changes to a mechanic or a ship bonus, ideas for changing low sec tend to be more holistic and sweeping. as such, they require a lot of discussion in these forums and elsewhere to distill them into actionable proposals. that's one of my objectives: to drive low sec discussions in a productive manner so that such proposals can be made. while ccp's apparent lack of interest in low sec is a bit discouraging, i'm optimistic that some really good, well-thought-out ideas might have a chance of arousing their interest.added ya to the list--same for everyone else who requested it. once there is sufficient interest in participation, a schedule will be posted in the op and on my blog."
4/25/2010,lets see how you feel about that perk when planes are grounded and you have to spend 2-3 days on the north sea mind expanding on your vision for low-sec or is there a thread already active with it?
4/25/2010,"hi mynxee, thanks for replying.i'm not asking you to promise that an issue will be fixed; as i stated in my previous post i want to know what you plan to do to ensure that the issue will receive serious discussion. thats all anyone can really hope for where ccp are concerned; that the issue makes the meeting and receives serious discussion.now your ability to raise an issue is wholly related to the success / failures of previous csm candidates. a lot of candidates are making a lot of pledges that they will try and ensure that their issues are raised. this creates a lot of issues - more than can be dealt with by the csm and ccp. this means that a lot of these issues are discarded.the remote rep issue that i mention was on aleks' pledge, and it was not raised as an issue in any csm document that i have seen (and that you are re-raising the issue is an indicator that the problem has not been addressed). now i don't doubt that aleks tried to raise the issue because it's a problem that affects a lot of people who deal with highsec wars. however he failed to raise it as an issue, as far as i am aware.now that means that this issue has been vocalised before and has not received attention. this means that it did not receive enough support from the rest of the csm or ccp, so to a lot of peoples minds it cant be a big deal. this means that whoever wants to push this issue forward to the attention of the csm and ccp so that it actually receives serious discussion is going to have to do more than just say they want it fixed  you have to assume aleks already tried that route and got nowhere.so my question is what are you going to do better than him to get the issue raised?"

4/25/2010,"herschel, did you read my full manifesto (linky in the first post)? in it i give a very specific example of a potential gameplay change that might deal with lag.i will reproduce it below:---a modest proposal to fix lagi want to preface this by saying that since i don't have any knowledge of the internals of eve, this is based on guesswork. i do not claim this is the way to deal with lag, only that i think it's an interesting starting point for discussion about the kinds of changes that might tame lag -- see, i'm waffling just like a real politician! i would make one (conceptually) simple gameplay alteration: warp cores interfere with sensors in other words, the more ships that are near you, the less you can see. there are many ways this could be implemented, but the simplest one would probably be: you can only see the closest n ships (where n might be 50-100) both in overview, brackets and local. consider the effects of such a change:small-gang pvp is not in any way affected.blobs now become much harder to use effectively. in a large blob, most of the ships will see mostly friendly ships, and only a few of the enemy. an opposing fleet that splits itself up and maneuvers well can put itself into positions where it can gain advantage. combat stops being fcs saying ""dirtbag is primary"" over and over again, and becomes much more tactical, with more decision-making at the wing and squad level. there's more maneuver, more confusion, more chaos, more fog-of-war, more fun. a well-lead small force may be able to defeat-in-detail a larger, clumsy blob.from the standpoint of the devs, such changes (while not trivial) should make life a lot easier. if a player can't see all the ships on grid, then the server doesn't need to send all that information to the client, greatly reducing the amount of i/o.furthermore, with certain exception (like bombs), if a player can't see another player, he can't interact with them, which should reduce the compute requirements.take a minute and think about how such a simple change would affect large fleet compositions and tactics. it would throw current doctrine for a loop -- which imho is a good thing. ----i want to repeat again that i don't think this is the only solution for lag, and it may for many reasons not be an appropriate or technically feasible one. what i do claim is that a gameplay change like this, that does information limiting and fog-of-war, that is going to be the long-term lag (and blob) killer.furthermore, whatever gameplay changes are used to kill blobs (but not large fleets -- that is crucial!) are going to have huge effects on large-scale warfare, so they need to be very, very carefully considered, and very, very seriously discussed by the involved stakeholders (devs who want to solve the lag issue so they can do more interesting things, and the large alliances that want to go back to serious carnage).the potential for unintended consequences is huge, and csm, standing as it does uniquely between the players and ccp, can perform a vital function in that discussion. this is what csm should be all about. you should assume that i'll call ""bs"" on anyone, dev or player, when i think it's appropriate. i've even called ""bs"" on myself on occasion, as in... ""blah blah blah expound blah blah oh wait, i'm full of it... sorry (blush)"""
4/25/2010,"ccp is not going to revamp their code in order to prevent lag. that would be like throwing away years of expertise and optimizations already in place, for the idea of starting afresh. what are they going to do, fire their programmers and hire ""experts""? the only practical way to fix lag is to let them fix the lag. i think it's a top priority for them already; not sure it can be made more of a priority.as far as the ui, i am all for a ui revamp, but they have adamantly said no to player-made addons. i don't think you can change their minds. the only thing that seems doable about the ui is to ask ccp to add some functionality themselves.specifically, the client can do some interpretation of the data, for us. add some optional functionality that makes it less ""spreadsheets in space"" and more visual/auditory. things like the calculated value of all the **** in containers and cargo holds, your actual dps displayed during combat, time-until-you're-dead estimates based on incoming dps vs. your current tank/resists, and a color-coded combat log that works properly, has transparency, allows for floating messages, and lets us trigger sound-alarms on events such as being ewar'ed, critted, the enemy is no longer missing, the enemy is in range, etc."
4/25/2010,"um...wow. i'll give you points for ingenuity, but i'd wager that your proposal will serve primarily to increase lag(by throwing an extra layer of checks on top of everything else) and cause unprecedented rage among 0.0ers. if the game had been designed to promote dogfighting from the start, it'd probably be interesting, but i don't think it's something you can do now. i don't think you actually have any idea how eve does its computations for fleet fights. and here i always thought the only difference between the two was that a ""large fleet"" is blue and a ""blob"" is red. silly me. what exactly was bs about his line of questioning? again, they seemed fairly innocuous to me. if you're not willing to share your opinion on an issue as simple as piracy, i wonder how you can possibly consider yourself qualified to be a csm."
4/25/2010,i have not yet begun to troll.
4/25/2010,"this is one of the worst ideas that i have seen in the history of eve. it is as much likely to make large gangs stronger than it is small ones. because a small gang will likely see none of their gang mates with them against a big blob. and rather than knowing what is up, are more likely to become disoriented and make bad decisions."

4/25/2010,"my full campaign:ideas and issuesgiven the opportunity to undertake a term as a csm my aim would be to support the continuing development of the game through the generation of new ideas and finding ways of dealing with issues that recognize the needs of different players; these are briefly pinpointed here:planetary interactionthe planetary command center, processing, storage and spaceport could all be part of the same complex while still being separate structures.expansion of the command center power grid and cpu, through additional structures.mobile harvesters.player owned structuresto try and help bring about improvements in the pos side of the game through adding new structures and making their roles better defined: starbases.starbases could be turned into a single station structure, which could allow a corporation to operate labs, factories, hangers, ship fitting, refineries and repair facilities in one station.starbases could become conquerable whilst retaining the ability to be destroyed.the addition of refineries to starbases in empire.the addition of ship repair facility on starbases similar to those found in stations.starbases could obtain racial bonuses related to the types of activities done on them e.g. caldari (labs), minmatar (refining) , amarr (factories) and gallente (ship repairs).the configuration could be made simpler by using a method similar to ship fitting by having slots where weapons can be fitted, slots for shield hardening and facilities set by placing module like components for labs and factories.a starbase could be setup before moving it to its deployment location.starbase could turn on each facility one by one over a few hours.access to the starbase could be from both docking and outside; players would be able to access the corporate hanger without docking, which would make dropping off loot/ore easier and quicker.no more starbase charters, instead a moon rental fee could be charged per month similar to an office fee.unused starbases in empire could be impounded in the nearest station,30days after last rental payment was due.fuel pellets: would be the best means of simplifying the fueling process of starbases by using a factory to combine all the ingredients into something much easier to manage.faction starbases could retain their improved fuel efficacy and shields."
4/25/2010,"empire navy versions could become available from agents, they could have improved shields and a further reduction in their fuel based on the corporation/alliance standings to the empire it is deployed in.besides being able to build / upgrade a faction starbase before deployment it would be better if it were possible to upgrade an already deployed starbase.other deployable structuresweapons platformsstarbases could deploy up to 10 weapon platforms instead of having 30 or 40 weapon arraysweapon platforms could be multi-sized (small, medium and large) having fitting slots, for weapons, shield tanking and electronic warfare modules.docking platformthis would be an entry-level structure, which can be launched by an individual who does not have the required standings to place a starbase.this basic structure could consist of a large hanger and a small ship hanger, which would allow a player to store and fit ships and store loot or ore securely.this could replace having to use a large number of giant secure containersmining platformthis structure would be used with moon harvesting arrays and a number of weapons platforms to protect it.this structure could replace the current towers set up to mine moons and allow the moon material to be deposited directly into a hanger.reactor huba reactor hub could be used to connect up a number of reactor arrays to it to process moon minerals, these materials could be placed in a normal hanger.if a large number of reactions are required then a number of reactor hubs could be connected together simultaneously.this could means the reactor hub could become a strategic target by giving it a similar subsystem to those on the outpost.cyno jammer, cyno generator and jump bridgesin respect of cyno jammer and cyno generator because of the changes in sovereignty they could be tied into the infrastructure hub instead of a starbase.jump bridges could not only become more like stargates where they do not need a starbase for support making it more flexible.jump bridges could be further improved by removing their fuel requirements and increasing their range limit.super capital facilitythe super capital facility is a very large station designed to store and manufacture super capitals (titans and motherships).it could be deployable in a system with an outpost and be conquerable.the facility could also have subsystems to be taken out so you can slow down your enemies capital ship production."
4/25/2010,"smart minesbeing able to remotely protect strategic locations such as stargates is something that has been long missing from eve, smart mines could be an answer as an anchor-able structure that uses a smart bomb like weapon to destroy targets, and when dormant can be cloaked.smart mines could be set to detect what they attack for example, they wont detonate if a scout ship flies past but it could detonate when the main enemy fleet arrives doing enough damage to make them think twice.the damage output could also be set by a player to make it unpredictabletournament/training arenasareas where corporations/alliances can practice combat or challenge friendly corps to competitions or attack simulated targets.tournament arenas could use special holo(graphic) ships that can take on the appearance of any ship available to pod pilots (dependent on skills) and fit them out accordingly. when combatants enter the arena the combat damage is simulated and neither party looses any ships, but the win would be real.sub system targeting on shipsthe ability to target a ships sub system such as weapons or propulsion would provide scope for new tactics to be added to the game.suicide attacks in empirethe recent increase of pilots using smart bomb equipped battleships to harass players and benefitting from being able to receive insurance money from this act should be reconsidered. in fact any concord based ship destruction where the player has attacked another player without cause should result in them not benefiting from this insurance to be fair to everyone.one other solution to this might be locking smart bombs in empire like other modules, which can only be used in low sec or 0.0."
4/25/2010,"black ops shipsblack ops ships should have covert ops cloak capability, increased jump range and remove the targeting delay.it might also benefit from a marauder style bonus of 100% to weapons damage and limit the weapon slots to 4.maraudersmarauders perhaps need a 20 - 30% capacitor increase to be able to fit a cap stable setup without compromising the overall dps.a 10% per level increase to the rate of fire on the golem and a 5% on the other 3 might be the difference that makes this a really good ship class.escort carrierescort carriers would be a cross between a battleship and a carrier able to carry up to 5 fighters and use stargates; making them essential for escorting valuable ships where a carrier can't go and where you might need the extra firepower.scanninganother approach to scanning could be introducing a scanning module that can be fitted to covert ops, recon and similar ships and enhancing their specific roles as scout ships.the ship is essentially turned into a scan probe with variable scan ranges and strengths (dependent on range), as the ship finds results it can warp to signature areas and perform more detailed scans.command and communications ship (comcom)the comcom would be based on tier 3 battleship's and have the capability of becoming a larger command ship. it would be able to keep track of large areas of space and help fleets find their target; the pilot would require fleet command skill.the comcom could bring some strategy to large fleet fights, allowing a fleet commander to keep track of the ships under their command and have a better idea of enemy positions.scout ships can also relay information to this ship allowing a fleet commander to send ships to the right locations.the ship isn't equipped with too many weapon slots instead relies on the interference from its scanners to jam enemy ships attacking it (a form of natural ecm). it could be fitted with a covert ops cloak providing it with the ability to use covert ops jump bridges. as well as having the bonus of 99% reduction in warfare link module cpu need it can use 3 warfare link modules simultaneously."
4/25/2010,"mackinaw and hulkthe mackinaw would possibly benefit from a 40% increase in cpu and 30% in power, which would bring it in line with its role as a low sec/0.0 mining ship.the hulk would benefit from a 10 to 20% increase in cpu to provide it with a slightly better tank.orca high slotswhen the orca was introduced it was an excellent addition to all mining fleets but it is time to improve on its one shortcoming it didn't have enough high slots an extra one or two would greatly improve its usability.ship transportera new ship class is required to move around rigged/assembled ships; it should be able to carry a few battleship sized ships and have a reasonable sized cargo hold for moving spare modules and ammo.t3 frigates, battleships and modulesthey were mentioned not long after the strategic cruisers were added to the game but haven't seen anything since.trade routesto help manage factories, starbases and planet based facilities it would be time saving to have trade routes to move products around to where they are needed, and free up time.a trade route could be setup by buying an industrial, transport or orca and installing a crew module; this means that it can fly its self on the route.the route is set in the trade route management window, which allows the player to select the destinations and pickup points and what to pickup and drop off."
4/25/2010,"science and industry changesproposal regarding changes to the way science and industry works by simplifying it slightly at the user-end; even industrialists like to do other things.research agentsresearch agent under the new system being proposed will help you create tech 1, tech 2 and tech 3 blueprints.with the research skill and research project management skill you should be able to run up to 6 research projects with the same agent, access to the agent can be determined by personal, corporation and alliance standings.when you go to the agent you can select the bpo you want to research and it starts a project, which can be speeded up by running missions.if you are lucky enough to own a starbase or outposts you have access to your own research slots these can also be accessed by the agent who can help you speed up your research for a small fee.research projects (invention / reverse engineering)this is no-longer a one shot deal you could end up with a fully functional very low quality bpo, which can be installed on your database where it can be installed into a lab where over a period of time it can be improved.invention / reverse engineering projects will still require the same materials to create them just in larger quantities but it will all depend on how long the player can afford the research project to run.blueprint databaseinstead of having hundreds of blueprints lying around in a hanger they are stored on a database, which should make it easier to manage.the bpo when stored on the database can be accessed or transferred to a personal, corporation or alliance database, which can be shared with anyone who has security access to it.quality control (me and pe)whilst it might take 1 month to get a bpo and take 6 months to make it useable the advantage to having it on a database is that it allows simultaneous improvements to the me and pe by anyone with access to the database it is held on.technology databasesthis would be a new facility, which factions and npc corporations can provide players with copies of technology databases to help create bpos, these would be available via loyalty points and maybe a lucky find on a mission.pirate faction and ancient races also create these and they might be useful one day in making more interesting modules and ships.datacorethis would become a technology database fragment that can be used to speed up research into bpos and are destroyed in the process of research.players could also now build these.automated assembly plantplayers with access to starbases or outposts will be able to do something new; once they have a bpo they can set up an automated assembly plant, where as long as there are sufficient raw materials and parts being fed in the production will run continuously.players have the ability to run as many automated runs as they can use factories; each automated assembly plant has a bonus, which cuts the build time by half; meaning you can use less factories to build the same amount of items.thank you for taking the time to read my proposals, there are ideas here for everyone and i hope you will consider supporting them by voting for me."
4/25/2010,"in addition to the raw attendance, you'll see that quite a few of the full delegates took little or no part in the meetings even when they were present and didn't bother to put forward any issues. while i wasn't allowed to bring up issues myself, i did take a full part in every meeting that i was present for."
4/25/2010,"greetings, my name is teadaze and i'm here to ask for you to vote in the upcoming csm5 elections. of course i would be very happy if you decide i am the right candidate for your vote(s) but the most important thing is that you do vote for somebody.eve is a unique place with a vibrant and diverse community and where players can shape the news and even the game itself. the csm is an important part of this, taking player ideas and issues, filtering them and finally passing the best to ccp for a response. as the role of the csm has expanded i feel it is even more important to vote for candidates who take the responsibility seriously. it is in the best interests of the players to vote and continue to post issues in the assembly forum because it shows ccp that the csm process is worth supporting further.about mei am a delegate on csm4 during which i took the secretary role as part of my promise to improve communication. i talked with ccp about ways to improve the production of the summit minutes which lead to a ccp supplying a member of staff for that purpose, enabling everyone on the csm to participate fully in discussions. it was also one of my suggestions that lead to ccp making csm as a stakeholder in the eve project (thanks to the full support of the rest of csm4)i have been playing eve since 2005 and currently specialise in 0.0 small gang pvp but like many people i started as an empire carebear running missions. i currently a member of a small sov holding alliance, i also dabble in market trading, have an alt in factional warfare, run a reaction pos and am involved with low scale t2 production via invention so have a wide variety of game experience to draw on. i was selected to be one of the commentators for at7 and was also invited to be on stage commentating at fanfest.i teach classes with agony unleashed to help players new to pvp to find their feet.out of game i am a senior software developer with an engineering degree and 12 years of experience in the profession.what can i offer?i take the csm process seriously and will put in the necessary effort. during csm4 i spent at least 5-7 hours a week discussing proposals with other players, raising issues and producing minutesi am methodical and committed to researching any subject raised by the players thoroughly.i have a wide breadth of eve knowledge including areas outside of my primary pvp focus. i will listen to feedback from players on any issue and ensure items are presented to the csm as proposed by the players before the csm make any amendments (accurate representation).i will continue to get correspondence to the players in a timely manner. some of this might be out of the csm's control, but in that case the playerbase need to be kept updated even if it is to say that ccp haven't yet published the supplied material.risk should be rewarded. for example i'm still looking towards lowsec players for suggestions on how to improve it. if people want to stay in empire that is fine, but those wanting a riskier path should find it worthwhile to do so (carrot not stick).i'm in favour of (where possible) buffing a weaker item instead of nerfing stronger ones. i feel that not all ships need to be good at solo pvp and that racial differences should be maintained rather than homogenizing everything. that said balance is important and must be maintained in some way.with tyrannis on the horizon and a commitment from ccp for a team to continue iterating on the design it is important that the players have a voice, but not at the expense of all the other issues.some of you might agree with my position but might have specific issues, i will try to address some of the common ones in a further post.i will be happy to answer any questions you have.tl:drvote for teadaze!"
4/25/2010,"i believe the csm process needs to be properly represented so feel free to ask me questions in game, here, on my blog etc. what did you do during csm4?i kept to my promise of improved communication by producing minutes within a few days of every meeting.raised a great many issues relating to every playstyle100% attendance recordi took the process seriously and made time to speak to players directly in game, on forums, blogs, twitter etcwhy vote for me (and not another 0.0 candidate)?it is likely the large 0.0 alliances will be well represented on the csm without additional votes from players outside those alliances. their combined block voting will take around four or five of the nine available seats (going on previous results).i live in 0.0 but i don't have political connections to any other space holding alliances. i represent a different style of 0.0 play based around small gang subcapital roaming. i wish to ensure this remains viable and so represent the smaller gangs which move fast, hit hard and gtfo (or explode spectacularly, it is all good ).whilst agony are now a sov holding alliance we are still fairly small and our no blues policy remains in place (outside of occasional planned operations). we were the first new alliance in providence to reset standings and are not pets or renters (aaa are neutral as well).why vote for me (and not another pvp candidate)?as an instructor with agony unleashed i have taught hundreds of players how to take their first steps in pvp and have a good understanding of the challenges they face. i want to help educate players in how to survive in pvp and maybe they will get the same pvp bug that i did.as i stated above, i wish to ensure that small gang roaming pvp remains viable to all. this is applicable to low sec as well as 0.0 dwellers. i know agony have a reputation for only flying frigates, but rest assured we fly every ship class in game though when i say small roaming gangs i mean subcapital ships with between 2-20 pilots.i support many forms of pvp even though i prefer 0.0 roaming. this includes piracy, gate camping and even pos bashing (just don't ask me to join in). i prefer a policy of educating people in how to avoid obvious ganks rather than attempting to remove current tools in place (don't break the sandbox). however that isn't to say that some things shouldn't be made a bit more tricky.i am a ccp certified pvp expert from at7 why vote for me if you live in lowsec?because i realise that for many people the endgame is not sov holding 0.0 and i stated as much during the csm summit. i know people have ideas for improvements and will continue to support lowsec issues and poke ccp into some improvements.whilst i am not a pirate, i have a good relationship with many pirate corps and understand their game style. it is a valid form of pvp even if not to everybody's taste.as i said above, i support risk vs reward and this appears to need looking at in lowsec.why vote for me if you live in empire?there may be other candidates that are a better fit for people who live in empire, however i feel i can still represent your needs.i have experience of being a carebear (missions and mining) and understand some of the frustrations there.i trade, run a pos do low scale manufacturing so have better than simple background knowledge in those areas.[*]i have helped many people from empire to get into the mindset of pvp even if they decide that style of play is not for them.[*/]tl:drno matter what playstyle i promise to look at your proposals and submit the best to the next csm meeting for voting.vote for teadaze"
4/25/2010,"some more questions and answers.why haven't you promised to fix the lag?short answer, because ccp are already working on it.csm5 can continue to monitor the progress of this but it is utterly ridiculous to think that ccp are not aware of the importance of this issue!during the csm4 summit this was well discussed and ccp presented some technical information as to the nature of the problem. we await the outcome of these discussionswhat about the ui?everyone agrees it needs work but the amount of development required means that promising to get it fully overhauled isn't a very sound election platformduring fanfest 2009 ccp hammerhead stated that he wanted to throw the ui away and rebuild from scratch. this means it is on the radar and whilst csm5 could encourage the development it is too large in scope to be something csm5 can commit to getting pushed through.got more questions? ask away!"
4/25/2010,"your work on csm4 has been extraordinary and raised the bar considerably with regard to keeping players informed about csm activities. if i wasn't running for csm5 myself, i'd vote for you (again!). best luck, teadaze. hope to be buying you a drink in iceland in june."
4/25/2010,"i officially support this campaignmuch love,phunk"
4/25/2010,what would be your opinion on black/red manticores?i like the focus on the user interface and options for accessibility. they might not be as glamorous as giant space lasers but in the end i think people will appreciate more a game less painful to play.
4/25/2010,"thanks mynxee, jinx and seleene :)"
4/25/2010,i agree that changes and progress must be made in eve in order to keep it viable to the hardcore players if you are the one to step up to the plate you have my vote
4/25/2010,"well cinori, after listening to your ideas and plans, you def have my vote 100%. you will win."
4/25/2010,aye the little things are often the hardest to fix but need it most. hope to see you prevail in your effort.
4/25/2010,i too would like some improvements within the game you sound progressive and you have advertised which is more than some prove me wrong you have my vote
4/25/2010,cinori - you are great at listening to ideas and looking at them from all sides - then refining them down into possiblities. you have my vote!
4/25/2010,you have my vote. although it would be nice if you had a list of little things to be changed.
4/25/2010,"thanks for the support all! it's great players like you that make we want to take this on. i'm working super hard right now on this campaign, and that hard work is merely a reflection of my work ethic if elected. you are absolutely right. i'm working hard on developing full descriptions and proposed resolutions for the suggestions from players that i've spoken with in-game; i have a 4 page word doc, single-spaced, that is filled with them, as mentioned by emerald. i will edit the op with a small sample list of ""little things"" that i'm championing. i will also be posting a host of assembly hall topics within the next week that encompass all the ""little things"" that have been suggested to me so far. the list will surely grow as you, the players, continue to suggest things."
4/25/2010,"cinori is a csm candidate i can actually get behind, with a clear platform that has the possibility to affect real change in the game. there are so many little things that have been neglected along the way in expansions, some of them are so simple they could be ""fixed"" with very little coding work at all, others would require a bit more work but the key thing is if ccp spent even just 1 month not working on expansions and focusing only on improving all the little annoyances in the game then eve would be so much more pleasant to play for everyone.this is why i am proud to support cinori aluben for csm 2010 and provide web hosting services to help facilitate the campaign. i encourage everyone to get signed up on our forums at"

4/25/2010,"i agree with your ideas and altough i'm in the same alliance, i'm pretty sure most people would agree with his ideals. .you have my vote!"
4/25/2010,"please elaborate on that, would it just prevent cloaking, friend and foe.. or would it be something that would aid in scanning a cloaker down if they was sitting still long enough? details would be appreciated here, since it's such a radical idea."
4/25/2010,"i am glad you asked, i was a bit afraid no one was listening, and i was only talking to the voices in my head again everyone and, i mean everyone, hates when a guy pulls up in system and sits cloaked for days at a time. he is not doing anything constructive or destructive. let me pause here to say i am not talking about a recon gang that lays in wait to kill ratters or cyno in bo hot drops(shout out to my brick brosefs). i'm talking about a cloaked rifter. most of the time it is just an alt afk sitting there to be an eye sore in intel channels. my idea for this would be a cloak module nullification array(the guy who makes up cool names in the bathroom, we will just call it ""the array"" for now). there are 5 levels of system sov index, so depending on balance, anchoring ability would be linked to one of those levels. of course this would also cost the sov holder more isk/month, and hauling the ihub upgrade from empire, which would mean it is one of those upgrades you have to determine if you really need. the array would have a hefty pg/cpu requirement (along the lines of what a cyno jammer needs) so it would require a large pos be up. (keep in mind that i do not have my own personal sisi to balance test these numbers on.) the array would require an hour to online, would stay online for five minutes, and then would take 2 hours to offline and return to an anchored status.(or if an offline timer was too hard to code, it could auto-unanchor and have a two hour anchor time, the point is a long cooldown) while the array is online all cloaks go inactive, like a mwd hit with a scram, in the entire system, for every ship. if the cloaker is afk five minutes is more than enough to probe and pod. if the cloaker was instead gathering intel and not just not afk, most decent players know how to bounce safe spots enough that five minutes should pose no threat to them. others have talked about cloaks requiring cap or fuel as a solution. i do not believe this is the best answer as it puts the burden on the cloaker. i feel a pos array puts the work and cost on the defender, if you want them stopped it is on your head and wallet to do it."
4/25/2010,"i'm not sure listening is enough. usually, when someone listens to a crowd, nobody in the crowd feels that their particular issue has been listened to enough (or with enough priority) over everybody else in the crowd. you're not going to be popular or give the impression that you're accomplishing anything by listening, i think. we're a crowd. i want the ui revamped, for example, and everyone has their own little pet peeves, and we'll tend to be most vocal about things that ccp has refused to change (due to time constraints, or against their vision, or whatever reasons). we're going to be asking for not the impossible, but the impractical.there's also a lot of information on the forums and from past csm councils about what we want, so it would be a shame to make us repeat ourselves. so, rather than listening, please read up.what do you think are the most pressing issues that the playerbase seems to be concerned about right now? ccp's never actually let us vote or had a poll, to my knowledge.in any case, good luck with your candidacy, both of you actually. we'll make you work hard if you win."

4/25/2010,"even if we are not from the same side, i support your top priority of fixing the lag issues in large fleet battles. before new features, the eve world must work as advertised.. no server shards,and all players being able to share the same world is the pitch that got me into eve.. these massive battles are stuff of legend.. right now they are stuff of legendary lag and i'm not fleeting up in large fleets anymore for that reason. so pass up the good word up that ccp fails if they do not fix the issue, and fundamentally, they are misrepresenting their marketing content too...i'd also like it if you can carry the idea expressed here"
4/25/2010,"new features in a game might help it become more popular for a while. maybe not.fixing and expanding existing features in an already good game can make it legendary.thats what my candidacy for csm is all about.ive lived in empire and in 0.0. in empire, i ran missions and dealt with the frustrations like some of you do now. in 0.0, ive been lucky enough to fly with a great group of pilots in an alliance against many other good players and alliances, and dealt with ccps apparent lack of concern for nullsec pilots existences. just like the rest of you.and i get frustrated at some of the failings of ccp to fix what is broken, and their history of limited implementations of other much desired features.those 0.0 issues like lag (if you already arent tired of hearing about it, you will be by the time this election is over), the failure to balance some classes of ships or break others in some ham-handed attempt, and the ability of some alliances to live like a king with the right type of moons and rats while other alliances live in 0.0 holes (i wasnt expecting many it or nc votes anyway). those highsec issues like can-tipping, greater penalties for ganking (wasnt expecting many pirate votes either), and greater variety of missions and rewards geared specifically to highsec miners / ratters / missionrunners. those issues effecting us all, like the ultra-fragile alliance structure where one player can dismantle an entire alliance with the press of a button, to so many other game-play mechanics hacks and exploits (oops  just lost the goons votes) that ruin the game for the rest of us. dont get me wrong: im not against new features and functionality. i like the idea of gate- and station-guns for our nullsec pilots. i like the idea of removing aggression timers when jumping through a system where you have sov (for 0.0) or a high standing with the local npc (in highsec). i like the idea of out-of-pod missions if / when ambulation (or whatever it is being called this week) is implemented. and dust looks like it is going to kick arse.but i believe we should fix whats broken before we go crazy putting in some new feature.please ask any questions you may have about ideas and issues important to you and i'll answer them as fast as possible.thank you for reading this, and im asking for your vote for csm!(web site link to come with more details about ideas and issues soon)"
4/25/2010,"if past history is any guide, there will be either 1 or 2 goons on the 9-member csm. also, it is important that the csm be able to work together and keep a united front when proposing things ccp is not eager to do if you are to have any hope of pushing them through. given that, do you think it's a good way to kick off a campaign to insult as many as a quarter of the people you hope to be working with by calling them cheaters?"

4/25/2010,"thanks for putting this back online. are we going to see some client, gfx, and gui styled questions this time around? such as improvements to the eve font, gui, improving existing menus, blocklists, events menus, dust, evegate, closed sockets, fixing the new mail system etc?i hope so -t'amber"
4/25/2010,do you have any suggestions?
4/25/2010,"i have a question.one might assume that you've positioned yourself as running on a low-sec platform from your post in the crime and punishment forum, which is great (and i hope fair of me to assume).my question is regarding your views on newer players in low-sec specifically and pvp in general. do you feel that it is currently difficult for new players to get involved in low-sec operations (such as with the fairly steep learning curve and sandbox nature of eve)? a commonly held view regarding difficulty's new players face is ""suck it up noob"" or ""join a corp"" and the assumption that players meant for the game will figure it out. do you agree with this? if you wouldn't mind, would you use these questions as a spring board for an elaboration how you would approach the needs to new players as csm. thanks!"
4/25/2010,"very good question! i feel, and i always have, that lowsec piracy or just living in lowsec is playing eve on hard mode. i do however feel that more people should experience the thrill of making a living there, it's what makes my heart thump and provides much more excitement than hisec.first we need a mechanic that doesn't dumb it down in any way, most lowsec dwellers like the unforgiving nature of the lowsec life and we dont want to remove that thrill. so we need to help the newcomers. some changes we could make are:creating easier ways of joining lowsec corps. this is the best bet for survivaladd an hour of invulnerability after being accepted to a lowsec corp to get stuff moved inimplementing an 'underground network' (dedicated chat/eve voice channels)additions to the tutorial to give advice on lowsec and using the directional scannerimplement deployable camera drones (picture in picture intel)increase the rewards of lowsec, better ores/rats/missions, etcimplement a skill and module to check realtime system populations by selecting a gatethis list is totally off the top of my head and so you can take it with a pinch of salt. but i would love to know your ideas. i want this to be a collaborative effort and not just my dictation. there must be hundreds more good suggestions to make lowsec more appealing.the main issues that keeps people away is that they don't know what lies beyond the gate. all of these above changes are to give the new player more information about the system they are jumping into. we need to give them the tools to make players more confident that they aren't going to be ganked the second they decloak on the other side and at least give them a fighting chance.i don't want to ruin gate camping though, i love it as much as the next guy, but we need to implement changes to allow people a chance and a little more system intel/better rewards seem a good trade off. plus the best gate campers never sit on the gate anyway so most changes wouldn't affect them either way."
4/25/2010,"is it difficult to join low-sec corporations right now? it seems to me that those who want to find a home in low sec are able to do so with little trouble. regardless, what ideas do you have that would make this easier?what kind of invulnerability? this will certainly not be abused in any way by people leaving and joining a corporation repeatedly...these already exist, although they are generally corporation and alliance specific. there are also the always-empty constellation and regional channels which are... always empty.this is something that could be very useful. aside from a directional scanner tutorial, what other information would you like to provide?how do you believe these should be implemented? flying alone carries its risks and forces people to work together. a deployable camera drone would mitigate the teamwork aspect of an mmo.this would certainly be helpful! in particular, i would like to see a higher drop rate for pirate faction items in low-sec belts, and lower it in null-sec. let the null-sec guys have the officer and super high end deadspace modules. what do you think?personally, i would not mind this because it would allow intelligent players to more easily evade blobs. there's 50 pilots in this system? time to stay away... and if enough people start to do that, then perhaps the blobs will break up due to lack of targets otherwise. it would be great if you could spend some time thinking about, and developing, some more ideas. brainstorming is always helpful, but having been in eve for as long as you have been i am surprised that you do not have more concrete proposals.on the other hand, this reduces the need for intelligent scouting, which again reduces the teamwork aspect of the game. is this a good idea?seriously? i find it to be more boring - and less rewarding - than shooting at rocks! that's all personal opinion of course, but my idea of low sec piracy does not include gate camps. it includes solo pilots and small gangs roaming around looking for targets of opportunity. what ideas do you have that would enhance my play style?thanks!"
4/25/2010,"hello guys,i'm running for the csm, and would like to give a shout to everybody here. i'm a common guy, no alliance affiliance. currently i live in empire, but i have lived in 0.0 before, and played around in low sec too. please visit my blog, where i'll be posting more informations about myself, my experiences in eve and what i think i could do to help in the csm.thanks,"
4/26/2010,"these ships are crap, specially the sin. please review."
4/26/2010,"obviously, a boost to railguns is about more than just the rokh. the rokh has a clear edge because its specialized with bonuses that fits well into the heavy fleet sniping role (+ its tier3). the apoc is a more versatile ship that also fits well into the rr-role with very nice optimal range for pulses. it has better cap economy, 20% smaller sig. radius, higher alpha, don't have to reload, cargo space etc.hybrid weapons inherits the weaknesses from both projectiles and lasers with very little tradeoff. perhaps 15% is to ask for too much but a 10% boost to damage modifier is definitely in order. the rokh will still be well inside the boundaries of balance, imo."
4/26/2010,"what do you think sniper bs are for? sniper fights almost always start when one fleet is moving to kill a pos or in the middle of killing/reinforcing a pos. so, yes, you have tons of ammo. unless you are attacking, in which case you can skimp. however, even then, you usually have a pile of short/mid/long-range ammo for the fight. you don't know what range you're going to end up at and you don't want to run out of ammo on the off chance that the fight escalates into a multi-hour thing.i mean, how do you think these fights happen? you don't exactly take a sniper bs fleet on a roam.railguns really just need to be given a better niche rather than just a damage boost, but i'd rather a damage boost than the status quo. 10% or 15% - 15% is very appropriate for medium and small turrets."
4/26/2010,"oh, i was under the impression that people had cap ships for killing poses. most of my fleet fights have happened at gates - where one of us was jumping into the other. some of them have happened at poses, but as a rule we did nothing more than play second fiddle to the cap fleet.-liang"
4/26/2010,wrong.capship fleets are currently a thing of the past. pos bashes are by bs fleets 99% of the time.
4/26/2010,then i'm damn glad i don't do that kind of crap anymore. spending hours shooting a pos when dreads can knock it down in a single siege cycle is borderline stupidity.-liang
4/26/2010,heard of a module called cyno jammer?
4/26/2010,"yep, sure have. did you know that you don't have to kill the whole pos to take out the cyno jammer?-liang"
4/26/2010,"cyno jammer 16m hp to turn it off (1m shield 15m armor)large tower 30m hp to reinforce (shutting the jammer down)if you are going to pound down 16m hp, might as well shut down the rest of the pos modules while you're at it. obviously, this depends on the resists. however, with fleet lag, you simply don't field caps to pound poss very often anymore.why was the fleet on the move? could it have been to... hit a pos?"
4/26/2010,"i haven't been conditioned. i've flown it. i've flown other things. like most, i trained to fly something that doesn't use railguns. this isn't because i've been brainwashed to think that i am better off spending months of additional training time to fly something else than i already fly, which you claim is the best ship for the job.i did not say this. i said that ehp increases are not equal to dps increases. dps aggregates in a fleet, while ehp does not. therefore, ehp is only beneficial in that it maintains parts of the aggregated dps. i also said there is an upward limit where increases to ehp are worthless as they do not improve survivability. you grossly misunderstand fleet mechanics. likely because you have not been in large fleet fights. it is also a gross misunderstanding that you have the same point of view as me, as evidenced by your argument that the ehp excess and the range excess of the rokh are perfectly good trades for the worst alpha and dps of snipers at engagement ranges.again, just as there is an upward limit to useful ehp, there is an upward limit to useful range. there is, however, no upward limit to useful dps or alpha strike. this is the failure of your arguments as well as those of goum."
4/26/2010,"the upward limit of range is 250km... which we're well underthere is no upward limit on ehp. this is a figment of your imagination and the fact that you're unable to perceive small units of time(especially when they come in random intervals)there is no upward limit on dps. this is a figment of your imagination and the fact that you're unable to perceive small units of time(especially when they come in random intervals)there is an upward limit on volley damage... but i am pretty sure everyone is also well under that. damage aggregates and is compared to a targets ehp... ehp is already aggregated at the start of the fightnow, we have been over this already1. ehp looks worse to individual pilots compared to dps because dps is easy to see the effects of and ehp is not. furthermore, the primary advantage of ehp is that it allows others to do dps.2. ehp can be worse in some situations. these situations do not encompass the rokh or fleet fights... unless your alliance has committed to a sub-par fleet battleship doctrine"
4/26/2010,just lolthis is one of the stupidest line ive read this month :)
4/26/2010,"truly? it is easy to fit a rokh to reach past that range. would that not be considered excess range? however, it is impossible to fit a rokh to do the damage of other sniper ships. most fleet engagements are two balls of ships 150km-200km distant from each other though. so, range much further than 200km is excess.if ehp = dps and the worth of a ship is the sum of the two, you would be best served making use of the lack of stacking penalty provided by tank modules and fly a pure tank ship. such a ship would be a waste though, as it would not actually improve the likelihood of survival, and would sacrifice dps to do this.yeah, i said there is no upward limit to dps. apparently we are agreed on this point.false, volley damage is spilled over onto the secondary target.aggregate: formed of separate units gathered into a mass or whole.really, if i'm being shot, i have the benefit of my fleet mates' ehp? i do have the benefit of my fleet mates' dps when i'm killing something.false. it looks bad when your ship pops and you get raged at for flying a glass canon. far worse to not have enough ehp than to not have enough dps."
4/26/2010,"read the maths section in my link, if that won't convince you then you should stop posting with the big boys."
4/26/2010,"but we're not.the multiple of the two, not the sum of the twoall tank modules are stacking penalized in one way or another. even the raw hp modules which have no explicitly defined penalty.no its not. unless you have some magical system that makes excess damage appear onto your next locked target somehow.i mentioned we were probably under the point where it was a drawback, but really. spilling onto the next target? that is the advantage that low volley hasyou have had the benefit of your fleet mates ehp so long as you were not the first target. and if you were then your dps didn't really add up to much, but your ehp mattered a lotyet you continue to fly ships that do not maximize the combination of dps and ehp..."
4/26/2010,"wtf? yes, because nobody fits resists on a death star.i can't speak to that - it seems extremely foolish to bring 500 battleships instead of 50 dreads though. like i said, i'm glad i got out of massive fleet blobbery when i did.to incap the cyno jammer.... so they could bring in their cap fleet or bridge in support. they did both. :)i also want to point out that there is a practical limit on the utility of alpha strike. that's a long discussion though, and one that's been rehashed oh so many times.-lianged: and really if the entire goal of your fleet op is to go bash a pos, you have never ever had any choice but amarr. ever. even when they ""sucked"". and you wouldn't even if the hybrids were boosted by 50% or more."
4/26/2010,agreed... railguns need some love
4/26/2010,"actually, they usually send several different bs fleets into nearby systems and hit them at the same time, so if an enemy fleet shows up, you consolidate and overload the node.wrong word. point remains.proof?no its not. unless you have some magical system that makes excess damage appear onto your next locked target somehow.i mentioned we were probably under the point where it was a drawback, but really. spilling onto the next target? that is the advantage that low volley hasthis is one of the reasons people don't use missiles. it you have four targets and you hit the fire gun button(s), but the first target dies before you fire, it will shoot at the next target.no, the guy before me warped out at 50% armor. so, in reality, i am only saved the time required to get to me as a target (my name starts with a ""b"" so when they go alphabetical order, they get to me pretty quickly).clearly you have not looked at the fits of ships i have flown. you're still stuck on the theoretic fits showing how other ships can fill the same niche as railgun ships, a niche that (as no one fits any of the ships that way) is useless. my ships are not fit that way."
4/26/2010,"ah, it all begins to become in focus now! i suppose that isn't such a new tactic.-liang"
4/26/2010,"yeah, this tactic is as old as the game."
4/26/2010,"no, it doesn't. the largest rectangle with sides that have a fixed sum is always a square1+1 =22/1 = +100%2+1 = 33/2 = +50%+100%>+50%now just do it with hit points added from plates. 10k base armor for abaddon + 5250 from 1600mm rt = 52% more armor(less than +45% more hit points due to shield and structure hit points). add the second and you're at 21125 armor = +33% more armor.that is a stacking penalty.this is true enough. at the same time, if you are shooting at that target and it has 1 hp left and you volley it for 5000 then you have wasted 4999 damage.this is where the waste comes in, not in targeting. i was saying that this isn't likely to be a big deal at current volley values.so you got saved enough damage to volley you to 50% of your armor and you were able to deal damage throughout that. if you weren't then they would have been shooting at you. targeting loss works on both sides, so any reduction in the value of ehp due to targeting time also reduces the value of dps. unless the fight is a turkey shoot, but then who cares about balance?actually i was looking at your named gun rokhs. you don't have a loss history for of rokhs for me to examine.edit: i don't want to critize named gun rokhs, they are the one of the only ships that can hit fleet engagement ranges with tech 1 weapons and as such are perfectly fine to fly."
4/26/2010,"this tactic is not as old as the game. if you want a system its better to stick all your folks in it from the start. winning under lag is typically a function of being there first. not going to the point you want immediately is more likely to lose you the point and the battle than it is win.separating your forces like that is inviting disaster. if you've done that and you've got the system overloaded you might as well bring your caps in(because no one will shoot them when they load grid, compared to the enemy who will get killed if they attempt it)unless it gives you a dps advantage. which, if your enemy is set for another range. it will."
4/26/2010,"definitely want this. also turning off the auto-load of character portrait when you show info on them. in a mildly stressed environment, showing info on someone will blank out your screen and take a while to recover from. we've come to believe it's because it's dling the portrait information. if we can exclude this it would be most beneficial"
4/26/2010,no one in their right mind would want to load my character portrait anyway
4/26/2010,"it's always bothered me that i can turn portraits off in the actual communication window, but not in the member list. this issue is one of my biggest pet peeves about the current ui, and is connected (albeit loosely) to ui peeve #2: loading times for portraits (both player and agent avatars).supported"

4/26/2010,sniper cerbs prove to be pretty efective from a 200 km range
4/26/2010,"at the beging this improbable exploit/bug was only used on t3 cruisers giving gangboni...to have them save in system, without the urge to have a pos there.but now its a real plague. space is full of missionrunners you cant scan down anymore. mosty tengus are used. you simply dont get probe results on them. youre in system and you have no way to harm them while thyre doing their missions unaffected. tengu also dont have drones...so you cant even scan for that. for me its a terrible exploit which renders carebears, esspecially mission- and escalation-runners totally invincible: you cant harm them. and thats never a good thing in eve. if deep space spot and nanospeeds require a nerf, cause those ships are difficult to pin down.....then unprobable setups definetly need to be fixed and all ppl who used this exploit for their their own favor need to be banned. another problem is that the unprobable state is more and more used by sniping ships. i saw whole (faction)bs gangs sniping the **** out of victims and they couldnt warp on them, cause theyre unprobable. the only way to get them is to approach them. that means they instapop alot of your ship and finally the warp out, if some of your tacklers get too close. if youre aligned and on the ball this tactics is really safe for you. those are 2 totally lame things, which grant the buguser absolute superiority of the siuation. and i also cant see how you gimp your fitting, if you eccm-up your ship, those setups seem to work perfectly. imho this exploit is a terrible issue. eccms are meant to make your ship less vulnerable to ecm and not to make your ship impossible to get for whole enemy fleets. if you wait a bit longer this eccm exploit will spread out even more and in a few weeks all 0.0 or lowsec missionrunners will be as safe as in 1.0 empire space.ccp. remove this eccm exploit! dont be that pro-carebear. the only item which makes you ship impossible to probe should be an activated cloaking device."
4/26/2010,this is not an exploit and is not a bug. stop whining just because you are a complete fail at killing ppl.not supported
4/26/2010,you can still catch them on station/gates.but sometimes you got to accept you cant get all kills. accepting that is good for your blood pressure. a cloaky can still approach them and make warpins for your gang. takes time and patience of course.but you need quite a bit of effort to make bs unable to be probed out. so far i only see your inability to adapt to the situations. both targets can be caught. just not brute force with the head through the wall as you described it.yes it is very bad that you got to work for your kills and cant just probe out mission runners anymore to kill them.
4/26/2010,"unprobable ships are fine.i used to hate them, now i fly them"
4/26/2010,"the solo-bs pilot is dead, they only spawn in docking range these days, you should know that fw implants are cheap compared to crystals, slaves etc. and the lack of tackle on heavy hitters is easily compensated using regular small tackle ships which are even easier to make immune to probing.ps: there was mention of be's latest gimmick involving probe immune faction bs in a completely unrelated thread, if true then it will be tweaked since they seem to be harbingers of the nerf bat - just saying"
4/26/2010,"ok ... that fit requires: 2 eccm - gravimetric, 2 gravimetric backup arrays and a hg talon set.(complete fit 5x hml ii, 10m mwd ii, 2 eccm - gravimetric ii, 2 sensor booster ii, 2 bcs, 2 gravimetric backup arrays. 2 hydraulic bay thruster rigs.)so you got not buffer to speak of (2505hp shield). dps is crap. and you gave up 4 slots and need a billions isk worth implant set to make it usable.not sure about you ... but i would prefer to have atleast 1 lse on my fit, to have a bit more buffer to burn back to the gate."
4/26/2010,solo bs is not dead.
4/26/2010,dont forget to use boosters and ganglinks which reduce your signature and are cheaper than 1bil implant sets....
4/26/2010,working as intended. fitting a ship this way severely gimps the abilities of the ship.

4/26/2010,i definitely like the t1 frig and bs changes.
4/26/2010,"out of recons, huginn is currently quite underachieving.basically, there is no reason to fly it when compared to the rapier. the rapier will in most fits: outdps and outrun, outrun and outtank or outtank and outdps the huginn.and lets not forget the covops cloak.so, how to approach fixing it?i find that the biggest pain the huginn has is the dual slot layout, which is still in the old style. another is lack of flavor compared to the rapier.so my suggestions are actually quite small, but i think they will be effective in making huginn at least a more tempting choice, and not an outright dismissal as useless.proposed changes:give huginn a weapon layout of 4 turret and 4 missile slots (up from 3/3). this was already done to the typhoon, and made that ship better, but not overpowered.give huggin a bonus to the web strength instead of target painter bonus. that will result in it being of a different flavor ship. alternatively, if you find this overpowered switch the web range bonus for the web strength one, and keep the tp bonus."
4/26/2010,"not sure what server you are playing on, but on tranq the huginn has more dps, more speed, better agility and a better tank. the rapier gets +1 low and the covert ops cloak, both of which can come in handy but does not obsolete the huginn.the huginn needs:-gun bonus+web str bonus-2 guns+2 launcherst2 ships are specialized ships. they are not supposed to be dual weapon systems. see reference amarr khanid ship changes."
4/26/2010,i actually agree this would also make an interesting and improved huginn. i just think starting with small changes means more chance in seeing them happen. hence the small scale improvements i suggested.
4/26/2010,"ever since webs got the rather ridiculous web nerf minmatar recons have become severely back-burner. they can't even tackle an interceptor running flat out with three webs laid on at 10km. by the time it slows down enough to become a worthwhile target it's well beyond web range.ccp needs to put webs back where they were, or give the min recons the same web bonus the paladin currently enjoys, dropping the useless target painter bonus."
4/26/2010,i am entirely in agreement with this huginn.
4/26/2010,"i think the bigger issue is stasis webifiers. since their nerf, you generally want to use a warp scrambler instead. scrams have a similiar range and a larger reduction on your target's speed by turning off their mwd. if afterburners were useful in pvp, then webifiers could have their place, but that's not how things are. another change i would like to see is to increase the drone bay and bandwidth to allow 5 medium drones. this makes it more like the typhoon, where the ship is kind of subpar until you have good guns, missile, and drone skills."

4/26/2010,"a lot of us have either suicide ganked or been a victim of a gate-camp ambush in hisec, or .5 sec. let's break down the mechanics of the thing.you, a pirate, likely in a t1 cruiser or t1 battlecruiser, camp mid-hisec gates for freighters to run along. then, like a flash, you attack and destroy them. concord responds immediately and pastes you. you lose a ship. boohoo. but look at all of that loot just sitting there. then, your freighter buddies come along and grab it all. you only lose a cheap t1 ship. but you can possibly get some very nice t2 gear, worth far more than what you lost.someone in my alliance was victim to this. lost a t2 freighter, and 1 billion credits worth in gear. the aggressor and his friends made a killing, and only one of them suffered a loss in standing.now, at this point, the case is closed. the pirates grab a new ship (possibly raising sec status by killing some pirates so they can enter hisec again) and return to the camp. their freighter buddies ready to refill and make money.this is wanton abuse of the game's engine. concord would not realistically stand for it. i read in another thread that concord should pick up hisec victim loot and return it to them. just doing that would end suicide ganks. or, make concord target the entire fleet of the offender. there has to be some way to curb the wild upward spike of game-breaking piracy."
4/26/2010,what t2 freighter did they kill and what did they suicide on it to be able to kill it before concord showed up?
4/26/2010,mostlikely some shiny nice jf. :)i guess the price of the ships hurts more than the 1bn worth of assets.anyway ... nothing to be changed here.just curious ... is gerard ridefort the friend of yours?
4/26/2010,"no, it was hayfront or somelike.and i think that something can be done, even if it comes down to petitions. it's not fair, doesn't make sense, and makes concord look like more of a joke than it already is."
4/26/2010,"concord is not meant to protect. concord is meant to punish. and they do that job pretty well. if you see someone escaping concord (as in concord doesnt blow his ship up), you can petition it and the person will get banned.protecting your assets before the crime is your job."
4/26/2010,"as someone once said: ""concord provides punishment, not protection"".edit: darius beat me to it. there are numerous way to protect yourself from suicide gankers, not the least of which is using a scout. if you see a battleship and a couple haulers sitting on a gate just hanging about, odds are, someone is about to have a bad day.also, remote repair. when my corp moves our freighter, it's always (not usually, not normally, but 100% of the time always) accoimpanied by a remote repping dominix. the domi fits as many logitics drones and remote armor reppers as it cans and turns them all on the freighter while the latter is aligning. the higher warp rate of the domni means it can normally make the far gate in a system before the freighter does, even if it goes to warp afterwards. the domni dooesn't even need guns since all we have to do is keep the freighter alive until concord pops the ganker."
4/26/2010,you should try bringing a rapier/huggin (or even 2) with the freighter. makes them get into warp really fast and with 2 ships you can even scout a gate ahead.
4/26/2010,"realistically if someone really wants to cause you to have a bad day in a freighter or what not, then they will disregard all the consequences. but here are maybe a few that should be implemented.1) insurance payout is canceled. simple reason, what you are doing is causing fraud. if you burn your house down intentionally in real life, you don't get the insurance and you go to jail for fraud and arson.2) increase the sec status hit from attacking a target in hi-sec. i hear they are already doing this.3) impose a fee to those that cause concord to respond."
4/26/2010,"insurance will be reduced in the next patch. (am i the only one reading devblogs?)though i promise you... it wont reduce suicide ganking much.had been done in one of the previous patches. wont help much either. ratting up sec status isnt that bad (especially for 0.5/0.6 systems). 2nd, lots of suicide ganks are done with 2 week old alts in minmatar ships nowadays. i am sure they can recycle those alts faster than you can recover from a freighter gank.concord always responds, but they are not meant to protect your ship. they will just punish the bad guys. all you can hope is surviving long enough. which in most cases, you wont do.(edit:typo)"
4/26/2010,the amount of firepower to take out a t2 freighter is a lot. you got a kill mail link?
4/26/2010,"thank you for posting this subject again, as i see, is not me only thinking that concord is a ""failure"" police. yes, is time to re-think concord, no it<U+FFFD>s not doing the job well as low sec drones get smarter, concord gets stupid. we don<U+FFFD>t want a hell angels police ,we need a real one, more intelligent, more efficient, more participant and im not saying shooty shooty.. im saying a.i. .. concord has great guns and no brains. period!p.s. zannier is not a friend of mine.. well, it is now : )thanks for posting this thread!"
4/26/2010,"+1also, hypothetically, if they took enough people to down a jf, the 1 bil of assets would not go very far among them.the only way your story makes any sense is if it was a t2 transport hit by a tempest or two.otherwise, if it still happened, it was a mis"
4/26/2010,"actually if concord was actually going to punish it should not just blow up the offending ship but also pod the ganker. this also could be abused. the most balanced form would be as was suggested is to have concord ""confiscate"" the loot and ship it back to the original owner."
4/26/2010,"no npc pod. and no concord shouldnt give you the stuff back either. you failed at hauling.if you failed at pvp, you wont get your stuff back either."
4/26/2010,"people can get unbelievably arrogant in eve don<U+FFFD>t they? unless you own ccp and if so.. you doing a terrible job. just don<U+FFFD>t reply threads with nonsense pathetic opinions. how can anyone ""fail"" at hauling a freighter (yes! people have the right to play alone.. some do, and that<U+FFFD>s part of the so called game mechanics, now, use your brain, this is not pvp, this is a healthy discussion about the game mechanics. i would remember you that blockade runners came into action due to the amount of haulers being ganked on empire (no.. it wasn<U+FFFD>t made for low sec hauling only) enough said."
4/26/2010,"if you would just invest a bit time and searching you would notice that everyone including ccp tells you that highsec is supposed to be safer, but not *safe*. you fell into the believing that highsec is safe.if you want to avoid getting ganked:1. fly cloaky transports2. for afk hauling: dont carry more than 1bn worth of cargo (the 1bn limit only applies to a freighter, it is much much less for smaller hauling ships, see point 1)3. scout with an alt.my reply has nothing to do with being arrogant. it is just an advice to check reality and dont live in a dream world."
4/26/2010,"thanks for the ""dream world"" : ) and thanks because you just cleared one of my points, people have to haul with a scout, hmmm, you<U+FFFD>re saying ccp is forcing us to have 2 accounts? one is not good enough to play the game. (please don<U+FFFD>t reply with something like ""don<U+FFFD>t you have friends ingame?"") well, i do, lots, but some people want to play alone, i used to, not anymore. but basically you are saying, don<U+FFFD>t join eve online unless you can afford to pay 2 accounts. that<U+FFFD>s bad advertising my good ccp defender now, as for dream world, if i remember well, this is a game.. a dream world : ) i would research the word ""reality"" if i was you."
4/26/2010,"let me say it this way ... if you are riding this high horse all the time, you got what you deserve.i didnt say you need 2 accounts, but if you want to afk haul, solo, then you should keep an eye on the value of your cargo. but for now keep hauling billions in your little ship. people will happily take your donations to fund their pvp.oh and welcome to eve."
4/26/2010,"yeah, it's as if concord just dont care about making hi-sec totally safe for you."
4/26/2010,"actually, i don't mind the change after all it should be a drone boat. just keep the turret hardpoints. the ship that really needs gun changes is the myrmidon 6 turrets with no bonus and 75m3 drone bay with bonus....lol?"
4/26/2010,i think this is a step in right direction.
4/26/2010,heavily supported !!
4/26/2010,"what the op said, plus no scrolling to the top=win."
4/26/2010,"exactly, i don't want to have to ""figure out"" the date, or expand the neocom."
4/26/2010,very simple
4/26/2010,good idea. supported.
4/26/2010,"on a related note, could we get the clock show local time as well? if there is such a feature i sure as heck haven't been able to find it. more than once i've looked at the clock, ""oh it's only nine no worries"" just to remember the time is actually past midnight for my timezone."
4/26/2010,when i want to make orbit in 8500m exact but i choose this it go out to 15000m ang my scramble module turn off letting the escape. why this happen?proposing make 8500m orbit work if i want it to not this other orbits which not wanted.
4/26/2010,alright an orbit is not a circle. it is working as intended.wikipedia orbit
4/26/2010,but then to stay with the scramble range but not close you do what to it with rainge? this could be made easyer.
4/26/2010,that is one of the few things you have to learn as pilot:with preset orbit range x and speed y my real orbit will be z.you can train stuff like that even with some npcs. all in all... this is a non issue.
4/26/2010,your orbit will be the range you set if your speed is low enough to let your ship orbit that close. otherwise it will only orbit as close as your speed and maneuverability allow.
4/26/2010,"i know what you mean. working as intended, am i right? its your job to figure out that 8500m = 15000m because its working as intended, obviously.like the op, if i set orbit at 14500m, its because i want a 14500m orbit. if my ship cant maintain this orbit, for whatever reasons, if must slow down until it can because thats what i command it to do. as simple as, really. meanwhile, you could jettison something then orbit that and fiddle with the set distance at until it stays put at 8500m. supported because orbit at 1500m must orbit at 1500m."
4/26/2010,in many cases you want the speed more than the exact orbit speed. but it might be just me.
4/26/2010,"it looks like you didn't properly read the op. this makes me think less of you when considering my vote for your candidacy for the csm.as for the issue at hand. it is clearly a balanced trade off. imo both features should be available. currently if you want to maximize speed you use orbit and if you want to maximize precision you use keep at range.one issue i can foresee with the proposed mechanic is that any implementation will probably not be able to dependably that the desired range. at the very least not as well as keep at range.i also wonder if the proposed mechanic would use more cpu cycles for physics calculation.finally i want to mention the increased work required to fly a ship that the current mechanic represents.all this considered i believe that the current mechanics (keep at range, manual piloting and pre-calculated orbit ranges)are sufficient and the proposed mechanic would too drastically reduce the skill required to pilot ships in eve. that said i do support improved mechanics for movement, like ones that allow for easier control over throttle and orbit range as well as ship direction. this will come as technology improves, i hope.this exact issue is not supported by myself."
4/26/2010,put nanos on your ships instead of overdrives. problem will fix itself (plus you'll be able to orbit faster - which is what you want anyway).
4/26/2010,"well, yu could use nanoes as suggested. or just pic a closer orbit, since the ships in eve follow the rule of inertia it can't be exakt 8500m.due to speed and centrifugal(did i spell that right) forces the ship will be puched beyond set range. higher speeds, more it will differ. and i think you're doing this in pvp. pilots will try to manually outmnouver you, also knocking orbit out of place since they're moving to. try manual flight, or setting closer orbit. you'll get it soon enough =)"
4/26/2010,"if you have a mwd/ab active, you won't orbit at the right distance. you'll have to set yourself to a tighter orbit to compensate.suggest you test these things or ask in help chat instead of making useless threads next time"
4/26/2010,"a little harsh but i will elaborate. i do not think that it should be made easier for you to fly your ship. i use orbit because it keeps me within a decent range (mostly), keeps me moving (mostly, and most importantly when the target dies i keep moving. making it easier to do speed distance balancing will remove the advantage of higher personal talent (didnt say skill because...obvious conflicts). now i do like your idea of easier throttle control (clicking on the circle is just a pain) but that kind of strays a little from the topic."

4/26/2010,this is not the appropriate place for this. file a petition.
4/26/2010,"edit: ok, i appreciate that the increased logistical burden this would have placed on supercap pilots is probably too much. people have proposed a few other ideas, though, so please use this thread to comment on them:restrict fighter-bombers to 0.0 (like titan dds)30-60 second delay when jumping a supercap into lowsec.remove supercapital ew immunity or ability to use remote repair modules in lowsec.the overall goal is to make supercaps no better in low sec than they are in 0.0, and to discourage people from deploying them there.original proposal:create a new supercapital cynosural field generator or script(i.e. with jump harmonics 3, following on from the covert cyno)restrict the use of this new cyno to 0.0 space.restrict supercap jump drives so that they can only jump to the new type of cyno.there are several balancing possibilities relating to the exact choice of game mechanics here - it could be done by adding scripts for cynos, allowing people to use the same module in 0.0 or in lowsec, or by adding a new module altogether, and forcing people to choose which one to fit."
4/26/2010,generally that might be right but it will create incredible logistic troubles if you need say to move from one pleace in 0.0 to another.imagine moving titan from venal to gw for example?
4/26/2010,"it is not super-capitals but capitals in general that has a disrupting effect on life in low-sec.the handful of hulls a typical low-sec corporation can field is dwarfed by 50-100+ that 0.0 drops represent.making all jumps to low-sec systems expensive in both isk and time would do a lot more to limit bored 0.0 entities from ""interfering"" in low-sec life.add system security as a modifier to fuel consumption for all jump activities and a majority of on-a-whim hotdrops become a thing of the past for everyone but actual low-sec citizens who have arranged fuel depots within their sphere of influence."
4/26/2010,"this seems completely unnecessary and rather ill-advised. lowsec supercaps haven't been invulnerable since 2007, and doomsdays don't work in lowsec. but if you want to bridge people around, or use them for their basic combat power, why not? they don't change the dynamics of lowsec appreciably. not supported."
4/26/2010,"oh jeez, another clueless nub wanting to nerf low sec."
4/26/2010,"personally i don't see the point of having capital ships in low sec at all, save from pos bashing which is mainly the job of dreads or plenty of bs's anyway. as for the guy who said ""nubs nerfing low sec"" - i'd say its more of smurfing low sec if dropping capitals there would be banned altogether, from a battle waged in fw today - and number of other times - it seems that low-sec battles seem to have more and more of an issue of which side can field more capitals, regardless if they're the normal or supercap variety. personally that is not to my liking, but hey, maybe it's just me."
4/26/2010,"so answer me this. if super capitals was banned from low sec, then how the hell are they supposed to move from place to place then?.would be a really really big pain in the ass to move the ships via 0.0 space if you have to move the super capitals to the other side of the galaxy."
4/26/2010,horrible idea..
4/26/2010,"well as the 0.0 heroes tend to say to just about anyone not interested in 0.0, ""eve is tough, deal with it.""they still have 0.0 to rump around in, and 0.0 is most of the systems of the game i believe. i'm fairly certain they were not meant to be tools to dominate low-sec systems with originally. i also cannot see any reason for them to really sneak through low sec, aside from some cowardly sneak attack. if you can give me a reason why they should be able to, then i might reconsider."
4/26/2010,worse idea ever...
4/26/2010,"to quote myself:here, let's see if i can spell this out clearly:- supercarriers are a supercap- there are four counters to a supercap in 0.0- there are megablobs and massive napfests in 0.0- there is exactly one counter to a supercap in low sec.- supercarriers are fully functional in low sec=> supercarriers are more powerful in low sec - which is a place singularly ill suited to doing anything about them.there are two reasonable solutions to a glaring game imbalance here:- ban all supercaps from low sec- supercaps lose ewar immunity + fighter bombers in low seci personally prefer losing ewar immunity+fighter bombers, because i do not want to contemplate having to move supercaps around if they can't enter lowsec at all.-liang"
4/26/2010,"so just to see how stupid this idea is, then can someone let me know how many cyno jumps it takes for a super carrier to jump from 7bx-6f to x-7omu via 0.0 space only for example?.edit: liang. the ban of sc's in low sec wont happen ever. because it makes billion more problems than it fixes."
4/26/2010,"the airportplease visit your user settings to re-enable images.ok, first let me start by saying im not an empire ganker , but i have seen those in action and here<U+FFFD>s my thoughts:the airport example and eve onlineyou go to any airport in the world and as far as i know, only the police can run a scanner on you, not just anyone that desires so. eve is not the real world.. really? ok, lets talk concord now. they will scan you for drugs and/or any illegal cargo you might carry around empire; standing next to this police, the thief uses his scanner the same way without any problems. game mechanics you say. well that game mechanics just demoralizes concord, the thief can scan you, get a few minutes penalty and some standing penalties but will come back to the ""crime"" scene totally clean and get the results of that robbery. is concord that ""loose""? where am i going with this? well, ccp could make the game more interesting if : 1 - scanning on empire is considered aggression like webbing scrambling and so on... (though one to swallow?) 2 - scanning on empire will tag you so the victim and his fleet has the right to defend the ship (more pvp !! ) 3 - all the lot dropped from the assaulted ships will be confiscated by concord and on petition, returned to owner i think ccp guys will not like the extra work anyway, there are, trust me, players that do like to live on empire with their corps, and they will, again trust me, start leaving the game if this pathetic game mechanic failure is not fixed.you a pirate, want to gank freighters, grow some b**ls and go gank low sec alliances freighters.i do hope ccp does reads this, and will not reply with something like (not happening)please explain why such crime is allowed."
4/26/2010,"except that a rl thief can look at many other indicators to get an idea of what you are carrying. if you are wearing tailored clothing, sporting flashy jewelry, etc... it can reasonably be assumed that the contents of your luggage are worth taking, additionally, the theft will result in ownership of the bag (which can be worth quite a bit of money as well). this is not the case in eve, where a freighter is more likely to be chock full of tritanium as something valuable.this is a false comparison anyway.1. there are always consequences to ganking a ship, unlike rl thefts.2. for a pvper, being forced to grind away ratting to resolve sec status hits is a pretty big penalty.3. ganking a ship requires a lot of planning (especially a freighter) and patience.ganking is more comparable to a heist, not grabbing someone's baggage. sure, a better mechanic would be for players to pay off dock hands at stations to identify what a freighter is carrying when it undocks. we are, however, flying internet spaceships, we have other scanners, it isn't a large stretch to think we couldn't scan the holds of other ships."
4/26/2010,because this is what makes eve strong.not supported.
4/26/2010,"while i dislike suicide ganking itself, darius is right. it is suicide ganking, and other activities in the same vein, that make eve online the game experience that it is. if you take those away, or nerf them too harshly, we'll end up with wow in space, and no one wants that."
4/26/2010,"this is madness, no"
4/26/2010,"no asking for support, just stating my opinion either you like it or not. game is made so people can enjoy it enough to pay monthly fee to do so. i can bet anything ccp will change game mechanics if numbers start to go down.maybe we will see some good changes on the next patch. who knows."
4/26/2010,"the assembly hall is the place to collect player votes, to make the proposal being carried forward by the csm. if your posting is not a proposal that the csm should push forward, then this would be the wrong forum."

4/26/2010,yes !! that<U+FFFD>s the thing. blind ganking would make ppl think twice before they lose their shiny faction ships ganking empty and hopefully insured freighters.
4/26/2010,lol. i doubt anyone with a brain would suicide gank in a faction ship.those are mostly cheap fitted t1 bs. ;)

4/26/2010,"dev have already replied to this idea and the reply boilde down to:""not until we have something that can replace enough of the function of the current local without the need to spam the directional scan every 10 seconds. ""spamming scan every 10 seconds is bad for the server and the nodes, do nothing useful in system crammed full of peoples, can easily macroed putting at a disadvantage people that don't cheat. the only thing that has changed is this new exploit where people can disappear from local. seeing ccp past reaction to a similar cheat* it is possible that if patching the client to plug the exploit is very difficult they will simply make appearing in local optional. but we will still be lacking a proper tool to scan for enemies without problems for the game. *the friend/foes tags that goonswarm was capable to add to people in local thanks to a client hack (before the current standing tags)"
4/26/2010,"why would it only be available for sov holder, that just wouldn't work.but rather than have it for just having sov 4 make it and upgrade from sov one with a low upkeep cost like 5 mill or something per month"
4/26/2010,"pretty simple, other people with the same idea came up with ""only sov holders will get rid of the delay"" and that is a no go."
4/26/2010,yes we can
4/26/2010,"supported ^^i see a few reservations reguarding ur sub-cap drone controal mods,maby a better solution too fitting 5 of thease and still maintaining a tank would be,that sub-cap drone controle have the fitting requirements of 1.5x that of the largest blaster/ac/puls lasor/missile launcher of corresponding size:large/large ect.maby add a roal bonus to t2 drone boats reguarding fitting requirement reductions,and cap ships not affected by module changes/signed"
4/26/2010,i support improving drone ships.
4/26/2010,i think there also should be some changes in drone skillscause right now it takes a tremendous amount of time to fly a ishtar and not just sit in it
4/26/2010,i support just because i want to see more sub cap drone boats other than gall
4/26/2010,"while this idea sounds good at first glance (i also suggested something similar to this), the amount of server queries required to sort local by anything other than their name would make this feature too costly in resourses to be worthwhile."
4/26/2010,"you sure for this? as there are already flags etc for standings exists - probably can do with client side, with current data"
4/26/2010,even if done client side the problems with repeated sorting local in a busy system would be less than good.also ccp have said local is not intended as an intel tool so good luck with getting more intel information added to it
4/26/2010,"as long as local is set to delayed mode like in w-space i have no problem with this. those people who want to talk and show up in the list can be sorted, those that don't won't appear."
4/26/2010,while i am not for this issue i am not exactly against it. i wouldn't want chat list to be sortable by anything but alphabetical. but in an intel tool to replace local i think sorting by standings would be great.otoh i am for optional removal of portraits in chat lists allowing more names to be displayed in the same space.
4/26/2010,this.
4/26/2010,^^ this
4/26/2010,"ccp should not spend any additional developer resources making local as superior intelligence toolinstead, they should concentrate all their resources of removing local as viable intelligence tool"
4/26/2010,"it isnt about getting the skills to rep the ship it is simply just another feature of a pos, what difference would it really make, if there is an additional way to keep a ship alive. do you all object to having repair facilities in stations too .would you all like to have a ship repair facility on your poss fly to it click an option repair ship, then go off back to a fight. instead of flying to a corporate hanger array, offline a few mods, replace them with the various repairers, wait the few mins to repair the ship or sit around waiting for a carrier/logistics pilot to fix you.i suppose if a repair facility may not be an option this particular idea of a rr array is a good second. it is seriously just a convenience idea. it could also be automatic too, so no need for people to run the arrays.rr arrays could be prevented from reping other arrays or even the tower maybe even making them only usable within the shield bubble only. so you cant just keep alive a ship defending the pos.still support this"
4/26/2010,if you got a fight on the pos ... bring out logistic ships or if allowed in the space carriers. they can sit on the edge of the shield and repping your other pilots.having them inside the pos makes the rr relatively untouchable. not affected by ewar/cap warfare. so in a pos fight you would need to kill the remote rep modules on the pos before you can even start the fight with the ships. given the hp numbers on the average pos modules that would take quite a while. so this basically encourages blobbing.still not supported. if you want rr in a fight ... get out of the shield.
4/26/2010,"well i did only say that this device would work in the shield however never said it could not be sitting outside of the shield, seeing that seems to be a point of concern for you i would have no problem with it sitting outside the shield. however if my proposed changes to pos as part of my csm campaign were to go forward the starbase would have outpost style subsystems so that would be a feature an attacking fleet could take out. if u want to discuss that goto here.i still dont see this as a full scale battle turning device, it might be best used in wh space, where resources are not as available and where individuals may only have limited support. there are obvious trade offs here and it is imposable to make everyone happy, but it is still a good idea."
4/26/2010,"centurax: when did you have your last fight on a deathstar pos?2-3 remote reps with 40000-60000 hp themself, which cant be jammed (most pos modules have sensor strength 2000), those can easily turn a fight in the long run.(combined with the other pos modules like guns/ecm/neuts)"
4/26/2010,well i typed this i a paragraph (below) speaking in support of this idea. but i realize that local reps satisfy the need i spoke about.not supported.i support this idea if implemented such that it can only repair thins inside the forcefield (from outside) and only very slowly. or some other restrictions preventing this feature drastically altering balance.
4/26/2010,"this would be the end of ganking people who fly out of the shields while the pos is being killed. as this is the highlight of hitting a pos, not supported."
4/26/2010,"1. good for u, even though it did nothing to address the issue.2. if it something still stays the same, why would u need to change it in the first place, unless u do want it to be different? might want to reasearch common sense and what it means...actually, i cleared it up several pages ago so u're still way off, seeing as how u're still *****ing about willingly, impulsively and obliviously training your main continuously, billing yourself a higher clone cost for sp u claim doesn't matter much, yet u still do it. *hint hint* ok then--let's get back to the issue u've stated u're now trying to avoid, but still won't simply because u think u're entitled to all rewards and no risk.1. yes it does at least directly correlate to combat or any other general effectiveness, otherwise, corps wouldn't be asking for minimum sp requirements in the first place.2. yet once again, u still train them, meaning they r still advantageous enough to be worth training. 1. yet, all u're proposing is to lessen the risk, not balance, lessen the risk for yourselves.2. and of course, u never bothered to read my previous post, which explains that this is no different than the usage of faction/t2 ships/mods for that extra effectiveness. only this time, the risk stays with your char because the rewards (including combat effectiveness, in addition to versatility) stay with your char, no matter what ship u're in. anytime. just be sure to actually read the explanations, including several pages ago but always glad to help. like i said before, what u're saying about not replying anymore and what u're doing, which is replying more, r two opposite things, but coming from u, it's not surprising. but hey, go ahead and play the ""flame and troll"" card for the millionth time just like everyone else when u can't even refute what i said. and while u're at it, yes, plz keep it coming. we both know that's what u're gonna do anyway, regardless of what u say."
4/26/2010,"anyone else having a problem with ppl dropping 1 or 2 super carriers on there roams.its starting to get a little to common. just when it was getting popular to drop a carrier or be dropped by one which could turn the tide of a small bs/bc gang, we now have to put up with sc coming in and doing crazy damage and not being able to do anything about it, unless you also have a massive cap fleet or part of a large 0.0 alliance.nurf those suckers when they come into low sec, cause this ain't 0.0pew pew dammit wrong area and no idea how to move"
4/26/2010,1. for moving report the posting2. be good friends with advocate destruction/ch?they might have enough caps to kill a mothership after baiting it.just a thought.
4/26/2010,duplicate thread.
4/26/2010,i am going to tell why this is a poor underthought idea.1) this shows that you have no idea how the game mechanics work because lock time is based on scan resolution so not really possible to make a specific disadvantage to targeting.2) that is not even a complete thought.3) to offset the above? why not just make the cycle time increased by 5%?4) maybe dont fight people with a capital fleet on call?
4/26/2010,"the amount of damage from stealth bombers is way over the top. i propose the following changes:- increase the lock time to lock a bomb onto somebody by 20%- increase all bomb launchers by 15%- increase the cycle time by 300%- to offset the above, let you fit 2 launchers.this way when there is a good fight going on and someone decides to fly in a fleet of bombers, it does not become an automatic i win button."
4/26/2010,his bomber whine was a few threads down. maybe join there.
4/26/2010,"the amount of shiptoasing from emo tj is way over the top. i propose the following changes:- increase the post time to post crap by 20%- decrease all emo tj mains sp by 15% - trolls in the csm? seriously?- reduce the posting rights by 15% per second- to offset the above, replace all his main's ships with ibisthis way when there is a crap post going on and someone decides to reply, it does not become an automatic i fail button."
4/26/2010,i support this.
4/26/2010,1
4/26/2010,"do i get to necro my ""posting with your main"" thread and get some thumbs up now?"
4/26/2010,of course ... ... not :p
4/26/2010,"having a quick way to identify the security of the system a stargate is linking to would be nice, especially if there are flashies on your ass"
4/26/2010,"i didnt expect you would understand it with a mindset that doesnt come further than: ""need easier ganks for killmails"".and regarding the suicide ganks:1. it was said eve needs it, eve doesnt need it, the economy wouldnt collapse without suicide ganks. and like i said, if you see losing a fully insured ship that nets you a profit by losing it as a risk, then lvl 4 missions are also risky since you lose ammo. 15 minutes not undocking, w00t big deal. and not being able to actually kill the target? yes that is a risk, kinda like the risk of losing your ship in a mission, in both cases it means you just didnt do it right."
4/26/2010,"how wrong you are, there're hundreds of bs' lost on a daily basis to suicide ganking. do you have any idea how many ships are lost, fueling mining and manufacturing? i will tell you now, it's in the thousands, and you want to kill the most important professions in eve: manufacturing and mining.please, go play wow or hello kitty."
4/26/2010,"yeah, i'm such a killmail ***** that i have a total of 7 lifetime kills on battleclinic. you don't get much more yarr than that, amirite? as for the economic impact, eve is a really bizarre case, because it basically runs entirely on the broken window fallacy. in any sort of real-world economics, destruction is bad no matter what it does to nominal gdp, because it wastes productive effort on replacement instead of expansion. in eve, the saturation point for stuff is far lower, and productive effort is something we want to maximize(since it's a game, not a job), and so we make those match up by blowing **** up. in other words, the economy is built on the principle that creation is just time-delayed destruction, and so destruction is actually more or less a good thing. you could of course build a game on a different set of assumptions - most mmos do - but that's how eve is designed. as for the merits of suicide ganks, your data is out of date. losing a battleship costs you a few mil after insurance, plus a mil a gun or so, plus the assorted other gear to make it work(damage mods, faction ammo, drones, scram, possibly a mwd or some ew). you fit cheap, of course, but you can fairly reasonably lose 10 mil on a gank bs, from my back-of-envelope numbers here. all this for the potential of a payout that you might even get to keep. i'm not saying it can't be profitable - obviously it can be. but it's nowhere near the ""100 mil an hour for no effort"" that ankh is suggesting. there exist hours you make 100 mil, but there exist a lot more hours where you make nothing at all. it is simply not income of the same sort as missioning."
4/26/2010,"how nice of you to have editted your first posts, removing your proposal to have suicide gankers/pvpers banned for legitimate tactics. but post 28 still has you quoted and so have others, your stance towards pvp has been saved.i will not vote for you and neither should any other empire citizen."
4/26/2010,"my god you are in a 0.0 alliance and this dense? you seriously think the few ships suicide ganked have any significant impact on the eve economy? the amount of ships lost in low sec, 0.0, and high sec wardecs are so much more the economy wouldnt for a second notice it when suicide ganking is removed tomorrow. and no, contrary to what you are going to claim next i dont say suicide ganking should be removed, but it should have meaningful consequences.suicide ganking that guy in an untanked iteron who is moving faction ammo worth 3b, fine. or that guy you really dislike (me for example), sure. but it shouldnt be profitable to close your eyes and gank a random target, and if you like ganking hulks for lulz you should really feel it in your wallet.and you seem to be obsessed with hello kitty, like it much?and if you mean by the hunderds of bs lost suicide ganking, those used for the suicide ganking, the same influence on the economy can (and is) created by just self destructing them. that the insurance and mineral market is at the moment obviously not healthy is not a reason why suicide ganking should be easy."
4/26/2010,"i don't get what all the flaming self-proclaiming pvp-pros here want.if you don't want high-sec carebears in the game, if you want pvp only for everyone, go make yourself a csm member and tell ccp directly! whining in the forums like ""omgwtf! ankh doesn't understand the game"" is so damn stupid, because you people don't even understand anymore that there are different playstyles and they are indeed enjoyed, also by ankh. she has her views and her opinion and enough people do want what she wants. if you want to do something against that, vote for the wtfpwnpvpplayer so he can take a contrary role. that's the purpose of the csm. thank you.edit: and yes, omg, ankh will get my damn vote, only to kick all of you trolls in your face!"
4/26/2010,"so what you're saying is, that if someone disagrees they should keep quiet? that's a refreshing point of view, please take it elsewhere"
4/26/2010,"you should probably educate yourself about ankh. the fact that she's a carebear doesn't bother anyone, the fact that she's ignorant, blinkered, stupid, terrible and, worst of all, dutch does (ps i don't have anything against dutch people). you don't want to vote for a pvp centric candidate? that's fine, there's plenty out there who aren't ankh."
4/26/2010,hey!
4/26/2010,"so, mr. economist, please do tell us what would happen to the hundreds of millions of units of minerals used up in the replacement of all these ships if suicide ganking were removed?i'm glad it only takes one bs to suicide gank a freighter and the fool who moves 3b of equipment deserves it, i'm glad we both agree. ships lost = ships replaced, shame you just don't understand it.it's an excellent place for you, ankh.i'm glad the tooth fairy will eat all the minerals that will no longer be used by suicide gankers and the impact on the market will be minor, after all hundreds of millions of units of trit is nothing, right?i shall suicide gank you, boi, for insulting us!"
4/26/2010,"hunderds of million tritanium? that is a billion isk in trit, nah that is nothing, you almost put that in a single dread. for comparison, aaa alone probably already nukes for 30b trit in a week where nothing happens, when there are some cap fights, or worse super cap deaths, it increases rapidly.but for clarification, which part of suicide ganking do you think is a requirement for the eve economy to prevent it from collapsing? the freighters that get destroyed or the fully insured bs that are lost and provide a huge isk source (didnt realise we lacked them), and effectively being equal to npc buy orders of minerals. because you know as well as i do that a suicide gank bs is practicly free, so yes it exchanges minerals for isk, but exactly the same is done via those just self destructing bs. in essence it is (almost) nothing different from npc buy orders for minerals (or ships to be a bit more precise). so please clarify, sokratez, is it the destroyed freighters that would make the economy collapse if they arent destroyed or effectively the npc ship buy orders?when we go further on that, why not just also make (t2) modules fully insurable, so we can have fleet fights where in the end no one lost anything. because following your logic having effectively (almost) free ships is a requirement to prevent the economy from collapsing. or wouldnt it just be way easier to put npc buy (and when busy anyway also sell) orders for everything since you say that is required."
4/26/2010,"to the 'lowly' miner, mining trit in his barge a billion isk is nothing. can i have 300m trit then, please?so, a destroyed freighter does not equal income for manufacturers and miners? glad we got that sorted out. seriously, you have no idea how the economy works and only look at things from your own, selfish perspective. it is your ideology that we buy a ship and an item once and never lose it. you want us to live in carebear land where pvp is non-existent and where you show off on the forums your trillions, with which you can do nothing. it is you who is advocating the collapse of this game, through destruction of its economy. the sooner you realise you will never have your carebear utopia the better it is for yourself.however, i'm sure sok can articulate this much better than i can."
4/26/2010,"ankh, dear, liranen is not sok. they are very different persons. both intelligent, but that's where the likeness stops, just about."
4/26/2010,"i thought we were talking about the eve economy, or is there only one miner supplying all tritanium in eve?about a week ago i bought myself a new dread (after self destructing my old one, that is how insurance works in eve), are you saying if i wouldnt have bought that dread (about 1b in minerals) the eve economy would have collapsed? glad to see you didnt bother answering the simple question. also funny you say i dont know how the economy works, while you are the one here who thinks 1b in trit would have be enough to crash the economy.glad to see you didnt even bother trying to do more than flaming around. i expected at least a member of a 0.0 alliance to realise there is more pvp in eve than those who need concord protection for their pvp. and that is even ignoring i never advocated the removal of suicide ganking. but dont let the facts stop you.i wish i had boobies :(edit: i am not going to continue contaminating this topic, since that isnt the point of this topic. i just wish you realise two things: first adding more consequences to suicide ganking is not the same as removing pvp from eve, and second we are talking about internet spaceships here, is it really too much to ask to have a csm campaign that is done nicer than zimbabwes elections?"
4/26/2010,"and how much of this trit is provided by miners and how much by mission runners?no but the eve market would be destroyed if pvp became non-existent and i fear that is the ultimate goal of ankh and her followers. while she may deny it, at the end of the day, that is her secret goal.what is even more interesting is how you continuously keep mentioning the freighter, while ignoring all the trit that is lost in the attempt to blow it up, by the aggressors. and what about all the other ships lost in empire? you saying that an end to suicide ganking won't have an effect on the market?it seemed like you were and if you weren't i apoligise.i do not see how we are contamunating this thread. we're having a discussion on the proposals of ankh."
4/26/2010,"i don't believe the posts have been edited meaningfully. she still praises the ultima online justice system in post #22, and if that hasn't been edited out, what else would have been? it's hard to find anything you could say to offend pvp lovers more than ""i'm fond of stripping massive amounts of sp from players who engage in nonconsensual pvp"". if she actually has edited meaningfully, please cross-reference eve-o with eve-search and point out what changed. i don't like ankh as a candidate, but please keep your complaints to the realm of the factual. you really have no need to make stuff up, there's more than enough real issues to complain about. and liranan, i'll say this pretty bluntly. hundreds of millions of trit is nothing. look at the jita trit market sometime - there's at least 20 billion units for sale right now."
4/26/2010,so whats your feeling on mission busting?how do you feel about current directional scanner mechanics?how do you feel about local as an intel tool?also...per your bio you are a student of game design? can you actually point to any eve-like mmo's you have actually designed please as they are missing from your resume?
4/26/2010,"i'll be quick and to the point. having noticed a distinct change in the tenor of your posts since you first ran for csm, i have a couple concerns / questions.1. it is clear that many players (including myself), and current/former csm have been disappointed by ccp. what specifically are you disappointed with? (for example, csm, ccp, specific mechanics, general development process of the game.)2. what do you plan to do personally as csm, if elected, to address your own and others disappointments with the game?3. why the concern with free trips? the trips seem more a reflection of ccp company culture than a distraction for csm members."
4/26/2010,"as game designer, i use exactly the same work methodologies as ccp does. both ccp and my fellow csm would benefit from my expertise in this field.i'm sorry...would you mind detailing your vast amount of experience in game design in order to verify your expertise?"
4/26/2010,"as a general note on my part, you seem to be concerned with politics surrounding the csm more than anything else. 'free trips', i'd call that an incentive. anyway, my question;why would you implement additional game mechanics to fix something that clearly isn't broken? i can see how it's an easy way to get certain voters on your side, but really, has the game become unplayable for certain game archetypes (i.e. the carebear), or is it simply lack of risk management on their part? as an example, does a hulk sitting next to an orca really need modifications to enhance cargo space? what if they'd drop the civilian shield booster, and fit it for real? does a mission runner need a 2 billion fit to do some simple l4's? there are simply numerous ways to negate the risk or prevent it altogether. you tell me you're unbiased, i'd say drop the election and start informing people like yourself."
4/26/2010,"i, too, would be interested in this."
4/26/2010,"you had my vote before, and you will have it again, but...no free trips to fanfest? that's just plain mean. in fact the more i think about it, the more i think it's important that the 'people' get the opportunity to meet their representatives in person!good luck though, and keep standing up for the little people."
4/26/2010,you got the part where ankghgehgkehglkajsalkjgm's in cva right? as in the (former) 0.0 alliance that isn't about the little people? yes? no?
4/26/2010,"i believe ankhesentapemkah is mature enough to leave in game politics in game, and represent me and my concerns as a player to ccp in a professional manner."
4/26/2010,"you clearly haven't seen some of the emails she's sent. also, why do you think that other candidates aren't equally capable of doing the same?"
4/26/2010,"i don't think that, i'm sure there are others. i only have one vote, and currently i believe ank. represents me the best."

4/26/2010,"you have my vote. one of the reasons i dont pirate is due to the lack of content for outlaws, and the order or many items in the contexdt menus annoys the heck outta meedit: please add me to your list or participants for the focus groups, i would love to help"
4/26/2010,it's ok - eve players have a lot of experience of ship spinning :)
4/26/2010,"much love to a great corp mate.do you have any thoughts about the currant black hole that is the local exploit ? seems ccp need a kicking from someone before they sort it out, figure it may as well be from you"
4/26/2010,you have my vote mynxee and please include me in the round-table. i would be honoured to participate. f
4/26/2010,"as long as it's not in the north sea, i'm okay with that my primary desire for low sec is to see new content added that is in keeping with its outlaw nature--such as the ""contract hits agent"" described elsewhere in this thread. i have no desire to make low sec safer, because to be honest, it's not that dangerous right now (with the exception of a small handful of systems where lazy gate-camping smartbombers are frequent). if you pay attention and take the most basic of precautions, you can travel low sec just fine--especially if you're not an outlaw yourself.making low sec more profitable is a noble goal, but that won't contribute to giving it a distinct identity. content is king in that regard. if unique, outlaw-centric content provides a play (and profit) opportunity that high and null sec don't offer, there is a very good chance that people of a certain mindset (outlaws, adventurers) will seek it out. designing it so that it involves pvp rather than dumb red crosses would keep it fresh because nothing is more consistently interesting or unpredictable in new eden than the dynamics between players. building in the opportunity to profit from other players would be perfectly in tune with the nature of low sec and thus in my opinion vital to any such content's success.i'm also looking forward to seeing what impact tyrannis has on low sec and on the opportunities to profit from both planetary interaction itself and from those who show up to claim their rewards from low sec planetary infrastructure. once a pirate, always a pirate...at heart!"
4/26/2010,you've got me'h vote mynx.
4/26/2010,"at the moment, you are on top of my vote list. low security space affects me directly and, from what i can tell, your vision of what it should be is similar to mine."
4/26/2010,"i'm afraid i gave up on that thread when it got to about 10 pages. much of the discussion is well outside my technical expertise and thus my eyes glazed over. obviously exploits like this one should be stomped into the ground with a hobnailed boot and the offenders suitably punished. it bears watching and ccp needs to be held accountable for some kind of answer/response/fix, so it's good the player base is keeping that thread active with questions and discussion (although discussing exploits in the forums is a slippery slope that must be approached with great care). i'm sure ccp is taking a hard look at the matter, but wouldn't expect them to discuss their investigation until a solution is identified and implemented and guilt established."
4/26/2010,"mynxee,there's already been a good deal of questions and discussions here about rr and low-sec love, which honestly wouldn't affect me directly right now. i am, however, curious about what specific ideas you might have with regards to ui love. what are some of the specific areas of the ui you would like to see updated, and what are some of the thing you think currently work well?"
4/26/2010,"hi mynxee,yes that answers my question perfectly - thank you for the time it took you to research and answer my question."
4/26/2010,"here are some ideas, based on things that bug me--mainly related to inconsistent placement and/or labeling, cumbersome workflow, or avoiding unintended consequences (e.g., trashing a ship you meant to assemble):put show info in a consistent location on every context menu...top or bottom, pick one!remove the trash it option and make it a button on the station services panel and in the assets window instead. similar for reprocess.in options-->reset settings, there are two ""are you sure?"" items listed in my window. error or are they related to different situations? and if so, which? no clue.in corp wallet, wallet divisions, change context menu items labeled ""transfer..."" to ""move..."" (money between wallet divisions) so as to avoid confusion with the functionality of the transfer money button (to give isk to a character) at the top of the window. make the corp name at the top of the station services panel a lot smaller or let me collapse it (like you can with a character sheet) so it gives me more room for my merged items/ships and other windows.can i have a transfer money button on my personal wallet? that pops up a search dialog for corp/character? in case i'm feeling generous but lazy?how come i can't export my personal wallet journal in-game? why do i have to go to the eve o web site for that? even if i'm limited to once per day or whatever it is, that's fine. show me a countdown in the wallet window, just like for jump clones.let me define the top-to-bottom order of the buttons in my neocon.allow the option of chat tabs on the left side rather than the top; this would make it easier to read the labels when many chat windows are stacked in a tall narrow shape (that i tend to use). when i'm trying to remotely contract a damaged item, give me the option of having it repaired for the customary fees as part of that process. i'm pretty sure this has been proposed either by itself or as part of a more detailed ""fix contracts ui"" proposal but as its the one thing about the contract creation workflow that makes me rage, i want to push for this specific change.change the font so that letters and numbers that look the same can be more easily visually differentiated. ""o""/""0"", ""s""/""5"", ""b""/""8"" and ""1""/""l"" most notably.granted these range from tweaks to enhancements to outright fantasies, and this is just a small sample. obviously bigger projects like an easier-to-use corp window are way more important. some of this stuff is in the backlog. some of it is just on our wish-lists. i'd like to know what, and where, and maybe when :)"
4/26/2010,"oh, forgot to answer about what i think works well. i love the overview buttons. could not live without them.love that i can move my hud and target rack around.love that i can group things on the neocon into services and services. kinda wish there was a ""financial"" that wallet, contracts, market, and assets could go into.granted i'm just new to caring about it, but the sovereignty window is nicely designed. i've never had any real issues with the pos management window either (which is visually somewhat similar to the sov window). understanding the implications of some of the pos settings is another matter. i have few to no issues with the map window; it's fun to play with. the scan probe ui is very enjoyable to use, although there are improvements that could make it even better that have been proposed.there is plenty about the ui that works just fine and there have been some welcome changes in the last couple of expansions. however, from the perspective of consistency and intuitive labeling/organization, more attention would be especially helpful for newer players. after a long time playing this game, players operate at a level of unconscious competence. that tends to make weaknesses in the ui become less noticeable and harder to spot unless they are constantly annoying."
4/26/2010,"mynxee, i've found you to be one of the most agreeable pilots in eve, and i'm glad you're running. your goals are (in my opinion) the ones that are most pressing. i'll be proud to give you my vote. best of luck on the campaign."
4/26/2010,"1st interview is up, linked in op!"
4/26/2010,you inability to read and comprehend is not exactly something that makes me want to spend votes on you. nor is your attempt at a smear campaign. but i'll bump you thread.
4/26/2010,excuse me? inability to read? ank states quite clearly there that she is fond of a system that would never ever ever work in eve and would in part destroy on of the main things that make eve great. she has all the rights to think that but i will oppose it where possible. and a smear campaign by me? if you read her thread you'll find that others are doing a much better job at that.
4/26/2010,"she is hiding behind multiple characters, posting in her own defense, digging an even deeper grave for herself and you call not being able to answer questions about her idea's on pvp a smear campaign?it'd be like going to wow and advocating an end to the pointless grind that is raiding and when people disagree with you say there's a smear campaign against you"
4/26/2010,"so at least daily i'll post something in this thread to repsond to questons or comments and to provide something to help folks decide if i deserve their vote.so let me start by thanking everyone that has let me know they support my effort to be part of the next csm. i am flattered that this early i seem to already have a large voter base! i'm not worthy but i will try and earn the support i get! :-)so todays topic is about simple things i think ccp could consider to make eve better for a lot of folks. today i talk about low sec.low sec - i am excited to see ccp is going to try some thing to make low sec more interesting. i am not sure what they plan will work. bottom line, mining and ratting in low sec needs to be way better!!! this is good for all players, it makes the carebears consider the reward worth the risk, and more importantly, it makes carebears go to low sec so that folks that love to blow up care bears come back and enjoy some quality 'sploding! risk and reward have been totally screwed up in low sec for way too long!permenant low sec gate camping in eve needs to become impossible! when i first started eve no one could tank a gate gun, then atfer a while you could have a sniper setup and camp a gate from a distance, now you can just sit at a gate and ignore the guns. this was never the intention and something needs to change, same for low sec stations. right now all gate and station guns seem to to do is blow up noobs that don't understand how the mechanics of the guns work. pirating and mayhem needs to be moved to the belts in low sec! i've seen what ccp has said in blogs about low sec and i don't know that their changes will fix the issues in low sec.i think ccp should consider some of the following for low sec:1. something like an alliance hq outpost. some structure like an outpost you could build in a low sec system. make it basically a dockable pos that allows cross alliance sharing. alliances needs a structure all corporations can truly share. also consider letting moms be dockable in this structure. i know some folks might find this a radical idea but how about make it so that even the 0.0 power blocks have a motivation to have a presence in some parts of low sec.2. low sec needs comets! a new experience in eve that lets folks gather the rare moon minerals owned by the 0.0 power blocks. comets would be scanned down and mined in a maner similate to deep core mining. they would yield all the range of moon minerals.3. low sec needs player police forces! alliances should be able to pay a fee and become the local security force in a low sec system. if they are the local ""police"" they could operate basically like concord in the system and system and make decisions for example about what trade goods are ""illegal"" and engage folks in pvp with a reduced set of restriction on combat.4. low sec needs smuggling!! eve has teased us with the idea of smuggling since the beginning but it never really got implemented. if i want to be be a bad person and slip about with questionable cargo low sec is where it should happen! introduce new market goods with some degree of illegality! also pick a class of ship and make it the smugglers ship of choice! the idea of smuggling could fill pages with possibilities!so these are just what i thought of as i'm typing this. any idea i have like this is intended to start conversations with the other pilots of eve. this all of ours game! so let me what you think. as your csm represntative i want to let ccp know what we all think would make eve better!so if you like some of this let me know! if you don't like any of this let me know too! but i ask only one thing from anyone that doesn't agree with me. let me know why and what idea you might have that you think is better.let me know what you think because in the end that is what matters,issler dainzeyour next csm representative!"
4/26/2010,"today i am going to make a really simple suggestion that coul really improve the pos usability for alliances.so when i was in csm ii i wanted to know why pos structure sharing was so broken. for example why can't i have a hangar anyone in the alliance could use. i learned that because of how alliances were implemented and how item ""ownership"" works it would be very difficult to make alliance wide sharing work. ok, i thought but still there had to be something that could let an alliance share things easily at a pos.so here is my idea the bac! the big ass can. what i'm going to suggest to ccp is that they create something as simple as a new passworded anchorable can. it can only be anchored in a pos foce field and it is simply a huge password controlled container. it would work like any other anchorable secure can, but it would be the size of a hangar. not ideal but it would make a huge difference in pos logisitcs for alliances. something very simple that could easily be added easily and make a big improvement in a very annoying experience. finally corps within alliances could easily share for things like mining ops or combat ops. just share the password and suddenly alliace poss really can be a common resource for all the member corporations in an alliance. not perfect but simple, doable and someting a lot of folks would love to have.issler dainzevoice of reason csm candidate"
4/26/2010,"who said anything about a code revamp? this kind of change is not really any more complex than any other potential lag fix, but it has several advantages - it reduces the total amount of client-server i/o, it lets that i/o be parallelized if need be, and it will reduce the total compute.which we have been doing for years, and the results speak for themselves. minor, inconsistent improvements. the bottom line is, ccp simply does not have the resources to do everything! i've been on the dev side of the equation, and i know how frustrating this is for both players and devs. the only long-term solution, the one that lets them concentrate on the stuff that only ccp can do is to be less cathedral, and more bazaar.the only way we are going to get any of the ui tweaks you want is if we have the ability to do it ourselves.i am glad you think i am ingenious -- i will certainly apply that ingenuity to any problem i am faced with if elected to csm!the key to understanding why this helps with lag is to understand two things:1) modern computer tend to be much better at compute than i/o (in the old days, it used to be the reverse)2) i/o can be made parallel and is thus much easier to scale than compute.consider a greatly simplified version of the current situation:client <--> serverwhere the client is getting all the info about everything on a grid (yes, i know it's not that simple, there are lots of optimizations going on to reduce the amount of i/o, but note that those optimizations take server cpu to perform).the way you do things to get parallel i/o is this:client <--> smart proxy <--> serverthe server never talks directly to the client. instead, it updates the smart proxy -- which can be running on a different machine, and if need be, there can be multiple instances of it. the smart proxy talks to the clients, and applies whatever perceptual filter rules are imposed (such as the one i suggested).this means that the only i/o the server is doing is sending game state snapshots to the proxies. almost all its cpu can be devoted to updating the game state.note that a proxy that does not impose any filter rules results in no gameplay changes but still offloads the i/o.i assume you mean things like gang bonuses, etc. there are global effects, but these are largely static, they don't change all that often. quite frankly, nobody who is not under nda to ccp has any idea how the internals of eve work. i, like everyone else, am making educated guesses.and once again, i'm not claiming that the gameplay change i am proposing is the best one for helping to kill lag. i'm claiming that its an example of the class of possible solutions, and demonstrates why any proposed solution will require careful discussion, mediated by csm."
4/26/2010,"they were nebulous questions designed to permit him to start an argument that would feed his need for attention. given his track record, i wasn't going to take the bait.as for piracy, at the most general level, piracy cannot flourish without fat merchants to plunder, and merchants won't venture into dangerous waters without serious economic opportunities that make the risks worthwhile. so if you want more lowsec piracy, lowsec needs to be more profitable -- planetary interaction may help out here. the problem is that if the pickings get too rich, then the big alliances will invade and take over lowsec to exploit them. this is why, historically, piracy has always been a marginal occupation, and why, in eve, getting the balance right so that there is an ecological niche where piracy can thrive is always going to be difficult, perhaps even impossible.piracy has always sucked as a occupation, except in the movies.on the contrary, a small gang will almost always be in a cohesive clump, and so much more likely to be able to observe each other. it is the larger blob that will have limited visibility of the smaller gang.note also that i have just presented the simplest case as an example. the final perceptual filter rule would probably be more complex; you might always be guaranteed to see everyone in your squad, for example.as for being disoriented, that's war. that's good. it means a smaller fleet that keeps its situational awareness can take out a bigger fleet."
4/26/2010,"the issue here is you are making fundamentally flawed assumptions of how the eve server works and attempting to build lag reduction ideas on top of them.i'll admit i had a similar view till i spoke to the devs and due to nda i can't elaborate (convenient excuse i know). suffice to say ccp showed csm4 lots of detailed graphs of server performance etc and they are working on the issue.on to the question of user customisable ui, yes it would be a nice to have but at the same time i don't want ccp to waste man years of effort on trying to close all the little loopholes and un-intended automations that people would build if given a ui api to play with.lets look at another mmo with customisable ui and some of the issues they had to patch.single button healing which cast the most mana effective heal to the player most in need from a listsingle button raid wide de-cursing (just mash that button, no need to pick the right players)auto navigation leading to more sophisticated botsand many others since i stopped following that game years ago...the common thread here was giving ui mods the ability to automate things to reduce player interactions to the point the player hardly needed to be involved.you could argue that the ui mods should be display only, but that still allows the potential for easier botting (more utilities like bacon, macro-mining etc).i for one do not want to see fleet fights turn into broadcast wars where the mods pick up broadcasts, automatically target the primaries and apply dps or logistics ships automatically catching need armour requests. i also don't want to see automatic market mods to raise/lower prices by 1 isk every 10 mins.is a ui redesign needed? yes, ccp hammerhead agreed at fanfest. does it absolutely need to be via a user modifiable ui? no and by not trying to implement an api we would likely get a better ui fastercould the csm as a stakeholder have the power to get it pushed through? nope. csm as a stakeholder will have limited development time and a ui redesign would likely require ccp to commit a whole expansion to it.good luck anyway."
4/26/2010,"yo so i'm running for csm 5, and since this is a serious matter i'ma get straight down to serious business.(there's a tl;dr in the final post)also my eve tribune interview is up for those interested:"
4/26/2010,"neutral logistics  ive seen the slaved abaddons deaggroing and warping in a guardian until they can dock, heck ive even been that guardian. i think there is a simple alternative, and that is just giving the logistics ship that does the repping an aggression timer. that is to say, after repping a ship the logistics cannot then immediately dock or jump, they have to wait the one minute like everyone else.station games  i read the last csm notes where they suggested that a warp scrambler could keep a ship from docking, with the trade off being that you can see outside the station before undocking. i am vehemently against this idea. although sometimes it is frustrating for some guy to sit on the undock in a dreadnaught or a super-tanked battleship, this change would ruin the little guy. sometimes the only time a small force can fight a larger foe is when they can dictate at least one term, and in the case of station fighting being able to kill some ill-prepared support ships and dock if things get out of control. i understand that in eve there needs to be risk, however currently with super capitals there is still a huge risk of aggroing on station. removing this option just promotes them to stay docked  eliminating any chance of a fight  or bring more people (crashing the node and eliminating any chance of a fight). guerilla warfare doesnt need to be nerfed. ecm  ecm needs to be looked at, at the very least the countermeasures (eccm) needs to be boosted. if i fit a tracking computer to my ship, i counteract half of a curses likely midslots; if i fit a sensor booster i counteract half of an arazus likely midslots; if i fit an eccm im going to get jammed by 5 ec-300s. something is not right here. now, i still think that ecm is the best way for a small group to stand up to a large group and i dont want to change that dynamic. i do think, however, that sacrificing a pivotal mid-slot should garner a more significant boost. additionally i think that ecm drones need to be looked at. its more than just rhetoric, light ecm drones seem to be disproportionally effective. a few options that i think are worth exploring are: reducing their jam strength, but increasing their speed so they will be more effective against smaller, faster targets, or simply increasing the duration of their jam while slightly reducing the effectiveness (by 5%-10%) so that they are less likely to get a jam off, with the trade-off being that it lasts longer. local in 0.0  removing local altogether would likely be far too drastic a change to implement. i good compromise, i feel, is to have anywhere between a 15 and 30 second local delay. the pilot jumping in will be able to see everyone in local who has been there for more than 15-30 seconds, but he will remain out of local until his timer expires. similar in theory to jumping in and remaining cloaked. to make holding space more valuable, systems with military upgrades and a new upgrade (local scanning upgrade, or something similar) will have a 20% per level reduction in the local delay. so a system with military upgrades 5 and this local scanning upgrade will have no local delay, and this encourages people to live in, and upgrade, systems. those who venture out for solidarity will do so with an increased risk. likewise roaming gangs would have more maneuverability in the outlying areas, but would be more at risk in the main systems."
4/26/2010,"factional warfare  i participated in fw the summer it first came out, and i was very active in it. it was probably the most fun ive had in lowsec ever. after the initial awe factor wore off, however, it became very stagnant and boring. with the addition of fw specific lp, factional warfare has picked up. i want to continue this trend and i have a few ideas. first, race with the most victory points will be given a spot in the alliance tournament (they will have to pay the entry fee like everyone else, and can choose not to field a team if they wish in which case it will go into the lottery). i think this will encourage people to stay in fw for more than a month, and make it a bona fide profession. additionally, new systems that are conquered should give a small bonus to the owning faction  perhaps a bonus similar to a non-mindlinked fleet leader. of course, these will not stack with existing leadership skills  itll merely act as a gang member with pretty good gang skills. it may not be a huge motivator for conquering systems, but i think it will be significant enough to make people consider taking systems and for having certain factions live in certain systems. low-sec, missions, and risk vs reward  low-sec is probably my favorite part of the game, but its really not in great shape at the moment. the way i see it, the main problem is that there is no real reason for people to venture into low-sec. solo miners can make just as much money in high-sec with no risk. small mining groups can make tons more mining abc ores in wormhole space which, frankly, is safer than low-sec. missioners can pull level 5 missions that are in high sec. the one thing low-sec does have going for it is pos reactions. but even then, those dont necessitate living in that system  all one has to do is check on the pos, at most, once a week. exploration is slightly better in low-sec, but only slightly. what i think needs to be done to stimulate low-sec is to both increase the reward to be more in line with the risk, and to decrease the reward in high-sec to be more in line with the risk there. there are areas in low-sec with the best agents, and those places are lively. i think if more high-level agents were introduced in low-sec with slightly better rewards, it would promote growth in those areas. level 5 missions really should not be offered in high sec, i feel this was a grave mistake; 40 minutes, 80,000 lp, no risk? i wouldnt be opposed to outright removal of level 5s in high sec, but i would be willing to listen to the concerns of those that run them exclusively in high-sec. if need be, a compromise so that mission rewards are related to the security that you run the actual mission in opposed to where you accessed the mission, so that if you get a level 5 in high sec you only get 20,000 lp instead of 80,000. still, i favor the elimination of level 5s in high sec in part because i think it would make mission running corps more necessary and will make the eve corporate landscape more dynamic. what does your corp do? oh were a mission running corp, we have created an alliance with another mission running corp, we provide security escorts for our guys, and we have a feud with the local pirates. yea, thats cool. additionally id like to see low-sec exploration a little bit more profitable. i think the best way to tackle this is to reduce the number of sites in high sec and increase the yield of sites in low-sec. like mission running corps, exploration corps would have more of a purpose and would merge different groups together. as far as mining goes, its a tough subject. high sec mining keeps eve running, and messing with that would have potentially disastrous effects. the best option, as i see it, is to remove the dense ores from high sec (the massive scordite, dense veldspar, et cetera) and increase their ratios in low-sec."
4/26/2010,"mini professions  maybe its just me, but i always thought that the explorers out there kind of get shafted. i mean, their job can be done fairly well by a dude in a drake with two weeks of training. i know specialized covert alts pilots can find these sites faster, but a non specialized ship can find them fairly easily. compare this to mining, or even missioning, and its a joke. miners aspire to fly exhumers, misisoners aspire to marauders, and explorers aspire todrake? dont get me wrong, my love for the drake is well documented, but i think tech-3s provide a great platform for making professions more than just mini. no ship gets a bonus to analyzers or code breakers, what about giving the emergent locus analyzer subsystem a 10% bonus per level ? you can ditch the tractor beam velocity bonus if you want, i really dont think anyone even uses that. explorers, be they in wormholes or wherever, will then have a de facto ship.gas clouds  there is no ship that gets a bonus to mining gas clouds. maybe im totally wrong here, but ive never seen anyone flying a skiff ever. why not retool that ship to get a gas cloud bonus. you can even get a gas strip miner if you want, thats cool. wormholes  frankly, i kind of like wormholes the way they are. perhaps leave the wormholes open for a bit longer to increase the chance of being spotted, but that isnt too high on my list of prioritiesinvention and manufacturing  i havent forgotten about you guys. batch inventing, that is installing multiple jobs at once, would be a welcomed addition. another pet peeve of mine is that bpcs and bpos all look the same, i think having bpcs a different color would help organization immensely, and it seems like it would be ridiculously easy to implement. maybe i'm the only person who accidentally drops a bpo in the midst of 9000 copies, but for some reason i don't think i'm alone.ui  i see some people on csm saying they think this is a huge issue. i am not one of those people, this will probably be dead last in my list of priorities.scamming  im ok with how it is right now. yea its a scummy way to make a living, but so long as it doesnt take advantage of game mechanics im alright with it.i have plenty of other views, but this extended another four pages and i thought that was a bit weighty. if you have any questions on where i stand, feel free to ask here and i will gladly answer any question. if you feel the need to troll me, thats cool  but do it somewhere else if you can. tl;dr ive played eve for a long time, i know the mechanics extremely well, i want low-sec to be more awesome, delayed local in 0.0, mini professions to get boosted, changes that will create a more dynamic corporate structure, fw to be more awesome, repping to cause an aggression timer, tweaking mission rewards to be more in line with risk, and boosting eccm."

4/26/2010,"hi space friedn, what is your proposed solution to make assault frigates really cool annoying ships worth using?also, do you have a stance on caldari in pvp? i feel caldari are almost useless for pvp and something should be done about this race, like a boost to the drake~ and/or missiles in pvp."

4/26/2010,it's fairly common knowledge that ccp has already said that it can't be done.
4/26/2010,i knew this would be worth waiting for. 5 votes for you.
4/26/2010,"nine page threads from two years ago are, in fact, common knowledge and pertinent to the game as it exists currently. my bad brosef. still, i'm sure there are options that can be explored in this area. the reason i say this is because, as i'm sure you know, you can differentiate between copies and originals using the science and industry ui. that's all well and good, but it would be nice if i could perhaps move a bpo using that ui, or even select multiple blueprints. the reason i deem this issue to be important enough to mention is because i deal with people who find this to be a rather annoying problem, and it seems as though the tools are halfway there. i can select multiple instances in my hangar, but i can't see which are bpcs or which are bpos or how many runs are on each without viewing info on every one. using the s&i screen i can see the runs and if they are copies, but i can't really do anything with them. two half-useful screens don't make one useful screen in this case.thanks for your comment, and i hope that i answered your question."
4/26/2010,"i will agree that the font is lousy, and although i have found a way to make a legible tilde in game it still leaves me wanting. my post about the ui may be a little bit misleading, and i thank you sir for bringing this up. the reason i have not listed the ui as one of my main issues is because, as far as i know, it's being hammered pretty hard by the current csm. additionally, the issues i brought up were more about demonstrating how i would tackle a complex issue, not only the issues that i plan to raise. that is to say, the font is not one of those dynamic issues that has different outcomes."
4/26/2010,"a max-skill curse gives -62.81% per td. three of them, after stacking nerf, gives about -87%. a tracking computer gives +30% tracking or +15% optimal, which means that even in the best case you've lost 83% of your base tracking. a max-skill arazu gives -53.13% per sd. three of them, after stacking nerf, gives about -80%. a single sensor booster gives +60%, which means that you've lost over 2/3 of your range/scan res. a dominix has 22 base sensor strength, and an eccm adds +96%, for 43.1 total. each ec-300 thus has a 1/43.1 chance of jamming the domi, which means that the group has about an 11% chance of jamming, compared to 21% without the eccm. i understand the frustration when it happens, but you need to look at the numbers. there's no practical way of countering the effects of a td, countering a sd isn't much easier, but ecm's countermeasure is actually very strong. of course, it should be the strongest, since it's the only one that gives you no boost whatsoever outside of jam protection(unlike the others, which boost more generally useful stats), but it is very good at its intended role."
4/26/2010,"mate, when was the last time you actually flew a recon in combat? i flew one yesterday, with 1150 of my 3k-something kills having been scored in one. i've almost never fit 3 ew modules on a recon. except for the caldari ones, none of the others have 3 spare slots to fit ew in them, barring a couple very specialized, niche roles you could fit for. normally you use 1-2, or none at all since you've got an alternative role with neuting, webbing or holding a point. a falcon, in contrast, fits not 2, not 3, but 6 such modules typically, and has no alternative role in combat. and there is no stacking penalty for using ecm mods.when was the last time you used, or were targeted by, ecm drones? again, yesterday for me. most of my solo / small gang ships don't leave station without a set, simply because they work so well - even smalls can be relied on to jam any ship up to and including a bs to provide a tangible advantage - or an escape that's hard to stop - far outweighing the 25 m3 of alternative uses i can come up with for the drone space they occupy.now i don't mind them being overpowered - they're overpowered equally for everyone. however i do feel their presence in their current form is taking away some of the choice i'd have in fitting my ships if they were on par with any alternatives.don't go telling how they're fine just because the numbers in a skewed example you came up with look fine to you on paper. 11% means a eccm'd bs will spend 5/43rds of its time afking, controlled by 5 lights. that's vs 5/22nds for an un-eccm'd bs. i challenge you to find a single mod or a set of drones that will make more of a difference in a small engagement.so i agree with elise that ecm, ecm drones and eccm need love - and with most every other point he made.after this post i also want to have his babies, but that's a different story :)"
4/26/2010,"i agree that the numbers paint a slightly different picture, but there is a stark difference between eft numbers and practicality. ultimately i feel as though this is the root of a fair few problems in eve.if i'm alone flying a turret ship and a curse shows up, i'm done for regardless of what i have fitted, that's just how it is and i'm fine with that. if i'm with two people, the curse can either take one person completely out of the fight (we're talking e-war here, not neuts which i know isn't realistic but stay with me here) or mitigate some damage on two targets. in the latter case my ship is still functional if i'm using a midslot for tracking - sure it's not 100% but i can still nail the dude that i have tackled. if i'm with three people, a (likely fit) curse can do do nothing to the third ship, and if any of the ships use missiles the curse can be boned (or at least run off) with relative ease. the dominix is a bit of an outlier here because it has so many utility midslots that it can get away with losing one to eccm and still function with relative normalcy. if you look at a ship like a maelstrom, armageddon, or even a typhoon or a megathron - to fit an eccm they have to give up something serious. if a falcon or rook, or even a blackbird/scorp show up fine you should be able to have one ship totally locked down with a good chance of getting a second ship totally locked down. however, two sets of light ec drones coming from an unbonused ship having a one in five chance of locking an eccm'd battleship down? and it's even worse than that, because unlike other ewar when it does fail the target still has to acquire lock - which effectively acts as a phantom jam cycle. yet another difference between eccm and other midslot items, which you actually brought up yourself, is that, even when not countering any of their related e-war, they are still beneficial. realistically you're not giving up a midslot for just one scenario, you can still gain something from it when that scenario doesn't play out. eccm, on the other hand, doesn't do anything for you when nobody tries to jam you. so between all of these factors, i think it's fair to say the eccm and ec drones merit looking into. i'm not suggesting sweeping ecm changes as i do think ecm is still the best weapon for small gangs, which are ultimately what i'm trying to promote here. thanks for your great question/critiquetd;dr, because i know i tend to be overly wordy sometimes: light ec drones are far too effective against large ships for far too little a trade off. eccm gives no practical bonus when not combating its intended counter, so should be looked into and likely tweaked to bring it inline. a midslot is a terrible thing to waste."
4/26/2010,"yeah, 3 is on the high end. i picked that to standardize, and because elise said ""half a curse's mid slots"", which implies three of them. but with the stacking nerf, the third one only operates at half effect anyways, so it doesn't matter too much. let's look at it differently, shall we? a ship with one curse td on it and 8 tracking comps(just to really prove my point) loses 1/4 of its tracking or almost half of its optimal, depending on which stat they're affecting. eight meta-14 officer tcs can only barely get you back to your base tracking, and leave you with less than 2/3 of your base range. far from you being able to counter ""half of a curse's likely mid slots"" as elise claimed, a scorpion fitting its mids entirely with officer tracking gear can't counter a single curse td, never mind three. the situation with damps isn't so bad - it only takes two sensor boosters to counter a single damp. two damps can't be countered with even 8 sbs, however. and again, elise talked about half an arazu's mids, which implies three damps. three boring damps requires five officer sensor boosters to counter. so yeah, while i don't claim my numbers were entirely realistic, they at least have the virtue of being accurate, which is better than the comment i was replying to. and regarding ecm drones, yeah, they're too good. they need a slight nerf, and other ew drones need a serious buff, because i want all types of ew drones to be at least somewhat usable. i don't consider them too insane, because warrior iis are pretty good too, but they're a bit op. nonsense. that midslot makes you go from -63% tracking to -52% tracking. unless that happens to neatly coincide with the speed the curse is orbiting you at, it's going to give you a pretty damned meaningless dps boost. let's take an example here - curse mwding around you at 20km at 2km/s, one td on you, you trying to hit it with a mega pulse ii with multifreq. without a tc, you do 1% of nominal dps. a tracking script gets you all the way up to 4.1% of nominal dps. yes, it quadruples your damage, but the phrase ""double nothing is still nothing"" comes to mind. that's why i picked it. a geddon's not going to fit eccm no matter what you do, so what it does to the geddon is fairly meaningless. the domi can sanely fit it, so i used that to illustrate what it does. granted, that's a lot. but consider, the alternative fitting is 200 dps of light drones. taking a battleships perhaps 25% of the way off the field(to account for re-lock time, though note that you can still do things like cap boost and rep while jammed) seems broadly on par with taking 200 dps off the field - most reasonable battleship fits do perhaps 1000 dps theoretical, less practical, whereas hobgoblins can be trusted to do full dps in a battleship fight. i do agree. i've seen a couple proposals for addressing this, like making eccm provide broad-spectrum resistance to all forms of ew, or like folding them in as scripts on sensor boosters. the first one seems reasonable, the second less so, but i have no objections to changing it generally."
4/26/2010,quoting this because you seem not to have noticed it. or have no excuse for this foul two-faced action.
4/26/2010,"this pretty much sums up why the csm is just a bad joke - some idiot in his 20's likes to pretend he's a teenage girl to get some attention on an internet spaceship games forum and people will consider voting for him to represent the community.i normally abstain from this fiasco, but this time i'll use my votes against this cretin."

4/26/2010,"the great philosopher once said what is good? all that heightens the feeling of power in man, the will to power, power itself. what is bad? all that is born of weakness. what is happiness? the feeling that power is growing, that resistance is overcome.. thats the key to our life. my moral code has two cardinal sins: stupidity and weakness. stupidity is a cause for all human mistakes and weakness leads to a life full of fear and self loathing. lack of intelligence is also weakness, but weak are not always stupid. strong will always rule over the weak. this is the law of nature. those who deny it are deceiving themselves. they flee from any danger, they avoid responsibility, they are afraid of any risk and think themselves somehow important and valuable. in truth, they are nothing. just the victims or the slaves for the powerful.eve online is based on those principles. in-game society is divided into those who dare and those who do not. those who dare not, who are afraid of strife and challenge(even if it leads to stagnation) are called carebears. this term is often misused. not everyone who spends most of his time running missions or ratting is the carebear. the carebears are afraid of any risk and a change. they call themselves cautious, but they are just cowards. they call themselves smart, but there is nothing smart in being afraid of interaction with other humans. they are the caste of untouchables. i, on the other hand, stand here as a candidate for those, who are not afraid to challenge customs. for those, who can think outside the box. for those, who are ready to explore, build and fight when needed.im playing since beginning of year 2007. i have experienced various parts of the game. ive been builder, ive been trader, ive done my share of logistics and pos management. ive researched, ive invented and, of course, i fought. i roamed lowsec in the search for victims on the third day in the game. before the end of the trial, i lived already in the nullsec. i was the warrior of red alliance, later, with my corp, i fought for the goonswarm, now im killing for the it alliance. conquest mechanic is not perfect in this game, but it is its essence. i like politics. i enjoy fleet battles. i am here for pvp in all forms.my main concerns are:nullsec affairsnullsec is my life. i dont want drastic changes here. i just want to improve existing features for the better experience for people, who chose to live there. for example, i would like to see interface with all reinforce timers(to substitute all out of game pos managers. i would like to see mechanics to deal with the lag, as in this topic. i do not want to see homogeneous nullsec space with no rare and/or unique resources to fight for.lowsec wastelandi would like to see lowsec boosted. low security space has great potential, but now it is mostly barren space with non-existent life. i would like to see it changed. i would like to see more convoys there, like in the old days, when there were regular freighter convoys, before ccp introduced jump freighters. i think, that lowsec needs something unique, like all booster production should be moved there, because people must have some reason to live there.highsec rebalancinglevel4 highsec missions are one big mistake. ccp should move them to lowsec or reduce mission rewards. profit should come in pair with the risk and there is no risk at all in highsec mission running.other issuesi would like to see insurance entirely removed from the game. for pvp to matter, it needs to be costly. if you are unable to buy new battleship after losing one, then fly battlecruiser or cruiser. also i would like ccp to give up the teen rating and switch to more mature theme as it suits the game about grim, unforgiving future."
4/26/2010,"thats my view on the game. if you share this vision; vision of the game, where losses come with a great cost; vision of the game, where only bold and daring are rewarded; then you should vote for me. if you have any questions about my views on other subjects, you can ask them here or by using in-game mail. in latter case, you can write me not only in english, but also in russian, polish, lithuanian or german(although im not as fluent in german as in other four languages).tl;dr: pvp oriented. carebears and whiners  go back to wow!direct voting link for your convenience.an interview with me on eve-tribune.com website."

4/26/2010,"i am shuffling through all these campaign messages and i can not understand, why there is so much hate for carebears? i spend most of my time in jita, because i enjoy trading and i do not care about 0.0 or lowsec..."
4/26/2010,"i think that you haven't read properly my posts above. i clearly stated that carebears are people, who are afraid to take a risk to achieve greater profit. traders are rarely carebears, because serious trading is risky endeavour. it's market pvp and sometimes you lose even more than some small alliance in capital fight. if you are full time trader, you should probably know, what i'm talking about. i enjoy trading myself and i earned some billions that way. when i'm talking about carebears, i'm talking about people, who act against the spirit of the game. they whine about wardecs, ninja-salvagers, suicide ganking, nullsec choke-points, etc."
4/26/2010,"it is not about player vs player or hiding in the corner.. it is about challenges in virtual world you take or not :)each game has own goal while eve eveloved into multigoal complex game which fits all possible types of gameplay, that is why it is still popular after first release in 2003.. so, be pvp player or industrialist or trader/other type, you will always find your fit in eve.. :) and because of that the game itself became huge social network."
4/26/2010,"i dont know about these ideas with ""highsec rebalancing"". 90% of eve commuity live in highsec, so i think it's will not working. but i know corbeau is a good guy as well. and i will glad to see him in csm next year :)"
4/26/2010,risk vs reward is not balanced for 4lvl atm and with increased cost of suicide gankage it will be even more unbalanced. something needs to be done or i`ll kill the kiitten.
4/26/2010,"i am fairly certain most of what i have proposed can be used in low sec, i don't have any specific low sec only plans. i really think you should think about how some of the things i have proposed could be used. i do support making low sec closer to 0.0 allowing the use of equipment currently only available to use in 0.0."
4/26/2010,"you propose a very long list of changes, both to balance and to gameplay. what do you think the odds are of you getting even half your list implemented? do you think that we should be concerned about whether the changes you propose are ultimately balanced, especially when taken as a group?"
4/26/2010,"as this is my first time running for csm i am not sure how much of this would get through but if i am lucky enough to be selected i would fight hard to get my proposals through. i cant predict the outcome if all of this was to hit the server, but i feel it would be a positive and beneficial experience for the eve community. if there are issues in particular you feel i should have further thoughts with i am willing to consider it. as a member of the csm i am fairly certain that i would be able to work out any issues with ccp that i might not have foreseen.as it is the largest part of my proposal i will use my plans with the player owned structures, i hope most of you agree the current system isnt the best it could be. having spent several months running 0.0 poss i know the problems and the time taken in running that kind of network (moon mining, reactions etc) so splitting the moon mining and reactions from starbases was one of the first things i wanted to change, it should streamline the processes and encourage different game play around them, enabling small gang to strike new targets. with the recent sov changes starbases are perhaps not as strategic as they used to be to a systems defence and thus fewer of them are needed in 0.0 where the opposite is true in empire where to do anything industrial you need to have one . also splitting off jump bridges and cyno gens and jammers so they work with infrastructure hub instead would change the way a system is attacked and defended, i feel that these changes would be positive to game play.i suppose the biggest change of turning the starbase into a single structure this will make most of the operations that can currently be done more efficient, and making the starbase a more significant target to small gangs as well, by giving it outpost style subsystems to attack. this kind of change could make a single station more significant and maybe operate as a corporations base of operations in all areas of space. i feel this in its self a positive direction for starbases to go.the main thing to take away from this is that my proposal is just that, by the time it has gone through all the processes required to get it into the game they will be slightly different, i am just offering a direction for things to go, and it is upto the eve community to decide if that is a direction that you want to go in."
4/26/2010,"hi, nice read really it's about time a serious, qualified candidate showed up who can be trusted to remain neutral, as opposed to clearly representing the interests of their alliance/powerbloc or even just their own gameplay style. more risk, more reward - i agree, totally, but care to share any ideas you have here?"
4/26/2010,another good candidate for my vote list. :)
4/26/2010,"there are some very compelling reasons for voting for teadaze, regardless of your corp and affiliations.1) he is intelligent2) he is knowledgeable3) he cares about the eve communitythese are the 3 best reasons. other reasons i could list would be that he, as a part of agony, helps teach newer players how to not just survive in 0.0, but also enjoy 0.0 immensely. he is also quite a good pvp player himself, and an unselfish team player in a fleet. as a commentator for the last tournament, he constantly impressed me and others with his accurate and intelligent comments and his good manners as a member of csm4, he has constantly been working for the community, being the tireless and selfless person to put up meeting minutes for those of us not in the csm to read, putting forward proposals and working towards a better eve.i would like you to point your attention to the issue of the deep safes. a lot of us players were in an uproar about the proposed tyrannis changes to deep safes and the resulting deletion of ships in such. teadaze was there, did a proposal at the assembly hall, and the changes were not implemented as intended, but instead in a much less harmful way. i know that it was not just because of teadaze, but he was certainly on the ball, as he is always and constantly.i doubt if there is any one candidate in the runnings who has the knowledge, the experience, the integrity and the intellect that teadaze has and i hope you will vote for him.i know i will."
4/26/2010,at this rate i wont be able to vote for myself :|+1 vote for teadaze who did a fantastic job on csm4.-t'amber
4/26/2010,"+1 for teadaze, always polite and friendly"
4/26/2010,"teadaze is a good friend and excellent instructor in agony's pvp university. he is knowledgeable, courteous and an able communicator. his love of eve is manifest in the amount of time he puts forth in csm, teaching courses in pvp-u and spending time blowing things up with us, his friends.tea, you've got my vote. *conspiratorial whisper* also, now people know where you live in eve and will flock to come pod a csm. more targets to shoot at! \o/"
4/26/2010,"at the last csm meeting there was a discussion which illustrates my feelings on risk vs reward as well as my commitment to accurate representation of player ideas and my promise to pickup well supported but apparently ignored issues.there was a proposal in the assembly hall to remove ""experimental"" gallente storyline missions. many people were upset with these missions because they were somehow linked to factional warfare even when the player offered the mission was in highsec doing missions for a highsec agent. for those not aware you get given a storyline mission after clearing 8 or so normal missions and they are the way a normal mission runner gains faction standing. this meant that rejecting the offer would require grinding more missions and hoping for a more suitable storyline.another complaint was that the missions gave no additional reward for the extra risk involved (heading into lowsec to known mission systems vs other storyline missions of delivering x units of y in highsec).whilst this is outside my usual area of gameplay because nobody else picked it up i raised the issue anyway (i promised during the csm4 campaign that i would pickup well supported issues being ignored).once i had raised the issue as described (again under my pledge of accurate representation) i proposed an amendment so rather than remove the missions that there be a branch (as per the epic arcs) where the player could pick a safer story mission instead. in addition csm agreed that the reward for the more risky option should be significantly enhanced. the amended proposal was passed with 9 votes for, 0 against.more risk for more reward whilst also giving the player a choice. win - win in my opinion"
4/26/2010,"i just want you to know that this holds a lot of weight with me. it is frustrating to have people elected and watch them miss multiple meetings. i know that real life raises its ugly head often enough, but...perhaps the question should be, ""why vote for another 0.0 candidate at all if they already have so many seats locked in?"""
4/26/2010,"a fair point. thankfully i'm not just a 0.0 candidate and have a proven track record of supporting lowsec and other issues too (including industry and empire). yes my primary focus in game is pvp but my primary focus for csm4 has been to improve communication and ensure the process is followed properly (e.g. no favouritism or short-cuts to getting issues raised).until recently agony only based out of npc 0.0 which is a different playstyle to sov 0.0 and so it is good to have people with that experience too. we also spend a good deal of time teaching newer players as well as older players new to pvp how to survive in lowsec and 0.0. as part of this we have general question and answer sessions which helps me understand the concerns players new to pvp have.if enough people take the csm election seriously then these alliances attempting to split their votes to get multiple people elected will fail to get everyone in and we'll maintain a good balance bottom line is that i am willing to put in the effort to the csm process, have a track record of raising issues not just related to 0.0 and as a returning candidate will not have to get up to speed in the ridiculously short time from taking office till the first csm summit."
4/26/2010,"i'd actually like to take the chance here to thank teadaze (and the other members of csm4) for restoring my faith in the process after the catastophic train wreck that was csm 3. you guys did a fantastic job, and i hope that csm 5 keeps up with your accomplishments."
4/26/2010,"tea,you'll have my support again. we'll probably run another free public seminar for you :)we get to talk to tea all the time so we know how hard he works and how dedicated he is to the eve community. i'm not asking the rest of you to take our word for it but give him a chance and read what he has to say. he's a straight shooter and you can trust him.peacespin"
4/26/2010,yes to t'amberi can't wait till your thoughts and ideas are flowing through eve.grass
4/26/2010,"first i believe ccp needs to do a big documentation injection into the evelopedia and make it easily accessible from within the game. new players can be intimidated by the unknown especially with a game as sophisticated (and rewarding) eve online. i too have had many friends gush about how awesome eve looks but they don't have the time nor desire to learn it from practically trial and error. and so they go play another mmo that spoon-feeds them the content. so no, i don't think ccp has done enough. i would like to see interactive video tutorials for the broad array of mechanics in eve. here is a list of examples: setting up a posvarious combat scenarios for pvp: tackling, sniping, dictoring, probing, understanding uimanufacturingmarket usemission runningwormhole lifedifferences between highsec, lowsec, and nullsec life.i could go on and on here.i want these videos to have voiceover, close captioning, and clear identification of what you're seeing as it plays. hell, if ccp won't due this i may just put together a team to do it myself. the only hiccup is fact ccp knows (or should) how everything works so they can provide 100% accurate information."
4/26/2010,i would like to see the manticore model redone in a similar manner as the scorpion too!keeping eve accessible to everyone is an issue very near and dear to my heart. especially since i personally have suffered in gameplay due to ccp changes. before the redid the scan probing system i was freaking rockstar probing ship down? now? it is too difficult for me physically complete the task due to combined use of keyboard/mouse in moving probes and resizing them. i will do whatever i can to keep this game accessible for everyone who wants to play it. and hopefully ccp will promote the creation of a focus group for this purpose.
4/26/2010,"don't hold the fact that he's dutch against him. dv was a competant chairperson on csm 3, a good representative and quite fun to go on the lash with."
4/26/2010,"i can understand your view of the little things, and i wish this game didn't have any bugs so everybody could play smoothly. however, there are a few points you should consider before you make this the entirity of your platform.first, ccp did focus on the little things. they released a patch that fixed 100 of the most complained-about bugs in this game. they got no positive feedback for it, whereas for something like dominion 1.1, the praise has been flowing in massive numbers.second, although bug fixes are critical to the continued survival of a game, it's the eye candy which sells the game. ccp have been doing well by fixing a bugged issue with the game as well as adding in eye candy. in apocrypha, they fixed scanning and gave us wormholes. in dominion, they fixed sovereignty and pirate/faction ships. in tyrranis, they're fixing a lot of aspects of manufacturing as well.i'm no ccp parrot, but i give them props for being perhaps the only mmo that is growing both in terms of game depth and in subscribers. i'm not saying that wanting and pushing for bug fixes is bad, but it's not the job of a csm delegate in the entirity.what areas of the game are you good at, and what areas would you have trouble honestly representing for your constituents? what fixes could you recommend for the problems that plague eve?"
4/26/2010,get the cloaking ship sweeper in the game where you get a ship class and a mod to find cloaked ships and the more ship sweeper in a gang actively pinging for a cloaked ship the time goes fast and you find him or maybe have a activation cost with liquid ozone or heavy water.great corp mate but a better csm you have my vote.
4/26/2010,what patch are you referring to?
4/26/2010,suggestions: tech iii cloaking mining barge? // multiple stations in 0.0 systems // some ability to counter the afk cloaky tards that lock down systems while they leave for work <<-- use consumables to limit cloaking times <<-- hunter killer style ship designed to be able to scan said cloaky tard at varing difficulties that can only be greatly enhanced when fleeted together and hunting him down and special mods that take training. // shields and secure cans hackable? // the upgradable ability to a system to place centry guns at stations and gates // tech ii insurance reworked // capitals can use all jump fuels but are more eficient to one racial type // rorqual needs fighters not drones... more to come.cinori for csm!
4/26/2010,"my platform is not based even primarily on bugs, i assure you. i've just updated the op as requested by others with examples of little things that i'm talking about. it's more little feature improvements, in addition to bugs, honing and tightening. i remember that 100+ bug patch, and it was fantastic. in fact, it impressed me so much that i resubbed after a short break, before dominion even came around. that patch has indeed been recognized by game reviews in admiration. ccp should realize that they are not only looking to get new subs, but to reactivate new ones. there's a pretty big pool of former players that would definitely resub if an ad for next expansion showed ""massive polishing expansion"" or something to that effect.check out these two links, one a threadnaught with overwhelming support, that show that this is a big issue."
4/26/2010,glad to have someone who i know is concerned about improving game quality for everyone running for csm.
4/26/2010,"an aussie on the csm... sensational!based on the above feedback you will almost certainly have at least one of my votes, but i'd like your opinion on what is a bit o a sore issue for many australian players, myself and a fee mates included; downtime.downtime falls at 9pm for the eastern seaboard aussie folks. smack bang in the middle o prime playing time. despite my best efforts, i know this has cost eve a couple of players who could put up with it during daylight svings (10pm dt) but gave up just recently. by the time som of us get home, spend some quality time with the family, eat, you know, all that annoying meatspace stuff, we've only got an hour or so to throw into thhe game, which is frustrating for some. for the weaker willed like myself it can get downright unhealthy (just one more mission/wh site/asteroid after dt!... yeah right ;))so, i'd really like to see dt time looked at and, if it's not going to be detrimental to a larger proportion of the playerbase than it will be helpful to, i'd really like to see it pushed back an hour or so.that 'for the greater good' sentiment aside, if it's only going to disadvantage th unemployed basement dwellers who gould be working then bugger 'em and give me later downtime. as a fellow aussie (perhaps eastern seaboard based?) i look forward to your thoughts on the matter oz. and as you asked, if you must answer in lyrics, i'd like a proper answer first, but then have at it. perhaps an aussie song rather than eminem?"

4/26/2010,"hello manalpan,i must say that some of your ideas have me very concerned. for one thing, what experience do you have with the pve side of the game (which accounts for approximately 70% of the playerbase in this game)?that said, i don't understand why you want to kick players from the npc corp within one month. most of the veterans inside npc corps are the very ones educating the newer players, since rookie chat is such a pain to use. if this happened, this game would stop gaining new members and start losing them. ccp isn't that stupid.npc corps already have many other disadvantages, such as the new 11% tax (which takes a huge chunk out of most pve activities), the inability to share aggro with other fleet members, the inability to erect a pos, etc.some of your other ideas concern me too, but to a lesser extent than the above one. being involved in a wardec myself on an alt, i can understand the rr nerf. however, your idea for a corpse launcher is pretty ridiculous. it sounds like something mazziliu would bring up (monster trucks replace titans, et al).i'm sorry, but i cannot back a 'joke' candidate, and that is what you appear to me to be. please list your qualifications for the job and areas of trouble with the game's mechanics so the people can make a more informed choice on yourself."
4/26/2010,"the pvp npc corporation is a very underdeveloped idea and will not be presented to csm. it is an idea for the future that definitely needs some discussion for it move forward (or be stopped however the people feel about the idea i will follow). one my bigger vendettas against npc corp only players is the rr which has a new fix proposed. the concept was basically a means to help ccp push its social group player goals instead of leave players alone in npc corps. if a group of friends only want to mission in the game i feel they should make their own corporation not protect themselves within an npc corp. this goes for things like freighter pilots and the like should not be hiding in an npc corp.yes, the corpse launcher is strictly for amusement. i wont really be pushing it in csm (am updating the blog to reflect its position is my agenda), but it represents a really easy but simple way to entertain yourself with a morgue of corpses."
4/26/2010,i approve of this product and/or service.
4/26/2010,i believe institue would be a great csm5
4/26/2010,gets my vote great guy with some interesting views. would make it a better game for all
4/26/2010,"signed,sealed,now deliver"
4/26/2010,"fatmarrow answers your questions:keith neilson interviews csm candidates...alas i don't have any helpful alliance members to big me up on this thread, so i'll do it myself :)"
4/26/2010,"ps since this seems to be an issue for some candidates let me also mention that i am able to field your questions (hopefully!) in spanish or french if you prefer, although i think this would have to be privately rather than on the forum (due to forum language rules). je parle francais / hablo espa<U+FFFD>ol."
4/26/2010,"as his alliance leader i'm always going to be a little biased but let me say this: we all know how well versed meissa is on industrial/pve themes - but he certainly knows his pvp and also how finely balanced the equilibrium is in terms of the sandbox. right now eve is the only mmo where you can really meet a few friends in a pub and spend hours planning 'something' and actually feel as unrestrained as planning something in a real life initiative. and i don't just mean a fight or a pvp tactic but also the general initiatives in eve, from banks to invasions to art to machinima or just about anything. i am confident that if he gets elected again, meissa will work hard to keep this alive. i suppose this probably means that a revolution or two might go missing, a business unfounded or a some art unmade, given that enquiring minds can continue to find solace in virtual space. but so be it - there's not much else out there like eve."
4/26/2010,"thank you very much for your support. the local exploit is a travesty in game design, it's such a simple, basic part of the game that for some reason ccp has managed to screw up. the people exploiting the bug are no better than the incompetent programmers who allowed for it to occur, this needs to be remedied especially as it can cost a player days of work (if it were a jump freighter or capital) if lost to people exploiting this. this type of flaw can ruin the game experience of any player, you should be able to lose your ship properly and on a even playing field, atleast that way if you lose it, you've lost it in a ""fair"" setting. not to someone who's using a exploit to get a leg up.there is alot of proposals on how to fix things to be more pvp-centric. i'd like to see something done and what you are proposing is not a shabby idea."
4/26/2010,"hello prospective csm delegates,there are a good number of candidates running in this election, and some people have composed massive platforms of stuff they'll promote while serving, while others have been vague in the hopes that they'll get the ambivalent vote. i have a simple question for the candidates, and i'd appreciate it if you'd answer honestly. my question is this:which issue do you believe is the most important for ccp to examine and fix in the next patch?* faction warfare* pos mechanics* war declarations/security status* corporation mechanics* general ui overhaul* mining/manufacturing mechanics* low security space balancing* other not listed above (describe please)best of luck to you all, and may we have a clean election where the best candidate wins."
4/26/2010,"i can't chose only one point. but two most important ones for me, from your list above, would be ""general ui overhaul"" and ""low security space balancing"". ui overhaul doesn't need any comments at all. everyone, who played the game, should know that user interface needs an improvement.low security space balancing is particularly highlighted in my campaign topic. there is lots of stuff that can be done there."
4/26/2010,for me it would be looking into tweaking low-sec space. you can see my thoughts on reworking the risk vs reward in low-sec in my csm thread here:
4/26/2010,"well,probably my biggest issue with eve on a personal level is the font. something needs to be done about it. ether drop it for something more legible or allow the player to select from several options. this would fall under ""general ui overhaul"". while csm4 did push this a bit i would like to see it brought more to the forefront.that being said, the most critical issue within the game is the post-dominion lag issues with fleet fights in 0.0. i have never, nor do i expect to ever, participate in 0.0 fleet ops. still getting this issue resolved is of the utmost priority.on the gripping hand, the font issue is something that falls with-in the csm purview and the post-dominion fleet lag does not."
4/26/2010,"going to hit other on this one. technically the next patch is tyrannis, which at this point is feature locked and will be the primary focus of dev time at this point. it will be the initial fallout from this expansion that will dominate the next few months starting with csm4 at release on the 18th may till csm5 take office in june.going forward there are still many little fixes and some not so little fixes like the eve font, broken sound and general ui issues that have already been raised by csm4. also in this list is black ops buffs, changes to active tanking bonuses and other ship balance items.however if i had to pick one single feature post tyrannis above all others (other than bug fixes which should come out of ccp's dev budget) it would be the treaty system promised for dominion, which would open the sandbox further and allow far more flexibility when interacting with other corps and alliances.what is more important in my opinion is that whoever makes up csm5 is willing to put in the effort to continue pushing issues taken from the assembly hall throughout their candidacy. history has shown that people with ""pet"" projects tend to get them raised in the first few meetings and then they stop raising issues. remember that the csm5 session is 10 months long and so campaigning on a few issues which will be raised and passed in the first couple of weeks isn't thinking very long term.attitude and experience are the most important things for the long term of the csm. people who are dedicated, approachable and active. see how many people running for csm5 have actively participated in the csm process by raising issues in the assembly hall or spent time commenting or just supporting them. i hope this is the case, but with the kind of unrealistic promises some candidates are making to gain votes i do wonder if that will happen"
4/26/2010,"as with others, it's not quite that simple but if you want me to stick my neck out i'd say* low security space balancing"
4/26/2010,and the net result of that won't be small gangs roaming around and harassing station services it will be bs fleets with cap support instapopping them. if you can do something with x guys you will always do it faster and more reliably with x+1 guys. giving small gangs the ability to take on strategic targets like that is a bad idea. having said that there should be a lot more ways for small gangs to actually interdict hostile activity and cause a nuisance without opening the system up to abuse.
4/26/2010,"is there any ideas on small yet not super easy things to shoot that would equally be able to be repaired to undo the damage? i don't know. just start throwing ideas out there guys, who knows what we might come up with."
4/26/2010,"for all of you csm 5 cantidates:could you please provide a synopsis of your core desires for change? what are your platforms?industrialist (builder, trader, ect)combat pilot (pvp)logistics (0.0 infrastructure, corporation manager)pve spec.this will allow players to examine, at a glance, your general blanket of goals in one location. once they have garnered an interest in your platform they can follow links provided in your posts for further information.thanks,an alt."
4/26/2010,"i'm afraid my platform doesn't fit into any of those categories neatly, but if i had to pick just a few key points:- my experience as a patent attorney has given me plenty of practical experience of getting clever ideas accepted by officialdom- i want to improve access to small gang pvp warfare in low sec and null sec, but i don't want to nerf 'epic scale' combat or make things harder for non-pvp players- i want to focus on a getting a realistic number of incremental improvements made in all areas of the game (pvp, pve, industry, etc)key links:keith neilson's e-mail interviewfatmarrow candidacy threadvote fatmarrow and i promise to serve your large vegetable needs."
4/26/2010,"i think i have elements from all platforms in one way or another.these are the core ideas and issues i want to cover:helping to develop planetary interaction.player owned structures, making changes to starbases and working towards adding new structures.sub-system targeting.general improvements to black ops, marauders, exhumers and orca.trying to add some new ship classes to make combat more interesting with escort carriers, command and communications ship and seeing where t3 battleships and frigates have disappeared to. also seeing if a ship transporter to move rigged ships around could be a reality.improvements to science and industry and the addition of trade routes.making suicide attacks in empire less appealing (but still possible).however these are just the issues i have written down, i do have ideas in other areas and feel free to ask me about how i would go about resolving issues that effect your area of eve.candidacy threadcampaign website"
4/26/2010,like many candidates i'm not concerned with a single part of the game to the exclusion of all others. anyone that is a single issue candidate probably will not be a good choice for the csm. i live in 0.0 but i also run a hi-sec industrial operation. i also spent a lot of time running missions and doing small gang stuff with friends out on the periphery of 0.0. i don't consider myself limited to any one part of the game.read my platform and ask me questions in my candidacy thread.
4/26/2010,"i'm focusing on:risk vs reward concept. safe and straightforward activities should not be profitable.lowsec boost - because it's long overdue.fleet fight experience. less lag, better ui, more fun.pos management, because it's pain in the ass at the moment.some other changes i'm interested about(but not limited to) include: close range t2 ammo boost, better market ui and more stuff to explore."
4/26/2010,"in a nutshell, the issues that interest me and which will get special attention from me as a csm are:new content for low sec that reflects its outlaw nature--particularly content for outlawsbalancing pvp: giving neutral remote reppers an aggression timer; diversifying ways to counter ecm that are weak alone but strong in combination; and exploring the possibilities of ""stacking penalties"" for fleets that would help discourage blob tactics.ui fixes. simple tweaks to improve usability and more sweeping changes to streamline tasks and remove needlessly cumbersome ""work flow"". better communications from ccp: more timely and useful information that will result in improved player expectations management, from petitions to dev blogs to forum posts.although i am best known as a low sec pirate, i have experienced all aspects of the game to one degree or another in the 3+ years i've been playing. i have a wide angle view of the game, respect all play styles, and can therefore effectively represent players from many different play styles. during my campaign, i will conduct focus groups with groups of interested players on my platform topics to brainstorm problems and solutions and produce related proposals for assembly hall.my eve-o candidacy threadmy blog life in low secin-game channel: hellcats pub"

4/26/2010,"i would suggest something to the effect of: ""in comparison to other issues, ui & menu improvements are a priority."" to which they can respond using the spectrum of ""agree"" choices.thank you for putting this together, it is a good effort. i would definitely like to be a part of it."
4/26/2010,"""tech 1, meta 0 loot should not be dropped by npcs.""the recent dev blog makes this question a bit moot. at the very least a decent portion of the problematic loot will be removed. i hope that all t1 meta 0 loot will be removed. in any case since it is happening, and there is no real battle cry against it, i see no reason to have this question listed.we discussed my distaste at how you handle the ""no opinion / don't know"" option in the last csm election so i will not bring it up here. i will just be sure to not use that option so i don't get lose out during the matching process again.in any case thanks for the effort. it was clear that people found your vote matching service of value last election."
4/26/2010,"some proposed questions:- ccp needs to change game mechanics so that blobbing is no longer effective.- corporate and alliance security mechanics are fine as-is.- ccp should improve the share system, including the creation of an in-game stock market.- a new 0.0 infrastructure upgrade should be created that nerfs cloaking in an upgraded system.- sovereign alliances in 0.0 should be allowed to anchor guns around gates and outposts.- players should be able to see who is outside their station before they undock.- ccp should spend less time developing new features and more time fixing bugs and old, broken game mechanics. a couple of those(especially the stock market and bug fixes) might be a bit one-sided in their answers, but they all address concerns i've heard around.edit: - alliances should have alliance officers, alliance storage space, alliance wallets, and the like supported in-game."
4/26/2010,"sure, some suggestions off the top of my head:(i am aware some of these issues have been brought to and commented on by ccp)issuethe existing sound engine is sufficientthe ingame font is ambiguous and needs refinementimprovements to the graphics user interface would beneficialexisting ingame menus require attention and/or additional toolsblueprints and blueprint copy icons need to be visably differentserverside issues such as closed sockets and lag are priority issuesthe new mail system requires improvement and some options to decrease wait time for loading and less required mouse clicks to move mails :)a corporation bookmark system should be made availablethe corporation role and pos role management system needs refinementa new menu should be introduced to help create/ manage and find alliance/ corp and public events :)bringing back no-longer available features such as cyno effects, engine trails and auto spin are important to meimproving and fixing existing features is more important than creating new onesstill waiting for the new effects engine...some of these are quite large issues obviously and you'd probably want to be more specific but i'm rather vague when i've just woken up.another idea if you have time would be to add a section for major topics where candidates can assign one number per topic in order of importance to them:example topics:0.0sec combatlow sec combatsoverientyfaction warfarescience and researchindustry and manufacturingclientside improvementsserverside improvementsexisting tool improvementsfuture/ new tool developmentsocial networkingtertiary applications/ apicorporation and alliance mechanicsi like your sig -t'amber"
4/26/2010,"this looks very interesting and i look forward to filling out the completed survey.maybe an issue under the ui guise ""should the ui be more user configurable?"" or ""should users be able to rearrange options in the right click menu?""the only thing i'm not a fan of is the neutrality option ""no opinion /don't know"" i might know about the issue and i might have an opinion outside of agree or disagree. i would hate to get pidgeon holed into a don't know don't care label."
4/26/2010,"for the love...hanger |'ha ng r|noun1 [in combination ] a person who hangs something : a wallpaper hanger.2 (also coat hanger) a shaped piece of wood, plastic, or metal with a hook at the top, from which clothes may be hung in order to keep them in shape and free of creases.3 something from which another thing hangs, such as a hook.4 historical a short sword that hung from a belt.hangar |'ha ng r|nouna large building with extensive floor area, typically for housing aircraft.verb [ trans. ] (usu. be hangared)place or store in a hangar : the army choppers that were hangared out at springs."
4/26/2010,"where does ccp use ""hanger""? all the market entries are for ""hangar"". also, i think you want the assembly hall."
4/27/2010,riiight... you go ahead and try that. you want the grid to die before any enemies realize you are there after all. right?
4/27/2010,"no, a stacking penalty is:pds #1 +5% shieldspds #2 +4% shieldsas opposed to 2 pds = 10% shieldsor, for armor tankers:trimark #1 = 15% armortrimark #2 = 10% armortrimark #3 = 5% armorinstead of 3 trimarks = 52% more armormany ehp modules/rigs do not have stacking penalties at all. resistance modules do, however (as they function by decreasing a percentage of the non-resisted damage type rather than the total potential damage). so, going back to the idea of plates/extenders, you actually can see dramatic increases in total hp by stacking hp modifier modules with them. again, this is not a functional/good idea in actual combat, because ehp =/= dps.i was saved time. time is the function and its constraint is locking time, not ehp. defensively, you try to waste the time of the enemy. offensively, you try to focus your fire as best as you can to pop ships before they warp out.indeed, i have not lost a rokh in over a year now, despite use in geminate and the north. i almost lost one here though. i'm usually asked to fly something else, logistics/dictor, as they are more valuable to our fleets than rokhs."
4/27/2010,"if you want anyone to take you serious you have to at least standardize what you're looking atadding a constant raw value to anything continuously will yield a lower percentage increase each time.when discussing stacking penalties you're always discussing a percentage increase over the previous value.otherwise, you could have the following situationhyperion base armor ehp: 14815+1 eanm @ max skills ehp: 19753+2 eanm @ max skills ehp: 25236first eanm adds 4938 ehpsecond eanm adds 5483 ehpare resistance modules stacking penalized or not?a: yes, even though the second adds more raw ehp than the first, the first has a larger percentage effect(33% vs 27.75%). and the percentage effect and not the raw effect is what we're measuring when we're looking for a stacking penalty.now, plates do indeed have less of a stacking penalty than eanms after the first few. but after a few you're way over your allowance for efficient fits anyway since the percentage increase has fallen so low even with the lower stacking penalty.and what do we maximize? its the combination of dps and ehp. which is the point where the percentage increase in one is equal to the percentage decrease in the other when making the trade offedit: indeed, lets just do the simple math1600rt plate #1 added to hyperion = +52.5% armor1600rt plate #2 added to hyperion = +34.4% armor <- here is where ehp maximization adds 2 eanms rather than plates1600rt plate #3 added to hyperion = +25.6% armor 1600rt plate #4 added to hyperion = +20.3% armor1600rt plate #6 added to hyperion = +16.9% armor1600rt plate #5 added to hyperion = +14.5% armorin terms of ehp these numbers are much lower since the dcii adds 53% ehp and the first plate adds less in terms of armor only.then compare to the dps added from damage mods. which, in sniping ships, is absolute at1.1/.895 for the first or 22.9% raw dpsand 1.087/.08965 = 19.6% raw dps and it seems pretty clear that simply adding plates is pretty foolish by the rubric establishedif the constraint is on locking time then dps and volley damage don't matter. and if dps and volley damage don't matter then why are you complaining about it?ain't my fault your alliance leaders are stupid.better that the node slows down and cripples the enemies ability to defend than the node slows down and cripples your ability to attack. under the heavy fleet lag of today, jumping in means losing. giving your opponent the ability to jump in when your force isn't there is just plain foolish. its asking for defeat."

4/27/2010,"the idea of these missions is interesting. tying missions into the events of eve is ok. as an empire missioner going deep into low sec is scary but i would give it a try if the risk reward merited it. however the time / risk / reward makes no sense. you want me to risk a battlecruiser or battleship and 80 million isk in implants in my head + my time for a ridiculously low reward.here is a suggestion how to fix things.create a new class of missions call them black ops missions. be offered one of these crazy missions; however, my character gets put into a special jump clone and a one shot special ship that self destructs after so many jumps. tell me i get rewarded if i succeed, but given the nature of the mission there is no penalty for failing in the mission and i would certainly give it a try no matter how dangerous. changing things up would be fun. you could send me into a class 6 wormhole, you could tell me to smuggle contraband into caldari space. i would probably give it a try. you could make my special ship a big fat target by making it yield tech 2 salvage. these missions would become fun if i am risking relatively little for a new challenge - and who knows i might like it enough to make it a career."
4/27/2010,"very well-thought out, and i love the concept picture. i've actually talked with mates about this before, as one of the suggestions of my campaign, actually making the f11 window a viable tool. very nice mate.putting these types of ""little things first"" is the base of my platform for csm. all those ""i wish they would just..."" ideas. make eve more efficient, tightened, honed. just 5 little things like this would create a synergy to greatly improve daily gameplay.see my full campaign message here:"
4/27/2010,"assuming syris anu does in fact agree this proposal/issue is so far in 100% agreement,but still lying under the radar."
4/27/2010,"yes, i fully agree."
4/27/2010,f**k yes! gallente ships need a buff in blastersalso the drone boats should be real drone boats which can compete with gun an missile ships dps wisein that process the manufacturers should be revisited and the rolls of the ships should be cleared out and eventually switch manufactureri don't agree by any mean to removal of the active armor bonusesbecause amarr already uses mostly plated ships and i think gallente should thus active tankand keep their armor repair bonus and maybe even get a bonus to capacitor use of repairersactually i think every race should have a tanking favor likeamarr > passive armorgallente > active armor (as with shield boosters)caldari > active shield and minmatar > passive shieldand get enough bonuses to their favor that even passive armor tanking should get possible in pve (wishfulness i know)of course there should be exceptions in any direction (active armor amarr ships which even have bonuses etc)and minmatar should keep the balance between shield and armor as it is but thats another story i also don't agree with the ab changes i think they should if at all get a reduction in mwd capacitor use
4/27/2010,"as much as i love my blaster boats i think buffing blasters as much as you are talking about here would make them ridiculously op. maybe give them a little bit of tracking love to help with the ""in your face punching your mouth"" concept but to be honest i think blasters are pretty well balanced atm. show me any t1 cruiser fit for short range that i can't get more dps out of a thorax or vexor.railguns on the other hand.... those things are like using a bow and arrow against an f-22. spike can't track for **** and you mine as well be shooting spit balls if you use t1 ammo.not supported to the extremes that the op is proposing, and they are extreme."
4/27/2010,"i cannot fathom what possessed you to say this. compete with missile ships in terms of dps? are you serious?1. vexor's (to my knowledge) can produce the most dps out of any normal t1 cruiser. and ~half of the dps is unaffected by ewar, what more do you want?2. drone boats strength lies in their versatility. have you ever fought a dominix fit with heavy neutralizers? they will rain pretty hard on just about everyone's day. i've even seen neut myrmidons used with great effect by ushra'khan. you can also fit a mean tank on pretty much any drone boat and just take a crap-load of damage while your drones do the work. or go balls-to-the-wall with some blasters and get up in peoples face. or play the support role and sit out at range with some railguns while your drones rip some poor guy apart. or use sentries to help you play sniper.crap guys i'm a gallente pilot and even i know that we got it good. if you're gonna run missions and hang in empire space fly caldari and poof, problem solved."
4/27/2010,"iv never wanted to train for either of them because of the poor fitting, poor bonus especialy the tp bonus and of course how bad webbers are now.what i want to see for both recons are;1.change the tp bonus to a lock time bonus so its possible to get these fast ships.for the huginn;1.remove the launcher slots and add more turrets slots2.change the missile bonus to a webber strength.3.increase the drone bandwidth to 50."
4/27/2010,"sure, 1 scram is more effective then 1 web...but having multiple scrams do nothing, having multiple webs do. i agree huginn (and rapier really) could use a web strength bonus, but 10%/level like some marauders and faction frigs get is overpowered. being able to slow down a ship to 1% of its max speed from 40km with only 2 webs now that ships are already slower and can be slowed even further with a scram added is just too much. i would however support a 5%/level bonus, bringing them to 75% with max skills. this would leave a ship with 6.25% of its normal speed remaining compared to the current 16%, and a inty that was originally going 5k/s would now go 312.5 m/s instead (2 90%'s would put it at 50m/s)."
4/27/2010,"what do you smoke man?btw, you realize that if you turn off target's mwd, his sig radius is no longer boosted by that mwd. if you web him, you have a slow frigate with sig radius of a dreadnought, which usually means a dead frigate."
4/27/2010,"by slow, you mean a ship still traveling a couple hundred m/s with a sig the size of a fly.webs are more useful at gate camps though. turn off the mwd with a scram (and prevent it warping), but it can still get (back) to the gate with the inertia from the initial burst of the mwd... unless you web it (or have a large camp).edit: supporting changes."

4/27/2010,"minmitar needed some love and they have gotten that with the boost to artillery and some ammo balancing. it was too much. currently artillery can just insta-pop practically anything under the sun. the following needs to change to bring it back down in line with the other long range guns.- increase the rof by 20%- decrease the damage by 30%- decrease the tracking by 20%- increase the optimal range by 15%this will make it more balanced with the likes of rails and beam lasers. remember, it is about balance and fairness to all other races. i am sure you minmitar people will run in here and try to derail this but ask yourself this before you post:""if i was the one being alpha struck left and right by those guns, would i think it was fair?"" speak with your heart and you will find the correct answer.fairness huggs,emo tj"

4/27/2010,"alright this is the part that will always be wrongyou want concord to be more realistic? well realistically, concord would not be invulnerable as they are now. concord would not instantly destroy a ship. concord would not always respond. concord would not always win.i am all for a more realistic concord mostly because then you can kill concord. i do not think you would be happy with getting your freighter ganked by a fleet only to watch that same fleet mop the floor with the concord that shows up.concord is really only punishing in the most balanced way possible."
4/27/2010,"i had a similar thought regarding can flipping - how was it fair that if a thief (usually in a combat ship) can steal ore from a solo miner's (in a mining ship) container that the only rectification available for the miner is that they can legally attack said combat ship (yes, in their mining ship)?i thought perhaps it would be fairer if the thief couldn't legally fight back, but then i got to thinking about it some more and realised what ccp had done with this mechanic, and they've done the same with suicide ganking freighters, and many other activities too.what ccp has done is create a game mechanic which encourages cooperative/social play. it is a criticism of many massively multiplayer online games that they are really massively single player, ie they only have single player experiences, just in the same online world as all the other players.eve is very much a social game, so much so that it stands apart from the rest of the field in this respect.it's not about expecting players to have multiple accounts, or requiring people to always work together. it's about providing tangible rewards to those who do participate in cooperative activities so that all parties involved benefit (often far) more than they would on their own.so as solo can mining carries risks that mining with haulers mitigates (but still doesn't eliminate), solo freighter runs with expensive cargoes carries risks that can be mitigated by working with others.and your homework for the day, have a look at as many eve game mechanics as you can find and think about how they encourage (but not require) people to work together. i'm sure if you look the slightest little bit that you'll find heaps."
4/27/2010,woohoo. someone who understood it!:) welcome to eve. take a seat and enjoy the flight.^^
4/27/2010,i would propose a question to you then. do you feel that the destruction of a fully insurable ship is sufficient punishment?when you consider that suicide gankers use ships that after insurance cost insignificant amounts of isk to gank and as a result receive what could be hundreds of millions worth of cargo i would think a larger punishment would be necessary. i do not personally disagree with suicide ganking but your argument is lacking i think.
4/27/2010,i dont care much about it. most people getting ganked are autopiloting. so that is just darwin at work. if i haul something of value the ship is tanked or cloaky.when you look at the killboards ... people haul faction ship bpcs and faction modules worth a few hundred millions in a t1 hauler. afk. that deserves punishment.
4/27/2010,"even without the insurance payout for concord invoking actions, the benefits can be quite high for suicide gankings. so while i would support removing insurance payouts for ships destroyed by concord, it would have very little effect on suicide gankers."
4/27/2010,"though suicide ganking is a annoying it is still a legitimate tactic in the game, always has been.though i may agree that the removal of insurance payouts would be a start in making some pilots rethink where they do it, but it should only apply to concord kills.i think ccp are working on a better concord ai anyay, or have they already deployed that? so many patches to keep track of everything .i understand where you are going with this, but cant fully support the removal from eve but do agree should be less incentive to do it. but with all things in eve the best reward comes from high risk activities, this just happens to be one of them, all you can do is not afk haul expensive stuff."
4/27/2010,"this. <U+FFFD> haul high value stuff from lowsec to highsec trade hubs on a fairly regular basis; but with basic safety precautions (my alt can't fly a cloaky hauler yet, but it can fly covops for small volume high value stuff; my main can't really get to highsec, heh) i have never been ganked.hauling isn't (and there is no reason why it should be) a riskless job; anyone with a basic grasp of game mechanics can judge how much stuff can you pack in a ship before it becomes a flying loot pinata begging to be suicided."
4/27/2010,"your mistake is thinking that concorde are there to stop you dyeing rather than to be a repercussion to the acts of others.anyhow, the insurance adjustment should go some way to helping or hindering this kind of thing.only time can tell"
4/27/2010,"i am going to have to disagree with you. suicide gankers would need to then factor in the total ship loss because of no insurance when it comes to suicide ganking.currently it only cost them a sec hit which is very easy to fix with a few battleship rats. so they get to roll the dice on the drop with no risk of isk. they get a 50% on each item to turn their risk of zero isk into profit. not a bad deal and it is the main reason suicide ganking is so rampint in eve.now if they removed insurnce if concord is on your mail, then the suicide gankers would have to have thier ship cost factored into a potential drop on the loot.can they still suicide gank you? sure. but it won't be free anymore no matter what the outcome of it is."
4/27/2010,"until you see killmails with machariel bpcs and x-type shield modules in an untanked t1 hauler.how does it matter, if you loose 65m for the tempest with t1 mods?"
4/27/2010,"if you are stupid enough to carry something valueable enough for someone to bother with taking the sec hit, replacing the ship (need to bother with bringing it to the system), scooping+selling the loot (a huge bunch of random things not worth allot is annoying to sell, especially if it has to be done trough contracts) and then waiting out the 15 minute timer then you should blame yourself.a ganker does not just need to break even on the kill, he need to make up for what he could have made with other methods. if he spends an hour ganking, he could have spent that hour running missions or any other money making activity in the game, and the ganking need to give atleast as much money as he could have made that way, after including the time spent getting sec back up again, which is far from as fast as many seem to believe."
4/27/2010,"1. i don't see a jf loss for your alliance on killboards and i don't see a link to the killmail. so, i can only theorize that something is off about this story.2. a t2 freighter isn't going to be ganked by a gang of t1 cruisers or bcs. a freighter might be though.3. flying a jf solo is dumb. whoever lost it needed to learn that lesson.4. 1b in the hold is not worth ganking a freighter let alone a jf. about 1/4 of it will drop and that's not worth the time and effort of the number of pilots required to do such a gank.5. the people who conduct the gank rarely get all the loot. there's usually a handful of industrials sitting near the gate waiting to ninja the loot that aren't connected to the group doing the gank.6. hard to scoop all the loot. can't use freighters, aren't going to use a orca (for fear that the loot that made it worth ganking the freighter will make the orca worth ganking leaving everyone feeling pretty foolish)."
4/27/2010,65 mill is not 0 mill (free) is it?
4/27/2010,"compared to the drop it is free.it is just a small cost factor that you got to take into account, not more."
4/27/2010,"i fully agree with marlona sky. that is a good start point for ccp.my personal opinion is that ships destroyed by concord should not receive any insurance. and yes, i mean 0% of the ship cost. absolute zero."
4/27/2010,i support this change and will be making a note of this in my campaign.
4/27/2010,"i thought you love badgers? they will be jealous if they find out. also, supporting the proposal."

4/27/2010,supported
4/27/2010,"yes. maybe along the lines of it telling you the eve date, and then under than telling you the local time."
4/27/2010,"not a bad idea, but there are so many other things to fix even just in terms of reducing the clicks required to do tasks in the neocom i'd be kind of annoyed if there was a dev spending time on this. maybe a good one for an intern?"
4/27/2010,"great idea! you have my support. putting these types of ""little things first"" is the base of my platform for csm. all those ""i wish they would just..."" ideas. make eve more efficient, tightened, honed. just 5 little things like this would create a synergy to greatly improve daily gameplay.see my full campaign message here:"

4/27/2010,"right, so get on with removing fighter bombers and ewar immunity already.-liang"
4/27/2010,"i don't really think that will be a good idea to be really honest. because a super capital can as easily be hotdropped in low sec as it can be in 0.0 space, so it needs it defence against other ships.it's really easy to kill a super capital in low sec as long your willing to use your brain a bit.well a suprise attack from a sc is ofc a suprise attack because you didn't really know about it. but if you know that there is a super capital around in low sec where you live and if you really want to kill it, it's not going to be that hard to do that.it's all about being able plan an attack on the sc and to bait the sc out and have a fleet ready.edit: it's 5 cyno jumps from 7bx to x-7o via 0.0 space only. not that bad. but try from 0a-kz0 down in period basis to x-7o. then it needs 13 cyno jumps."
4/27/2010,"you get these safety by moving to high sec.also i do not support this proposal.""well as the 0.0 heroes tend to say to just about anyone not interested in 0.0, ""eve is tough, deal with it.""""^applies to the op also."
4/27/2010,wont happen. and sc's are killed all the time in low sec because people in sc's get a dumb false sense of security in low sec so think of super capitals and low sec as an opportunity for fat loot.
4/27/2010,"the low sec dd bug was a real problem but the presence of super caps in low sec itself isn't really an issue. if any changes are made, i'd ban the jump portal on titans. even that's iffy though, it's only one douche bag alliance that's exploiting the hell out of it and i suspect they'll go bankrupt from fuel costs long before any nerf could be implemented.as for super carriers, i've seen one fielded. my fleet knocked it into about 75% structure before it was able to limp back inside it's pos shields. pretty sure we wiped out his fighter-bombers too. i do agree that the lack of tackling options and general low sec corp/alliance size makes them far more potent than in null sec but this isn't too big of an issue. what i would like to see is an ""empire jumping fee"" that is charged to any capital jumping into a low sec system. a 10m isk fee per jump to any 0.1 to 0.4 sec system would be enough to stop casual hotdroppers. i would exclude black ops bs's from this fee. not sure about jump freighters but i'm leaning towards them needing a hefty tax."
4/27/2010,^ make it 100 million and you'd be onto something. 10 million should be pennies for anyone who can actually get their hands on a supercapital or capitals in general. jump freighters would be the only capitals exempt for this fee.
4/27/2010,dont like super caps in low sec easy move to high sec problem solved no balancing required. the thought of banning them or nerfing them in low sec is totally ridiculous.
4/27/2010,people said the same thing when there were no counters at all for supercarriers.-liang
4/27/2010,and now there are. shouldn't you be happy?
4/27/2010,perhaps if they all worked or there wasn't an incentive to use supercarriers in in low sec... as it stands supercarriers are overpowered in low sec both because of the political landscape and because of game mechanics.-liang
4/27/2010,"the counter to a big, stationary object is a large number of dreadnoughts. those work in lowsec. you also need to make sure that the ship doesn't get away, so you use a heavy interdictor with a script. those work in lowsec too. they'll probably target the hictor with their fighters to get away, so you remote rep the hictor. for that you use carriers or logistics ships, both of which work in lowsec. what precisely are you asking for here? if you need a bigger gang to take down a mom, the recruitment forum is right there on the front page of these boards."
4/27/2010,for supercarriers to not be more powerful in low sec than in 0.0 by virtue of having fewer options available for tackling them.-liang
4/27/2010,"if you want to trap anything else, you can use generic equipment that can be carried by virtually any ship. that gives you many more options. lowsec is free from bubbles, however, and i think it should stay that way.i appreciate the point that people are making about logistics, but how often do supercaps typically have to deploy from one side of the galaxy to the other?i would generally agree with the argument in favour of following on from lowsec use of titans and restricting the use of fighter-bombers. the 'lowsec entry fee' might be interesting, but balancing anything around cost is never very easy. a better counter to hot-drops, without too great an impact on logistics, would be a short delay- maybe about 30 seconds - while 'waiting for clearance to jump into empire space'.i appreciate the time people have taken to spell out the arguments against this proposal - it's been interesting to read, and i now have a slightly better understanding of some of the issues."
4/27/2010,horrible idea is so horrible...
4/27/2010,"if you lose anything else, you're out a few hundred million, possibly as much as a couple billion if you pimp it out a whole lot. if you lose a supercapital, you're generally out 20-80 billion. yeah, i think that should take a bit of special equipment to pull off."
4/27/2010,this would be interesting in any case for any capital ship.
4/27/2010,"that's the thing, that's pretty bad scaling. currently it looks like this:high sec: no capitalslow sec: capitals and super capitals fully functional, except titan loose dd0.0: all capitals and super capitals are fully functionalto me, it would make more sense looking like this:high sec: no capitalslow sec: normal capitals fully functional, super capitals can enter in order to move trough the area but are limited in functionality by not being able to dd or deploy fighter bombers.0.0: all capitals and super capitals are fully functionalthis would create a scenario where high sec is relatively safe with no caps at all, suited for people just starting out, then you have low sec for people that are a bit more experienced and want to live in more dangerous space, and it gives an introduction to capital warfare, and it's also suitable for older players tired of the blobs in 0.0 that want to be a part of smaller entities that do not have to blob up to counter super caps and finally 0.0 where everything is allowed. super caps will still be useful in low sec, titans being able to bridge and give gang bonuses while super carriers can still rep/do twice the damage of a normal carrier but with huge ehp and ewar immunity, but while useful, they're limited enough to give the owners an incentive to focus more on 0.0 where they belong."
4/27/2010,well said. never thought i'd agree with a bane member.
4/27/2010,they already introduced a whole ship class to stop super caps being invulnerable in low sec - heavy interdictors. if you've having problems with super cap hot drops fit a hic with a focus script and learn to fight back. more friends might also help.
4/27/2010,"on second thought, ban supercaps from lowsec entirely. what, going through 11ty billion jumps through possibly hostile 0.0 is a problem? bring moar ppl."
4/27/2010,"because being stuck in ships that can't dock isn't be enough of a penalty, now they wouldn't be able to get to low sec?besides, if you can't field a hic, you probably aren't going to kill a normal carrier either, so why complain about supercarriers? what other tools for tackling them are being used in 0.0 that can't be used in low sec? you have hics, you have bumping, you can drop dreads... i'm not sure what the problem is here."
4/27/2010,hics can't be remote repped while they are using their focus point. just thought i'd point that out.
4/27/2010,"whoops, i thought that was one of the effects taken away by the script. my bad. still, if you need rep, just bring two hictors, and trade them off - one scramming, one getting repped up. cycle times are only 6 seconds with the script, so you can trade pretty quickly if you need to. the point stands, normal fleet stuff works just fine in lowsec."
4/27/2010,"^^agreed, defenders do work quite well against guristas."
4/27/2010,"if an there is a feature in game that is broken, it shall be fixed."
4/27/2010,"i don't know what it is defenders need, but they surely need something. supported."
4/27/2010,hell yeah they need to be looked at again. however they would need to be looked at very closely if they were to affect missiles other than those fired at your ship ..... a change in their use like that would make them far more usable.
4/27/2010,"there are quite a few people who mutter about how the old cyno effect really made your heart pound when a fleet of capital ships jumped in.i want to recreate that feeling.no, i do not want the old cyno effect as that's regressive development, not progressive.imagine instead that a carrier or three jumps to your grid as happens all the time. what kind of cyno effect is good? a quick whoop and there they are; nothing wrong in that. it's just three carriers.now imagine 50-200 carriers/caps/scs simultaneously jumping to the same grid you're sitting in. no whoop this time. i want visual and sound effects that cause epileptic seizures and blows eardrums. i want to sit paralyzed in shock as sub-space spatial integrity goes to hell and massive amounts of energy and mass gets dumped into a small volume of space.impress me."
4/27/2010,i'll impress you by not supporting a half-arsed proposal
4/27/2010,the old cyno effect was fine awesome. spruce it up a bit if you must... but bring it back. -liang
4/27/2010,"well, do u have hopes in ccp?i dont.they promised better cyno effects, they failed to deliver. as always."
4/27/2010,let's fix the grid before we deal with cyno effects. the dread i feel when i see a lot of caps jump is the dread of finding something else to do for the next 10-30 minutes within sight of my screen so i know when everything is functioning again (with my fingers crossed that the next screen isn't the inside of a station).
4/27/2010,"yeah, i agree that the application is pretty limited, and could prolly be accomplished with the ray and d-scan cone, or even just the d-scan cone unless it's less accurate closer to the edges of the circle.my main thing with it was use for scanning down folks, scanning moons, launching bombs, etc. i do wonder how many people would find it useful since the ray/d-scan cone it couldn't be that difficult to implement as an overlay option."
4/27/2010,"not supported.2 does not lead to more pvp because in 1 the guy has already been concorded...also, no you shouldn't get your stuff back otherwise 1 & 2 just wouldn't happen and it would destroy an entire play style in eve.support the greifers!"
4/27/2010,"""anyway, there are, trust me, players that do like to live on empire with their corps, and they will, again trust me, start leaving the game if this pathetic game mechanic failure is not fixed.""subscription numbers keep rising since 2003 in spite of all the ~pathetic~ dangerous elements. i think you are dead wrong.the entire spirit of eve is that it's a dark universe where peoples dreams can be crushed, and if you look in the right places you can stand to gain a lot. i'm not just talking about suicide ganking. this game is not for the weak, be that those unable to protect themselves, those that cannot adapt to more effective activities, or those that don't take advantage of opportunities around them.if overly cautious, pvp fearing empire dwellers leave this game, it's likely because they are bored and not because a hauler of theirs got violated."
4/27/2010,thats the risk you take when flying a giant freighter around with 6b in it... fly with 1b and people won't bat an eyelid to try gank you... simply not worth it...
4/27/2010,suicide ganking is fine as it is. gb2wow
4/27/2010,"the 'pathetic game mechanic' solves itself. you run around with 6 billion worth of merchandise in a freighter, expect to get ganked. you run around with a 3 billion fitting to do some simple missions, expect to get ganked. you fly around in a shuttle with valuable blueprints, expect to get ganked. risk management, period.oh, for some reason, the market is flooded with products at extremely reasonable prices (dirt cheap). seems this game mechanic is working just fine."
4/27/2010,wahhh wahhhhmake it so bad men can't hurt me. i counter propose that op diaf
4/27/2010,"you want to make it more realistic? sure, i'm in. just as long as you go all the way and make it possible for the criminals to fight back effectively, or to evade the cops completely. if criminals irl bring enough people and firepower, they will be able to kill the police and get away. in the same way, if they strike and get out fast enough, the police will not get there in time and the criminals get away with no penalty."
4/27/2010,"good kill on that domi, i wasn't running a mission though, but helping some random person who was stuck with scram frigates on him in room 3. eventually got him out using a rifter. directional scanner works okay, used it a lot in fw, although the refresh limitation is annoying. local feels unnatural, i like the no-local wormhole space much better. i currently don't have a hard stance on removing local from 0.0/lowsec/everywhere, but am well aware that there are many players that want to see this happen, although there are also players that oppose this view. there are also some middle-ground mechanics that are worth exploring here.the stuff at my campaign website is from csm1 and thus quite old. need to update it, yes. will put an updated cv up soon.i'm currently working at virtual fairground as game designer (and probably senior designer next month or so). we have several mmos in production. one is currently in early beta and aimed at children, club galactik (based on the galactik football series), which we used to develop our engine and backend. right now it isn't much, and full of bugs, but the upcoming update will finally implement the core gameplay, economy, item system, and all the fancy kiddy carebear stuff such as shopping, quests, avatar customization and room furnishing. we're currently in crunch-time and it should all be released soon(tm).we have another, mature, mmo in development which will use the same engine. this mmo will be a combination between rpg and strategy and feature open-world exploration, player-driven economy, territorial conquest and so on. can't say a whole lot about it, unfortunately.as game designer i am specialized in virtual economies and have designed the entire economy of club galactik and the other mmos. i build prototypes which simulate the market dynamics, so we can try out different game mechanics before we start development. with two collegues i also do game balancing. along with another senior designer, i am usually the person to write up the initial outline documents, thus creating the foundation for a new project and defining the scope."
4/27/2010,"excellent question! thanks!1) ccp promising all kinds of shiny stuff at fanfest, to the csm, and in devblogs, and then rushing out an unfinished expansion which lacks these features but introduces a whole lot of bugs. examples are fw, epic mission arcs, storefronts, treaties, and a whole lot of 0.0 mechanics which were promised to the csm over a year ago, but were completely scrapped for dominion. we got a whole lot of insider information, and every one of us agreed it was awesome. then the expansion came and excitement turned into utter disappointment.2) the lack of insight into what the heck ccp is doing, and the lack of communication between ccp and the csm, and ccp and the players.3) ccp always saying ""yeah, we'll add this to the backlog"" when confronted with csm issues, and then doing something else entirely, leaving the issues in limbo for years and eventually quitely throwing everything in the paperbin. (alliances in factional warfare, issue 1,2,3,4, ccp promising to add it in empyrean age 1.3, quantum rise, q1 2009, immediately after apocrypha.... and then making clear that nothing is going to be done with fw whatsoever due to lack of players participating) if you're not doing anything with our issues, then what's the point of raising issues on behalf of the players? due to this, many players get the impression that the csm is just something to keep them quiet and give the illusion that ccp cares about the players, when they do not.4) not asking the csm for feedback. the whole debacle with the fw missions being isk printing machines could have been prevented if only they asked someone from the csm first. plus we didn't ask for fw missions to be fixed first, there are serious exploits plaguing it for over a year now which still go unfixed despite me reproducing the crap right in front of their noses in their office! there are several other examples of this happening with 0.0 mechanics as well, same with the gallente storyline missions. if only they had asked the csm then we could've pointed them in the right direction.ccp fortunately admitted its limited use of the csm, and that's why a few of the problems are solved by the csm becoming stakeholders from csm5 onwards.in csm2, i got the q&a sessions through, but they fell into disuse. i intend to revigorate those and create a better framework for the players to submit questions.i also want to take a good look at the csm section on the wiki. it can be a lot more structured so players can track the submitted issues, instantly look up ccps response and actions. this way, don't disappear off the face of the earth after the csm has taken them up. and the csm can relay further feedback from the players to ccp immediately. there needs to be a lot more communication, both ways.the most important thing is getting ccp to move to a different business model, and stop rushing out all these incomplete expansions. this requires understanding why ccp does what it does. the average player plays for only 6 months, thus ccp is releasing these expansions to keep players hooked and paying until the next 'awesome' expansion.i think differently. another way to increase the subscribers is convincing new players to sign up, and retain old players longer. for this reason, i focus on improving the ui, as it is a great barrier to entry, and a major frustration for veterans."
4/27/2010,"14.30 in.if we don't get rid of the free trips, at least ban alcohol and drugs so we don't have csm showing up drunk and stoned. there is a clause in the initial csm-ccp meeting trip that ccp expects csm to remain sober, but some csm couldn't even manage that. i think that the csm that do this **** display a great disrespect to the players they're supposed to be representing. (i'm not pointing at darius johnson here, he needs it for his flights and contributed well during the meetings)contrary to popular belief, i do actually drink, and i'm guilty of drinking too much at cultura at some point during fanfest 2008 myself (thanks for all the free black russians). i caught and dealt with that in time, and was on time and sober the next day."
4/27/2010,"so, by your own admission and by being in cva, you admit to knowing very little about pvp and want people to vote you in based on your experience with the design of a childrens mmo. a designer of hello kitty doesn't automatically have knowledge of all games and all concepts. we only need to look at animations made by disney, which were total disasters because even the most evil character had big, brown puppy eyes and was cute.ones you are intimately familiar with, correct?how about expulsion from the csm, banning of their character(s) and their immediate eviction from ccp headquarters? you want people to pay for their own trip because you know most won't be able to and you can be elitist about it, as you will be able to afford yours and very few people will care to pay for trips like this. this, by proxy, will make you one of the very few people who will run for csm, thus, ensuring your permanent seat. very superficial from a 'game designer'."
4/27/2010,"trolls that twist my words and quote out of context will not be replied to.all your stuff has already been answered, some of which even in the post you're quoting parts of. i'm not going to repeat myself six times because you're too lazy to read."
4/27/2010,saying that ccp expects people to always show up to every meeting sober seems a bit unrealistic tbh.
4/27/2010,"this has more to do with them thinking if they vote for you, you'll show ****...and less to do with your actual platform."
4/27/2010,so free business trips are frowned on but free alcohol (which you are objecting to the imbibement of by csm members) is somehow acceptable? could you please clarify your stance on how you justify taking certain freebies and not others. at the moment this just sounds like a double standard.
4/27/2010,"trolls which twist my words and quote out of context will still not be replied to. ccp: ""in order to fully focus on the importance of the summit, alcohol will not be provided during the event. likewise, we request that councilors approach this event with all seriousness, punctuality and sobriety.""they tried as usual, there was no enforcement of it."
4/27/2010,"this is getting very confusing. are you calling everything a troll in the hope it gets cleared by the gm's, so you can pretend these questions were never asked?please, answer the question as to why giving one thing for free is acceptable and something else isn't? you make use of both the free alcohol as well as the free plane ticket and neither make a dent in ccp's budget. can we safely assume that you would gladly pay for your own alcohol?"
4/27/2010,"ankhesentapemkah, please explain how you'd protect the two key design principles of eve, meaningful loss and no assured safety, in light of some of your previous posts that seem to indicate you wish to degrade these two principles. thank you."
4/27/2010,"the alcohol was paid for by a group of eve players who decided that i wasn't having enough leisure, and took me to a bar. not by ccp. beer tickets given by ccp at fanfest are always given away to random players or traded for food tickets."
4/27/2010,"xena i like the questions you ask, they get the conversation stirring so i am going to jump in here and answer this one also.(note also, not instead of, i'd like to see ankh and the other csm runners responses)first to protect the principles that there is ""no assured safety"" i would leave the suicide mechanic exactly how it is.second to ""meaningful loss"" that one will be harder to answer until we see the final numbers from the tyran insurance changes. i can say that if concord is on your kill mail you shouldn't recieve any insurance. and i am not the biggest fan of t2 ship insurance, as it negates a bit of the meaning out of losing that hac or recon, but i am open enough that i am willing to see how that change effects the game( not that there is much choice at this time)"
4/27/2010,"wow...way to alienate an entire voting block in a single foul swoop. not to mention the fact that you've ****ed off the pvp populace (at least those that read the forums)fire your campaign manager, cuz hes an iiiiiidiot.*fake edit*nice navy domi loss during a wardec"
4/27/2010,"which voting block are you talking about exactly? and why would they be ****ed off again? because she calls someone a 0.0 elitist? you do realise there isnt exactly a shortage of 0.0 players who think they are better because they are in 0.0? and the same is also true for low sec and high sec players btw.btw i am active in 0.0, i pvp (before some smartass searches kb stats, main shiptype is logistics), i read the forums and i havent actually seen any reason why i would be ****ed off? because someone likes the system in another game but admits it wouldnt work in eve? or because she lost a navy domi? do you really want to see how my care-o-meter reacts to someone losing navy domi?"
4/27/2010,"there should never be a pvp switch, and thus highsec will never be totally safe. i hate pvp switches. my ultima online freeshard had a pvp ruleset which allowed playerkilling everywhere, and it resulted in interesting dynamics. eve is a sandbox, and completely removing non-consensual pvp will just make it stale and boring.to quote raph koster: ""there are a substantial amount of people out there who enjoy player vs player conflict of all sorts, who get crowded out of a game when it is completely safe, and go play elsewhere. and these people aren't necessarily *******s. but it is easy for them to become *******s if they feel put upon enough or if they think they can get away with it.""contrary to popular belief, i do not wish to focus on adding more limits to prevent crime from happening. i wish to add more options for players to police themselves. players should be able to provide their own security, hence the call for things such as tradable killrights and mechanics for bountyhunting and vigilante playstyles. don't fight crime with game mechanics, embrace crime and add game mechanics to let the players do the fighting. regarding meaningful loss, i dislike the current insurance mechanic. coupling payout to mineral values is the first step in the right direction, but it remains an artificial mechanic that is an isk faucet and unbalances the economy.edit: one more raph koster quote""someday we will be able to hand over the reins of policing to players. it will be seen as just a meta-game for those who are interested in it (and what's more, i bet the cops will be the same people we're currently turning into grief players with our limited mechanics). but right now, neither players nor developers are ready."""
4/27/2010,what is your stand on being unable to dock when pointed?
4/27/2010,"personally i think it kinda jumps the shark. warp scramblers and disruptors prevent a ship from initiating warp--what logical ""in character"" reason could you apply that would give them the ability to prevent docking? none. i would much rather there be a new module put in play that would serve the purpose or a ship with that special capability...some sort of super-specialized station tackler that can do little else.as to the bigger question of whether there should be a way to prevent ships outside the station from docking, it appeals as a way to help prevent docking games which are extremely annoying. but i think the implementation of the idea should involve trade-offs of some kind--such as having to decide whether it's worth devoting a pilot or a slot to a highly specialized task as described above.in general, i tend to favor solutions that require pilots to make hard choices about trade-offs and compromises."
4/27/2010,you have both my vote and best wishes.i belive you will be a voice for those of us that live in low sec....

4/27/2010,"hmmm, i'm not sure if the forum gods will smite me for linking an assembly hall thread here....might come off as cross posting...anyway, mynxee's recent affirmative reply to one of my hot button ui issues has earned her my votes!!!"
4/27/2010,"not life changing thingsbut mynxee i'd like to hear your opinion on1. bringing back the engine trails as optional.2. fixing the launcher animation for missiles (odd from no where missile shooting drakes while orbiting.3. improving all around effects such as rail guns, blasters, impacts and explosions etc.as for ccp communication, i'd like to see ccp reps push for more common dev blogs not full out dev blogs but perhaps just status reports or heads up blurbs on whats planned.... and perhaps updating of the wiki.and thank god for your bringing up lowsec and the ui as main driving forces as they really need to be dealt with... personally i like project outlaw (the expansion idea from the forum that was posted i think thats the name, probably wrong lol)"

4/27/2010,and my cloak!
4/27/2010,lolz..i've added a small manifesto to the first post to quickly summarize my stance on eve and the csm.
4/27/2010,"vote sok... for a better, balder eve!"
4/27/2010,"the lowsec changes would definitely be welcome. smuggling sounds like a fun way for noncombat-oriented thrill-seekers to enjoy themselves and make money all at once.i rather like the bac idea. it seems like it would be invaluable for groups living in wormholes.great ideas, great candidate, +1 vote!"
4/27/2010,you have support from me! count two votes from me and my second account. beep beep!
4/27/2010,"issler is certainly the best choice for csm. she has the experience and knowledge a great csm needs. i know her personally, and she does keep her promises. she has significant software development experience, too. vote issler!"
4/27/2010,"you will note that i was very careful to state that my proposal was simply an example of a potential fix based on educated guesses. the important point that i am trying to make is that the only way to kill lag long-term is gameplay changes that permit the devs to do optimizations (i/o, compute, or both) that suffer less from scaling problems. otherwise the blobs will just get bigger and you'll just be back to where you started from.i have no doubt that the devs are working round-the-clock trying to beat the latest lag problems, and i have no doubt they'll have some success. but a year from now, we'll all be complaining about it again.your point about the nda is not an excuse -- it fact, it's exactly why the csm can play a crucial role in helping to solve this problem! thanks for helping make my point more clear.i entirely agree that the automation issue is the #1 issue that must be addressed in order for addons to be implemented.fortunately, we have the benefit of the lessons learned from ""the game that must not be named"". it's been a while since i programmed an addon for it, but iirc, the restrictions that did the trick were that only one command to the server was permitted per ui action by the player, and that an object's target and actions couldn't be changed after instantiation -- though you could change the appearance.agreed to an extent, but the bottom line is, cheaters will cheat. and keep in mind that in my proposal, i suggested that all addons be public, registered and digitally signed by ccp, so if someone does develop an abusive addon, it will quickly get found by the community, reported, revoked, and the banhammer applied.i entirely agree -- and none of that would be possible. but, for example, an addon that improved your situational awareness of which of your buddies is calling for help, so that you could target them and apply the love, would be.finally, while doing an addon-based ui will be a bit more work in the short term, it's a huge win long-term in terms of ccp's own future development of new ui features. if ccp did announce they were going to spend an entire expansion cycle to doing the ui this way, i'd be one very happy eve player.thank you for the interesting questions you raised in your post."
4/27/2010,"what makes you think that a small gang has any more liklihood of having their allies nearby compared to a large gang? or that a large gang, having many more players does not also have an increased liklihood, due to having so many players of having that small gang on screen? or that a large gang, having many more players, cannot simply split into multiple smaller units to achieve the same advantage that the small gang has except more because they're more of them? or that somehow, after the sides have been weaned that the large gang, now being small gang, would not have that same advantage or have their disadvantage removed?small gangs can already defeat large gangs, and the reason that this is so has nothing to do with special mechanics meant to give advantages to smaller forces and never will.the problem with small gangs in eve is not that they are not strong and efficient, the ""problem"" is that everyone thinks that they and they alone are luke skywalker/space blackbeard/space yojimbo and god damnit the only reason they aren't totally killing those other losers is because those other losers totally blobbed them and its like totally unfair that that should happen. it doesn't ever have anything to do with the fact that those other guys might be as good or better at the game than them, that they might enjoy the type of combat seen at the size of the gang that they have, or that you are a target of opportunity in a bigger game, and it doesn't ever have anything to do with things that happen before the engagement. its a big cluster**** of ignorance; people refusing to examine the game if its the last thing they do.this is why ""blobbing"" has always meant and will always mean ""they had more guys than us""."
4/27/2010,"goum, you may be surprised to learn that i agree with many of your points; we may be arguing at cross purposes here.my point is this: that the long-term solution to lag is gameplay changes (and not necessarily anything that happens to bubble out of my tortured brain, btw) that make simply bringing more guns to the fight a sub-optimal choice -- and if those changes happen to make the dev's lives easier compute/io wise, so much the better (aka ""cake for everyone"").what those gameplay changes turn out to be is an open question (and my suggestion was just an example of something that might be worth discussing), but csm should have a big role in working out the details."
4/27/2010,"i believe you may be missing a pivotal phrase in my op. what i actually said was half of a curses' likely midslots. a curse does not fly around with 6 tds, i would be hard-pressed to find a curse that flew around with more than two. half of two, of course, being one. with a tracking computer fit, even with one td from a curse, a tempest can still track and hit a :whatever: that it has tackled. it doesn't do 100% damage, but it still hits it. geddons do actually fit eccm, but that is neither here nor there. perhaps if it were more useful people would consider fitting it - which is precisely my point. firstly i don't think light drones do that much damage (probably about 70% of that), but that's really not important. what the issue is that almost no resources can have such a significant impact where the counter to that, which is a significant resource, doesn't do more. hope this cleared things up a bit, we essentially agree that eccm needs looking into - we just vary in how to accomplish it. and like i mentioned earlier, i don't have something set in stone; i'm willing to explore various paths. i don't like the idea of an eccm that gives a slight tracking boost and a slight locking bonus - it strikes me as either gimmicky (or crazy overpowered if it's too powerful to be not gimmicky). i will still gladly listen to other ideas for it, but talking about it is the first step."

4/27/2010,are you going say something to improve the ui? i think we all can use some ingenious window slimming and blending that prevents our 1900x1200 turning into boxes and a 800x600 view of space. or perhaps bring up the issue of butt-ugly ships like the moa and imicus? sorry if i'm being too aesthetic lol
4/27/2010,"hi cat andrea herewhat ideas do u have for lowsec??? do you support more reward for the risk or making it safer??? also was wondering if u have any ideas concerning the economy i think it would be fun to have a publicly traded stock exchange and maybe some fdic thing or something lol also y do u hate pirates???x(cat, i think you are one of the more amusing people on the forums, and i hope you stay around in eve. this place wouldn't be nearly as much fun without you!)"

4/27/2010,"so you want me to do your job for you? is it so hard to state that you either have little interest in low sec, or that some of your ideas can be used or implemented in low sec......the ability to use the high end capital (titan and sc)building arrays in low sec would imo create an uproar among the 0.0 denizens. it would also blurr the borders between low sec and 0.0 even more.yes, i live in low-sec, yes i am biased towards candidates that at least mention or pretend to have low sec on their agenda.stil: no support"
4/27/2010,"i am not looking for you to do my job for me, but you would be voting for me to represent your interests as a member of the csm, i cant guess what you want, i may have a good idea, but if there is an issue that no one else has even looked at and anyone feels i fulfill other requirements the best, let me know and i will represent it when elected. plus there is only so much that can be covered in a campaign anyway.you want to be able to build super capitals in low sec seeing as that is tied into the sov in 0.0 the only way round that might be to change the way low sec operates. so if the viceroy idea ccp were suggesting for low sec was to go through where corporations could have more of a say in low sec. then having a kind of infrastructure hub for low sec could allow cororations to deploy things like outposts or capital construction arrays, then that could be one way of looking at allowing that to happen.how i feel my ideas do represent low sec here are a few:i would have thought that sub system targeting on ships would have been of appeal to you. for pirates will make the task of ransoming a ship easer for example.having a command and communication ship would have a significant advantage in organizing gangs to take on targets. my simplification of system scanning may well be of benefit to those living in low sec making finding ships and complexes easier. changes to starbases would allow you to operate in systems without stations more effectively in low sec specifically with repair facilities and refineries to process low end modules etc.even the addition of escort carriers would be of benefit i would have thought allowing you to take on bigger ships more effectively.but if you want some low sec specific low sec ideas:allow the use of interdictor bubbles in low sec, but this would also have to go in hand with improvements to warp core stabilizers (going for balance here, as having every gate in low sec covered in bubbles wont help anyone).allow the use of bombs in low sec.make low sec mining better, by adding some better ore here and there .more may follow but that is all i have for now."
4/27/2010,"teadaze sounds like the best candidate in my opinion, regardless of where you come from. he isn't trying to advocate a specific power block, he can work with all sides and he takes the time to talk to regular players. just the fact that he gets a vote of confidence from several of his opponents says a lot about this guy.+1 vote for you. best of luck for your campaign."
4/27/2010,"hear me, hear me!don't vote teadaze!don't vote teadaze if you don't want a responsible, impartial, honest representative on the csm!don't vote teadaze if you're easily swayed by foolish promises and emotional drivel about pvp being somehow wrong!don't vote teadaze for reasons of friendship or admiration!don't vote teadaze because a vote for teadaze is a vote for sanity and effective use of time and resources on the csm!"
4/27/2010,"listening to so many candidates who want to tell us that eve is ... [fill in whatever they want to cram down our throat], its nice to hear teadaze say ""eve is a unique place with a vibrant and diverse community and where players can shape the news and even the game itself.""i like that eve allows people to have fun doing all sorts of different activities. teadaze seems to understand and appreciate that. if i hear one more scrawny nerd rasping on about how eve is great because it's ""unforgiving, merciless and harsh,"" i'm cracking skulls. teadaze did a good job making sure the views that were expressed by the players in assembly hall were heard. he also also did a great job making sure players could learn what was happening in the csm! just remember, if we don't elect him again, we - players - might not have that."

4/27/2010,"sensor booster graphics.this apparently has been brought up several times before, but can you elaborate on why ccp feels we need the whole world to know we have an active sensor booster? the graphic is so obnoxious that it actually detracts from the gaming experience.will you bring this up (again)?"
4/27/2010,user interfaceone thing that particularly bothers me is the visibility/accuracy of the various timers. these are tucked away where they are barely visible.can you clonk some heads to sort this out?
4/27/2010,ccp agreed to do something about many of the graphical effects in-game from ships. hopefully you'll be able to disable effects based on their type. for example turning of sensor boosters but keeping remote rep visuals.and yes i will ask them for an update on this change.
4/27/2010,"avalloc, i have a couple things...right now i think the main thing facing players in 0.0 space is the introduction of terrible lag with dominion. there has always been lag when looking at massive fleet battles (500+ in a system) however since the last major patch having 150-200 people in a system engaged in combat seems to now cause significant lag. many pilots are now reluctant to engage in large-scale fleet battles for fear of jumping/bridging into a system only to load a black screen. with conflict be spurred by fights over moon resources and sovereignty structures which require capital ship fleets or large battleship fleets to effectively attack or defend, what is being done to resolve the crippling lag issue? or will pos and sovereignty structures be rebalanced to move fleet combat away from large fleet combat and towards smaller, more strategic fleets?the value of moon minerals changed with dominion such that certain minerals which are regional became more valuable than other minerals of equal or greater rarity. technetium being the prime example. was this intentional or an unforeseen consequence of the re-balancing? will we same the same un-even distribution of valuable resources with the introduction of planetary interaction?the re-balancing of super capital class ships and the introduction of fighterbomber drones has changed how capital fleet engagements are fought. a super carriers make great anti-capital ships with fighter bombers however they can also be used to incapacitate pos modules (turret batteries, ecm batteries, anything that is anchored outside the pos shields) and can easily shoot incapacitated modules through 99% resists and destroy them. a well fit super carrier can also tank a well armed pos. i understand the need for an anti-capital ship weapon such as fighter bombers, and the need for a super capital class ship to have a reasonable tank, however it seems out of balance for both to be use simultaneously with no drawbacks. while i think the re-balance of super capital ships (super carriers and titans) has been overall a good thing, are super capital ships and fighter bombers going to be revisited for a ""fine tuning"" pass any time soon?thanks!"

4/27/2010,"ahh the old downtime argument. i agree, for the aussie's it's not the best of times to have it, but unfortunately the downtime occurs at a certain part of the day for ccp to work on the servers and that happens to coincide with our primetime. there have been a few suggestions in the past to move it an hour or 2 backwards or forwards, but that then inconveniences other time zones (altho it's nz, and really, how many sheep play this game? ), so unfortunately for now we have to live with it.i say for now, because it's the ultimate goal of ccp to not have a dt at all, and since they decided to pay the aussies back for the downtimes by hiring one of us to work on that project (hi ccp mindstar), we're starting to see progress on that front, i believe the basic cycle down/up time is now 15mins compares to the old 1hour. so yeah, while it is a pita, i'd rather ccp work on removing dt entirely than restructure their work flow to not inconvenience us.and some lyrics because i promised (tim rogers is my neighbour):been watching so much eve-tvi'm thinner than i should bei'm like a waterlogged podthat no-one wants to warp scramble anymorean gatecamping warp bubblethat no dictor can get throughit's all fedo's & blue pilla pirate tag and a slaver houndi miss you like sleepand there's nothing heroic about the hours i keepthe warp-in's when it startsi don't look so sharpnow i got a snake implanti talk a lot about killboardsand ships i podded in ranceri **** off my friendsi'm insuring ship just for the fraudnow every e-plate's got a heat gaini'm loving 1600's againi know every stat about trans and versalsand ehp's and dps's and bombsi miss you like sleepand there's nothing heroic about the hours i keepthe warp-in's when it startsi don't look so sharpnow i got a snake implant..."

4/27/2010,"listening isn't, perhaps, the best word to use. i'm doing the reading and the digging right now to find out what is being asked by the playerbase, and what has actually made it into csm minutes. there's not much to be done about the items ccp refuses to deal with unless we know some reason why. unfortunately, non-disclosure agreements can prevent the csm from even passing that ""why"" onto the playerbase. however, my skills irl and in eve have centered around facilitation and compromise. once i know an issue or a problem... or even just a want... i work solo and in cooperation with others to get those dealt with. sometimes it has meant doing all the work myself; sometimes it's just pointing in the right direction. i can't atm say precisely what players want. i'm still doing the research on that one. but as 0.0 pos dweller, i'm partial to the modular pos ideas that have been re-proposed. having to run all over to manage a pos gets tedious. i'd far prefer something more centralized.greymouse for csm5"

4/27/2010,if you're against ankhesentapemkah's ideas and ideals and are running for csm please post in this thread so that i can decide which of you to choose from for my votes.thanks in advance.
4/27/2010,but but.... i only wanted to buff blaster tracking.... which the rest of the csm voted against
4/27/2010,"i support suicide ganking, non-consensual pvp, and profit at the expense of others. i will never, ever support or vote for any proposal--by ank or anyone else--that seeks to deny players the ability to do these things or impose ridiculously severe penalties for doing them. with one exception: the removal of insurance payouts for ships killed by concord wouldn't bother me one bit. smart suicide gankers who choose their targets well and position their support crews effectively can profit nicely even after factoring in the ship loss.if we are both elected to csm5, i will find a way to work amicably with you, ank, but i will oppose with all my will, heart, and soul any effort whatsoever to make changes such as you described here:that nonsense has no place in eve online. this is a pvp-centric game--whether that pvp is consensual or not--and i aim to keep it that way. bellum, you've known me a long time and you know where my interests lie. i am a pirate at heart and always will be. give me your votes and your interests--and those of pirates and pvp'ers throughout new eden--will be well-represented."
4/27/2010,"with respect to the insurance issue- just remove it completely. from everything. problem solved. soooo much time and energy has been wasted discussing this to death and now ccp is implementing changes to insurance to reduce it and they've wasted countless dev hours i'm sure debating how best to implement the change when they could have just removed it and been done with it.removing it completely is fair to everyone, suicide ganker or not. if suicide ganking doesn't get insurance i don't see why anyone else needs it either. ship losses should be painful. if you lose too many ships, fly smaller ships."
4/27/2010,"ankhesentapemkah is anti-pvp candidate. even if i admire her dedication, i can not and will not support any of hers proposed changes, which are against everything that eve stands for - pvp, pvp and more pvp.suicide ganking is viable tactic. period. my proposal to remove insurance entirely should solve the issue, when people are killing for marginally low profit, but it won't remove possibility to kill targets wherever we want and wherever we want. also, insurance removal would make combat in eve even more harsh and unforgiving."
4/27/2010,"a bit silly to basically make a hate thread, we could read all about ank's ideas and there is a discussion in her own thread, but this is just populistic mudslingingsad...but i guess you could all make lovely politicians :)"
4/27/2010,it's a perfectly valid question to be honest. ankletapepshah's ideas are completely out of touch with what eve is all about. there are plenty of good csm candidates who will look at the game as a whole and be able to apply more realistic logic to the issues the player base feels needs investigating.vote elsie randolph imo.
4/27/2010,making this thread accomplishes a few things:1) it tells me who is against ankh's ideas.2) it tells me who has the balls to publicly admit that they're against ankh's ideas and put it in writing.#2 is almost more important to me than #1. i want to vote for someone who isn't afraid to pick a side and stand by their position.
4/27/2010,"if you read the thread its quite obvious that people dare to publicly say they don't like it and are quite confrontational about iti'm a bit puzzled about the need for this thread , but then again i am not the brightest bulb around ^^"
4/27/2010,why did the rest of those idiots reject the tracking formula change proposal?*edit*stfu eve forums and your crappy 5 minute post delay.
4/27/2010,"this game is obviously pvp centric, and one of the key aspects that attracts many to it, is the harsh reality of the game world; meaningful loss and no assured safety. anything that jeopardizes those two core principles of the game's design should be vehemently fought against."
4/27/2010,"this thread is just a shortcut mechanism for bellum to evaluate candidates based on his selection criteria while avoiding the need to read through other more lengthy threads. i posted here to help him decide whether he wants to send his votes my way. while we have extremely incompatible philosophies about what eve should be like, i harbor no hate toward ank (or anyone else for that matter). i certainly don't mind discussing my differences of opinion with hers or any other fellow candidate's views publicly but personally prefer to refrain from doing so in their campaign threads. i do keep up with the responses of other players in those threads, however."
4/27/2010,"don't have the logs anymore but it went something like this.i displayed this graph.me: here it shows how the tracking formula is inherently flawed as the exponential increase....them: i don't understand, this graph says nothing! explain!me: well if you look, you can see that tracking an object becomes impossible after....them: so what, blasters work fine!me: well, not really, as you can see pulse lasers have 4 times as much tracking at their optimal than blasters and this causes blasters to have a damage reduction....them: too much blahblah!me: you asked me to explain....them: yes but blasters are fine!me: the tracking formula is not at close range, but this has always been covered up by web strength which was nerfed in....them: small turrets can hit at close range, thus there is nothing wrong with the tracking formula!me: as you can see, small turrets also have a tracking that is an order of magnitude higher, which is required to cope with the exponential increase of....them: just shut up, they're fine! your calculations are meaningless if blasters are perfectly fine in game! do you know the behind-the-scenes calculations? no? then your models are worthless!no solid arguments, whatsoever."
4/27/2010,"without wanting to sidetrack bellum's thread, i'm just going to say that i too would be profoundly unimpressed by a graph with unlabelled axes and no context. i assume the x-axis refers to the price of haddock in timbuktu, measured in simoleans, and the y-axis to the average annual rainfall on the plains of spain, in cubic kilometres?if that graph is indicative of your approach when raising issues in the csm and with ccp, then you would appear to be pretty terrible at arguing your position."
4/27/2010,this thread can't end well. then again bellum is the op so that would be expected.the csm you should chose should pop up quite quickly with a modest investment of time looking over the candidates. there is no reason to post a thread which in the end is a negative campaign ad. you would be better served making this post in c&p. i would not have issues any with it being there.
4/27/2010,"whine whine, troll troll. do you really think i didn't tell them what it stood for?if you are interested, it's the angular velocity of a target (and thus the value compared to gun tracking to determine if and how the target is hit) of an object traveling at 500m/s, based on the distance to the target. the lower lines are webbed targets, before and after the web nerf.either way, with the tracking as is, a large neutron blaster cannon ii with antimatter tracking (0.0433rads/sec) at optimal (3600 meters) is normalized against tan(0.0433)*3600 = 156 m/s of transversal. this while a pulse laser ii is normalized against tan(0.03375) * 24000 = 810 m/s of transversal.not surprising that the pulse laser ii outdamages the large blaster cannon ii at optimal. despite having a higher damage modifier, the blasters damage reduction due to tracking is significantly more. what is worse, is that the blaster's penalty increases exponentally when the target gets closer."
4/27/2010,"you know regardless of how smart or accurate your analysis is or isn't, and i'm not prepared to pass judgment there, if you can't communicate it effectively, that speaks more to your failure than theirs. if you're going to be a leader, you have to take responsibility for communicating clearly. period.blaming your failure to communicate and thus convince is indicative of a lack of character and, sadly, typical of failed leaders. just have a look at politics in the real world. pick a candidate, any candidate, they're all equally culpable for this tactic.you're not getting my vote, sorry. i'd just as soon have my interests represented effectively, thanks."
4/27/2010,"either that or they shouldnt be in the csm if they dont understand how tracking works.maybe it is also your problem, even without axis labels it isnt exactly rocket science."
4/27/2010,"why have a presentation on tracking at all, then? why bother with the graph if the council is expected to have intimate understanding of every bloody game mechanic in eve? oh wait, they're not. it's up to the individual presenter to explain the issue and convince the council of what they're talking about, since the council members can't be expected to have their hands in every aspect of the game, particularly math-intensive mechanics like tracking or intertia/motion in eve. ideally, sure, they should know the issues, but expecting each of them to be able to recognize a graph on tracking (sans labels) and be able to immediately grasp both the gameplay and mathematical implications of what ankh was presenting? come on. that's why she's presenting the issue."
4/27/2010,"they dont need intimate understanding, which is why the issue is presented, but basic understanding of something like tracking is expected."
4/27/2010,"why are you blaming it all on me, if the csm was convinced that ""blasters/tracking is fine!"" before i even started and didn't listen to reasonable arguments?you'd say that the 1337 pvpers on the council at that time, such as pattern clarc , would have raised this issue well before i had, or contributed to the presentation (as often happens) if they felt my information was incomplete or i wasn't presenting well enough.when i get home i'll see if i can find those logs, so you can clearly see that i wasn't the one to blame.the funny thing is that it was mostly the self-proclaimed math genius lavista vista bashing the issue and proclaiming that blasters are fine."
4/27/2010,"there is not regardless here. stop being an idiot. analysis and numbers unfortunately is all that matters, and if that is right, ankhesentapemkah is right, sinc analysis is correct, ankhesentapemkah is correct period. is the analysis correct? yes. discussion over. csm candidate is not a debator or potititian, job of csm is not to argue the issues, but to recognize them. if the rest of csm cannot recognize blaster tracking as an issue, well, they don't deserve that free trip to iceland. qftcsm are expected to understand the most basic and vital game mecanics. tracking is the second most vital game mecanic in existance. no it is not anyone's responsibility to convince csm in anything, csm are there to think, and if they don't know something, then they need to read up on it. if they are incapable of doing that, again, they don't deserve to be there. this mechanic is not , it's basic tigonomitery, you learn it in year 7 in school. or am i again expecting too much of the people here, to complete school?i am very dissapointed this thread even appeared here. next time i am voting for csm candidates i am going to make sure they are at least remotely educated. same goes for everyone else that does not understand how trigonometry works. this is not quantum mechanics. if you don't know, don't post."
4/27/2010,"the meeting minutes are here and the raw chatlog is here(from 16:26 to 16:50). from rereading it, it seems like the knowledge of tracking/hit quality mechanics isn't great among csms(unsurprising, it's a complex, obscure, and somewhat silly mechanic), and people thought that your change was too fundamental a fix to too narrow a problem. personally, i object to your fix as well, because laying it on top of existing tracking mechanics will produce a rather bizarre effect whereby range from the target is mostly irrelevant, and what effect it does have will be strongly nonlinear. you'll also need to change all gun signature resolutions into radians instead of metres. when you put this into practice, however, you get a very odd result - very close targets(<1km) are virtually impossible to miss, and range is completely irrelevant to tracking for anything else. far from solving tracking, your proposal would essentially serve to remove any tactics built around it from the game. for the mathematically inclined, the target's effective tracking would be determined by the formula t=(transversal/r)*(sig res/r*arctan(sig rad/r)), where sig res is in radians, and sig rad, transversal, and r are in metres. for any range aside from the shortest, this simplifies to t=transversal*sig res/sig rad - radius does not appear. the current tracking formula is tohit=0.5^(((angular/tracking)*(sig res/sig rad))^2+(max(0, range-optimal)/falloff)^2), so ignoring the optimal/falloff bit and <1km ranges, and converting it to your proposed system, we get tohit=0.5^(((transversal*sig res)/(sig rad*tracking))^2). pick a battleship gun with 0.05 rad/sec tracking, give it a sig res of, say, 0.02 radians, and have it shoot an ab battleship going 400 m/s with a 400m sig. you to hit is thus simply equal to 0.5^(((400*0.02)/(400*0.05))^2) = 0.5(0.4^2) = 0.5^0.16 = 89.5% chance to hit. always. given that tracking, sig res, and sig rad are all fixed(ignoring mwd's), this basically means that nothing can be done to alter hit chances except getting outside the other guy's optimal or changing your transversal. stripped of the math, what your proposal would do is remove tactics from the game and make range nearly irrelevant to combat, other than the cutoff points for the optimal ranges of your modules. it would lead to a worse combat model, and it wouldn't actually solve the blaster problem unless the blaster pilot literally gets to within spitting distance of their target - even orbit 500 won't be close enough in many cases. so yes, i am opposed to your idea."
4/27/2010,"thanks herschel, but please note:"
4/27/2010,"okay, but think through what it is you're proposing. you're proposing a pretty major mechanical overhaul to tracking formulas, and then saying ""i have no idea whether it'll work as i've proposed it, but if it doesn't, ccp can just change the formula even more"". at some point, you sort of have to acknowledge that you've got a solution far too big for the problem. if i was building a tracking formula from scratch, as you apparently were with the game you were creating that inspired the original thread, then i'd make signature resolution based on the angle subtended by the target, not based on the simple linear measurement of radius that eve uses as an approximation. but there's also at least two other major changes i'd work into it at the same time(including the ship's rotation in tracking, to allow proper circle-strafing in an orbit, and breaking apart the effects of sig and the effects of tracking to more accurately represent how guns work). thing is, i'm not working from scratch, i'm working from a game with a third of a million existing players and a 7-year history. i'm not going to change things for the sake of changing them, and i'm not going to overhaul major game mechanics to solve a problem that can better be solved with a slight tweak to a few module stats. if blasters don't track well enough, boost their tracking, don't rip apart the entire tracking formula and replace it with either a triviality or an enigma depending on how ccp feels today."
4/27/2010,hi bellum
4/27/2010,"this, in a nutshell, is something an average player such as myself likes to hear. it shows acknowledgment of point of discussion and its validity while matching the business and product with one another to produce the best possible customer interaction.the above statement alone speaks volumes to your strengths, herschel. while it will take some time to process the advanced mathematics in my mind, i do tip my hat in support of your counter-arguments.well played, old friend.sincerely,""the bear"" jw"
4/27/2010,"this is terribly sad... and so typically eve.i ask the candidates to post on a thread discussing their goals... it gets ten responses.threads saying 'this guy/girl sucks, don't vote for him/her' gets almost 30 in a couple of hours. *ugh* hate rules eve with amazing strength."
4/27/2010,"you know i'm not running this time, right? the biggest reason for that? you look really stupid posting for a second time in a thread like yours. this one, it's easy to get into back-and-forth on."
4/27/2010,"herrshel, i have strong objections to the formula.i think we should not change the entire formula. i think instead we need to make a small and neat addition. here is how:tohit=0.5^((angular/(tracking*min,1 log base(arctan(sig rad/range) of tracking ))*(sig res/sig rad))^2+(max(0, range-optimal)/falloff)^2)this way, when two battleships are fighting at point blank: 400 sig radius, 400 speed, 4km range, within optimal, 0.05 tracking- electron blaster cannon.0.5^((0.1 / (0.05 * 1.299)) * (400 / 400)^2)= 19.3% chance to hit, as opposed to normal 6% chance. somewhat better i think. as i try to use logs, i operated with orders of magnitude here. maybe should square the logs, then we would get 37% chanse, that i find more reasonable.. still needs some thought for optimal formula."
4/27/2010,"if we're going to rip apart the formula, we can do all kinds of fun things. personally, i'd make it a three-parter instead of the current two-parter. to hit = (tracking mod) * (range mod) * (sig res mod). the range mod is fine as-is, the sig res mod should be a simple circular area comparison(so if your guns have a sig res of 0.1 rad, and the target only subtends 0.05 rad, you have pi*0.05^2/pi*0.1^2 = 0.25 to hit from sig res), and a sig-invariant tracking comparison, probably something of the form tohit = 0.5^((net angular/tracking)^3) or so, where net angular takes into account the rotation of the firing ship, instead of just being a simple comparison of motion vectors. you'd preserve most of the eve-ish combat mechanics - it's harder to hit smaller ships, there's a ""sweet spot"" where the effects of tracking balance off against the effects of range(in eve)/sig(in this version) to apply maximal dps, and you would actually give small ships a bonus, because having dominance in orbit would let you ""circle-strafe"" the target and not even have to worry about tracking at all, instead of the current rather silly situation where orbiting a target too fast means you out-track your own guns. heck, if you wanted to, you could even delete optimal, and rely on the sig resolution stat to prohibit long-ranged effective combat. if you wanted to get really crazy, you could even change the sig resolution stat to a circular error probable number, and implement things like friendly fire and cover. but of course, this isn't something that applies to eve. it's too fundamental a change, and as much as the theiorycrafting part of my brain loves this stuff, and as much as i think it might be fun as a mechanic set in some other game, it's not for eve. what ankh proposed cannot be slotted in neatly, and it'd take a meat cleaver to too many game mechanics if you tried to rebuild the game around it. it's fine for a new game, but not for the one we have."
4/27/2010,"the problem is that ankh stands against what makes eve such an amazing and unique mmo. she wants to change it from the cold, dark universe where you have to fight to survive to something more wow-ish. while she does have a few nice ideas, overall her vision of what eve should be runs contrary to what the player base and, more importantly, ccp wants in the game. she wants to fundamentally change eve in ways that would ruin it.i do think she is being given too much crap over the tracking thing, though."
4/27/2010,"mynxee dear, taking the words out of my mouth."
4/27/2010,remember vote for me! i am in csm public chat channel as well if you want to talk to me!
4/27/2010,"joining the chorus of ""but but but, it's complicated"", i'd say that of the items you list, the general ui overhaul is the most important one, because it lays the foundations for a lot of other improvements."
4/27/2010,low sec needs to be totally revamped.ore distribution and value needs to be totally rebalanced.corporation and alliance management needs a total redsign.eve has had the same level of key resources despite the huge increase in pilots in eve. moons are a perfect example of something that remains at the level they were when they were introduced as a key resource. as the player base grows the resources that support that base needs to be adjusted as well.those are just a few of the things that come to mind.issler
4/27/2010,"1) stop ccp pushing out unfinished expansions every 6 months. it is not acceptable that content is pushed out of the door feature-incomplete, and full of imbalances and bugs. they claim to have a team left behind to develop planetary interaction further, but we heard the same thing with factional warfare, not-so-epic-mission-arcs and wormhole content... and we recently had a rather underwhelming 0.0 expansion which isn't what we expected of it (where are the treaties?).2) total ui revamp, as in dumping the current thing and starting fresh. corp, industry and pos ui need a serious usability upgrade. this is because the ui affects all players, and everyone agrees that the current thing needs improvements. the more features are added to the game, the more work it is to revamp it.3) factional warfare, at least the major bugs and exploits (complex spawning mechanics, and all exploits related to capturing complexes, npc rebalance - even if just quickfixing it and replacing everything with the same generic stats). unfortunately, ccp waited too long fixing fw and it has pretty much died out, thus decreasing their interest in doing a full revamp of it."
4/27/2010,"bunyip - of the ones you listed, i would say corporation mechanics.anyone playing this game knows how much time is spent building up your personal hangers, and contributing to those hangers of your corporation and alliance as you grow together. there is something inherently wrong when an individual or small group of individuals can press a button or two and dissolve that group and either lock you and yours out of everything you have built up, or outright destroy all the work you and your mates have done. after all we have seen over the last year, with great alliances falling prey to a few individuals, this issue is critical.even on simpler matters, there are basic features (alliance hangers for example) that would be so useful, which people have been calling for on these forums for some time. while i am encouraged by the talk of new mechanics in this next patch that allows for alliance-standings to effect poss and stations, there is so much more that can be done.so, corporation mechanics comes very high on my list of priorities.i would say other concerns would also include the lag issue (that seems to never die), and a better balancing of space - particularly nullsec. but much more on those later.if you would like to talk about this in more depth, please convo me in game anytime!"
4/27/2010,"just as everyone else said picking just one is a bit hard. but that's what you asked for so i will skip the wall of text for each option. picking just one that is the most important to me off of that list i have to say ""general ui overhaul"". the old girl is getting a bit long in the tooth and has added few pounds. it's time for a face lift."
4/27/2010,"a change to the expansion delivery schedule needs to be worked out.summer 'expansion' - primarily focuses on major bug overhauls and finishing/fixing expansion content (such as cosmos, fw, ect). any content would be relatively minor and in line with the repair/completion of previous material. it would also deal with major changes to existing mechanics (as we saw with sov changes with dominion) such as re-done pos or corporation management tools.winter expansion - new content."
4/27/2010,"the game mechanics need to be tweaked so that it's possible for well-lead smaller gangs to take on larger, unwieldy blobs and have a good chance of doing some serious damage. in other words, medium to large engagements need to stop being ""alpha is primary... beta is primary... gamma is primary..."" that's boring, imho. most of the people in the blob are just meatpuppets doing what the fc tells them, and waiting to get blown up.what is needed is more chaos, more fog-of-war, more opportunities for individual initiative, epic wins, and epic fails.i am of the opinion (see my csm candidate thread) that this is also the way that lag gets beaten in the long-term."
4/27/2010,"i know this might not be the answer you want, but it isn't about precluding the large fleets - they have their place and time and some players enjoy that kind of play. it's about making the smaller scale activities more vital. one idea that comes immediately to mind is to expand the role and functionality of the black ops ships. currently the jump range of a black ops is less than that of a jump freighter or dread. and those ships capable of being bridged is somewhat limited (currently force recons, covops / sbs and blockade runners). we have seen sb fleets doing amazing things in battle (remember last year's alliance tourney?) and if the roles and abilities of the black ops ships are bolstered, you could imagine more of these types of engagements. other ideas could include limiting the mass that a gate is capable of handling over a period of time or number of ships. but - i would be very careful before implementing any possible fix as it could bring more problems than it solves. like any of the suggestions in this thread (including my own), any fix has to be carefully thought out, and deserves detailed examination and testing. one thing i am a strong believer in is making things better - not just different. like i would imagine any of the other candidates here might say, this issue has to be addressed, but lets hash it out in detail and run the numbers to see if any solution is a fix or just the precursor to another problem. as stated by rokkit kween and others here, power blocks arent going to go away. and probably shouldnt because they are what makes this game so interesting for so many. but small-fleet engagements are something that needs a little loving."
4/27/2010,"short of some anti-sandbox restrictions like class specific acceleration gates this is going to be the issue with any structure.with this ""don't give x something to do because x+1 will do it faster"" attitude you might as well increase the hp of all sov structures because it takes no time at all to drop them with a large supercap fleet but not everyone wants to / can fly capitals which means even with the current hp levels hours and hours of sitting still shooting a single structure...giving a small gang some sense of achievement or provoking a fight was the aim of the station services change. as the suggestion was for the majority of the hp to be in resists it wouldn't take hours to rep them back again either. it becomes a more short term situational thing, and if a group want to cyno in their caps to incap services every hour then that is their time to waste this discussion kinda leads on to ship class escalation (if x bs can do something then x capitals will be better). all some of the lag reduction ideas people are floating around to limit the number of viewable ships on grid will do is kill the game for smaller ship pilots because if you can only bring 100 ships to a fight you sure as hell are not going to bring 100 frigs when you could bring 100 bs and caps. well agony might"
4/27/2010,"quite frankly i can't believe this hasn't been brought up yet:put 0.0 local in delayed mode just like w-space. problem solved.one of the main reasons that you can't fight using smaller and/or split forces and need to group everyone in the largest possible blob is because of local providing exact intel on enemy numbers and location.with local the way it is now it's impossible to hide anything. with other games and/or real warfare it's possible to hide your forces and ambush the enemy. not so with eve in a general sense.the only options in eve to do the same are hot drops via. cap ships and blackops. neither of which are very effective when you're talking about engaging large fleets.if 0.0 were in delayed mode you could at least attack a target as a feint and distract the enemy and pull their forces from your primary target and then once you have them engaged attack your main target in the hope that they won't be able to respond effectively, thereby achieving a strategic victory.the whole point of using small fast groups is that they're small and fast, but that is worthless when it's easy to know exactly where they are and what they're doing.anyway, you want to see more use of smaller more specialized groups in large scale warfare? nerf local."
4/27/2010,i entirely agree with bellum eternus here. any csm candidates also agree with delayed local in 0.0?
4/27/2010,full w-space local will not be implemented in k-space 0.0 - ccp stated this at fanfest.there have been a number of proposals to remove local in 0.0 and i support the concept. however ccp won't do it without replacement intel tools (again at fanfest).a proposal containing replacement local intel tools is more likely to get past ccp and i would be happy to contribute to and support it.
4/27/2010,"make it an upgrade on the ihub to see instant local, just make it expensive and probably only obtainable at around level 4 or 5. that way the majority of less used systems would be far riskier, it would also encourage people to develop more systems and increase index levels.w-space's intel of using the directional scanner seems to work quite well, same concept is used for low-sec missioners to look for scan probes... irregardless i think delayed local in 0.0 is really the only option to bring back small gang warfare in any meaningful way. a csm candidate that thinks it should happen is what i was asking, if ccp would implement it without further intel mechanics is a different matter entirely. although i'd love to hear everyone's ideas on how to improve intel mechanics sufficient enough to remove local from 0.0, yet keep the element of surprise it would give small gangs intact."
4/27/2010,"i support delayed local idea, but only on one condition: ccp must introduce some other intel gathering mechanic in the game. not as cheesy as local is now, but something for people to rely upon. for example, local could exist in systems with strategic upgrades lvl4 or 5. it could also be configurable, so owner of the upgrade could set who sees local and who does not. or something like system wide scanner, which periodically(once a minute or two) tells the people who own sovereignty, which ships are present in the system. because otherwise nobody would rat or mine in nullsec. nobody. it would become as barren as lowsec is now. fighting just for the sake of your own spot on the influence is not very motivating. empire should bring profit for people who fought for it.but i'll stop now, because i'm now repeating almost the same words, which devs told us, when people were asking them for delayed local for 0.0 after introduction of wormholes."
4/27/2010,"well i don't entirely agree _noone_ would use unsecured (no local) space, people do use wormholes afterall. i do think your ideas do show promises. i like the idea of a ihub upgrade for level 4 as a minimum (should be level 4 industry/military, not the just level 4 cause we've had sov ___ number of weeks) for an instant overview of who is in system. i'm ""ok"" with a pos module that will pulse every minute or better two, who is in local, a minute or two is plenty of time for a gang to move through system undetected, but i don't think this would be useful for intel because of that, it's not much better and in most instances would be no better then not having it cause a minute is plenty of time to have hostile enter system and find a ratter in a belt. but this combined with constant vigilance using the directional scanner...another idea is although not specific intel of who entered system, a counter of how many people are in system combined with some of the ideas above might work out just fine."
4/27/2010,"the directional scanner will do nothing to help you with recons unless you manage to click scan at just the right time. and while it's not a defence or counter per se wh space has dynamic and limited access. it is always the same road null sec. as a csm candidate i'm not opposed to delayed local for 0.0, but there would have to be some better why of gaining intel than we have now. also having local on immediate doesn't mean an automatic loss of ratter ganking. there is always that guy not paying attention, so you can go pick the low hanging fruit."
4/27/2010,"this is one suggestion that has been mooted a few times. it doesn't work in npc 0.0 of course. the debate there is should npc 0.0 be more risky than sov 0.0 considering that it has worse rewards? the concern here is not turning all kinds of activity into spam directional scanner every 2 seconds. we've already seen what happened with unchecked dscan spamming which is why we have the limit now...being aware of what has already been suggested and rejected (either via csm or via fanfest roundtables) means future suggestions can be designed in a way more likely to be implemented.like it or not the csm's power ends at ccp's table. csm cannot force ccp to commit to anything (though they can request a reason). bringing up the same issues which have been rejected again and again without significant changes doesn't do us any good (see pos dead horse and removal of insurance from suicide ganking for examples of proposals consistently rejected by ccp)as i said, i am in favour of changing local. to be more specific i would like to remove the ""free"" intel in 0.0 space. why should somebody already in system when i jump in see my name, corp, sec status and other such things in a chat window before i've even come out of blackscreen? especially as they don't have to do anything for that intel (i don't appear on directional etc)i did suggest a compromise of removing char portraits from local chat unless somebody talks but leaving the count of people in local (possibly delayed at least 30-60 seconds). people were not receptive to the idea the concern is that whilst delayed local will solve the issue of sneaking up on people, it creates a new one. how does a roaming gang know which systems to spend time scanning for targets? this is why i pitched delayed local count...ideas discussed at fanfest included being able to hack gates to get a list of shiptypes who passed through recently, deployable beacons, proximity alarms, infrastructure upgrades and so on.whatever solution is eventually picked needs to be carefully designed, i don't want some half-arsed ""solution"" which causes more issues than it solves."
4/27/2010,"and to address the op. in a pvp centric game like eve people will always want to win, and the best way to do that is have 2:1 advantage. until there is a meaningful reason to bring less numbers to a fight you just can't get away from the blob. ""i can do twice as much with twice as many twice as fast"". if there were an objective for small gangs that only small gangs(not a small gang with 300 bs camping a bubble on the gate) could accomplish that might help to lessen the blob"
4/27/2010,"i really wouldn't have an issue with npc 0.0 working the same way, instant local. call it the advanced sov the pirate faction has that allows this, just like in empire. npc 0.0 regions make up the minority of 0.0 regions. as for player controlled regions, the ihub upgrade has it's attractiveness of incentivising alliances to get military/industry indexes up and develop more space. if you take out the npc space from consideration like above, does the ihub idea have more merit?and ihubs are pretty darn new, has ccp categorically rejected the idea of intel this way already?"
4/27/2010,"that's always going to be the case with anything. if someone wants to form up a 200 man fleet with the intent of doing something that can, quite easily, be done with 10 men then so be it then more fool him."
4/27/2010,"it hasn't been officially raised but it was certainly one of the ideas discussed at fanfest 2009 before dominion was released.the most likely proposal to gain traction would be a number of ideas for 0.0 local intel replacement and let ccp pick the one(s) that would be simplest to implement. i had planned to raise something along these lines but time conspired against me.here's another idea which could be added into that list, small groups of people (say up to 5) can enter system and stay out of the local count for longer than larger blobs. this gives an advantage to your skirmishers while ""punishing"" people who just throw a blob into system"
4/27/2010,"i was surprised when i saw this suggestion recently. i kinda like it. the only issue i have is that it should be an on/off ability. once it is active it is active for everyone in system. the reasoning is 2 fold.1) everyone will know local anyway since there will be good old meta gaming alt spies on hand to tell your fc's what local is at anyway.2) it forces an alliance to make a choice. better defense, the enemy has no idea how many pilots you have in system or better offense and your alliance knows how many hostiles are in system.the down side is that no one would venture out of these upgraded systems since spamming the d-scanner very 2 seconds is annoying as hell, more so in pos filled systems.npc 0.0 should retain local as is. since players can not gain sov they would not be able to upgrade the system to have local function as it does now. this also provides an advantage to what npc 0.0 is about, learning to live in 0.0. then someday expand into sov space. no reason to make npc 0.0 the ""low sec"" of 0.0. lowest isk potential and highest risk. all that said, until ccp comes up with alternative intel tools things will stay the way they are."
4/27/2010,"i agree with that so much. i think the roaming gang should be able to attack system upgrades, and damage them, or if damaged enough, destroy them. there, ovcource, have to be some defences so 1 sb cannot just sit there all day bombing someone's mining upgrades (although if soem idiots don';t give a crap, they deserve it) but you would need like a gang of hac's with one logi ship or 8+ bc's or something, a medium sized gang should be able to do it. with pi we could introduce spaceports and other destructable orbital structures."
4/27/2010,"i don't know about blowing up upgrades, but disabling them would be nice. maybe not just remote repair them to get them going again, but also requiring some goods if they are 'incapped' or something. maybe some npc goods from upcoming pi. also i do not think any changes should be so far to benifit the attackers that being a defender sucks balls.maybe upgrades to the system have to be anchored at a planet and the sov holder decides what kind of grid wide affect it has on anyone that warps to it. i.e. - agilty is reduced, or local rep is reduced, or remote rep is reduced. all kinds of say scripts that could be anchored to it so the defenders can defend it in a way that might give them the advantage.what do you all think? i am starting to just think out loud and that gets me flammed a lot so please think out loud with me so we all can be burned."
4/27/2010,"irl i have been lucky enough to run three smaller companies. those experiences have taught me that even if you are sitting across the table from someone with a radically different view or goal from your own, there are ways to reach common grounds and get things done.in game, like you, we have many friends who have moved on to other alliances, including some who may be red to us now. doesnt necessarily make them less of friends. just means you get to shoot at them once in a while and then laugh about it later.though i did joke about a couple of groups above, and believe a little levity is a good thing from time to time, i am not kidding when i say that csm can and does make a difference in the game we all spend so much of our free time playing. and you deserve someone who will work to make it better for all of us.the idea in question was an idea we were thinking of to add to the benefits of sov ownership / high standing with the local npc.there is already a defensive bonus to holing sov in 0.0 (the added defenses of the system in the ihub timers) and in having a good standing with the local npc in empire (keeps those with bad standing to the npc or concord from entering your system unchecked  if at all).but there is not presently a tangible offensive bonus to holding sov or having those high standings. giving the pilot the chance to jump through a gate to give chase to a fleeing non-aggressed, non-sov holding fleet or to jump through a friendly gate to avoid a hostile camp . . . could be worth considering. and remember that while it hurts the roaming gang while in hostile territory, it helps the roaming gang in its own backyard . . . so balanced by design.more crucial: that was an idea that was being kicked about. the central point to my post and candidacy is that i am more concerned about fixing what is already out there. ccp certainly has a world of new features it wants to put in game. i am most worried about fixing what is in game and what is yet to come.will do.i completely agree that living in 0.0 is a test of will and strength. and that, like rl, there are benefits that come from being strong and surviving.but, unlike rl, this game provides a few non-exhaustible resources that, once secured, allow for reserves to be built that ensure continuance. look at the historic bob / goon conflict. for so long a stalemate or proxy war. only when both groups were taken by other tactics then combat did they each fall. if you employ the exhaustible nature of resources here, then i agree with you that it is for the smaller alliances to grow or die in 0.0 lands. but if you create a never-ending supply of localized top-end resources, then you have to create some footing for the other alliances to build on."
4/27/2010,"you dont have to look far for things that need fixing.from recent exploit where someone can avoid appearing in local until they choose to attack, to grid-fu, to wardec uses of neutrals, continued ui problems (including the lack of a more customizable multi-monitor environment) to upcoming adjustments to insurance that do seem to address t2 insurance, but leave alone insurance to high-sec gankers and squash supercap insurance (what was it? 10% of mineral cost for a titan) . . . there is a lot to cover.thank you sirs for your questions. hopefully i have answered them, but if not, please feel free to convo me in game and we can talk more about them all."
4/27/2010,"it didn't quite seem like a joke... this statement makes me think you have no understanding of pvp combat, roaming or balance. this idea is utter fail.so how is breaking pvp combat and greatly favoring the 0.0 isk farming carebear alliances (like irc) fixing an existing mechanic? your so far proposed fixes makes worried should you actually get enough votes to secure a seat on the csm.so you ment that you think all 0.0 regions should be about equal in terms of resources. i.e. get rid of truesec and make everything -1.0 or something along those lines? that's probably the single worst idea i've heard in a long time. suggesting it shows your lack of understanding of balance and how the game is designed."
4/27/2010,"wow. guessing i can count on your vote.but to be clear: so - not at all. just enough to get a footing. not enough to become the next powerblock. that has to be done, like everything else, through risk aka expansion to areas with greater resources.thanks again xena and again please feel free to convo me ingame."
4/27/2010,"i don't agree, i think there should be more very poor 0.0 areas and less high value 0.0. this would create a more dynamic 0.0 environment, make war more likely, plus more low-end 0.0 gives the noob alliances more places to get established. and i _completely_ disagree with your assertion that the poor regions in 0.0 are not profitable. look at providence, hands down the poorest region in the game when it comes to true sec. but look at how many stations and wealth those alliances was able to produce when unmolested by bigger power blocks. look at how stupidly rich your own ceo can get completely raping his member's off of simi-decent 0.0 space. i think your argument is very flawed on profitability. low end 0.0 is less fought over, because any real power block will go after high end. it's also vastly more profitable then most empire activities, and can attract a lot of carebears to farm it.your idea is to soften the edges between poor 0.0 and rich 0.0, so the poor more profitable and closer to the rich 0.0? this is definitely the wrong approach for 0.0 imho."
4/27/2010,"that would work as well. sadly, the repercussions of stripping many of the better areas of their higher-end moons and (soon) planets, and reducing their chances for officer spawns and 10/10 plexes . . . . not sure it is viable. pandora's box kind of thing.as far as the rest of it goes . . . convo me in-game please."
4/27/2010,"why wouldn't it be possible, it's been done before. also entirely possible add additional 0.0 regions that are heavy on the poor space kind.i also don't tend to think decent moons count, since a crap alliance likely would be renting or unable to defend them therefore would not be in control of them anyway. high end moons are controlled by powerful alliances or very high paying renters. weak alliances get pushed aside and them taken away from them. the crux is, true security status of systems. more regions like providence would open up more 0.0 to more care bears and more weak alliances able to get a foot in the door. this ultimately would be a win-win for 0.0 and the game imho. but your idea seems to be to buff all the weak regions... leveling the playing field... this would have the opposite effect, less 0.0 competition, less alliances entering 0.0 and more power blocks."
4/27/2010,you already got plenty advantages of holding sov. (cyno jammer/jump bridges)gate/station guns or changed aggression mechanics are over the top imho.
4/27/2010,"so, we have this:some candidates are pretty clear on their profession, but the general statements are 'fix lag, fix ui, fix bugs'. so $type_of_person might as well be 'any eve player' if you're all elected. is the game that broken? and how would you be able to approach ccp with any kind of decent proposal (i.e. the sales pitch)?there's nothing wrong with appealing to a wide player base (as much votes as possible is generally a good strategy), but i'd personally like to know if you have any decent ideas about actually pushing the csm to the next level. as a challenge, fill that quote in with something unusual.edit: oh yeah, thanks to virtuozzo for that quote."
4/27/2010,"going into the top priorities:reworking the ui from font to functionality - 15 intel windows and not being able to tell the ""4kon"" system from ""4k0n"" system is maddening reevaluating the piracy mechanics - pirates should exist, but shouldn't get full insurance for ganking . . . just enough to buy more parrot food fixing once and for all lag - it can happen in our lifetime closing the many exploits that ruin the game for so many reinvigorate small-fleet combat as a useful alternative or compliment to large-fleet combat as stated by corbeau lenoir, do something about the mind-numbing pos mechanics - particularly the anchoring / unanchoring tools rebalancing the dronelands - everyone else gets drone spawns, let the drones get faction spawns and escallations once in a while! as best possible, making sure that a new release is a tested, solid, balanced release - fewer patch +1 day ""fixes"" those are the ones that come to mind after being awake too long. i'm sure i'll kick myself later for forgetting important things."
4/27/2010,"back to top.keep chiming in, candidates... let us know who we should look more closely at.thus far, in the few that have bothered to post, only one has removed themselves entirely from my consideration."
4/27/2010,"core issues:* stop the expansion rush, finish expansions properly before working on the next one* improving usability by redoing the ui (corp, industrial, and pos in particular), dealing with the session timer, and taking more action against lag* improve communication between ccp and the csm, ccp and the players, and csm and the players. expand on my take care platform to maintain direct democracy where players retain their voice after they cast their votewho i represent:* independent players* small corporations* non-powerblock alliances* fw players* anyone with a good idea that wants a voice"
4/27/2010,"there is a platform missing from that list, and so i will add it.i wish to improve the csm process so that more people have their proposals raised, ideas heard and get timely feedback from csm and ccp. this was a core aim when i ran for csm4 and i feel i made good progress, but work needs to continue.communication is key, not just to those players who frequent these forums. csm need tools in ""spacebook"" to allow players to raise issues and follow their progress both in and out of game. these tools need defined categories for issues, a working search facility and linking of duplicate proposals.ultimately the csm is not my platform to tell you how i think the game should be changed. it is a place where any user can raise issues and for as many proposals as possible to be debated amongst a representative sample of players from different playstyles.during the csm4 elections people believed in my commitment and i hope i've repaid that during this term. i promise that if voted in to csm5 i will continue work on improvements to the process and raising player issues."
4/27/2010,"* ccp should devote an expansion cycle to revamping the user interface.and a second for herschel's ""ccp needs to change game mechanics so that blobbing is no longer effective"", ""players should be able to see who is outside their station before they undock,"" and ""ccp should spend less time developing new features and more time fixing bugs and old, broken game mechanics.""it is, after all, rather stupid that we have these huge starships and yet can't walk to a window and look outside the station! kinda breaks the old ""suspension of disbelief"" if you know what i mean."
4/27/2010,a note - i don't mean to imply a position on any of those issues. i just think they're interesting questions to ask.
4/27/2010,the csm doesn't have the power to dictate what ccp should do for a full expansion so this is a fairly redundant question.i would caution against adding questions about lag or blobbing because in the first instance nobody is going to disagree and in the second it is too wide a topic to boil down to a agree / disagree type answer. define blob for example - we get accused of blobbing when we have a fleet of 6 pilots
4/27/2010,"some more suggestions!* low sec npc-enabled content should incorporate pvp. * fleets of a certain size or composition should be subject to ""stacking penalties""* the range at which a ship lands from the gate after jumping through should be doubled in low sec."
4/28/2010,i hope to see the csm drilling this into ccp for as long as it takes :)
4/28/2010,it has been raised and passed how many times now?csm4i'm under the impression it was passed by previous csms but i could be wrong.
4/28/2010,"supported: this is a huge issue, still. as you noted, past csms have been ineffective in sounding this into ccp's ears, so you need a new voice to push this forward. a complete overhaul would be nice, sure, but even just tightening and honing the current system would be light years improvement - as mentioned ""stitch together what's already there."" if you value putting this first before new big features, vote cinori aluben csm5. my priority is that ccp make these seemingly ""little things"" a priority.cinori aluben csm5 2010fix the little things first!www.littlethingsfirst.com"
4/28/2010,1
4/28/2010,"this is so small, but so important! i can't tell you how many people i've talked to think this is so ridiculous, and that nothing has been done about it for so long.this is actually one on my primary agenda as a csm this term, along with ability to further increase eve font size:"
4/28/2010,"and trimarks? and pds? and a bunch of other modules that add a fixed percentage increase? sure, adding another plate would add less ehp (as a percentage) than the previous plate... unless you have a full set of trimarks.time is the constraint of for defense. damage is the constraint for offense. this is fleet warfare. defense is made up of having the enemy shoot ships that don't explode because they warp out, get repped, warp back in. offense is having enough firepower to pop the ships before they can react. therefore, reaction time is a pilots greatest defense in a fleet and raw damage is their greatest offense.i would say ""as opposed to your alliance leaders..."" but you're still in the training corp. you haven't gotten into pl yet. i'm looking at the kind of ships sniggwaffe and pl fly and seeing a remarkable thing. a massive lack of rokh, which are apparently the best sniper ship, since pl is famous for sniper fleets, i guess you are implying the . also, congrats to pl on the titan kill.again showing your lack of experience with current fleet fights. it isn't the system, it is the grid. all you have to do (while your fleet assembles) is continuously change grids, forcing them to load a full grid (it takes several seconds to minutes) every time they try to attack you, slowing them down and allowing you to pick a few off before warping off (while they are still loading the grid)."
4/28/2010,"i would still change ammo atrib so at longer ranges rails get better dmg but at shorter less. and the short range ammo could give better tracking. + the all needed boosts more pg for both caldari/gallente, longer rof+less cap/ammo use. fix rails tiering. these would make it balanced imho."
4/28/2010,"what the hell naomi, i thought you were all about boosting **** that was broken... not hitting it in the nuts with a chainsaw? -liang"
4/28/2010,"what? it would be a fix, maybe you missed my post where i said i disagreed with plain dmg boost.i dunno how this would be a hit in the nuts with a chainsaw. it would give rail ships a clear advantage at very long range ,and a huge disadvantage at short range,+ other fixes you forgot to quote --> balancedoh and yes rails are broken everybody knows this ,but some dont want to acknowledge it."
4/28/2010,my blaster rokh/mega/hype/domi says **** you for the damage reduction. -liang
4/28/2010,"not because blasters dmg multipliers would be increased to fix blasers too.that way antimatter would have better tracking and/or dmg than now, and longer ranged ammos would be useable because less dmg loss would occur."
4/28/2010,"well to be clear, blasters don't need more tracking as badly as they need raw dps. i will react violently to anything which threatens blaster damage... rails at this point are academic to my lifestyle. aww **** it so are blasters - that's what god invented pulse lasers for!-liang"
4/28/2010,"but i wrote it would increase tracking and/or dps for blasters, if they dont need more tracking fine ,but then they need better dps at least, or the ships should be changed, btw i'm in favour for dps increase opposed to tracking. blasters should hurt much more at close range than pulses at short , that would be balanced not like today,even hybrid bonused ships using autos/pulses that is sad.especially as blasters lost their dps advantage :("
4/28/2010,"the tracking they need is where a tracking boost will not help. that sub-1000m range where you can't hit the broadside of a barn. blasters really do need more damage though. if you can get 3x the range with almost the same damage with lasers, why use blasters?like the railguns, they lack a niche, just penalties."
4/28/2010,"if you have a full set of trimarks then the first plate still adds more ehp in percentage terms than the second.they're all still stacking penalized. the question is whether or not the full tank maximizes ehp/dps... and the answer is largely no. the reason that you don't see full tank fits is that the % increases for fitting more tank modules still does get under the % increases in dps. if time is the constraint of defense then it is also the constraint for offense. there can be no other way when its volley damage that acts upon ehp to kill ships. if your fleets volley is so high that the enemy ships (or your ships) are constrained in the time it takes them to die by how fast they're locked then the dps of your fleet or the enemy fleet or the volley of either does not matter, only how fast they lock.not really, no. lr hacs maybe, but not sniper fleets. but if you want to talk about what they suggest on their internal forums go right ahead. i could hint, but it isn't my purview to disclose.its always been both. i mean this is where ""grid load point"" came into use. system simply is worse than grid. but the same logic applies. if you want to win, then you go to the point of contention and sit there waiting for the enemy to warp in. when they do, you destroy them.for when you don't need 3x the range and want to do things other than dealing damage.and also, that evaluation is incorrect."
4/28/2010,"supported. keilas, i've also discussed this with others in game as a requested item. ours was a slight tweak on yours, and they are actually both complementary. ours not only asks for ability to remove portraits from population list, and resize accordingly, but also for somewhat the opposite: to be able to resize a chat window such that only the portraits are showing, for the purpose of monitoring portraits in local for reds or war targets. you can have that full-screen high local list, without having it take up so much horizontal space.having ability to choose either chat-only or portrait-only makes the chat window more refined and efficient for your specific use, while freeing up that ever-so valuable screen real estate.these types of little things are exactly what my campaign for csm5 is all about, to ""fix the little things first!"" hone, tighten, improve, polish... make more efficient the current gameplay as it is, before implementing more huge features that can only continue to complicate the gameplay. even just 5 little things like this combine to create a synergy that vastly improves your daily eve experience. if you value giving priority to little fixes like this, vote for cinori aluben. my priority is that ccp make these ""little things"" a priority. as such small items wouldn't require heavy coding time, devoting dev time to them is solely a matter of prioritization, which the csm will have an active part in now.cinori aluben csm5 2010fix the little things first!www.littlethingsfirst.com"

4/28/2010,lovely idea.
4/28/2010,supported.
4/28/2010,the possibilities for fleet tactical warping around a given grid alone are enough for me to support this.

4/28/2010,"i've seen this idea a couple of times before. i like the idea, i think it will create an increase in traffic to low sec which we pirates will love. however, as a compromise i think that a slightly different solution would be more optimal and fairer:do separate the empires with surrounding low sec areas. (either just between the amarr & caldari vs gallente & minimatar, or between all four.) however there should be a high number of routes between them. no pipeline systems. lots of 3-5 gate systems, and have it say 2-5 jumps through low sec to reach the other empire side. in addition to this, a long, safe way round, going through some 0.5 and 0.6 systems (perhaps faction controlled like ore?) which take say 20+ jumps to navigate. the shortest routes will obviously be more pirate infested and riskier, with slightly longer routes being less populated, and with the very long way round for the real carebears. gangs of pirates are likely to fight over control of these premium pirating systems which should not allow capital ships to be cyno'd in.(make these 0.3 & 0.4 sec systems, and others further away from the boundaries 0.1 & 0.2 which do allow capital ships.)this will allow organised pilots and gangs to escort a short-medium route through low sec with reasonably low risk, still cater for carebears and safety at a time cost, and allow smugglers with blockade runners to smuggle quickly through making profit as they can deliver goods quicker than those being safe.tl;dr: provide a very long safe route between empires, with several shortcuts through low sec. just another pirate's 0.02 isk..."

4/28/2010,could someone post a good example of the un-probable fit?
4/28/2010,"if op would try to fit such a ship first, before starting new topic, he would know that it's impossible to make unscanable ship without gimping your dps/tank. i think it's working as intended, even if it's quite annoying."
4/28/2010,"true if you choose to only consider the solo ship, once 2 or more are involved with remote modules and gang-links are put in play that picture changes drastically.even t1 bs can be given such a high sensor/signature ratio using ""just"" 4 mid slots + implants as to make probing virtually impossible to all but the three or four uber-hardcore probers who have a perfect understanding of probe placement, mechanics and flying tricked out coverts.the ships that can do it on their own is limited to recons, t3, coverts and the like so not a big issue. but i can see why people perceive it as a problem when a bs gang/fleet is able to hide in plain sight using this mechanic.cloaks which were used previously to acheive the same effect kills targetting and leaves the user open to midflight probing and even actual safe-spot probing if timed right.banning or declaring an exploit is overkill at his point though, but a discussion on whether it should be doable and/or if the ""penalty"" associated with it is equal to that incurred by using a cloak in in order."
4/28/2010,"i have an unprobable jaguar, but yes, it is only for light lowsec missioning."
4/28/2010,"well, alot of sites i do escalate in several steps right into hostile space. in particular those escalations sometimes end up in hostile station systems. before dominion i always had to ask around in my corp and we hat to run a bigger gang with logis, scouts, pvp ships to get this stuff done. if it was in a hostiles station system, we even had to wait for a better timezone and did this stuff during night to get the escaltion done. this was alot of efford.now ccp gave us the possibility to do stuff like this the easy way. i just grab my tengu and do this when i want to do it. in general i also do sites in hostile stn systems, but theres always the danger to get cought at the gate. so you need at least a noobshipscout. if youre once in - youre safe and can do your stuff without danger. i like this, its easymode and you dont have to share the outcome. there are quite some viable pve-fits for unprobable t3s. if yure pr0 you can also dualbox and use one t3 for scouting/ganglinks/salvaging/looting...this leaves even more fitting possibilities for your pve t3. i like to use it and i dont think its a bug nor a exploit. i can also understand this is the 0.0 and low sec missionrunners wet dream .) especially in lowsec theres no way to get you, since you cant bubble stn...as some fits for bs were asked: to make a nightmare hard to probe you need 2 lowslots (2xradar backup array ii and 3 meds 3xeccm radar ii). this leaves you 3 lowslots , 4 medslots, 3 rigslots and all highslots to fit it what you want. more than enough to fit for snipe/dps. your sig will be 340 and your sensor strenght 375. thats it. ofc such ships are used in a gang and so probably you want to use gangboni, this leaves even more fitting possibilities. you can also use xtinct booster for combat siuations to make it even better. common fit ist for sniping. ofc you dont need a tank you just warp in at a random spot and start to kill. if your whole gang is not probable there is nearly no danger tacklers can land on you. so just snipe your stuff and kill all tards which approach your snipergroup...then warp out. its the perfect tool to gank stuff at zero risk. there also nice fits for machs und probably there also some viable fits for t1 bs. ofc this makes no sense for solofits since youll lack tackle...if you tackle in a bs you are close to the enemy, which makes this whole issue unneccasary. so unprobable fits will always be long range fits.....well and dont use mwds..."

4/28/2010,"nice list of ideas. gallente are the weakest by far and really need a buff. maybe not this dramatic, but a buff for sure (especially medium rails)."
4/28/2010,"noooot supported... while a few of the ideas are ok-ish, most are crap. take the launchers off the lach? are you insane? nice job there reducing the total peak dps of that ship. other changes are of a similar fashion. why bother with falloff bonuses for blaster ships when blaster pilots don't give a crap if their blasters have 2km more falloff. upping the effective range from 4km to a whole 6km isn't going to make blaster pilots happy. making blasters do huge damage and hit anything inside their limited range will.more fail: ab bonus for astarte? really? because a bonused ab running my ship up to a giant 500m/sec is a good idea? ******ed. blaster ships need to be able to do one thing: sprint into range and then hammer the crap out of something. with an ab fit, unless somehow you deem it ok for them to produce mwd level speeds, the blaster ship is dead before it can do anything.anyway, c for effort but f for execution. gallente needs to be helped out quite a bit, but the large majority of these ideas are poorly thought out."
4/28/2010,"i've flown gallente ever since i've started and i really tried, i really really really really tried to make the best of the race, but i've been met with nothing but disappointment. 1. gallente blaster ships are too slow.2. drones seem to do less damage than indicated on paper. popped very easily and issues with ai. gallente only has a few specialize drone boats to begin with, the rest are blaster ships. other races can field impressive drones as well.3. too much cap usage- mwd + mwd cap reduction + active tanking + stasis web + cap using hybrids.4. hybrids are too weak and have lost their truly redeeming features. massive falloff projectiles thanks to dominion with tracking enhancer boost. - no more range advantage for railguns. pulse lasers do 80-90% of blaster dps with 3 times the range. 5. powergrid issues on ships like deimos, brutix, astarte, and hyperion. you can only fit wimpy electron blasters to have decent armor tank. minmatar and amarr ships mostly do not have that problem, they have plenty of pg to spare after fitting their highest tier of short range guns.6. stupid gallente storyline missions, wtf 15 jumps into low sec doing a mission harder than most level 4's for a 100k isk and a crap implant?7. most gallente lp items along with minmatar have no truly redeeming features. i don't fly gallente anymore i fly amarr and minmatar. the federation has lost its appeal to me."
4/28/2010,"are you willing to take a 100mil+ isk hac or command ship right up next to an enemy knowing full well they will primary you first, neut you til you can't even use a damage control unit, and then rip you to pieces as your tank is worthless without cap?i'm sorry, but i can't burn through isk like that. if it's a t1 thorax or a brutix, fine... those are expendable due to nice insurance returns. but when flying such an expensive ship i want there to be at least a chance that i'll come back in one piece. otherwise there is no point in bringing it out in the first place."

4/28/2010,"yeah, that's right. i said it.it works in w-space, it'll work in 0.0 just fine. i hear htfu all the time from everyone else about every other issue in eve. it's time the 0.0/lowsec peeps put their isk where their mouths are and htfu themselves.the advent of our little pl friends and their effective if exploitive local work around to kill russian macro ratters and isk sellers clearly demonstrates how a little lack of local intel can rectify some glaring game play issues.i think that putting local into delayed mode will also help with 0.0 fleet battles and increase the relevance and importance of skilled scouts. additionally, reduced local intel will allow smaller guerilla groups to effectively harass and fight larger fleets as they'll be able to hide from larger forces while they attempt to distract and evade the main fighting forces of their enemy.the advantages of this change are numerous, the drawbacks few. most will argue that it's 'impossible' to deal with the lack of local and 'spamming my scanner' all the time is horrible. to this end i point these detractors to w-space where *competent* pilots thrive in a very hostile and competitive environment. it's clear that anyone who would be against the change to delayed mode for 0.0/lowsec is simply too lazy, too incompetent or just plain soft in the head to survive in such and environment, in which case they don't deserve to fly in 0.0/lowsec anyway.once people adapt you'll find that fleet fights still happen, small gang pvp will thrive and those who operate with teamwork will be dramatically more effective than those without.let the whines of ""omg, it's too hard"" begin..."

4/28/2010,as i understand it:mashing directional for intel has 2 results and one conclusion1. strain on the server because of the way directional scaner is coded2. strain on your hands and mouse-> ccp does not want that kind of gameplayccp does not want to remove local before a beter intel tool than directional is invented and implemented... this is my understanding of the whole problem... wich has also been posted a lot of times beforei do support the whole idea (again) but solutions to problems 1 and 2 need to be found
4/28/2010,"i don't support this. in its current incarnation eve isnt reaady for it.it works in wormholes since there are limited and hard to find entries and exits. with a proposal like this with eve in its current form it would just be local full of cloaky ***gots screaming ""boom headshot!!!"" every time someone enters local because the game offers no intel tools other than a half baked directional scanner.edit: where the heck is the thumb down!?"

4/28/2010,"zarch, i am on the same page re the scrams. when i read the summary from the most recent csm summit and saw this idea on there, for scrams to prevent dock, first thought that went through my head was ""wow that is a bad idea. what are these guys thinking?"" overview visibility while docked is pretty good, but not the scrams preventing dock. talking to corpmates and they all agree it's horrible.docking games are indeed a bit silly, though as you've said, there's no serious problem with them besides caps. heck the idea of making all station meshes the same size is pretty quite and easy too. if they are going to move forward with anything close to the scram idea, however, i think your first suggestion is a good step in the right direction (second is a bit too intensive a change for my taste - tho it's good) [though the time per effect may be reduced to 4sec or 3]. i like your justification of ""docking request accepted, attempting to get docking beam lock"".the implications are basic and just:1) big blog outside of station, and you undock even though you see this on the overview in the station (or you're a putz and don't check the overview), you get 10 points, 10 scrams on you immediately, 20x3s = +60s to dock, you're dead tbh.2) only 1 guy outside of station, you warp to the station, he insta-locks you w/ resolution scripts or links, point&webs, it now takes you +6s to dock. if you're in a glass ship, & they a gunboat, you're dead; if not, you'll be fine.-everything in between.-i think capsules should be immune to the effects tho, unless justification can be made otherwise, i could be swayed.agree with this completely as well. even if ccp proposed this, still the csm supported it?? seriously? guys, please do not revote old members of csm who have contributed to well-known ineffectiveness!cinori aluben csm5 2010fix the little things first!www.littlethingsfirst.com"
4/28/2010,"i think your ability to dock ought to be directly tied to whether or not you aggressed. if you shoot, you can't dock until the conflict is resolved; makes sense from a story point of view as well as an in-game solution to the problem. more specifics on my (shameless plug) blog."
4/28/2010,"this is an awful idea. truly awful. if you undock into an enemy you have no chance to get away. you can't warp away, can't dock, so station camping will only increase - and nobody would ever even try to undock to get away because it would be a death trap.besides, last i checked, a warp scrambler stopped a ship from warping, not moving normally. so not only is this terrible from a gameplay perspective, but it is also terrible from an in-game rp perspective.i'm not convinced that docking games are a problem at all, to be honest. i have heard people whine that ""waahhh, when someone undocks we can't kill him in time, waahhh, no risk for him!"" yeah, well, what risk is there for the people camping a station with 20:1 odds?if anything, catching people at stations should be more difficult, not less."
4/28/2010,supported. i brought up this idea about two years ago and got flamed to hell for it. hopefully people will be more open minded this time around.

4/28/2010,"i agree that it is difficult to identify which player is a person's ""main"" - especially in a game where most people have more than one account, as well as multiple characters on each account.if you force the post to be made from the character with the highest sp on an account, they can easily login with a different account. if you force the post to be made with the character who is online the most in the game, that can be manipulated. if you require players to be in corps with at least 10 players, that will be sidestepped (see caod). the desire for anonymity is high enough that people will go to great lengths to circumvent whatever requirement is put in place."
4/28/2010,this is my main.

4/28/2010,"this seems like it'd be prone to serious problems with weird exploits of the system. in order for it to be even approximately balanced, it'd have to cost as much as an alliance wardec, and the war target should have the option to expand the war to include everyone in the alliance free of cost. and even then, i don't think i'd approve. it'd be too much programming time for too little payoff."

4/28/2010,i think this middle ship is a good idea. it's unrealistic that the eve market wouldn't fill this gap. i don't think there should be required industry skills to fly one though. i think the skills should be related to - well flying ships. the orca seems to indeed be a mining boat. look at the bonuses. 6 of the 7 bonuses are useless for simple hauling.

4/28/2010,you need to learn the difference between a troll and some one just busting your balls.problem with this thread and threads like this is that most would not know what a troll thread/post was if it came up and bit them in the arse. and the term is thrown around loosely to defend their rant when it is challenged.
4/28/2010,and you need to learn the difference between being rational and being stupid.you came here posting an direct attack (of which you admit.. thanks for that! now i can report you! ha ha?) and now your telling me that this thread is just like the rest.what are you trying to do? incite me to anger? are you just being here to come after me and not caring about the thread? what is this really about? are you just wasting time?sounds to me like your trolling!have you been reading these threads at all? the ones that emo tj makes? the pl threads that oppose something from pl yet pl members support?don't know about you... but i was referring to the op's proposal... this has nothing to do with me.. i rarely ever make a new proposal. yet your acting like i do so all the time.derp derp?tell you what... i'll let you take a moment to figure it out. i get the feeling you didn't take the time to think things out.

4/28/2010,i said what i needed to say in the other thread.
4/28/2010,"sometimes when things are a little quiet or your in an alliance thats not full of like minded pvp corps, sometimes its nice to do corp ops. empire wars can help towards this but if your in alliance you cant just go do this and it affects the entire alliance.so please can we allow corps to do corp only war decs even if they are in alliance."
4/28/2010,"this seems like it'd be prone to serious problems with weird exploits of the system. in order for it to be even approximately balanced, it'd have to cost as much as an alliance wardec, and the war target should have the option to expand the war to include everyone in the alliance free of cost. and even then, i don't think i'd approve. it'd be too much programming time for too little payoff."

4/28/2010,i think this middle ship is a good idea. it's unrealistic that the eve market wouldn't fill this gap. i don't think there should be required industry skills to fly one though. i think the skills should be related to - well flying ships. the orca seems to indeed be a mining boat. look at the bonuses. 6 of the 7 bonuses are useless for simple hauling.

(thread still open, didn't reach 10 yet.)4 more people say ""no""thread is locked or removed, not enough support.just a thought, this might have been said before, or a bad idea. however this could be entirely reasonable.thoughts appreciated,"

4/28/2010,"i can see a ship having the ability to protect other fleet members from missiles. but it shouldn't have weapons of it's own, currently that wouldnt happen as the person with defender could just load diffrent missiles.maybe a new dessie role, kills missiles automatically, can only load ( light) defender missiles,make missiles have something like armor, the bigger the missiles the more armor, that way a dessie cant screen against a missile boat such as a raven allowing a friendly to pwn it.anyways defenders need a purpose but needs to be careful. missiles are already kinda bad in pvp. defenders wont make them better =\"
4/28/2010,"tl;dr1. allow manual activation at all time2. have missiles target the closest missile or return and orbit---while i don't agree with the op, something need to be made. imo the easiest solution would be a slight change of missile ai and removal of the need to have an incoming missiles to fire them. the fixallow activation at any time. if there are any incoming missiles just target the closest one. if the missile have no suitable target then just orbit it at some random distance (5k?). mechanics are already in place. apparently fofs can aquire targets by themselves. drones does have a ""return and orbit"" command, and i suspect missiles and drones are _very_ similar when it comes to code. so you can fire them at any time and they will just orbit your ship for 10 secs unless someone fires a missile at you.tweaks (dodgy stuff that will change dynamics and therefore will be ignored)make let fofs be fired the same way and make both fofs and defenders smarter. my proposal is that if their current target disappears (destroyed, warped out, timed out, hits its target, whatever)then send them off on the next closest target, or return and orbit. instead of just going straight ahead."
4/28/2010,"maby they could be replaced by ""flares"" that you could launch at any time and traveled out like 5km for lets say 20s and any missile that came within a 10km sphere had a chance (high chance for light missiles, low chance for cruise missiles etc.) to take ""the bait"" and hit the flare insteadthus making them have a chance stop any missiles going at you or your allies (as-well as ****ing over your allies missiles) and not being a useless item that could only help yourselfidk how hard this would be to implement seeing as its some rather complex actions but if it was possible it would be awsome i guess you could also scale them so that lets say a heavy missile launcher loaded with a ""flare"" had a 90% effectivity versus heavy missiles and lower lets say 40% effectivity versus the lower and higher tier missiles (cruise and light missiles)or you could just make a new mod called flare launcher and balance it to every missile type..."
4/28/2010,"change them or lose them, same for fof."
4/28/2010,a few points:1. vs any missile: having defenders shoot down any missiles not just thoose aimed at your ship would be horrible in big fleets.2. vs specific target: a suggestion could be that you activate the launcher on a hostile ship and have it auto-launched on any missiles launched from that target. it would make them more like tds = boring.

4/28/2010,"anchoring a: while positioning during anchoring, provide a translucent positioning grid (simply based on the 1x1x1 anchoring box, even for larger structures). this to allow alignment with other objects already anchored at the starbase. these objects will 'emit' their own box, as seen when they were anchored themselves. if desired, i can cook up visuals. note that this will also help when dealing with the tower (anchoring modules too close to the tower) and the shield (anchoring modules too close to the shield).anchoring b: provide a preview (ghost) model while positioning during the anchoring process.onlining a: provide an onlining queue, where players can simply queue modules to online without having to come back every i.e. 2 and a half minutes. misc a: more diversity in pos visuals; most arrays of the same type (e.g. reactors, assembly, silo) look exactly the same. work in some color schemes, or whip up some new models.misc b: when previewing pos modules in 3d (green eye icon), especially turrets, things look different. e.g. i know the large turret arrays look pretty impressive on an actual pos, but the previews don't match."
4/28/2010,"i apologise for this misunderstanding. however, what about someone who pays for their own trip and still attends meetings under the influence of a drug (alcohol or otherwise)? don't you think banning, expulsion and, in effect, deportation from iceland or ccp hq a more effective measure?glad you see the error of your ways and that you are backpedalling on your end to pvp stance. i do agree that it'd be interesting if kill rights could be transferred, as it might (and this is really only a possibility in the remotest of senses) lead to a new occupation: bounty hunting. the agrieved party pays a sum for another party to deliver the corpse of their aggressor. it'd be an interesting development and might lead to lots of griefing.now what i'd like clarification on is whether you're advocating the removal of concord and the establishment of cva-like alliances that oversee the security of high-sec. how would this deter suicide gankers? their target is still dead by the time they get there, if they're online at all."
4/28/2010,"i'll answer the rest at a later time when i have the opportunity.it's not backpedalling, it's something i've been saying right from the start, ever since csm 1.was something i clearly mentioned in my first campaign movie."

4/28/2010,"as an old pirate, are you going to support small gang warfare in general, and in particular, the proposal of ship velocity vectors that is so good it doesn't generate discussion and thus has poor visibility?"
4/28/2010,"being new to it, i'm still wrapping my head around the merc profession. i need a little more insight and experience to be able to identify problem areas and opportunities to improve the profession. however, those of you who do know the business *casts beady eye at you, alekseyev karrde, and others while pointing at assembly hall* are sure to get my attention with your proposals and ideas, so please do share them. i do think that in a more general way, the pvp balancing changes i hope to influence (see op) will improve pvp for everyone--including (and maybe especially) mercs. it's clear there is a demand for mercs and opportunities for them to significantly affect the course of conflicts on every scale. but i lack perspective as yet on how the profession might evolve in the game. i reserve the right to discuss that in a more informed way later when i'm more knowledgeable about the intricacies of merc roles in the game. (edited to add:) it seems that some tools could be made available for mercs such as a directory of merc services; special merc contracts that allow terms/conditions to be defined; or a ""request for quotes"" interface that interested parties could use to (anonymously?) post ""mercs wanted"" ads. the latter idea might not apply to big established merc groups who can set fees based on reputation, but might be helpful for smaller groups just getting started or that focus on a specific type of work. just brainstorming; i've not given these ideas more than a minute's thought.the pvp balancing changes i mentioned in the op and discussed elsewhere in this thread apply specifically to small gang pvp. that's a very good proposal on velocity vectors. i'm surprised it didn't get more traction. holiday effect, perhaps? the thread is locked now due to age; if it wasn't, i would add my support for what would be a very nice feature. you should resubmit it as a new proposal (but you might want to wait to do that until csm5 is in office, so it doesn't fall through the cracks of transition between csm4 and csm5). name it something more immediately comprehensible to get interest, maybe [proposal] add optional velocity vectors to tactical overview. i suspect many proposals fail to get support due to imprecise, vague, or non-descriptive titles. few will bother reading something unless they can instantly assess its sheer brilliance or relevance. titles like ""fix lag"" won't do that. ""reduce lag by doing <insert fix here>"" is much better. teadaze's sticky at the top of this forum has some good tips for writing a proposal that will get noticed ad hopefully supported."
4/28/2010,bump!

4/28/2010,"so thanks to folks that have eve mailed me or convo-ed me to offer their support! i encourage anyone that wants to know more about my opinions of things in eve to contact me at any time. i love to chat!there is another thread related to another very high visibility candidate that brings up something i'd like to clarify about where i stand on one of the most imporatant parts of eve. pvp. even though i am mostly thought of as a carebear and an industrialist i do think pvp is a huge and important part of life in eve. i can't imagine eve without it. i also like to remind folks that if you are engaged in most industry you are engaged in pvp as well, just with isks and not guns.i'd even point out i entered my alliance in the pvp tournys twice. the first time we did manage to come up with something a lot of folks were surprised by, our blackbird of confoundment! i believe there is even a great video on you tube of it in action and the sadly misguided assasination attempt a spy on our team attemped against me. fun times! the second time, lets say trying to put together a team at the last minute on a major u.s. holiday is only a good idea if you want to provide your oponents some easy targets! :-)i'm not bringing that up to claim to be an expert on pvp, in fact i would be the first to say i'm not. but i do think pvp needs to be kept healthy and fun in eve even if a lot of the time i'm on the wrong side of the gun barrel.a couple if thinks i would like ccp consider:1. look at what constitues winning and losing a war. i aim this mostly at corporations that make a habbit of war dec-ing smaller independent corporations indefinitely. i think it can approach greifing and has driven folks from eve. i don't have the answer to this but i'd love to see some payment or action a corporation could take to surrender after some reasonable period. i don't have a perfect answer for this but i'd love to get some discussions started with folks on both sides of the issue. for example, what if when i surrender the winning side gets to put in their own ceo for a some period of time in the losing corp till he has collected a fair ""tribute"". if anyone has some ideas about this i'd love to discuss them.2. what if a mining laser worked like a weapon against an agressing ship? might make ganking a mining barge just a little tougher. again, something to brainstorm.3. even though i'm no pvp expert there seems like there are some classes of ships and weapons that need some ""luvin"" from ccp. i see rockets are finally getting some attention, i'll have to see if ccp gets them closer to right. also destroyers are maybe getting a look, they have needed some attention for too long. i'm not a ""balance"" expert but when i was in the second csm we did get ccp to agree in principal to regularly review balance issues. i definitely will try and help make sure ccp honors that agreement.4. if i can manage to take a pos entirely offline i should be able to hack it, scoop it up or better yet put it online again as mine. that may be more of a pos thing but it seems a shame i have to blow up someting i should be able to capture.so again, i don't expect that anyone is going to be declaring me the best of pvp candidate. i never will be. but i want everyone to know that unlike at least one ""carebear"" candidate i support non-consensual pvp even if i mostly choose to avoid it. as a csm member i will support any improvements in pvp that i expect other csm will suggest so long as they seem logical and balanced even if it might mean some places in eve will be more dangerous for folks like me. (i will also at the same time be pestering ccp to make sure that if i am going to be in those dangerous places and maybe being a fun target for folks the like to 'splode things that there is a carrot for me appropriate for the size of the sticks i face!)thanks if you took the time to read any of this,issler dainze"
4/28/2010,"glad to see you diligently strengthen your election platform. would hate to see all (1) my votes wasted ;)anyway, to keep this discussion going, some controversial statements for you to chew on and expose yourself in new and interesting ways:- ship loss and character death should be costly and painful. for starters, make insurance dependent on pilot performance (noob-friendly) or abolish it altogether.- in space, you own what you can protect. concord may possibly de-sec or even fine caught thieves (ore, loot or salvage) but not sanction the killing of a crew of thousands for an issue of mere ownership.- the pink thorax must arrive. opponents of custom ship colour schemes have long fought this issue with false and unfounded arguments such as lag or eye cancer and should finally show proof or stfu.- npc corporations are more than a safe haven for noobs, carebears and scammers. they are an inherent and logical part of the game world and should have functionality for players beyond being generic figureheads for a distant background narrative.- planets should not just have resources but people on it. workers. voters. casualties. consumers. there is more out there than pod pilots and the economies of eve should finally acknowledge and represent this adequately.- ships need crews, no matter how godlike we capsuleers are (i really wish ccp wouldn't portray us so - i can't stand the concept). make us feel their deaths. introduce them as an isk sink, give us another thing to micromanage, allow them to improve over time and make it worth something keeping that apoc in structure alive to fight another day with a now-improved crew.- eve has been around for 7 years. if you make changes, keep them small so as not to unsettle long-time players and their hard-earned habits. - strength in numbers makes sense up to some point. but there should be a drawback to this as well, since huge fleets must consider problems such as friendly fire and obstruction. introduce fleet size penalties (avoidable by formations to some degree, perhaps?) to reduce blobs and to reward reasonable sized, skilled and well-considered fleets."
4/28/2010,mazzilliu for csm \o/
4/28/2010,and this is impossible. not politically impossible. but physically impossible. its always better to have more. its never better to have less. there is nothing that you can implement that will change this.
4/28/2010,"i hate to say it, but he's pretty much got you there."
4/28/2010,elise is my hero (because of falcon)totally getting my votes. :d
4/28/2010,you most certainly will have my vote.one thing that rattles me though.where do you stand of the subject of ***gotry ? surely eve can not survive without it.please do not evade the profanity filter. zymurgist
4/28/2010,"why should i or anyone that plays eve take you seriously? i have not seen one post from you with anything but a troll response. even though kbs are not that important, it does show that your character dosent have any idea about any of the ships except the ibis."
4/28/2010,"i agree with you about lowsec, it definitely needs something unique, but i'm against the nerf of highsec lvl4 missions."
4/28/2010,"sub system targeting, sounds nice, but in order to be able to ransom ship or pod u need to immobilize the target, which (imo) means u need certain types of ships. (web it, scram so it has no mwd, nos/neut it to kill its caps and thereby afterburner) otoh, would be cool to be able to shut down their propulsion and speed mods, but in the same breath it would take away from the skills to needed to be able to ransom.the viceroy idea, eventho it might have some benefits for low sec dwellers, sounds like colonisation in space, not my cuppa tea.personally, i don't have too many problems with the scanning system, it feels like a nice mix of skills (both sp and personal skill) as is. ui problems or bugs aside.pos stuff, meh, too carebeary for my taste, another isk sink with too little benefits imo. i'm a pirate, we're in it to make isk off our ""customers"", by any means possible.while bubbles in low sec might seem like fun, finally a way to catch those cloaky haulers, even i can see that that might be too much of a good thing, those poor carebears.bombs in low sec, while again sounds like fun, would blur the bounderies between low/no sec too much.escort carriers sounds like fun also, helps with logistics in low sec (aswell).don't worry about it m8, you enjoy your part of the game, i'm still enjoying my part of the game, even after nearly 3 years of pirating. consider this a free bump for your csm thread. its impossible for you to please everybody, your campaign seems to me to be centered around 0.0 and industry, which is fine, that your thing. its obviously not mine, therefore still no support ther is one thing you could do for me, have them fix the mwd-cloak-warp trick and the log-off, log on, log-off tricks.see you at ff 2011"
4/28/2010,"i am strongly concerned that most of the ideas that you propose are ust cool ideas rather then important issues that have been buging us fr years. i am sorry t shot you down, but as much as many of them would be cool, there are things that have higher priority. read a few pages of assembly hall (have you even been there?) and come back with what you want to pick up, then we will talk. get me right, i am not against anyof these ideas like weapon batteries, but i find some things more urgent."
4/28/2010,"thanks for your input to my campaign, much appreciated, sorry i am not the candidate for you, but i will think over your comments and if i am lucky to get a spot on the csm, i can ask about those 2 issues.i am aware of many other issues than just the ones listed above, but there are only so many you can list before having way too much to get done. i do feel that eve does need an infusion of new content every so often to keep the game fresh and to give new goals, so the main focus of my campaign is resolving poss and improvements to the science and industry to make it more usable and less time consuming.however one issue i am very aware of that i have not put here so far is that there needs to be improvements to the pos ui so that players can remotely access the stats of their tower without having to fly to it, that improvement is long overdue.again if there is a specific issue that you want me to comment on please feel free to ask."
4/28/2010,the interview for keith neilson's blog is up now. read it here.
4/28/2010,what are your thoughts on blasters/railguns as far as their niche in combat? are there any changes you would like to see to them?what are your thoughts on blobs and your suggestions on how to promote tactics and/or a use for smaller fleets?what suggestions do you have/support to improve the bug reporting and handling system in eve?what suggestions do you have/support related to improving pos management?
4/28/2010,"tea, now that agony has sov in a constellation in providence, does that change the way you view eve? has anything changed? how do you feel about the current sov mechanisms? do you think that it is well-balanced at this point?my reason for asking is of course that i as a member of a large sov holding alliance spend a lot of my hours grinding structures. time i could see myself spending in a lot of other ways."
4/28/2010,"tea,after having read your blog and seen for myself the work you have done in the past, you definitely have my votes."
4/28/2010,although i've never met him teadaze has always come across as a good egg. he seems to have contributed immeasurably to csm 4 and has set a high standard for future delegates to follow. unfortunately i won't be voting for him because he's french.
4/28/2010,"_please more consturctive. can't see that as something to be proud of. i mean, how is that relevant to csm, that you have no blues? how does it make you a better candidate?do you think the rewards of nullsec need to be further improved (ratting being in the main scope for me, but if you have more ideas- sure)you have any real ideas of how to make roaming gangs purposefull, other then forcing bears to play sniptheship?"
4/28/2010,"i believe tea did a stellar job in csm4, his transparent and well communicated efforts have played a key roll in not only delivering on what he set out to change with his seat, but more importantly, helping lay foundations for a stronger csm. i also praise tea for sticking to his principles and not just promising voters unobtainable 'candy'. while we would all love to see things such as a new ui, it does not seem likely that ccp is going to invest in such a task at this point in time. i'd rather the cms focus on things which ccp will engage with in the shorter term, while also making sure that proposals from csm4 are developed and added to the game (like corporation bookmarks).my vote was well placed in you for csm4, you will have it again for csm5."
4/28/2010,you are right there.
4/28/2010,"firstly thanks to all the people for their messages of support to answer specific questions.i remember that one of the quoted aims for dominion was to get smaller corps/alliances out into 0.0. i don't believe that was the end result. at the csm4 summit this was discussed at length along with the missing treaty system which might give good options for bringing smaller entities into sov 0.0.it is clear that without a sizeable cap fleet available to commit to the boredom of shooting ihubs and stations at least 3 times that taking sov is still the dominion of the larger alliances. however what is the alternative? we can't have a system which allows sov to be flipped daily based on timezone superiority nor can the current system be streamlined by simply reducing hit points. i don't have an answer for this, it is tricky to come up with a system that allows 50 people to do something without making it utterly trivial for 500+ people. in theory defenders get home advantage (by setting the rf timers) which is probably the right way to do it. a related ""hot button"" issue is lag, which needs to be equalised so it is shared by everybody and not just people zoning in. of course ccp have been working on this and they didn't need csm to tell them (though we did complain on behalf of the players anyway ). because i am realistic i'll add that you are never going to get rid of lag completely. if we get to a point where 1300 people in system is acceptable then the fights will grow to 1500 people and lag again. of course should ccp actually get to 1300people fighting in system with acceptable lag then many players will be happy for a while once you have sov the upgrade system for ratting anomalies seems to be well implemented (decent isk per hour for a number of pilots in system) but i believe the other professions such as hacking are linked to industry indexes which doesn't make much sense. we've not had results from the wormhole attractor yet but we'll see as time passes. one thing that is up in the air right now is how planetary interaction will work with sov space and how that might feed taxes back into the alliance to make up for the moon goo changes.personally it has been a bit of a culture shock to go from basing out of npc 0.0 to sov 0.0 but the best thing so far is not needing to clone jump to empire to run l4s for isk. it is much better being able to get decent isk ratting for 30 mins with friends and then spend the rest of the time pvping instead of solo l4s then waiting on jc timers."
4/28/2010,"next question.firstly agony exists to pvp and having to maintain blue lists is time consuming and reduces the number of potential targets . nothing causes us more problems than system after system of blues of course as you are aware we are willing to work with other groups on a temporary blue basis, such as the situation this week in provi. but as before we will reset standings as soon as we can and go back to killing and being killed it isn't anything personal, we just treat 0.0 as a pvp playground. at the end of the day eve is a game and we want to have fun doing what we enjoy secondly we run pvp training and the more blues we have the more of a headache it is to run the practical roams. diplomatic incidents due to students shooting our blues (or more likely being shot by them) we can do without when we have a class of 60+ students under our fcs.does the usual lack of blues make me a better csm candidate? that is open to interpretation . it does mean i have a slightly different view of eve politics than larger alliances where they have spent years blue to each other. is my viewpoint more valid than theirs? nope, they are just different and i feel both opinions deserve to be represented on the csm (and lets face it, large powerblocs will have their representation unless thousands of non-bloc voters suddenly decide to support the elections this time )at the summit, csm4 suggested reducing the number of frig and cruiser rats and increasing the number of bs. this would hopefully raise the isk per hour without getting unbalanced. anomalies could also scale slightly based on the number of people doing them, such that a group of 5 people in (for example) a sanctum or haven would cause more rats in each respawn (with an upper limit of course). this would help increase the number of people each system can support as well as promoting teamwork.i'd also like to see other profession sites and upgrades be made more viable.lastly and without wanting to go :broken record: i'm interested to see how planetary interaction will vary between npc and sov 0.0 because if done right it could be another nice isk stream.i'll assume by making roaming gang purposeful you mean something to do other than running around looking for similar sized gangs to fight while trying to avoid far bigger gangs and hot drops at the summit, csm4 suggested reducing the ehp of outpost services (and putting the majority into resists so a gang could theoretically remote rep tank them while fighting back). whilst it might not be much more than an inconvenience to the owner it would at least give a gang some small victory (and opens up some situational tactics like making it possible to knock out the repair facility to hinder docking games).there has been talk of disrupting infrastructure upgrades and similar things. the trick (again) is giving smaller gangs something meaningful to do whilst not making it too trivial for a far larger gang.at the end of the day you can't force people to fight if they don't want to undock, and if you could force them it would likely just end up with numbers escalation.if elected to csm5 i'll certainly be looking out for any good ideas for small roaming gang pvp amongst other things"
4/28/2010,yes to t abmer!
4/28/2010,i also endorse this csm candidate
4/28/2010,will +1 only on the condition that goons reform as an alliance which doesn't break the tables on the forums...on a more serious note avalloc is a stand up guy with plenty of decent ideas. it was a pleasure to work with him on csm 3 and i wish him all the best with his candidacy.
4/28/2010,"yhea, this guy is a corp m8 of mine. so of coarse he is gonna get my votebut i like em a lot because he talk a lot. and i mean a lot. just means he is presistant and he won't give up..... ever."
4/28/2010,"also a fellow corp mate, want to show my support for this fine person!"
4/28/2010,issue? so you want to fix peoples fears about someone in local? isn't that the point in this type of warfare?
4/28/2010,cinori for csm!!!!!!fix the little things first ftw
4/28/2010,"this is very high on my personal priority list. i will look at other candidates as well, but you must get in and make sure little things get done."
4/28/2010,a friend in game asked me what i thought about skipping one or more expansions in favor of ccp taking time to fine tune existing content. i support this 100%. i think ccp's epeen demands of them the 2 expansions a year and i don't know how open they would be to the idea but i would certain push for it. they could use this winter expansion time to do this.
4/28/2010,one for allthe mirtillo effectthe planalso know as mirtille
4/28/2010,"i've fought against institute ofwar for a while in a heated wardec. i must say, if there was ever a person that understands the most intricate parts of this game it is him. institute is probably the most qualified person for csm on that list, and you'd be doing an injustice to yourself and the rest of the eve online community if you did not vote for him. and if your fine with injustice we'll come and break your kneecaps. (in game ofc)you've got my vote institute, as well as a few of my friends i'm sure.institute for csm!!!"
4/28/2010,you can also contact me for interviews for the tribune. i need the isk more than zarch does ;)
4/28/2010,i'll give an interview to the first tribune writer who convos me in game. interviewer pvp
4/28/2010,"i look forward to fielding your questions, feel free to contact me anytime you see me online"
4/28/2010,miya is a good reporter so if you see him online go for it. you will be in good hands. :)
4/28/2010,hi cat herei tried to make convo but did not work lol so maybe send evemails instead?xx
4/28/2010,"before i start, this isn't an 'i hate ankh' rant. to be quite honest i couldn't really give two hoots if she gets in and it's pretty obvious that she will.i was perusing the candidate page last night and i got thinking. given the fact that the page is huge and there are so many candidates and the attention span of the average eve player is it not somewhat biased to have the candidates listed alphabetically? as a first time/unsure voter the thought of trawling through so many walls of text and websites would certainly give me a rectal twitch. one would be more likely to just pick someone near the top who represented some of my needs rather than read all the way to the bottom and pick someone who represented them all.how about randomising the candidate listing each time it loads? those looking for a specific candidate can always ctrl-f."
4/28/2010,shiptoasting in a lark thread.
4/28/2010,"i see your point, but...having candidates' names in alphabetical order makes it easier for voters who already have a name in mind to find their candidate. random order would make that much more difficult--and as we all know, many eve players have little tolerance for *effort*. i'd hate to think a voter with my name in mind might--in annoyance at not being able to easily find me in a random jumble of 53 candidates--click the first convenient name simply to be done with the task of voting. i'd rather my campaign efforts not be sabotaged by making it harder for my supporters to cast a vote for me. i can live with the fact that undecided or uninformed voters won't have the patience to get down the list to my message before they click a vote button."
4/28/2010,it doesn't seem to be in alphabetical order however i do support randomising the positions on every page load.
4/28/2010,"if it remains static, i'd bet 100m that whoever is in the top spot gets voted in. regardless of who it is."
4/28/2010,"hmm, you're right, it doesn't seem to be. for some reason, i assumed it was."
4/28/2010,i support this 100%!
4/28/2010,i was the 1st candidate on the list for csm3 and had about 33% (almost 1000 votes) more than the number 2. coincidence?we've been asking for a randomised list for years - c'mon ccp :/
4/28/2010,"on a serious note, this is pretty stupid."
4/28/2010,"i'll be completely honest, my first time voting i did exactly that.i was all ""ooh voting"" until i got to that wall o' text. i read the first website (at the top), sounded okay, and voted."
4/28/2010,"when i'm soliciting votes for the csm elections, i always direct people to votermatch to find their candidate. the page is good if you don't mind doing research and reading (same as the jp forum), but for the average voter it's no good.from personal experience (when i ran in csm terms 1 and 2), the candidates are placed on the page based on when they put their application to run in. tbh, that probably was a major factor for me being elected to the 2nd csm.i'm not sure what solution for the game is the best. whether randomized or not, ccp just needs better metrics to help us pick (maybe a short list of categories or something, i dunno)."
4/28/2010,"ffs, randomize the order on refresh and have a dropdown box with alphabetical (by character name). it's not that bloody hard."
4/28/2010,this. seriously. covers all the bases.
4/28/2010,"right now its ordered by submission time, i was aware of this and submitted mine within seconds of the page opening.i'd like to see a rework of the promotional page, and a character limit on the campaign messages. makes scrolling through the list easier, at the moment my own campaign message takes up half a page. being able to view more candidates at once is a definite must."
4/28/2010,this should have been in place for csm1. it's utterly silly that it isn't yet.
4/28/2010,"this.for csm4 i was the last person to submit my application, about 2 hours before the deadline. so i was last on the list. i had an issue and was waiting for ccp to respond. i ran out of time and just went for it. everything got cleared up a few days later anyway.considering i placed about half way for the elections i think it went well. this time i seem to be in the middle for submission time... if the trend continues then i guess i will have the most votes of everyone, sorry people!! hay, while we are at it can we get them to rethink the html tags for the candidate messages? if the forums can handle putting in the html tags why can't the candidate submission page as well."
4/28/2010,"i support randomizing the candidate listings, seems fair."
4/28/2010,"if i can do it, ccp can."
4/28/2010,i support randomized candidate listings
4/28/2010,"whether you're a pirate, in fw, or do. . . whatever else there is to do in lowsec, i think all us lowsec inhabitants have pretty similar issues:1) increasing the value of lowsec in an intractable way. i.e. bringing in more miners, mission runners or industrialists. 2) reducing lagand if you're in fw like i am, you're also interested in advocating for all of fw's many well documented problems. so, who is running for csm that will advocate for these things? and why are you credible in your support for these issues?"
4/28/2010,"(translation: we want more easy targets)sorry. it's never going to happen. you will not get miners or missioners into lowsec because they will almost 100% of the time be blown up because the risk is never worth the reward if its almost a garunteed deathtrap. (how can one be sure of this? well, barges are defenseless and have paper thin hp. and pve ships cannot fight against pvp ships)the only time you will see this is if you get together a powerhouse to farm lowsec."
4/28/2010,"hardly. i think most lowsec residents would also like to have a way of making good income without having highsec alts or spending a lot of time grinding missions in highsec. fw missions pay great, but as they are generally done in frigates, are not sufficiently interactable. i mean, i run them (i like free isk), but i don't think it's an optimal game design choice.edit to add: whether it's new residents in lowsec, or just current lowsec residents doing their carebearing locally, it's the same effect, and a positive one."
4/28/2010,"you yourself said that you want csm to champion changes that will bring ""miners, missioners, or industrialists to lowsec"" what this basically means is that you support changes that will lure high sec carebears into a death trap. because that is sort of what low sec is. in anycase, you want to increase the value of lowsec to bring these people. however, the point is, you will not bring these people to lowsec because lowsec is so inherently dangerous that they won't come anyways."
4/28/2010,"please visit your user settings to re-enable images.the creation of this thread is one that amuses me as this particular candidate cannot currently post on these forums but is no less deserving of a candidacy thread than any other. it is because of this that i will post on behalf of big d and relay his answers to your various queries concerning his candidacy for the csm.dj's eve resume (d facts):darius johnson is best known as the former and current ceo of the alliance formerly known as goonswarm. he has been playing full time since 2005.dj served on csms 1 and 2. he championed a number of issues including the incentivization of 0.0 proposal which had a significant impact on, if it was not the impetus for, the revamp of sovreignty in the dominion expansion. unfortunately dj hit a term limit and was unable to see this through to completion. while dj is known best as a champion of 0.0 concerns people from past csms can attest to his willingness to work towards the concerns of other playstyles. dj has a varied voting record which is public and has supported industrial, lowsec and empire concerns as well as forum-related issues.dj is a technical person, serving as a security expert for a large multinational corporation. his daily work requires him to not just be able to understand technical jargon and issues, but to translate those issues to laymen.the platform:to put it quite simply there is none. dj's experience from the first csms is that having a platform is largely political crap that never gets followed through on or is not deliverable. running on a platform such as fix lag is ridiculous because a) everyone knows it's a problem and b) you can't deliver it. dj's finest attribute as a csm was his ability to take a multitude of various ideas from the community and coalesce them into acceptable issues that can be raised to the devs. a prime example is the incentivization of 0.0 issue. this issue was not dj's idea, but rather was a combination of ideas taken from discussing the 0.0 problems with players on multiple forums and at roundtables at fanfest. dj's role was to translate the ideas, ensure their passage through the csm, then champion these ideas to the dev team in iceland.in short, while it would be nice to say something like ""darius johnson - he will fix whatever you want *obvious thing goes here*, that is just bs fed to the masses in order to solicit votes from gullible people. nobody likes lag. nobody likes useless ships. nobody likes useless space. making a platform of these issues is pandering. dj's ~issues~:so having said there's no platform here are the issues dj is currently most concerned about -tuning sovreignty - dj feels that the vast majority accept that dominion was an improvement over pos warfare, but it is not completed yet. dj would like to advocate for you in order to better flesh out the gaps and deliver something more palatable. it seems the ""incentivization"" was left out of the ""incentivization of 0.0"" proposal.forum policies - this may seem a bit self-serving but the forum policies on eve-o are considered by dj to be draconian. this is a video game forum not a super serious forum that merits 6 month bans for silly posts or jokes, which scale up but never down... for life. certainly there is a necessity to moderate the forums and there should certainly be time outs, but what merits these actions needs to be visited as well as some scaling for offenses in relation to severity.lowsec - it's useless. everyone knows it's useless. we need to think long and hard as a community to squeeze some water from this stone and develop a niche.alliance standings - they suck. they're being worked on. dj would like to be able to be your voice into this process.landlords online - it seems that someone things playing space landlord as a source of income should be a standard. it's boring. we need alternatives."
4/28/2010,"landlords online - cont. - while being a space landlord may be attractive to some, it is the lazy man's way out to others. there needs to be actual in-game mechanics to support alliance level activities other than trying to wrangle people (without a mechanic hilariously enough) into paying you rent.security - dj believes csm4 dropped the ball on additional authentication factors or the use of tokens (like wow has) for additional account security. the statements that were made were technically inaccurate and ignorant. he would like to revisit and rectify this.that serves as enough information to begin a dialogue i believe. i look forward to your comments and conversation."
4/28/2010,"i would be interested to hear dj's analysis of this because a) it is a subject i am interested in and b) it was mostly the goon candidates in csm4 who played devil's advocate and opposed any additional :effort: to logging in of course i agree that having to go through pages of username, password, numeric code, captcha, fingerprint, retina scan etc would be a pita but there has to be a happy medium in there somewhere between convenience and security."
4/28/2010,"dj - ""additional effort is always the tradeoff when one is discussing security. additional security, by nature, tends to add levels of complexity that make your ability to achieve the secured end result more difficult. the underlying challenge therefore is to add layers which achieve that additional security while having the smallest possible impact on productivity. the fingerpointing aside (i had heard from at least one goon csm that it was others who didn't ""get it""), the fact is that simply adding items of the same factor to an authentication mechanism adds the same level of interaction complexity as adding an additional factor with significantly less of an increase in overall security. let's break the problem down into laymen's terms with a quick lesson on authentication factors. a ""factor"" is a piece of information which must be verified in order to authenticate a person or process. there are currently three accepted factors for authentication. something you know (a password), something you have (a token) or something you are (a biometric). simply piling up multiples of the same factor have a limited impact on overall security while adding the same barriers to interaction. in the current system, which is identical in practice to the one employed in guildwars, you are required to answer an additional question once you've presented your password. in essence an additional field pops up which asks you for an additional piece of information you ""know"", namely the name of a character on the account. if one accepts that the largest risks people are currently facing are keystroke loggers and social engineering how does this defeat that? the answer is that it doesn't, it may buy a window of time, but it is a small one before the malicious actor's strategies adapt, at which point you're up a creek. a keystroke logger will log the account name in the additional field. a fake login page will simply pop up an additional menu with the same question then capture that as well. i am actually unable to play guildwars at the moment because i can't remember the name of any of my characters. a problem i suppose which is of my own creation, using gimmick names such as teh awesome wizard or weedking420 makes it hard for me to recall them all.so to defeat the two arguments i recall against a second factor of authentication. the first was that it will be a pita to log in. well, you have exactly the same amount of additional interaction now with the additional knowledge request. the second was that there would be little adoption, which is an argument of opinion with no basis whatsoever in fact. if one were to want to do that research one should look at the trends wow has had in adoption of their authentication tokens. goons at least have had a high adoption rate. why? because it's easy and it has a big impact. the time-based token completely defeats key loggers and fake login pages (social engineering). i say that the industry via wow has recognized the account hacking problem, and has crafted a strong authentication solution that is accepted across the security spectrum, which meets that test of"
4/28/2010,"providing greater security while also not interfering enough with the authentication process as to be over-burdensome. hell, if you have a smart phone it's even possible to implement at no cost. is there a cost to ccp or blizzard? certainly, but does it outmeasure the cost in internal investigations of hackings, reimbursements and the loss of customers? blizzard has determined that the answer is ""yes"". i can't answer for ccp except to say that i'd love to learn otherwise. if you have additional questions on specifics i'd be happy to answer them."""
4/28/2010,the guy in the picture looks like a total ****ing tool bag. where did you get it?
4/28/2010,that's a photoshop stahlregen made of dj's head in his aeronaut hat from the fanfest presentation on napoleon's body. i'll try to find a more attractive man than dj the next time i make a thread for him in order to please you.
4/28/2010,"in seriousness and credit where it is due zastrow did a good job at the summit and not just in this particular discussion playing devil's advocate was valid as it was a reminder that not everybody gives a stuff about the security of their internet spaceships. at least not until they lose them and proceed to tie the petition system in knots...the :effort: argument was valid because for many people even remembering a non trivial password is a pita. forcing them to have a better password than ""bond007"" or having them dig out a token to type in a ""random"" number within x seconds will just annoy them further. of course these people need to htfu the argument about adoption was valid too because those people who don't give a stuff about security are least likely to buy a token. if you don't get a decent adoption rate then it becomes extra expense for no significant reduction in support costs. i make the assumption that the people who most care about security would snap up tokens but they were probably the least likely to be hacked in the first place.however if ccp ran some kind of promotion (token plus bonus game time) or even provided an option to buy them with isk then adoption would likely ramp up pretty quickly. getting more drastic ccp could after a period of time state that without an auth token any account hack petitions will not be processed. i'm not sure how far they would want to go, but i doubt they would want to make them mandatory.i would love to have an rsa style token (as long as once token can be used for multiple accounts) and i hope that ccp can be pushed into providing this option going forward. i'm also still in favour of an optional system to only allow known ips to login to an account. this would only be for people with fixed ips or who know the issues. perhaps csm5 will have a few more delegates supporting security issues, votes permitting"

4/28/2010,"ankh is indeed correct, and those arguing with her about it would be wise to stop doing so. her suggestions regarding the tracking formula have merit.that being said, i also disagree with her fundamental ideologies and core concepts concerning where she thinks the game should be headed in the future.this isn't a 'we hate ankh thread' or 'bellum hates ankh thread'. i'm just lazy, and as mynx so clearly pointed out earlier, i don't want to read through pages of other crap to get what i want. i have no personal animosity towards her or anyone else on the csm."
4/28/2010,"not to derail my own thread or anything... but i really like your ideas regarding tracking and using a cep instead of a range variable, and particularly taking into account the nat angular velocity so that orbiting ships don't ""out track"" their own guns."
4/28/2010,"i agree with i sostoned that it's sad that hate can rule the forums, but thankfully hate doesn't rule eve, unless you prompt it. i'm not one to hate ankh, but as a csm competitor, i feel that i deserve your vote more-so.i do agree greatly with andrea. ankh's stands are contrary to the games' premises. one of the reasons i joined eve was for the harsh death penalty, and essentially open pvp, and yet industry still thrived - and is similar for many other players. ankh's stands go against this.finally, i'm actually disappointed that ankh's primary thread op(s) do not accurately portray her stance, at all. it's glassy words that might look pretty, but her actual track record and public record of stances are really quite different.cinori aluben csm5 2010fix the little things first!www.littlethingsfirst.com"
4/28/2010,"she's right that blasters have crap tracking. i'd be cool with fixing that. i just think that her solution sucks. oh, they're really cool ideas. the problem is, they're much harder to visualize for most people in the heat of combat, and they're too different from what's in place now."
4/28/2010,"i agree that her approach to solving the problem isn't the best (although i agree with her that it needs to be fixed), and lol @ ""too different"". doesn't bother me one bit, and in fact makes much more sense for someone like myself who is educated in ballistics. too bad others don't see it that way."
4/28/2010,"well, ok, changing formula for the sake of fixing blasters, no.. but changing formula to add more intereting aspects t combat.. sure, why not. i realy like your idea of having no optimal for example."
4/28/2010,"odd, it seems according to your recollection that it was you against everybody else. i remember it differently, and the logs back up my view.i was interested in learning more about the tracking mechanism you suggested, and even voted for your concept (so long as it was still malleable and set to be refined). and the vote was 6-3 fail.you seem to have this megalomanic issue with yourself, and it wore on my nerves then as well as now. please, look at the facts before you claim that everybody is out to get you."
4/28/2010,"as you can clearly see from the logs, this wasn't the first time this issue was raised and it certainly wasn't the last time either.thus claiming that my recollection is wrong because it doesn't match the exact logs is flawed, as this wasn't the only discussion was had about it in the csm. it was also discussed several times outside the meetings."
4/28/2010,"it's precisely because i understand this stuff that i'm wary about imposing it. i can rattle off trig and use words like ""subtend"" in my comments here. ccp can't do that nearly so well in game. i'm amazed they even use ""radians"" as it is - probably only because it actually sounds a lot like what it is. problem with mass-market games is that they have to work for people who don't know bugger all about ballistics too."
4/28/2010,afaik:sokratesz & myxneestill undecided on who to vote for though.
4/28/2010,"whether bunyip's claim as to your allegiance was true or not, it doesn't invalidate the questions he's asking you.i myself am a very new player, having been a part of eve for less than three months. nonetheless, i'm rather into it thus far, and i've been constantly perusing the forums and paying attention to the goings on of the community, such as this election. i truly would like to know...what, specifically, are your stances? you claim to stand for the 'average gamer', but that is something that can have many definitions. you can have your own specific thoughts on what needs work and progress while still serving the community's needs and desires; what might those thoughts be? many discuss issues such as lag, the new player experience, lowsec gameplay, nullsec gameplay, the user interface, and so forth. what do you personally feel needs the most attention?or if you'd prefer to answer it another way, what do you feel the average gamer wants?"
4/28/2010,so other than to rub warm oil on your hairy man nipples on eve tv why should i vote for you?
4/28/2010,another reminder to the csm candidates that advertising is still available as are email interviews. i've had 7 responses so far and 6 candidates have ads already running.take this opportunity to publicise your campaign and the issues you stand for.edit: grr forum logged me out first time i tried to post this and i forgot to switch chars when i logged back in. i'm going to have to scrap this alt now :/
4/28/2010,ccp have been making excuses on this for some time. who both wants to be on the csm and is willing to personally push for this on their otherwise free vacation?
4/28/2010,"only silly people would push for such a topic without even a concrete vision of requirements, which was already touched upon by ccp :pon a serious note, think. it's not a challenging concept. without a clear perspective on the basic human behaviour which makes the bulk of players and their events in 0.0 tick, and without some severe and structural changes in cluster technology as well as network code and on top of that a range of ui changes which dwarf even ccp's project of corification, it's not going to be a productive delusion in any way or form.look, i'd love a delayed local, but having seen the performance issues from scanning overloads, the limitations of scanning on its own (not to mention the disability challenges), it's a bit of a silly idea.it is also a delusion to think that with a delayed local we'd get more targets. look at the playerbase, and see how risk averse people are for the most part, from the wierdest ice miner to the most l33t wannabee pvp'er - they all want to win, but omg risk is bad. it'll take a few generations of new players brought up with the concepts of losing a ship and not thinking their isk is in level 4 missions before that broad delusion can even begin to be tackled :p"
4/28/2010,this has been discussed in another threadstarting here
4/29/2010,1
4/29/2010,another 10 years?
4/29/2010,"very, very yes!"

4/29/2010,ccp has told the csm they are not going to take on a major ui overhaul now. i think we as player need to pick only a few - less than five that we really want to push. most of those in the op i personally would not consider a high priority. my 3 high priorities would be:1) buy and fit ship option - where we can quickly buy the mods at the cheapest station price and fit our ships fast.2) drones - come on we should be able to just click (or right click) on a group of them like a module and they should attack our target. when we click (or right click) again they should return to bay. or something better than the current jalopy of lag and hide and go seek.3) right click and left click orbit and keep at range so we can save 2 orbits and 2 keep at rangesottomh those would be my main 3 ui requests.
4/29/2010,**** yes
4/29/2010,"no.would make use of tacticals far too easy.would re-create bm database horror similar to wtz bm's.would reduce viability or downright obsolete coverts for everything not involving ganking missioneers/ratters.possible work arounds:only visible as bracket when not on grid.hard limit on bm's within certain range of celestial/gate in a given system.new graphical representation when using overlay+system map to create similar effect but forcing view away from ""normal"" space."
4/29/2010,"i'm not sure i'm following your arguments here. i don't see this suggestion increasing the number of bms a pilot might have. 0.0 residents already have massive piles of bookmarks, all this will do is make it easier to move between the various bookmarks a person has on grid. as for placing a hard limit on the number of bookmarks someone could have on any given celestial grid, i don't think that would be an improvement for anyone but the unprepared. lastly, i don't see how this suggestion would, in even the smallest way, make covops ships obsolete."
4/29/2010,can i please hump your leg?

4/29/2010,fully supported!
4/29/2010,lilan posting something useful? i approve

4/29/2010,"yeah, sounds pretty logical and i think it would help inner-alliance logistics."
4/29/2010,sensible.
4/29/2010,sounds like a good patch job until ccp gets around to finalizing the corp/alliance shop interface idea they toyed around with some years ago.
4/29/2010,"sez you.... regardless, this one's a great one."
4/29/2010,"it's silly that they are limited to corporation members.although, i don't think they ought to be revocable; medals are generally (at least in the real world) given for actions performed -- those actions cannot usually be undone. you earned it, you keep it."
4/29/2010,and.... a way to prevent people from necro'ing threads in assembly hall that have already been passed.
4/29/2010,"this is not an issue i'm seeing in the game. it is an issue i see when i visit other web pages, like just now at www.washingtonpost.com.i see a lot of eve-online 14-day trial advertisements. way too many in my opinion. ccp can't have that awesome of an advertising campaign.my concern is that whoever ccp has hired for advertising is doing something wrong and advertising to people who are already eve-online players. i'm not exactly sure how - probably through some cookie tracking or backend database that aggregates unique id's stored in the cookies, generating on-the-spot ads.why does this concern me? because i don't want to see ccp's advertising budget spent on advertising to people who are already playing the game. i'd rather see that money spent on people not playing the game (to get them to try it and get hooked like me), or in r&d for the game.here is the webpage/article i was reading."
4/29/2010,if it means more players im for it.even if 1000newbs join and just a few stick with eve its better
4/29/2010,"most of those web ad places show you ads for things that are like websites you visit a lot. if you (like i) visit a lot of eve online sites, you will get (proportionally) more eve online ads - unfortunately, it's the kind of logic that doesn't really help subscription based services.see the way it works is this:the ad service sees you have a lot of cookies for clothing websites and infers that you like to shop for clothes. so, it checks to see if it has an ad for clothing and shows it to you. that's great, because clothes are something you buy in spurts. you don't subscribe to jcpenneys.it's less successful for subscription based services because it ends up targeting a lot of people who are already subscribers."
4/29/2010,"i remember reading a dev post on this topic a year or two ago. their basic rationale was ""well, we know it hits the sort of people who like to play eve. that means the targeting is working properly.""it's annoying, but i doubt ccp feels any great need to change it."
4/29/2010,"of course, most internet ads are pay-per-click, so unless you want your sub cost to go up, you won't be a douche and click on the eve-online ads that you see everywhere. leave that to people who haven't played yet or who need to re-up their subs."
4/29/2010,"they do seem to buy on the ""eve online"" keyword too much, people who have been targetted on that keyword already play.probably need to stick to buying ""mmo"", ""online game"" type keywords.up-to-them..... some advertising can be cheap enough that it doesn't matter too much. just to clear up a little miss-conception.cookies from one domain are not readable by another, they are well hidden on the harddrive and browser exploits that allow them to be read are quickly patched.the tracking cookies are on 3rd party domains and track you via the advertising you view on many different sites.these advertising companies can then offer targetting based on demographics of which pages you've seen their adverts on previously.cookies aren't virus, are safe and don't expose your private information."
4/29/2010,"it should be small, but i think it would add a nice dimension to the game.make it like base of 0% with skills and mods max of say 7.5% to 13% chance you can get away, based on sensor stg and stuff like how ecm works."

4/29/2010,full support here.
4/29/2010,"i am in favor of delayed local as well, but i hope that such a change also comes with a change to d-scanning mechanics because having to scan every 2 seconds see the gank coming is a real pain in the arse. let's face another issue as well, in regards to the recent controversy: see thread in general regarding someone managing to keep from being visible in local, and allegedly (innocent until proven guilty) using the supposed exploit to hunt botters.in as much as local is a good tool for both offense and defense, and removal of it would affect both sides equally, one of the ways that bots work via their scripting routines is to monitor local and then go to ss. removal of local would be a dent in bots on the level of unholy rage, and i think most players support that. but the d-scanner mechanics, while no problem for a bot program, is worse than water torture on a real player. it should be noted that i spend a lot of time in wh space and 0.0 in an exploration fit ship, and i have now, as if last week, managed to keep it in one piece for an entire year, not counting the first 2 months of its life when i used it in fw. i can use the d-scanner well enough to stay off the list of the soft-headed and lazy, but it feels as dumb as marching in place while singing and inserting your friends names in the lyrics.the ability to detect scans and radar signals is 1970s technology. i know, i used to work on those systems in fighter jets. it's a bit odd that, 23000 years into the future, a ship can't pick up on some signals, even low noise in passive detection systems, when being scanned down. unfortunately, such a system, whatever it's report medium, will get piped right into the latest bot script and the isk sellers will be back in business (and back off the menu). hopefully this will get resolved somehow."
4/29/2010,"i like the 15 au overview scanner part, and supported, at least for 0.0 to begin with and would not mind it in low-sec either with say such an overview/scanner change."
4/29/2010,"while i can't agree to the outright removal of local in 0.0 and/or low-sec, i think you may be on to one point. my idea for new local systems is available here.i feel that this will work a lot better than the additional server queries that constant d-scans would create with the op's idea. any constructive criticism is welcomed."
4/29/2010,this thread again?
4/29/2010,"from bunyips ""idea"" thread:worst ideas ever."
4/29/2010,yeap
4/29/2010,"i'd like to see the scanning system completely redone as well, but i don't think it's critical to have that in place before local is put into delayed mode.how about you and i discuss a revamp of the entire scanning concept elsewhere in another thread? i think we need to throw out everything we know about eve's current setup for scanning and come up with something that would be the most interesting game play wise and then back off from that if we need to due to implementation limits."
4/29/2010,"the only thing a delayed local will give to small gangs is the headstart to ambush solo/defenseless pilots at the belts. u can't hit and run on any gang and kill anything quickly enough except at a gate and even then, they'll still see u gate jump in so there's no surprise at all. it's just another ""i want easier ganks because my killboard isn't perfect enough"" thread. not supported."
4/29/2010,w-space is not analogous to 0.0
4/29/2010,put some thought in to improving the scanner and just do it.
4/29/2010,"wut? serious?removing local is the same as forcing people to smash a button every 10 seconds, that is just terrible game design. the only effect this would have is that indeed all ratters in 0.0 are macros, since everyone else already moved to lvl 4 missions in high sec. if your goal is to empty low sec and 0.0 even more, then sure go ahead.i actually agree local shouldnt be an intel channel. but such changes would break way more than they would fix. before you do it you first need a good scanner that doesnt make you want to commit ritual japanese suicide, and the pve content needs to be fixed, so you actually got a fighting chance against the roamers. (sleeper ai that switches agro for example)."
4/29/2010,no support.
4/29/2010,"maybe for 0.0, not for lowsec.until lowsec leaves the proposal i won't support."
4/29/2010,"i support having ccp review the local mechanic but not the change listed in the op. any removal of local would need to be coupled with a new mechanic like a super directional scanner or whatnot. i've actually tried to gather intelligence without local and it is insanely hard, to the point where it is such a pain as to make the game unfun. also i would want some more nerfs put on the non-covert cloaks if local is removed. there will be too many fleets hiding with cloaks without local."
4/29/2010,"(i dont know where i saw this, so if someone finds the link please add it)how about this: you jump into a system and wont be shown in local for the say first 30-60seconds. when the time is over, you will be shown in local.all people already in local before you get shown normally after you jump in."
4/29/2010,"i can see how this helps pirates and opportunistic pvpers, but how does it help everyone else?"
4/29/2010,"all in all whatever ideas get put around, the current state of things is ridiculous, a chat channel user list being the best intel gathering tool in a space game? its just stupid, and fills ur screen with yet another window that shouldnt be there, and ruins the immersion.things have to change, and have been glossed over for years."
4/29/2010,yep. supporting on principle - scanner needs some work as part of the plan.
4/29/2010,helps them compete against macros...?
4/29/2010,thumbs up if it is supposed to work both ways: i.e. person entering the system does not see who is in it and persons in the system do not see who just entered.
4/29/2010,"support on principle alone, but i'd like to see a lot of work done on the d-scanner before this got implemented."
4/29/2010,so as long as it's in the name of the good 'ol macro fight it's ok that it will screw everyone else. let's get to it then!
4/29/2010,"""this will defeat macros."" is the eve equivalent of ""tough on crime!"". appended to everything, and meaningless. just like ""this will defeat blobs and encourage small gang pvp."" if people don't know how many enemies are around, they won't scout or use dividing tactics or small gangs--they'll take the path of least resistance and blob up. w-space also has limits on how big a blob you can bring in.nothing should change about local before the directional scanner is made less horrible. i just love having to filter through twenty small pulse laser batteries every ten seconds when someone is in local, now i have to do it every ten seconds all the time? yay."
4/29/2010,"but really, why do you care? no-one's suggesting the hi-sec have delayed local."
4/29/2010,"euhm people, some rational thinking please. the only ones who can press a dir scan button every 10 seconds without ordering a rope and a chair on ebay are the macros."
4/29/2010,"this will bring more skill to eve pvpwhich means that people who learn the game well become better than other people, no matter what they do - roam, blob, or farmit will also make the game more exciting, there will be higher thrill level."
4/29/2010,"it is explained for w-space as being the lack of communication channels provided by the gate network that causes the local behaviour.this can be adjusted slightly to apply to null-sec where sovereignty is fluid. give sovereignty holder the ability to influence the extent of local delay or what it shows as a further isk sink for use in central systems (maybe even destructible so a vanguard roam can ruin local prior to invasion).low-sec is an entirely different beast though. it is empire sovereign space, concord is present (albeit only as sentries) and npc corporations have settled almost all systems. there is no reasonable explanation for a delayed local that will apply to low-sec without being equally applicable to high-sec with very minor alterations.for low-sec i propose a different approach that can be justified more easily and still provide a tactical advantage:one does not show in local as long as one is under gate cloak."
4/29/2010,"this is dumb.here is the issue, in w-space, most people are in exploration sites, which must be probed out. so, you can d-scan for probes and prevent ganks. in lowsec and 0.0, however, the majority of people are in asteroid belts and cosmic anomolies. a cloaked ship can easily pinpoint people with the directional scanner without ever launching probes. this would be the death of all non-exploration pve in 0.0 and lowsec. this would make it extremely easy for cloaked ships to gank people. with the increased risk, people would stop belt ratting and running anomalies and instead do the equally-profitable and completely safe alt character l4 mission running in empire. someone in this thread even claimed that this would level the field. its surprising how few people have ever opened the eve map and looked at the wealth of data available. i can easily identify ratters and other pve hotspots by using a few simple filters. you can look at the number of pirate ships destroyed over 24 hours, the number of characters active in the last 30 minutes, the number of jumps, and the development index of a system from any where in eve, or even out of eve since all that data is in the api. local cannot be removed or altered in anyway unless ccp fundamentally alters how people pve and how cloaks function. in w-space ccp changed how everyone pve'd, by putting the majority of the content into exploration and adding ""smart"" high dps pve content. ganking people in a w-space complex is very dangerous, especially if you rely on e-war."
4/29/2010,"i say we should remove local from several 0.0 regions first, increase rewards to adjust for higher risks. then all the lazy bears can move to old style 0.0, while people who crave more excitement and better money opportunities would come to new 0.0both groups can have what they want."
4/29/2010,"if by lazy bears you really meant lazy pirates looking for easier ganks then yes, i agree, removing local is the way to go."
4/29/2010,"basically.this and the mass limits are the reasons it basically works in w-space and would be horrible for low-sec & 0.0.furthermore, you have the following problem: the load of posses with ships in them make it idiotically difficult to actually gather intel using the d-scan without having local as well.furthermore, covops cloaking ships certainly don't *need* a boost.and finally; nerfing scouting empowers the blob, and that does not need empowerment tbh."
4/29/2010,"because he was using autocannons?^^honestly, finaly artillary is fixed and balanced and now u want to screw it up again? i u dont want it as it is, use lasers or missiles or whatever else. u can skill anything u want in eve, so just do it."
4/29/2010,i started writing something not that polite then self control got the better of me.this is a stupid proposal! now on to something that also works well bombs if you haven already made a proposal to nerf them do so. only because that would be another stupid proposal from you and i need a laugh.
4/29/2010,"the fact the loss of the sucide gankers ship is covered by the insurance makes it a no risk operation. the ganker gets his ship cost back and any loot he picks up is pure profit. the removal of insurance pay-outs when concord kills you would not only add risk to the gank but is more realistic. it will not end the practice of sucidie ganking nor should it, it is part of the game, but there should be some risk place into it. on top of that if i use my truck to commit a crime and the cops destroy it capturing me i highly doubt that my state farm agent would cut a check"
4/29/2010,"from the ""realistic"" standpoint:1. police r not omnipotent nor r they omniscient--they would not be able to instantly be alerted and catch u from billions of miles away in mere seconds to blow up your ship.2. then again, it's sci-fi, so realism is a poor comparison to a such a game anyway.3. low sec and 0.0 losses, hell any losses wouldn't be reimbursed by any insurance company. and that would only hinder pvp so not supported.this is just another whining thread discriminating specifically against an intended mechanic simply because ppl r too stupid to realize that high security =/= complete security. u're just picking only parts of realism that suit only u because of your stupidity in not adapting. u want to stay 100% safe: 1. learn how to make yourself less of a juicy target or 2. dock or 3. go back to world of warcraft."
4/29/2010,"removing insurance will punish those who accidentally shoot people in highsec. for instance, noobs. do you want to punish noobs for your mistakes? why? wouldn't it be better to htfu and do your job right next time?furthermore, as pointed out, removing insurance will merely raise the bar for conducting a gank - they will now have to target only really valuable shipments. the people who run these valuable shipments are the same group of people who whine on the forums. do you ever see whines saying ""hey, i lost my t1 hauler with some worthless stuff in it, wah wah wah""? no, you don't. the only people who care, the only people who whine, and the only people who push for changes like this, are people who haul huge amounts - and such people will be worth attacking even if insurance is removed.so, insurance removal will harm innocents, and solve nothing.also, both insurance and concord are merely game mechanics in a game, so if you have or are going to suggest no payouts due to realism, get a grip."
4/29/2010,"now dont tell me u care about n00bs but are ok with ppl loosing billions. insurance on concord kills and suicide ganking as a total should get fixed.or at least a ganker should get some real punishment. no docking rights in highsec, instant -10 sec status and a 10 bn fee before he can even start working his sec status up again."
4/29/2010,you did carebear a bit too much? if people loose billions it is their own fault. all ways to avoid ganks are listed in this thread already.all your punishments are way over the top.
4/29/2010,"why wouldn't i be? people losing billions is their own stupid fault. noobs, on the other hand, make genuine mistakes. furthermore, noobs rely on insurance to survive more than anyone else, even suicide gankers. and it only wouldn't effect noobs, they were simply the most obvious example.it isn't broken.anyone dumb enough to get themselves ganked should get some real punishment. instant permanent deletion of their character."
4/29/2010,"no, they are not. if u act like a criminal, than be a criminal.normaly u would go to jail for such. and it is against the law, otherwise u would not be punished. so going to jail is in this case replaced by exile. and to make sure that u actually stay there, u need to pay to return."
4/29/2010,it's a game. there is no 'normally'. now stop trolling.
4/29/2010,supported.
4/29/2010,"[proposal] increasing mission running difficulty with only a minor changeone way to increase difficulty of npc units in missions, is to make npc's actually use their warp drive when they are in trouble when they reach structure. that is when npc's lose their shields and armor that they should actually attempt to run and save themselves, just as real players do.however make it possible to warp scramble npc's.i believe this will increase the difficulty in mission running, as players either have to be fast enough to be in warp disrupt range, and/or have a friend assist in catching a npc. example a friend flying an interceptor. pro'sthis will have the added benefits of encouraging more:* team based mission running* warp disruptor / scramblers use* newer players exposed to understanding pvp dynamics and why a warp disruptor is important.* challenge and increased difficulty in mission runningcon's * players complaining of not being able to use their solo / slow sniper dps mobiles to mission run with* players complaining of having to run missions as a team* players complaining of actually having to use an afterburner in mission running to 'catch' npc's.notes:* there are thousands of times where in a npc fight, player c warps away from npc a, when they feel they are about to be blown up, and they are not warp scrambled.* there are thousands of times where in a pvp fight, player b warps away from player a, when they feel they are about to be blown up, and they are not warp scrambled* there are almost zero times where a npc fight, npc a warps away from player c, when it was in danger of being blown up.* i do not believe this will require a huge amount of coding to implement, nor will it require new items, or new ai tech for npc's in order to improve the challenge.maybe have this only kick in once players are doing level 3 and high missions as well as when fighting non mission npc's.oh and said npc can warp back, moments later perhaps with randomly [full/half] [shield/armor/structure]"
4/29/2010,"""only a minor change"", he says. this is anything but minor - it would be a fundamental change to the gameplay of at least a third of the eve community. that said, i would be in favour of this change in a limited way. i'd like to see missions that are actually intended as gang content(and not in the same way l4s and l5s were intended as gang content), and this seems like a good way to implement that. pve should try to lead people towards pvp in meaningful ways, by giving them the skills(both as a character and as a player) that they need for it. sleepers are good at this, but mission/belt rats are not. if you want to do it(and i do), it needs to be segregated from existing missions. have an entirely different agent type give them out, and make it clear that these missions are something different. make the npcs stop cheating and give them realistic stats(this includes lowering numbers and increasing payouts dramatically) and better-than-sleeper ai, make players use realistic tactics against them, and make gangs an effective tool for running these missions. demand warp scrambling to pin them down, make webbers/tds/jammers useful, give them some rr capability, and ultimately make them act like player ships at least to some extent. also, litter the agents throughout lowsec, every faction should have at least two dozen l4 ""gang"" agents in lowsec, as well as a few in highsec. letting people mission in pvp kit, without any obvious chokepoints pirates can nail like l5s have, should help make lowsec a bit more well-travelled. supported, but only on the condition that it not affect existing agents. it's too drastic a change."
4/29/2010,minor in the sense of how many game mechanics are changed in order to increase mission running difficulty.also how much server cpu time is used in order to increase the challenge.
4/29/2010,"okay, sure, but those are not what people think of when they think of ""a minor change to missions""."
4/29/2010,no thanx. missions are already annoying this will make them worse.nerfing the drops of modules is enough for now.
4/29/2010,"i would like to see more team based mission, but i dont thik the way to make this harder and more fun is rats that run."
4/29/2010,"1. mining is already a more favored profession compared to missions as it is so where's the mining nerf to balance this? oh there is none.2. missions teach practically nothing about pvp no matter what.3. homogenizing everything to simulate pvp, especially terribly, goes against sandboxing.4. if u wanna be forced to fleet for pve, just do lvl 5s.5. on the other hand, if u wanna force other ppl to fleet to pve for u, go back to world of warcraft or better yet, learn to pve without dying to brain-dead computer-controlled opponents and having other ppl fight your battles for u against brain-dead computer-controlled opponents."
4/29/2010,increase isk reward of missionimpliment warp-away ratsreduce rat spawnincrease rat bounty signifigantly and increase overall combat abilityintroduce missions with specific rats need to be tackled and killedi could see this making an improvement in pve. makes grinding and soloing missions harder (must fit scramble mission) encourages group missioning? makes pve fits more able to fight pvp?
4/29/2010,"not supported, this would make a scrambler needed on every fit out there, and frankly, that is a bit much for those mods. i like l4's in a cynabal, but really can't spare the midslots.now changing that some specific mission need this is fine by me. (possible, done in the new training missions already)"
4/29/2010,"1. the isk reward will still pale in comparison to loot and salvage.2. that's not encouraging fleets--that's forcing them. and for just active pve, no less while at the same time, solo mining still remains effortless in the first place.3. less rat spawns = less consequences of ninja salvagers/looters, therefore, eliminating the risk of high sec missions.4. much higher bounties will once again just lean towards more laziness in not having to loot/salvage for the bulk of the isk, in addition to 1 and 3. and buffing rat combat abilities would just force everyone to stay with the mainstream cap-stable super-tank cookie cutter fits instead of experimenting with more varied fits.5. refer to #2.6. ""more able"" to pvp =/= winning in pvp. ""more able"" = u'll still die to their blob.7. your entire post goes against sandboxing, with strict fit restrictions, further mission/mining unbalancing, major removal of loot/salvaging, and removal of high sec mission risks.8. again, unless they decide that mining gets nerfed to balance this, which isn't gonna happen, this ain't gonna happen either."
4/29/2010,instead of this simply implement sleeper ai on all npcs
4/29/2010,"you know, let's go ahead and ban half of eve accounts because they are using server cpu time. let's not add any new features ever because of server cpu time, i hate when people comment on cpu time, anhd half of them have no real idea about how much impact a certain feature will have. about the proposal: yes, because that means a missions runner can fightback upon attackers, makes mission running and pvp ships less different. you might still consider using cap rechargers and active tank, but you will have an omni tank, and be able to hold anyone who will try to kill you in a mission, making gankers think twice.this is a great argument: ""the ship i prefer to run missions in has no spare midslots, so i woun't support it""- do you even... think?? ...who am i asking.."
4/29/2010,"missions need to be more interesting. this would help. basically, the current ai makes shooting npcs as fun as shooting fish in a barrel.no level of pretty graphics makes up for ""lock"" ""fire"" ""lock ""fire"" on repeat. we wonder how we have such a problem with macros... up the complexity. for such a complex game, fighting npcs is so incredibly un-complex."
4/29/2010,"well, you plan to make a warp scrambler or disruptor mandatory not only for pvp, but also for missioning, this is a very large limit to all fittings. basically, you'd need volley (to kill something before it can flee) or tackle (losing one midslot). so either minnie (artie) or amarr (beam). well, volley does not always work, so either you tank with one less midslot, or you armor tank. tackle does not have a long range, so all sniping fits would have to go, all slow fits as well.which would mean caldari and minnie would not be happy (lose tank). drones might ruin your mission because they might make someone unhappy and warp off (gallente is a sad panda), amarr would not be happy because they are slow, and don't have enough midslots as it is.you now have limited the fittings that are viable for missions to about 10% of the original number."
4/29/2010,"this is a great simple, ""little thing"" that would make use of an existing feature so much more efficient and less annoying. supported.tightening, honing, 'polishing' of existing gameplay is the premise behind my platform for csm5: fix the little things first. just 5 of these little things implemented would create a synergy to vastly improve your daily eve experience.if you value giving priority to little fixes like this, vote for cinori aluben. my priority is that ccp make these ""little things"" a priority. as such small items wouldn't require heavy coding time, devoting dev time to them is solely a matter of prioritization, which the csm will have an active part in now.cinori aluben csm5 2010fix the little things first!www.littlethingsfirst.com"
4/29/2010,agreed
4/29/2010,the lp store ui is really an example how not to do it. fix it!
4/29/2010,can't happen to soon imho.
4/29/2010,"with the giant fleets in 0.0, its time to introduce a new counter to blob-warfare. i suggest the implementation of electronic warfare-capitals, with ew effecting the entire grid. webs for minmatar, warp disruption for gallente, neutralising for amarr and ecm for caldari."
4/29/2010,pure win
4/29/2010,i'm ok with this
4/29/2010,aoe ewar? you dont think the lag is bad enough already?
4/29/2010,yes.
4/29/2010,"would just be awesom. could maybe fitted to titans, would make them used more and maybe die more+1"
4/29/2010,"okay this is clearly a joke but...suddenly leviathans. hundreds of them. caldari ecm titan, wouldn't be overpowered much? or avatar sapping entire fleets of capacitor, or... anyhow, how would this discourage blob warfare i'm not certain. you'd need more ships to pump up eccm to other ships and might explode the eccm market, not to mention the demand for guardians would also explode.mkay. could we please stop making joke proposals in ah please? :/"
4/29/2010,"as a follow-up to this topic, it's been reported to me that in the upcoming tyrannis release, it shows the time and date, and if you click on it a calendar pops up that u can use to schedule events and set reminders. when ""little"" suggestions that are feasible to implement are put forward to ccp, you get results! vote cinori aluben csm5 for more results like this one! fix the little things first!"
4/29/2010,"currently when you go do buy orders, you have to fly to go pick up the stuff.if you were the seller, it would be cool to say""i am selling and willing to jump x amount of jumps to deliver it"". -i will not deliver in security < xx-delivery within xx amount of days.===sometimes i cant be bothered to fly around to go pick up some things...but would be cool to be able to buy something and get it delivered instead of having to make a contract."
4/29/2010,pretty simple. limit the range of your buy order. pick the range that fits your needs and people have to haul it into that range to sell it to you.
4/29/2010,"what darius said, or you can just use a courier contract. there's no need for this, it'd just make things more complex to no purpose."
4/29/2010,"having put a lot of thought in how to revitalize low-security space, i formulated the following idea. the concept also applies (given different mechanics) to null-sec, and this would allow for a better gameplay for all. any constructive criticism is welcomed.in low-sec:concord doesn't have much presence here, so have the factions control the local chat. the catch is that they're not going to give this permission out for free, except possibly to the people who are in their army (fw players in their sovereign space).local would be in delayed mode until a person paid a given amount at a station or a new 'agent in space' to use the comms system. once that price was paid, the user would be able to get local until he logged out or left the system. the price wouldn't have to be high (maybe something like 10k or so).to compensate for this, gate guns should be increased in power as you get higher in security systems. at 0.4, the gate guns will work approximately twice as well as they currently do, and at 0.2, they'll work as they do right now. at 0.0 empire space, they'll work half as well.this should allow for gatecamps at the periphery using spider-tanked groups, but solo gatecamping would be impossible. as you get closer to 0.0, the gate guns become weaker (accounting for a lack of maintenance by the owning faction).advantages:* another isk sink to replace the ones being lost by pi.* possession of a system means a lot more.* more prey in low-sec, since the entry will be far easier.* more access to choice toys in low-sec, given the new trade hubs possible.disadvantages:* new mechanics would have to be introduced to allow for this.* tactics would be required for gatecamps in the higher securities, while it'll become easier as the security drops.in null-sec:the sovereign power in the system would get a new ""communications relay tower"" for ihubs that would give their pilots local. whether this could be transferred due to standings or not remains at the discretion of the developers. everybody else (macroers included) would have to run cautiously.gate sentries should be able to work as pos sentry arrays, allowing alliances in control of a system to rent them out. i know this was promised for dominion, but it seems to have fallen to the back burner.advantages:* intel now becomes much easier for the sovereign power.* intervening space would be more likely to be sovereign, given the lack of intel in nearby non-sovereign systems.* macroers would have a lot more difficulty operating in 0.0, especially if it's held by another alliance.* cloak ships could be more of an asset for small-gang pvp, allowing groups to attack by surprise, even if not the sovereign power.disadvantages:* expense for alliances to set up the comms tower by their ihubs.* redesign of mechanics necessary to put this into place, including standings-based local if implemented.edit: given the mechanics suggested by herschel below, i've devised an alternate method that would probably accommodate these issues while still breathing life into low-sec from high-sec dwellers."
4/29/2010,stuff that i think is a bad idea:
4/29/2010,"allow me to explain my viewpoints:no battles within 250km of the gate: everybody in high-sec knows that gatecamps love to exist on the border between high and low security. battleships equipped with smartbombs are just the latest trend. until something is done about the reputation of the threshold between high and low security space, low-sec will continue being a barren wasteland.no battles within 250km of the station: it makes no rp sense that the owners of the station will permit battles to take place there. sentry turrets used to be a hindrance, but as the ability to tank has increased, the damage dealt by the guns have not.please note, i am not against pvp or anything of the sort. in fact, if done well, it can be done more often afk than in missions. pvp is essential to the game of eve, creating the need for consumption of new materials, and thus encouraging most aspects of pve.this idea gives the pirates more targets, with the slight modification that they now have to think to earn their epeen. i know of many other people, even those employed by ccp, who follow my thinking about pvp at gates and stations.the other aspect was with local and the intel tool itself. this idea still encourages local to be used as an intel tool, but not the automatic one that we currently have in place. it modifies the concept without 'throwing the baby out with the bathwater', but rather modifying it to a conditional tool.this idea is admittedly still somewhat in its infancy, but it has been refined from the initial concept. as i stated previously, i welcome any constructive criticism."
4/29/2010,you have got to be kidding me. jump gates are the number 1 source of pvp in the game and you want to abolish it? and you say you are not against pvp?i do not think you have the slightest clue to how pvp in eve-online works. i suggest you get some experience in all forms of eve pvp before you dare criticize it and make another foolish post.
4/29/2010,"you should probably read this fully before saying that, he does say it should be balanced by the inclusion if warp bubbles in lowsec.on the flipside you have a point although not as black and white as you seem to say. it will make things stupidly tough and wardecs harder in highsec.eve is all about consequences for actions rather than banning them, so rather than making pvp near gates and stations illegal just make sentry guns tougher and/or give people a docking timer if they fight too much outside a corporations station, which applies to other stations of that corp too. which sits in rp well, kinda blacklisting pilots at a chain of stations so they are low priority to docking technicians and they drag their heels giving clearance.what eve really needs though are patches of space that players need to slowboat through, meteor storms or some elemental ion cloud in space that you cant warp tunnel through so playes either have to go around them the long way or slowboat through them.the second thing eve really needs is a decent system scanner(beefy direction scan if you will) that can replace local and make intel gathering somthing players do, rather than glance at a chat channel. this will add gameplay! weee"
4/29/2010,qft
4/29/2010,"go on sisi and play around with bubbles a bit. you'll find out that bubbles only work on grid - you can't just stick one in the middle of someone's warp path. thus, if you abolish combat on-grid with gates, all you do is turn bubbles into a griefing mechanism, not a serious combat threat. this proposal would serve to make lowsec significantly safer than highsec for most purposes. op clearly means well, but this is simply not the right solution."
4/29/2010,"in the year and a half or so that i have had a dedicated yarrr character, i have not once - not once seen a smartbomb gate camp. if you think that piracy requires no thinking in order to get kills, you should actually try it someday. it's hard to find targets and harder to find targets that are stupid enough to be caught."
4/29/2010,"forums is a resource, that i, and many other players frequently access from publick mashines, those can be job, schools, universities, internet cafe, etc. eve gate goes even further, and can be accessed from mobile devices. it is obvious security of those may not be very well managed. i would prefer to have a different password for that, so if someone get's my forum or evegate password by installing a keylogger in the internet cafe, they cannot do much except for posting crap. (and probably not everybody will be interested in that). i've seen the new feature, where you have to type in your character name. although that is very nice, it could be logged a well."
4/29/2010,"i, too, would enjoy the option to have a separate password for eve gate."
4/29/2010,"this is a great suggestion for improved security, at least the option to do such. it's relatively simple, and ccp has been going on about better security, so i'll support it. cinori aluben csm5 2010fix the little things first!www.littlethingsfirst.com"
4/29/2010,"no, no and no and no some more. **** you suck"
4/29/2010,"sorry, but the whole point of being in an alliance is to have ""collective security.""if you can only dec a corp individually, regardless of whether it is in an alliance or not, then there is no point to making alliances. industry corps could be decced and their ""security"" corps would not be able to do anything about it (without making their own war dec). likewise, ""security"" corps should not be able to make an individual war decs because it would put solo corps at a disadvantage (you have an economic engine behind you that they can't touch without individually counter-deccing).honestly, if your corp isn't getting much out of its current alliance and you are itching for action, jump alliance/corp and search for something more to your taste."
4/29/2010,dude you got anger issues...
4/29/2010,this tbh.not supported.
4/29/2010,"you missing the point here, imm not saying that alliances/corps can dec individual corps in an alliance, im saying allow individual corps that are in an alliance to war dec other corps and alliances,, you cannot war dec just corps in an alliance"

4/29/2010,you missed the second part of my argument. to quote myself:
4/29/2010,well the problem is an orca is a ship that takes more time to train for and costs more than a freighter. yet it is listed lower than a freighter. why? because although it has a large cargo bay it is not as large as a freighter and is not really just a hauler. its interesting that you put carriers and dreads on the list last. are they really the best haulers? why not add titans? the problem with your list is you are adding ships that arent really just hauling ships  specifically the orca and the carriers. without the orca and carriers you do see a big gap between industrials and freighters. its odd that the eve market would function in such a way that there would be no hauler between the 2 sizes.
4/29/2010,huh? costs more?orca around 370mfreighters starting around 650-700m.also you got cargo bay + corp hangar. and as you said it yourself ... the orca filled that gap.
4/29/2010,"i like maids. french ones, especially."
4/29/2010,hasn't stopped me...
4/29/2010,"no, no and no and no some more. **** you suck"
4/29/2010,"sorry, but the whole point of being in an alliance is to have ""collective security.""if you can only dec a corp individually, regardless of whether it is in an alliance or not, then there is no point to making alliances. industry corps could be decced and their ""security"" corps would not be able to do anything about it (without making their own war dec). likewise, ""security"" corps should not be able to make an individual war decs because it would put solo corps at a disadvantage (you have an economic engine behind you that they can't touch without individually counter-deccing).honestly, if your corp isn't getting much out of its current alliance and you are itching for action, jump alliance/corp and search for something more to your taste."
4/29/2010,dude you got anger issues...
4/29/2010,this tbh.not supported.
4/29/2010,"you missing the point here, imm not saying that alliances/corps can dec individual corps in an alliance, im saying allow individual corps that are in an alliance to war dec other corps and alliances,, you cannot war dec just corps in an alliance"

4/29/2010,"i'm hardly an ankh fanboy, but there are some mistakes in your post. false. she finished 3rd overall in the csm1 vote and she was #2 overall in csm2 voting. she made it on the csm in her own right both times, with very healthy margins. she said some pretty amazingly dumb things, but i'm pretty sure even uo didn't delete characters for pvp. she's never advocated banning pvp that i've seen, merely making the penalties for doing so significantly harsher. ank's a recent grad in her mid 20s. at the time she sat on the csm previously, she was still a student. most of the other csms have been professionals in significantly older age brackets. i don't know the financial situations of csm members, but if i had to guess, i'd say that she's likely to be one of the poorest of the lot. she denies using the cloak exploit, and i've never seen any solid proof. flinging mud is all well and good, but this one doesn't quite ring true to me. not hello kitty, just nerfed from where it is now. and stupider yet, she's even admitted to it. she does have her fanboys, i doubt she owns 2000 accounts to vote herself in, so a lot of her support in these threads will be genuine. but yeah, she's been known to seed it a bit at times(and of course, it's impossible for us to judge just how much). i think her vision for the game is terribly skewed, and i think she'd be a sub-par csm member. i think she gets in from the support of a lot of people who don't really ""get"" eve, and that her lines of argument tend towards the laughable far more often than i'd ever be happy with(yeah, you're not affiliated with anyone, sure). but she's not the devil, even if we do treat her like it once in a while. as with most people who disagree with you in political stuff, they're not evil, they're just wrong. she's wrong, and she's a bad candidate. but you'd do well to avoid treating her like she's evil."
4/29/2010,you certainly have forgotten all the things she's said.anti-pvp = anti-eve
4/29/2010,"agree, at least in the extreme case. eve is a pvp game, and someone who ignores that is missing the point and quite frankly playing the wrong game. disagree. what she said was that consequences should be dramatically more harsh than they are now. i personally consider that crazy talk, but it's not in the realm of banning pvp or even banning empire pvp."
4/29/2010,"that is pretty much where i stopped reading. come on cant you put a bit more effort in your trolling?so where does she say she is anti pvp? and why should i possibly care if someone likes another game? if a candidate likes counter strike does it mean that candidate also wants to remove the meaningfull penalty dying has in eve? (something ankh wants to reinstate for suicide gankers btw, meaningfull penalty, not remove it, just add some consequences instead of keeping it a walk in the park). if a candidate likes roller coaster tycoon does it mean they want to make eve a single player game?edit: and sad to see a 0.0 player still sees suicide ganking as all pvp going on in eve :/"
4/29/2010,"i will say this about eva. she's driven, very dedicated and hard working, but so is the lumberjack who tries to cut an oak with a teaspoon for a year without getting anywhere... you don't want to hire either.she's also incapable of having a constructive conversation with other members of the csm, as such she's frequently ignored or ridiculed, as can be seen by the posts on this thread and others. at the end of the day the csm is a group effort, where people have to talk together and agree on a common point of view and sadly, it doesn't matter if she gets elected, because her general contribution other than when it pertains to her pet peeve is basically zero.it is my opinion that for a csm member to be productive, he/she should have good knowledge of all aspects of the game, otherwise they are just dead weight for anything. i think you lack that knowledge, but to be a bit more productive, here are a few questions, should you decide to answer truthfully, that may help people decide how experienced you are. the following questions apply to you personally, not to any friend/corpmate you may know, have heard of or have seen.- have you flown and regularly used (if so, in what situation and for how long) any of the following ship classes: light interdictor, recon, heavy assault cruiser, heavy interdictor, carrier, dreadnought, titan. please provide killmails where appropriate.- how well do you know pvp in general? lowsec pvp? 0.0 pvp? capital fights? large engagements (100+ people on both sides). please provide killboard detail for the ones where you do have experience.- how good is your grasp on pos mechanics? have you personally handled one or more (from set up to operation to dismantling)? if so, to what purpose and for how long?- how would you rate your knowledge of booster manufacture? t2 manufacture? t3 manufacture? capital ship manufacture? for those where you have personal experience, how many of what did you personally produce. over what time span?- have you personally moon-mined, if so what reactions and where? what volume?- have you ever done t2 invention? how much and of what?- have you flown a freighter? a jump freighter? to what purpose?thank you."
4/29/2010,"i can't say if they must have good knowledge of all game aspects, that's your view, but i can tell you nobody understood **** about tracking. therefore if your opinion is correct the previous csm was worthless. as you are more likely to be wrong, then the entire eve player-base is to be wrong in there choice of candidates, i suggest you stop posting.also, i can tell you right now that i am not voting for you, and i will strongly disadvise anyone else to do so, because a candidate must respect his competitors, and not go below the mark of an average forum user and start trolling."
4/29/2010,"your point of view is demonstrably false. numerous people understand tracking, it's not rocket science, it's basic trigonometry.also, you seem very prone to logical fallacies:eve if i were proven to be wrong about one thing does not in any way mean i am wrong about anything else and certainly not everything.even if that were the case, you cannot say that because i'm wrong in my reasoning, my conclusion is wrong.and respecting her is exactly what i'm doing by giving her a chance to expose a knowledge i say she lacks, and therefore proving me at least partially wrong/misinformed about some/all of her capabilities (or lack thereof).also, you might want to talk about ""going below the mark"" to your own candidate... seeing the straw in other's eyes and not seeing the beam in one's own and all..."
4/29/2010,"the logs of the csm meeting demonstrate otherwise. nobody grasped it. if you think otherwise, go ahead and prove me wrong. this is not my candidate, as her vision of the game does not match mine. i just don't like unfair criticism."
4/29/2010,"i got an ishtar and a chimera. lost the ishtar in a 0.0 gatecamp some time ago. still got another one for wormholes.i consider shooting players immoral and thus i have no kills.i'm a filthy rat and don't feel restricted in my carebearing by lowsec or 0.0 boundries and run and hide whenever people come for me. when bob was still in delve, i flew a vexor in and ran some blood raider missions and kill rats right under their nose, as there were npc stations in their space. recently, i enjoyed running sanctuary missions in 0.0. still want to run some intaki syndicate missions as well. hung out in lowsec for almost a year for factional warfare, got max rank with amarr and gallente. i don't mind fitting cloaks and a rack full of warp core stabs, as denying others pvp is my kind of pvp. i feel warm and fuzzy when one of those leet pvpers whines in local in frustration, or tries to camp my mission and wastes his time while i'm cloaked and left for a shower, dinner, or work. after an hour or two, the screaming starts. i had four poses in total, one on an alt account for research, and 3 corp ones for moon minerals and reactions, for which i had the full roles.occasional t2 blueprint research and manufacturing for about half a year.lowsec moonmining, also had a few 0.0 poses doing moonmining but i wasn't directly responsible for those. produced cadmium and hafnium and some other stuff.yeah for various t2 modules as experiment. didn't consider it all that interesting.can fly freighters and jump freighters, but they were never worth the investment to me, can carry what i want to carry in a normal industrial.i find it odd that you speak of teamwork and constructive conversation, when i don't see any csm from csm1 and csm2 coming here to flame and troll. you on the other hand, are being nonconstructive at best, and slandering at worst in your post.as for having experience of all aspects of the game have you:1) participated in factional warfare, and if so, what factions did you play for and what rank did you get? have you run fw missions?2) played year or more as soloplayer, all by yourself?3) run missions in 0.0? what standing did you get?4) participated in roleplaying activities?5) run cosmos missions and epic mission arcs? which ones?6) collect (rare) items that served no meaningful purpose?7) participated in space-racing tournaments?"
4/29/2010,"here is the crux of everyone's argument, though:how, and more importantly, why, do you feel you are qualified to pass judgement on a game mechanic that is an intrinsic part of the game for a high percentage of the player base if you refuse to partake?for example: i find missions horribly dull and boring, and refuse to run them. as such, i do not feel that i am qualified to pass judgement on, let alone influence, their development.why do you feel qualified to influence development of a feature you do not partake in?"
4/29/2010,if someone makes questionable statements they should be questioned for sure - as long as they remain civil. i am however not their mom and thus unfortunately cannot keep the kids under surveillance all the time.
4/29/2010,"great questions solo. let me see what i can offer in response:- ship loss and character death should be costly and painful. for starters, make insurance dependent on pilot performance (noob-friendly) or abolish it altogether.i agree there needs to be a proper ""cost"" associated with losing at some risky behavior. insurance has been broken in a number of ways for far to long. you got too much for t1 ships and not nearly enough for everything else. to think that ccp left insurance as a way to profit (buy a bs, insure it, pop it, profit!) for so long was a disappointment. it looks like this is finally getting the attention it deserves so maybe this will get better. there needs to be a proportionate ""downside"" when you lose a ship or die that makes it someting you have to consider when you decide to embark on a risky behavior.- in space, you own what you can protect. concord may possibly de-sec or even fine caught thieves (ore, loot or salvage) but not sanction the killing of a crew of thousands for an issue of mere ownership.i agree with the concept that you are ultimately responsible for the safety of whatever you choose to put out into the 'verse. i am mostly happy with the concord mechanics as they scale down the sec status of systems. i'd like to see the concept of ""player police"" put into normal play in eve. for example ""private police"" that could safely proxy my kill rights that i could contract to help keep me safe. i think a lot of players would enjoy the possibilities this would provide.- the pink thorax must arrive. opponents of custom ship colour schemes have long fought this issue with false and unfounded arguments such as lag or eye cancer and should finally show proof or stfu.i have argued and offerd technical support for the idea that ship personalization can be put in eve (within limits) in a manner that would not induce lag or have other detrimental effects on the overal performance of eve. i even think something as simple as letting players built ships have trim or some other simple visual that allows ""branding"". if i get elected again i will continue to fight for this to become part of the eve experience. this is one case i can make where my professional background with direct experience in developing the 3d pipeline used to render eve lets me offer an opinion with higher credibility than the nay sayers i've discussed this with.- npc corporations are more than a safe haven for noobs, carebears and scammers. they are an inherent and logical part of the game world and should have functionality for players beyond being generic figureheads for a distant background narrative.this brings up an interesting point. ccp made an initial attempt to move folks out of npc corps wih taxes. i can't see that those changes had much effect. it would be interesting to start imposing other things on players in npc corps to make them feel they are in a real corporation and not just in a safe place to hide. i'd love to brainstorm ideas to make that part of the eve experience. for example, some npc goal for all the members to reach that would affect station ownership, agent quality or other aspects of that an npc offers in the 'verse.- planets should not just have resources but people on it. workers. voters. casualties. consumers. there is more out there than pod pilots and the economies of eve should finally acknowledge and represent this adequately.i totally agree! why shouldn't there be trade opportunities with planets? why aren't there politics on planets? i'd hoped more of this would be part of the next expansion. so far i've been dissappointed with what i see ccp doing with planets.cont."
4/29/2010,"continued in reponse to solo's comments:- ships need crews, no matter how godlike we capsuleers are (i really wish ccp wouldn't portray us so - i can't stand the concept). make us feel their deaths. introduce them as an isk sink, give us another thing to micromanage, allow them to improve over time and make it worth something keeping that apoc in structure alive to fight another day with a now-improved crew.i love the idea of crews. and crews should get better with experience. this could create a new mechanic that would make it an incentive to keep a particular ship alive instead of treating ships like just another replacable resource. what if over time my ship got better if it survived time in space doing what it was designed to do? imagine if the stats on a ship could improve over time. could even start to affect the resale value of ships with great crews! seems like an exciting area to discuss to make eve more interesting!- eve has been around for 7 years. if you make changes, keep them small so as not to unsettle long-time players and their hard-earned habits. you have to make sure you don't break something players have come to enjoy over time. evolutionary over revolutionary is almost always the best path when dealing with an established game. all you have to do is look at the fate of star wars galaxies to see how easy it is to kill a great game by ignoring the experiences the established player base have come to love.- strength in numbers makes sense up to some point. but there should be a drawback to this as well, since huge fleets must consider problems such as friendly fire and obstruction. introduce fleet size penalties (avoidable by formations to some degree, perhaps?) to reduce blobs and to reward reasonable sized, skilled and well-considered fleets.this is a tricky area to address. i'd like to see the idea of making the optimum number for fleet flights to have some pratical upper limit. this could improve the experience for everyone overall. maybe someway the fighting can be coordinated across ajacent systems for some overall goal or that the nature of the combat mechanics ""evolve"" as the fight progresses so that different parts of the fleet would become the primary focus. i don't have the answers for this but i'd love to see some great brainstorming sessions with folks that are living this problem and see what could change to make this better for everyone that is interested in fleet combat in eve.thanks again solo for offering some interesting topics to discuss!issler dainzeyour next csm representative!"
4/29/2010,"look, basically go here if you want to see how i feel about issues.or read the various blogs like kieth nelsonor the tribune, old or new.i am worth voting for (in my opinion)you are welcome to agree with me.either way, vote dammitm"
4/29/2010,"with all due respect, this is not the case. bringing extra bodies to a fight imposes certain costs -- it's much easier to organize and nimbly lead a 100-person gang than a 1000-person gang.at a certain point, even with the current game mechanics, bringing extra people to the fight won't buy you much if anything -- and those extra bodies could be more profitably be used doing something else strategically important. the problem is that currently this limit is significantly higher than what the eve servers can ever be expected to handle.to use eve jargon, what's needed is a stacking penalty, to make it both strategically and tactically worthwhile to split your forces and achieve local concentrations of power. this need not be a penalty on ships; it could be a penalty on information. my original proposal was just such a penalty: eliminating the ""god's eye view"" of the grid and giving everyone a more ""fps"" view where they only see things close by.to give you an example of a game mechanic (deliberately exaggerated for the purposes of example) that strikes directly at the heart of your argument, consider the following:* due to warp core interference, for each 50 blues on the grid, you lose one lock.with such a rule, would you rather be in the 500-man gang, or the 100-man gang? if we assume most of the ships are bs's, then for the first 200 kills or so, you'd want to be in the 100-man gang (unless the 500-man gang had a lot of bombers and smartbomb bs's). the obvious counter is for most of the larger gang to leave so their buddies can shoot, but hey, they're off grid now, less hassle for the devs, and less lag.so clearly, it is possible to implement game design changes that limit engagement sizes. and clearly, any changes are going to have significant consequences that need to be seriously and soberly debated.finally, thanks for the excellent question. it really helped me refine my argument; please keep them coming!"
4/29/2010,"the 500-man gang, obviously. i'll just start setting allies red until the game rules see my 500-man gang as five 100-man gangs. whoops, you've just destroyed the standings system."
4/29/2010,get my vote only if you promise promoting a jump effect that involves rainbows.
4/29/2010,"why should anyone on the internet be taken seriously? as an aside, i can't take politicians seriously, and yet i'm going to vote. i'm going to vote most likely for the ""lesser of x evils"" and i think that i am probably one of the least evil here, so hopefully i'll get that vote lolanyway i mentioned a lot more about myself when i ran for csm previously, i decided against that this time partly because of the angle i am taking with it. i spend a lot of time reading what the community has to say, and as i understand it, the position is basically a community representative. i thought there would be little point in me saying boost this, nerf that, because there are plenty of other candidates with their own strong opinions on such things willing to fight the cause. i have a narrow focus this time round, and deliberately so. i think the bond and communication between ccp and the players needs to be stronger.regarding your killmail comment, you know that we have three character slots per account right? you'd be correct in saying this character has little knowledge of anything other than an ibis though. regardscat"
4/29/2010,then who is your main?
4/29/2010,"first tell me why that would influence any decision you would make. a lot of people do know which characters i play reguarly, it's not really a secret, just something i've never published. last time i applied, one guy did his research. he'd found out everything. he was a current war target, and to his credit and with my gratitude, he declined to call me out on it publically. the reason i don't ""post with my main"" is because it doesn't matter. i'm wanting to help the game if i can, and everyone knows me as cat. any further and we might bring politics into it, and my application is not about that.x"
4/29/2010,"yes but you are known as a clueless shiptoaster. understanding your main, or at least what genuine experience outside the forums you have would make it worth even remotely worth considering a vote in your favour. as it stands you are a muppet."
4/29/2010,have fun :)
4/29/2010,"i mentioned in a previous post that i did not include any such information as a matter of choice. i'm known on the forums as cat. feel free to convo me any time to discuss anything you have an issue with. i've been logging on cat far more than usual lately, so you may well catch me online."
4/29/2010,hi catwill you try to convince ccp that they really need to add elves to eve? lovedraco <3
4/29/2010,i can try to convince them to wear elf costumes... does that help?x
4/29/2010,if anyone has any questions or comments please feel free to make them.
4/29/2010,"csm4 discussed railguns and for the record i thought they were mostly fine. blasters however do need some help, ultra short range weaponry is by definition harder to use and ithink it's clear that blasters are underperforming. i'm not sure that simply boosting blasters is the solution (although it should probably be part of a larger fix), the ships that they are fitted to and the way they work with other modules (such as mwds) also need to be looked at.i'd like to see small fleets being able to make a strategic impact in large scale warfare. not necessarily in having infrastructure that they can kill because that's not good design, but rather in having 'soft objectives' such as preventing the enemy from making money, interdicting their movements and general harassment. asymmetric warfare should be possible in eve however to do that both sides need to have different objectives.the bug reporting in eve is clumsy and i'd wager that many players don't even know the systems exist. there should at the very least be an option to report bugs from the help menu ingame - this should automatically poll information like system hardware and client version. once the issue has been reported i'd like to see more transparency in bug handling. i can imagine that ccp don't want to make their bug-tracker public however i do feel that regular dev-blogs from the qa team should be published giving stats on bugs reported, bugs fixed and any major issues that have been resolved since the last build.pos management needs to be redesigned from the ground up. the whole process from launching the tower to refuelling it needs an overhaul. some of that redesign will necessarily impact other areas such as industry - i'd very much like to see pos labs be a whole lot less of a pain to use with centralised stores for consumables, tools and materials for instance.ideally i'd like to present a system that keeps the current dynamic of poss but makes their deployment, operation and use much less likely to make you claw your eyes out."
4/29/2010,"so, are you running on a lodra ticket or are you running as an independent?"
4/29/2010,"i'm running as me. regardless of the results of the internal [lodra] primaries, i'll be campaigning across the entire playerbase as a candidate who wants a better game for all."
4/29/2010,"from your candidacy site:as an employee for a competing game company, don't you feel that providing ccp with your experience as a game designer is a conflict of interests?"
4/29/2010,"it's not really a competing games company as i work on a very different kind of game aimed at a very different demographic. an nda forms part of my current work contract and another covers my participation in the csm. previous jobs have also required me to sign an nda and i've had no issue so far in keeping different jobs separate from each other. my professional experience is not a secret, i haven't hidden it from ccp and they have accepted me as a viable candidate twice now so clearly they don't see an issue."
4/29/2010,"given the generally negative eve public perception of lodra (previouly goonswarm), the reply above is hardly convincing tbh.i personally find your ideas a lot more encompassing than many of the other candidates for csm, and in addition you've also demonstrated your commitment as a csm alternate. all bodes well with the exception of your ingame affliation. in the hypothetical situation where votes needs to be passed that goes against the interests of lodra (or any 0.0 alliances) but benefits the game as a whole, what would be you decision?"
4/29/2010,"what do you expect her to answer, i wonder. if helen says that benefit of eve as a whole, you won't believe it, if interests of goons are prioritized, you woun't vote. obv. she will state the first."
4/29/2010,"in csm 4 there were 2 full delegates from my alliance plus myself. you are welcome to look up my voting record and the comments i made during meetings. you'll note that the three of us did not always vote as a bloc and we often had differing opinions. that's all cool, sometimes i agreed with the guy from aaa too.if i think it's a good idea then i'll go with it, i'm trying not to get dragged into any empire vs 0.0 demarcation because i think that's largely crap. the game is the sum of its parts - empire, low sec, 0.0, industry, piracy, missioning, etc nothing is an island and thinking that way is not going to get very far.the meme that goons will **** up the csm or take it over for our own purposes should have been pretty comprehensively debunked by now. there have been eight goon csm delegates plus one alternate in the last four csms and the voting patterns and contributions of all of us are a matter of public record."
4/29/2010,"regardless of whether the goons meme has been debunked or not through their track records, what really matters is their image in general public. it represents a red flag when you're vying for neutral votes. the recent drama from the goons only re-inforces that perception that things can get topsy-turvy pretty fast when goons are involved, despite any or all the assurances.good response however. now we get it explicitly stated in writing."
4/29/2010,"just want to say that i participated in a closed beta on another (highly profiled) mmo a while back, where helen was the lead community guy, and preformed that job incredibly well. very dedicated, very professional and very friendly. i'm voting with at least one account here, i have no doubt helen will do his best to change the game for the better, from a general game perspective, understanding the game is more than whatever niche we each personally like."
4/29/2010,"i think teadaze did a great job in either championing valid and already correctly presented proposals or informing people how to present their proposals correctly, while keeping the trolls at bay.he showed dedication and integrity and by that really helped to restore my faith in the csm.so for the second time...+1 vote for you, tea."
4/29/2010,+1 best candidate again.
4/29/2010,lets get him in there !!!!!!! we need decent csm members such as this.
4/29/2010,you will have my vote!! viva la rookie ship!!!<------>
4/29/2010,"which timers specifically? i'm already proposing that ccp add a new ui console for tracking reinforcement timers for one's alliance. whether it is pos, ihub, or station."
4/29/2010,will you propose that destroyers be changed to not suck?
4/29/2010,"he might mean the session change timers. i've found they are terrible and aren't accuracte at all (it displays a 15 seconds session change timer when i jump in through a gate. a cloak should be 30 seconds, and i should be seeing around 25s when i actually load grid and such.)also, can you ask for market ui improvements? i find the market extremely laggy when loading up info on the products such as buy/sell orders, and price history and the such.i'm curious as to if you or and of the other members every inquired about removing some of the session timers (like joining a fleet) or even shortening them."
4/29/2010,"would you do anything to also improve the station inventory? right now, even though you can search, i think it needs different tabs where we could get goods ready to ship. this would greatly help with organization when making a contract for example. as it is now it is very clustered looking at upwards of 500 items at once.would you do anything to try and make drone control a little bit easier for the use. in this thread or somewhere else someone mentioned the idea of more video tutorials for new players. would you also try and get more videos released by ccp who's main intent is to further the storyline or give new players a brief rundown of past events?"
4/29/2010,+1 good to see someone who listens...
4/29/2010,meh
4/29/2010,"thank you i feel the same way as you only get one vote per account, if you value these little things and would like to ensure i get in, i would greatly appreciate your vote!"
4/29/2010,"i agree with this completely. as an example, i think tyrannis would have been much better if they'd spent another six months on making it actually resemble what they described at the last fanfest.also, there are lots of partially-implemented, potentially cool things in eve, like cosmos, that i'd like to see receive more attention."
4/29/2010,just to elaborate on things that imo need more time and polishepic arcspialliance standings systemcorp rolesassault frigsui
4/29/2010,"honestly, i think if there was a csm that ran on a platform of nothing but ui overhaul, they'd get my vote. i think it's well past time that it's done and i haven't seen ccp even acknowledge that it needs work."
4/29/2010,i'm not convinced of your ability to actually do anything with what you learn. please convince me otherwise.
4/29/2010,with this campaign post i feel csm5 may go the same way as csm4.
4/29/2010,go insti . insti for csm . **** ecm drones (unless im using them)
4/29/2010,"sorry, not sure why it didn't work but i may have been afk :)better luck next time!"
4/29/2010,"alright contact me anytime you see me in game, which is hopefully soon."
4/29/2010,hit me up anytime im online and i can make time so long im not shooting someone or being blobbed lol
4/29/2010,"i'm in, bossmanm"
4/29/2010,i'm looking forward to the interviews being posted.
4/29/2010,"i just wanted to bring this to the top again, as it seems patently unfair that the first to submit their application, in a vote with a set deadline, gets top boat. as mentioned in the thread before, top candidate will always get into the csm. randomize it before the elections, please, ccp, otherwise we'll just get ankh+11 alliance candidates in.there is no way this election can be considered fair unless you randomise the candidates list."
4/29/2010,bump for a great chap & player. meissa knows his stuff.
4/29/2010,"meissa, according to the attendance log by teadaze, you failed to attend 6 out of 9 meetings. i also understand that you were secretary for csm3, and you often failed to produce the meeting minutes in reasonable time.is this correct, and if so, could you offer an explanation?"
4/29/2010,"i didn't ""fail"" to attend meetings, i didn't attend (attendance is not mandatory for alternates). being 4th alternate this csm, i didn't get the opportunity to vote during those meetings, my contribution being therefore limited. i obviously participated and voted when the quorum wasn't met and i *could* participate.however, as can be seen for the attendance of csm 2 (for which i also was 2nd alt), my attendance record was nearly flawless, better than some of the elected members. as was my attendance in csm 3, obviously.as far as the meeting minutes for csm 3 go, i posted most of them within the allocated time frame. however, it is true that towards the end of csm 3 the meeting minutes were posted late due to a combination of factors. one of which was that i took ill and required medical attention for a bit, thereby making it difficult for me, not having access to a computer at all. the remaining reason being that the vice-secretary was asked to do the minutes a couple of times for that reason (and the very reason for which a vice secretary exists).during my tenure -- and i agree i could have done the secretary job better -- i developed tools to make the minute redaction and formatting process way faster than it was, and passed on those tools to the current secretary. the job now takes 3 to 4 times less time than it did before, and the secretary gets to produce minutes formatted for pdf, forum code and wiki code automatically without having to do anything but the redaction."
4/29/2010,"unlike some csm candidates who who try to pander to the pirate community by giving shallow promises of scrubs in every belt, i actually want to fix low sec for everyone. check out my platform on lowsec and ~other things~"
4/29/2010,"the fundemental question is, should lowsec be economically viable or not. most lowsec residents, i believe, would answer in the affirmative. currently, lowsec is a deathplex party zone. residents usually make money with highsec alts or highsec holidays, depending on sec status. some of the ""miners, mission runners and industrialists"" are players who prefer a minimal risk environment, but some are also alts or those who will otherwise go wherever the best deal is."
4/29/2010,"i am interested in influencing the revitalization of low sec and would like your vote. in my view the low sec objective should not be to draw more people there, but to provide more/better/unique content for those who already live there. with any luck doing that will draw others, too.i want to see outlaw-related content that promotes pvp and provides an earning opportunity, as discussed in my campaign thread. i wouldn't be opposed to better exploration sites, but only so that those who already live in and are savvy about operating in low sec can run them, not to entice more people there (even though that might be a nice side effect). tyrannis will provide a way for anyone to extract isk from planets at apparently pretty low risk. as has been stated elsewhere, the low sec planets are going to have high value. gate camps will still be dangerous for adventurous profiteers but in most cases, brains will see you safe out of those. so right there is a new isk making opportunity on the horizon that is surely going to attract folks from high sec.""reducing lag"" is such a general statement. of course everyone wants lag to be reduced. to do that, the causes must be identified. ccp has stated they are investigating the lag issues that (re)appeared post-dominion; the csm's job is imho to insist on updates on that front that they can share with players. the csm should also remain attentive to related proposals that might help reduce lag and support those."
4/29/2010,"i have discussed both of these issues in my candidate thread.to sum up:* lag is only going to be fixed by gameplay changes that make blobbing tactically undesirable.* the problem with lowsec is that it has to be made profitable enough to attract fat merchantmen for the pirates to shoot, but not so profitable that a big power-bloc won't come in, lock it down, and farm it. this is the same problem that pirates faced in the old days (of the spanish main, not eve!). so i'm in favor of tweaking lowsec after the effects of pi become clear, but recognize that it's a tough game-balancing problem."
4/29/2010,"low sec needs a defined role and i'd like to help ccp figure out what that is. is it simply the wild west or is it something more? i would like to see better rewards for actually living in lowsec and to blur the boundaries between high-sec, lowsec and 0.0 activities."
4/29/2010,"i have focused on trying to get ccp to improve low sec even before i was elected to csm 2. i personally live in low sec full time and i expect i might be the only csm candidate that can make that claim.so i'm very passionate about low sec, i think it is currently the most under utilized and out of balance portion of eve (and has been for far too long).issler dainze."
4/29/2010,"from dj ""one known quantity about the knowledge factor is that forcing complexity or hard passwords seldom works. many people are lazy or have a hard time remembering these things and therefore will find ways around it. the beauty of adding a second factor is that this now becomes less of a concern. i personally find it easier to key in a number displayed on a screen in front of me on either a token or phone than i do to remember a password at times. your phone also tends to be something you constantly have with you.re: adoption there's no way to tell and any guesses at it are only that. there's no data that's been shown to speak one way or another about it, though my gut is that if the blizzard money machine found the investment to be of value there's probably a way they're not losing money on it. i don't think it wise to automatically assume that someone who would purchase or install a free token on their phone is automatically unlikely to have needed one in the first place. virtually everyone at some point has put themselves in a position to have fallen victim to a keylogger or is a liar.i wouldn't recommend they be mandatory, but i do agree with the possibility of incentives or perhaps some changes in reimbursement policies to increase adoption. known ips is an intriguing option, but not as secure as a time-based authenticator and in actuality perhaps even more burdensome.if i'm on csm5 and the makeup is what i believe it will likely be i don't believe getting the votes will be an issue. getting ccp to implement will be the largest hurdle."""
4/29/2010,"as to dj's willingness to support other playstyles, he has refuted this statement in person while we were in reykjavik. he is pvp to the core.that being said, he was a hard worker in csm 2 and put a lot of effort into the sovereignty changes. as we all wait with baited breath for the rest of the promises to be fulfilled (gate guns, missions, treaties, et al), his ideas helped form the core of this concept.as a carebear with some pvp training, i cannot support him myself. however, i'm sure many others agree with his viewpoints, and he is a great candidate for 0.0/pvp concerns."
4/29/2010,"is there a candidate willing to pick up on antialising, soft shadows, and adjustable font (either fix it, or let us choose any font we whant, and playerbase will deal with it)? the candidate willing to do that gets my two votes. (assuming the rest of your platform is appealing)"
4/29/2010,"if you want to put a few more details down, i can always add a few more things to my ever growing list of demands.campaign forum page"
4/29/2010,"hi cat herei'm not entirely sure what you're looking for falls under the remit of the csm. you are talking about real resources, i don't know about game programming, but i'm fairly sure the textures/aa/shadows are a programming limitation and not to do with the 'game', balance, etc. i'm sure the csm could draw attention to the fact, but it would almost be futile imo - of course ccp wants to improve their game as much as possible, but remember when they up the requirements to run eve, they potentially alienate customers. possibly lose existing ones.i'd agree with the font scenario, and the ui in general, though i'm not sure any csm candidate could help with exactly what you are wanting. regards,vote cat.x"
4/29/2010,"graphics would be tricky to push as a csm, especially as they've just recently put a lot of work into the graphics. i don't claim to support or push issues that in reality csm has no control over, as other candidates seem to.however, these font issues are one of my primary items for addressing, among a host of other ""little things first."" see my forums:"
4/29/2010,"i absolutely agree with the font issue, i find myself squinting and leaning far too often. a simple choice of a few and an ability to size up any written text is one of the things i have already said i want to see pushed.as for the other things (shadow, aliasing) i will be honest and tell you they are less of an issue because they do not directly alter ther basic and underlying gameplay. making it prettier is always nice but i want playable first, pretty second.m"
4/29/2010,"overhauling the ui is one of my focus points for this campaign, and of course the font is an important part of that.not a graphics *****, and don't understand the importance of anti-aliasing and the shadows."
4/29/2010,the font problem is a major issue for me. it effects everyone and can be simply fixed by replacing the poorly designed eve font or time could be spent rebuilding the old system that eve apparently use to have that let you chose a font.aa and soft shadows are a bit different. i do find it silly that eve does not have aa. you get great graphics and then your subject to a full fledged case of the jaggies. it kinda sucks if your trying to make a vid or photo. then again when your playing eve your usually zoomed out to the point where you can't see your ship so the graphics go out the window anyway. on the gripping hand you can still see planets with the jagged edges because of no aa.the font is easy or hard depending on how far you take the change. aa and shadows would be a major time sink. considering players have been complaining on deaf ears for years on these 2 topics i don't have high hopes things will change anytime soon. you don't get anything if you don't try.
4/29/2010,"with this post i think you've got my vote, and i've never even been a pirate.edit: on second thought, i may have been premature--there are several candidates that sound good, so i'm still deciding. i only have one account, so i only get one vote, so i want to make sure it's for the person i think is best."
4/29/2010,"i haven't spoken with akhkghaskjtah and really haven't gone out of my way to read every post she's ever made on anything. likewise i haven't perused all of her csm accomplishments, which at a glance seem rather impressive. the only things i am basing my views about her are by how she generally presents herself on the forums and her campaign messages. she seems to go out of her way to resent mazzilliu (and others, but mostly maz who is really her polar opposite), while at the same time getting flustered when people give her criticism. she also appears to have, i'm really sure how to phrase this, a holier-than-thou attitude regarding the csm. things like how hard hard the csm is, how much time it takes, how it can ruin the eve experience, how more than two terms is atrocious. all while running for a third term. perhaps i'm totally mistaken here, and i'm not going to spend the time perusing every post, but it's just my impression. either way, she seems devoted to a cause and that's not entirely a bad thing. and like i mentioned before, she has (what seems to be) some success with the csm.as far as her views on eve, i have a hard time deciding whether she is actually so out of touch with what most of us think makes eve great, or if she is just shrewdly pandering to the people that have been suicide ganked and are really miffed about it. there are so many pvp candidates out there and she knows full well she'll never get their vote - but it doesn't matter, those votes are watered down. she can alienate them so far and collect a far bigger pool of players in the process. i mean, i've literally lost count at the number of people i've killed (only suicide ganked a few - standings grind is far too annoying for me to do regularly) who have sent me nasty eve-mails about how i just killed an it alt and that my corporation would be destroyed, or how i'm tarnishing the name of my alliance and that my ceo is going to boot me. alliances have their vote, low-sec brosefs are all fighting amongst themselves, leaving a bulk of the population just chilling ready to be picked up. realistically none of the ridiculous changes she is advocating will make it anywhere off the drawing board, and deep down the people voting for her probably know that too, but hey it's more subtle than ""i'll fix lag man~"". either that or she is totally out of touch with eve. one thing i've learned in eve is that you can never discount that possibility.if you want to know more about me as a candidate, feel free to read my campaign thread"
4/29/2010,"personally i think it might be a little too much making a whole new mechanic of a thing that already have a sorta working mechanic to it.also, by making a ""player kill unfriendly"" system in a pvp game is just by asking for trouble, i mean the concord is just by punishing the people from doing it, dont stop it from happening so how with the new system change the fact there are already people going to gank you nonetheless? majority of the pvpers in this game dont care of the disadvantages piracy or suicide ganking already gives, so adding a new system with worse consequenses is just making it worse for those who accedently fire a gun at a station, gate or a pass-by ( mission runners for example tend to be unfortunate in various events ) still, ankh should be more open-minded for the ""shady side"" of eve, being in highsec hoping to never get killed sorta remove the ""never safe"" feeling ccp orginally wanted this game to have in the first place, so why would they change one of their major sell-points of this game?this is just me thinking of your new criminal system, for me, pvp is what keeping a mmorpg from being a farmville you could just place on a facebook page."
4/29/2010,"i think many agree that missions need to be changed--i think the main problems with them are that they are:completely free from competition in an otherwise competitive game. every other way of making money (even those that make less money) is subject to competition between players, and i believe that competition is at the heart of eve. i think missions should be made competitive in some way and that player interaction (cooperative and competitive) should be encouraged.broken in regards to risk/reward. once a mission-runner has decent skills, he can make lots of money with virtually no risk. it's even possible to do some missions with some ship setups literally afk for minutes at a time. i know because i've done so before. compared to every other form of making money, it has the highest reward/risk ratio.boring. i have nothing against pve gameplay per se. in eve, however, missions are boring and involve little thinking or tactics. i think they should be more like pvp battles and more challenging. they'll never be as exciting as real pvp battles can be, but it's something to strive for, imo. i'd like to see npcs have better ai (similar to sleepers) and i'd also like to see fewer of them (but make them harder to beat). they're just a mindless grind to make money rather than having the interesting and challenging gameplay that they could.this isn't necessarily the biggest issue for me, but i do think it needs looking at, and i'm curious to see where the candidates stand on this issue. i think ccp has been overlooking this for too long now.thanks for your attention!"
4/29/2010,"you can, in a way, compete doings missions. or at least you can cause enough grief to have someone run missions somewhere else. simply probe them down, shoot all spawns, warp off. alternatively snipe mission objectives, steal loot, et cetera. missioners can compete with mission rewards, loot, salvage, and the like; yea it's not quite as you envisioned but it does exist, albeit in a roundabout way.i think direct competition the way you described would have an adverse affect on the casual eve player, which at its core is one of the main ideals that makes eve so good - it is accessible even to casual players. i do agree with the rest of your points, however. one of my main qualms is risk versus reward, ideally i'd like to see low-sec significantly more profitable and high-sec slightly less so. will it move everyone to low-sec? of course not, but the promise (and delivery) of riches will motivate certain people out of high sec and have them create dynamic corporate environments. it's a change that isn't very difficult to implement, either.regarding pve - revamping all missions and giving them something like sleeper ai will not happen overnight, and i really don't think it's something that i'd want. nonetheless, i do think that pve can be spiced up. fleshing out the current mini-professions (that any schmo can become sufficient at in two weeks), i believe, will get more people out of the mission hubs - if only for short times. it will even create direct competition, as you envisioned for missions, by its nature. and something that i like, it will motivate different types of players to join forces and work together. at the moment there is no real need for a mission running corp; just grind out until you can afford a cnr and grind you way to riches. if a missioner in a corp in low-sec could make a lot more money, oh baby mission running corps that provide defense and form pacts with one another, or compete with one another, would be a necessity. check out my campaign thread ("
4/29/2010,"as a csm candidate i am happy to elaborate my opinions on missions. i agree strongest with your third point. here are my views on each of your bullets. missions are not completely competition free, there is always ninja salvagers and of course ninja mission objective looters. i assume by competitive you mean, for example, how miners have to compete with each other over limited roids in a belt. short of limiting the amount of mission available and how many an individual can run, i cannot think of a way to make them more competitive.(fyi i'm not for limiting them in that way) there is as much risk from other players in missioning as there is anything else in high sec. there are some people who just like shooting red crosses all day and have no intentions of leaving high sec. that doesn't really do it for me, but no point in ruining their style of game play. pve isn't some infectious disease that's out to destroy eve. there is a good chance that even the most hot handed pvp god has a lvl 4 running alt somewhere. maybe the reason i don't shoot red crosses in high sec all day is because i'm far to involved with watching this fresh paint dry. ccp should take time to spit shine missions and give us more epic arcs. maybe even some of our vanilla missions with added sleeper aifeel free to see where i stand and ask more questions in my campaign thread here*edit the forums are annoying me *"
4/29/2010,"just a quick response: i don't see ninja-salvagers as being mission-competition, since salvage isn't directly part of the mission. it's just a side source of income commonly engaged in by mission runners. i've been on both sides--i've run tons of missions (most of the time i feel like shooting msyelf out of boredom and swear never to do any again), and i've ninja-salvaged, which is more fun, but usually less lucrative.likewise, i wouldn't really consider mission griefers to be competition per se. there's usually not much reward to doing so--some people just like to annoy other people. i wouldn't consider that to be competition, though.what i was thinking was something like a given agent's quality slowly dropping the more missions s/he gives out per day. it could scale slowly, but after giving out, say 1000 missions in done day, the reward could drop significantly. the player could get a message informing them of how much the agent quality has dropped that day.there's also the possibility of just having each mission only have a certain number to give out per day, but i think that the former idea might work better.i think the main problem, though, is the sheer mind-numbing boredom of missions. i think mission-running needs to be less of a grind to be endured for money to spend on things that are actually fun, and more of something that can be enjoyed in its own right. yes, but missions make significantly more money that most other high-sec activities (except trading, but that involves risk and considerable skill and research to do well at).you touched on what i think is one of the problems with pve in eve--it's just shooting mindless red crosses. it feels more like harvesting goodie-bags than actual combat. as i said, i have no problem with pve per se, just with the mindless grind that often goes along with it. there are plenty of games (single-player and multi-player) that have fun, challenging, combat against computer opponents. i don't get why many mmos, including eve, are content to relegate it to a boring grind against mindless database entries that is to be endured rather than enjoyed. eve eschews many of the un-fun mmo cliches, but it still has boring, mindless pve combat that plagues the genre, imo.eve is primarily about pvp (by that i mean player competition in all its forms), but that doesn't mean it can't have fun pve also.thanks to those who have responded thus far."
4/29/2010,"it isn't as direct, i'll give you that, but in a way it's competition. the problem with this is that it's entirely time based. someone in a given time zone will benefit by doing nothing different other than living in a certain time zone. that doesn't strike me as a good change. i mean, i guess you could have an agent give the same mission out to two people and whoever finishes it first gets the bulk of the lp reward, which would fit your competition model, but i also think that would be a change for the worse.i agree with this notion, it is mind numbing. my solution, however, is not to overhaul missions (which, realistically, is unlikely in the near future) but to spice up pve. if someone can make more isk doing something else other than missions, they will be motivated to. you will always have the guy that runs missions and nothing else, that won't change, but for people like you and i we won't have to run missions.i see what you're saying, but i think a grind is necessary in eve. it gives things value. a ship costs fifty million isk, but what is that? it represents, say, an hour of work. losses like this are what make eve so unique and awesome; when you die you actually lose something of value and it makes you space mad for awhile. you get the shakes while pvping and you just barely survived. i know this is a little off topic, but essentially i think more people would enjoy the game more if they experienced this part of the game. back on topic here, i think if you diversified the grind it would still keep this fundamental law of value, but it would be less mind-numbing.either way, we agree on a few subjects - what i think are the most important ones - and i'd be happy to answer any further questions you may have."
4/29/2010,"this is exactly what i was trying to explain to a friend who plays wow, and why eve is superior in every way. i know everyone says ""internet spaceships are serious business"", but the finacial/time impact of a loss makes it more ""real"" and for me more enjoyable. (after i stop being mad at myself for losing a ship to obvious bait)"
4/29/2010,"i concede that it would give an advantage to people in certain time zones and that's not good. it was just an example idea. i still think it's a problem when every other way of making money involves competing for limited resources, whereas mission-running involves resources being created out of nothing on demand, day in and day out, limited only by how much time each player is willing to spend running missions.i disagree that grind is ever necessary. having to do un-fun things in order to have fun later (ie: grind) is the primary, fundamental problem i have with mmos as a genre. also, for money to have meaning, it doesn't have to be painful or boring to acquire. if it takes time to acquire, even if it's fun, it will have value and people won't like losing it. also, i think how much money you can make should be tied to player skill rather than how much time they're willing to spend and how much boredom they're willing to endure.i do completely agree that the chance for real loss is a major part of what makes eve what it is and i wouldn't have it any other way. i just don't think that grind is a necessary condition for loss and risk to mean something.ideally, there'd be a wide selection of ways to make money, all of which are fun, and you can do whichever you feel like or are specialized in. i don't see why players should have to choose between enduring boredom for money or spending that money for the chance to have fun."
4/29/2010,"that's your viewpoint, and you're welcome to it. however, i find missions to be cathartic after a tough day of work (whereas pvp would not be). a huge majority, i believe, concur with this.if you find missions boring, try doing some ice mining. there's a lot of thrill in watching your lasers s-l-o-w-l-y eat away at a chunk of cosmic ice [/sarcasm].the only thing i could see to make missions more dynamic and interesting is to change the size of the ships in the spawn, while still being somewhat fair to those running missions. in this situation, you wouldn't know if you're gonna get a spawn of 5 battleships, 2 battleships and 6 cruisers, or a bunch of frigs (although limitations would have to exist).i cannot endorse this idea."
4/29/2010,missions under reviewdynamic missions
4/29/2010,"i agree with most of what i read in those two links, except i don't see disrupting missions as a mechanical isk-generation engine to be a con--rather, i see it as a plus.and this mindset, along with ccp complacence toward it, is what will probably prevent missions from ever being fun and challenging.the fact that it's so easy to make obscene amounts of money of money while vegging out doing an essentially mindless activity, is the problem. ccp seems afraid to change this and instead leaves it as the mindless isk-grind that it is. there is always mining if you want a mindless, relaxing way to make money, but i think even mining needs to be overhauled to require more player interaction (and also comparatively buffed to be a better source of income).i think eve needs more gameplay where the player (and his/her brain) is actively involved, not less. there are plenty of mindless, relaxing games out there. i don't think eve is really intended to be, nor should be one of them."
4/29/2010,"*smiles* doesn't look like ai will be getting your vote anytime soonokay, let us look at this in order. you complain that there is no competition? run a level 4 in dodixie. see if you can finish it before the blackflies start buzzing around your head. (ninjas)you say that 'once a mission runner has decent skills, he can make lots of money'. isn't this true of every damn career path in eve? get better at it, have a better chance of success. i would call this a feature, not a problem. eve has never promised a consistent risk/reward ratio (i'd love to see the math involved in even thinking such a thing might be calculable) there is risk in everything from mining to missioning to hunting in nullsec. but each has its own style of gameplay and there are people who could not imagine doing one of the other careers. which leads me to the third pointboring? then make it less boring, fly a l4 in a hac, or even a couple of assault ships. challenge yourself . . or don't, your choice. but please do not complain that someone else is having fun and you aren't or making isk doing something you do not want to do. that is like complaining that the people who pick up garbage shouldn't be paid because you think they didn't need to get an education for the job and it is boring anyway. 'nerf the garbage men'bottom line? i admit bias, i am one of the people who mission, i don't seem to be tied into that mythical fountain of riskless isk that everypone speaks of, and sadly i seem to have fun doing what i do. strange, eh?what i would like to see is the following.1) more mission arcs of all walks and varieties2) missions that have advanced ai or unpredicatble odds, make people scared as they warp in not knowing what they will find (yes i know that is called wormholes, i do those as well)3) retire some missions and write other new ones, make changes that will enlived the game.4) a random mission site where you are truly playing with fire, not a clue how bad it will be till you get there.5) level 6 missions. impossible for less than a small well coordinated gang. only offered to corp fleets. massive and dangerous that may even send you after sleepers in a mission spawned whthat is what i'd like to seeso . . . unlikely you'll vote for me, but i still encourage you to vote, just the same.m"

4/30/2010,okay.
4/30/2010,"here i disagree. eve has too many features that discourage player interaction, and hi-sec wardecs are one of them. i guess in theory they are supposed to get people to band together in larger groups or join a bigger corp (which fits ccp's idea that bigger is more impressive, so i would agree that they are trying to encourage people into the largest groups possible) , but in reality they just discourage people from forming player corps in the first place since such corps really only have the advantage of interaction yet the disadvantage of wardeccing. player corps simply do not have enough point to them to offset the negative in many cases.a similar example would be the fleet mechanic. fleeting removes concord protection, so it becomes a very 'all or nothing' thing.. so no fleeting with strangers, no helping newbies, no casual throw together groups that might eventually become a unit or corp.so no.. wardecs do not help interaction or cooperation, they hurt it. it could even be argued that they serve no purpose other then harrassment when it comes to hi-sec. after all, there are no resources to actually fight over, no territory, nothing. they are just a way to 'get at those carebares' and encourage people to either join a larger group or go back to an npc corp."
4/30/2010,"the fact that people would rather jump corp to avoid such ""forced interaction"" rather than fight back and protect their creation(s) smacks of problems regarding the player(s) and not the system.you correctly pointed out that by being in a corp you have the advantage of interaction. how you utilize this is almost impossible to measure. you can share intel, rally to corp into a fleet, talk about what ships you found to be most effective, etc.a war dec is only a disadvantage if you don't like to fight other people at all.they changed this mechanic some time ago. as it stands right now, you will go gcc if you shoot at a non-corp fleetmember.see... you assuming there is nothing you can do if some ""big, bad, mean, pvp corp"" war decs you. god forbid you engage in actual diplomacy (i.e. getting the balls to convo and hash things out with your adversary without resorting to insults and questions regarding their mental health) or gear up and fight back.in the latter case, having numbers and being part of a larger group is a good thing. you just need to organize it a bit so you don't all go up in balls of fire.truth be told, if people can't handle the idea that they have to interact with other people [in some capacity] and that they can be forced into situations which might not be to their liking, they shouldn't be playing mmos."
4/30/2010,miracles happen every now and then
4/30/2010,nonsense no such things as miracles
4/30/2010,i fully support this idea
4/30/2010,"the idea here is simple: currently you can create up to 500 contracts to your *corp*, but only x *public* contracts according to skill. when you create a contract to your *alliance*, it counts from your max *public* contracts, not from your max *corp* contracts. this suggestion would allow *alliance* contracts to count the same as *corp* contracts towards that limit.supported. quick to implement, sensible, and would improve contracting to your alliance greatly.these types of little things are exactly what my campaign for csm5 is all about, to ""fix the little things first!"" hone, tighten, improve, polish... make more efficient the current gameplay as it is, before implementing more huge features that can only continue to complicate the gameplay. even just 5 little things like this combine to create a synergy that vastly improves your daily eve experience. if you value giving priority to little fixes like this, vote for cinori aluben. my priority is that ccp make these ""little things"" a priority. as such small items wouldn't require heavy coding time, devoting dev time to them is solely a matter of prioritization, which the csm will have an active part in now.cinori aluben csm5 2010fix the little things first!www.littlethingsfirst.com"

4/30/2010,wtf are you even posting in this thread? it doesn't concern you. you never set foot out of 1.0 space anyway. leave the big boy play areas to the adults.
4/30/2010,"hi,my name is william demeo (ingame). i would like to make proposal for game of eve online. i will make general discussion of subject matter, so i hope this is correct place to do so.i want to discuss the issue of human players who are pretending to be npc rats. that is uncivil, and i do not belief that is the whole point of this multiplayer game.in current status of the game, players are free to pk other human being players at will. if they do so in high security solar systems and they do not have legitimate basis for their actions (war target, kill rights, anti-piracy, etc), they will be made into pod by intervention of concord forces, or the local faction patrol.fair enough so far.but imagine this scene - you are in a low security solar system. i know you get a warning message when you initiate jump into such a system, but to be honest, don't we all just make click of ""yes"" on every confirmatory dialog box pop up window?so continuing with the exemplary scene of example. imagine you are in a hauler, carrying valuable skill training books for your entire corporation. you jump in to low security solar system, and your cellular telephome starts ringing. since you specifically assigned a special tone to your girlfriend, and that tone is playinf right now, you know it is your girlfriend who is making a call to you.you say ""ok, i have 1 minute of cloaked time at this side of the gate, i will make short talk with my girl friend in that time frame, and come back to travel on in the game"".nice thinking, but not always practical. i say so because this has happened to me irl.because irl matters are not that simple, and cannot be predicted as easily as ingame events.i mean for example if you could hold your cloak of invisibility at the gate after you jump, say, until you press another key, any key (including mouse buttons), that would be fair in my opinion of thought.but for example, let's say you went for a toilet break after you jumped into low security solar system. you know you have 1 minutes of cloaked time, and you are affirmative you can complete your toilet break under 1 minute.but what if there is a line of waiting at the toilet?? (this also happened to me, fyi)to be honest, i do not like the way eve online game is in such ways detached from realities of irl. not fair.so my proposal is this:make pirating human players (those who pk spaceships of other human beings) pay more irl money for their monthly subscription.it is obvious these kind of players (pirates) make the game play experience worse for peaceful players already. the security status is a joke, they just get an alternative character and haul stuff with that. not even remotely balancing. nowhere near discouraging.but if every pirate pays, say, 0.1 more monthly for every human player they killed within the past month, i do believe we could make better pace in the everlasting battle of eliminating all criminals from the game.i do believe this is only a slight punishment the way i have exemplified above, but i am also aware it already too much for the eve online gaming community to absorb. that is why i am not posting this post in crime & punishment forum. i would probably be podded 10 times every day if i did so.i would very much like to hear your views on my proposal, and i thank you for your attention if you read my postage of discussion this far.fly safe."
4/30/2010,"horrible, horrible idea. the ability to pirate is part of the game.also, pirates don't just grief players - take fw for example, when the enemy militia is in a downswing, pirates often provide the bulk of pew pew available due to their ""we'll shoot anyone"" stance.piracy is a valid lifestyle - i admit changes need to be made with suicide ganks and insurance payouts, but once you hit lowsec - it's the wild, wild west."
4/30/2010,"actually it's got to be vice versa - pirates should pay less since they're playing @ hard mode and doing the most unthankfull job in the whole game, effectively allowing ccp to claim eve as a mmorpg game.get real - are there any other roles out there? miner/manufacturer? ok, anything else? a regular soldier? r-r-right... piracy is just the very juice of eve (or at least that's how things should be arranged), those who embraced this path deserve an honest praise."
4/30/2010,"wait... let me get this straight:you want to penalize the very essence that makes this game unique?sorry, but the stated theme (by the developers i might add) is that this is a pvp game.if you have to go to the bathroom and can't ""mother"" your fragile ship with its expensive cargo, dock up. if your gf calls and you're in fleet or in the middle of doing something, excuse yourself and dock up (if your corp or friends give you **** for this tell them the cardinal rule of gaming, ""real life comes first"").in short:you're not glued to the computer. you can do things to make yourself safe. outside of cloaking in a safespot or docking in a station, never assume you are safe... especially in low-sec (of all places)."
4/30/2010,fail.
4/30/2010,hey ! ever considered a comedian career ?
4/30/2010,"i have nothing intelligent to say here, so i will simply say this is a horrible idea."
4/30/2010,this is worth idea in entire history scince king olaf the hairy ordered 500 norse battlehelmets with the spikes on the inside.
4/30/2010,"shoot my ship, pod me and kill my kittens if i jump into a low sec system and go afk without any sort of defense mechanism. low sec is not safe, it should feel dangerous, part of the excitement of the game is that you are not alone, and many wish to prey on you. making the elements that give this atmosphere pay in game is a bad enough idea (more than they pay now in sec hits), but taking it to the real world is a very stupid plan.there are three realities, the in character stuff (which ship you fly, which factions like you etc), the person playing it (tactic, communication with other players), and the world outside eve (your girlfriend calling, logging out of eve because you want to do other stuff -which might be something you need to look into-, your bank account).mixing the first two is no problem, the third however, should have a minimal impact to the game. of course you can buy gtc's, and friends who play eve will chat with you, but your actions in the game should not bleed out to actions outside of the game."

4/30/2010,"well, the ecm wouldnt affect sieged dreads, supercarriers and so on, and the rest would be chance-based as always. the neuting aoe would mean it would be more viable to bring ravens and tempests to fleetfights. and the web- and disruptor-aoe's would make sure more ships died, which would drive up the need for more ships; hence prices on ships and modules would go up - and losing ships would actually hurt."
4/30/2010,i quite like this idea even though it may seem a bit overpowered due to ecm beingoverpowered but it doesn't always have to be ecm for caldari they also use targetpainter (!) imagine all the battleships get a signature of 1000 or even higher thatwould make it possible for caldari dreads to kill battleships a lot easierwebs for minmatar would be cool i think with most ships only going like 60 or evenslower minmatars hit and runs style would get a big boostwarp disruptor for gallente i don't know i would like sensor damps much more itwould make sniping fleets useless and would buff blaster boats cause the enemycould only attack em when they are already in blaster rangeneutralizing for amarr is also a nice idea i think it would be best to have it like a 20% capacitor recharge penalty i don't think that this would fit to a titan though i think it would fit much better to the mothership ccp said they would make as replacement for the super carrier changes

4/30/2010,i do not support this only because marlona has a picture of that blotch on gorbachev's head in her sig. well that and it's dumb. anonymity is part of the free wheeling tone of eve. leave it that way. btw this is my main.
4/30/2010,"i have two accounts. how does the forum even know they both belong to me?i see the sense in your idea, and i support the initial idea, but there is not way to feasably implement it."
4/30/2010,"i'm split on this. on one hand, forum trolls can go burn on a special level of hell normally reserved for child molesters and people who talk in the theater. on the other hand, as was previously mentioned, anonymity is quite useful for the purpose of selling information, and especially for the purpose of selling locations such as those of wormhole systems and the entrances thereof. locator agents are a plague, sadly, but they're a plague that has to be worked around.also: posting on my scouting main. :)"
4/30/2010,"i know the idea of a dedicated salvager has been brought up before so i figured i would come up with my own version. it comes in 2 parts, ship operations and ship functionsthe ship operations the salvage barge is like any other ore barge it comes in 3 sizes, where it differs is how big they are the first barge is the size of a cruiser (locator), the second is the size of a battle ship (staker), the third is the size of an orca(mover). each ship can fit tractor beams and regular salvagers and can do the job that those modules currently do. once you get back to the ship itself you will find it has what appears to be sub system slots as well as a slot point value , sort of like rigs and there calibration cost. the locator has 2 points worth, the staker has 4 points worth and the mover has 6. the salvage barge does not have subsystems but something close, it has salvage bays.a salvage bay appears like the 6 bays on a orca but are interchangeable like sub systems. each bay installed creates a special cargo hold that holds no m3 value. there are 4 salvage bay sizes. small can hold a single frigate wreck; a small bay requires 1 slot point. medium bays can hold 1 cruiser or smaller ship and requires 2 points to install. large bays can hold 1 battle ship or lower sized ship and cost 4 points. lastly x-large bays cost a full 6 points and can hold none super capital wrecks. these bays use the same create your own small universe effect that normal cargo containers use to store cargo of any kind so it does not matter the exact configuration of the bays on the ship you just need to understand that it works. once you have your ship configured you require a loader beam module. in essence its a tractor beam but has a range of only 500 meters and it takes a full 30 seconds to load a wreck. which is placed in the first bay that is big enough to hold it ship functionsonce you have secured a wreck in your hold you have one of two options (1) perform special salvage options on it(2) take it home and try and repair it option 1 involves 4 new modules(i) the wreck scanner  the wreck scanner is akin to a molecular sensor array that scans the wreck atom by atom to see whets in it. to activate you right click on it and select a bay much the same way as you would select ammo in a gun. once you click, it scans for 20 seconds then displays a page that looks like the one you get with the roid scanners but with 3 sections. (a) salvage  this bar shows the regular type salvage you can get from the wreck plus additional stuff the normal salvagers wont pick up (b) items  this shows around 75% of the cargo/modules the ship was carrying when it popped(c) usable hull fragments  parts of the hull that can be melted down into base minerals(ii) the super striper  akin to the salvager i in function but consisting of multiple robotic arms. this modules when activated cuts the ships into pieces in such a way as to extract as much regular salvage materials as possible , hence you would get both the regular amount plus the bonus amount shown in the wreck scanners scan. activated in a similar way as the wreck scanner it takes 5 minutes to fully break down the ship at which time the salvage is placed in the cargo hold of the barge.(iii) the locator- akin to the salvager i in function but consisting of multiple robotic arms, this particular module has been altered to seek out cargo and modules that are classified as destroyed due to damage. any module/items that appeared on the scan can be removed from the ship and placed in cargo; any modules removed this way are completely damaged and requires a full repair to use again, takes 5 minutes to complete its job(iiii) the cracker - akin to the salvager i in function but consisting of multiple robotic arms, this particular model simply extracts the still useable hull fragments from the wreck for melt down at a later time , takes 5 minutes to do the job."
4/30/2010,"option 2 take home repair simple put you have a mangled frame of a ship which can hopefully be fixed. this requires new skillsracial ship repair  a racial ship repair skill that allows you to fix bigger ships of that race, i.e. level 1 does frigates, level 5 allows capitals of the none super variety, factions ships such as the night mare are custom designs not covered by these skills, hence are not reparablesince you have little to work with your goal is to return that frame into a usable ship that said you will get the base model of the ship, a navy scorpion or widow wreck will give you a regular scorpion. when you attempt repairs you will get a total mineral cost and the time it will take, the time itself will be longer than the regular build period for said ship but will overall cost lest materials between 80-60% of a build from scratch."
4/30/2010,i just wish there was a little button on every wreck/can that puts all its contents into your cargo hold

4/30/2010,"don't think this would be needed.i have a high profit (but ridiculously low volume more for fun then profit)manufacturing / sales side venture that works because...i pick systems that are high through traffic systemsthat are far from trade hubs.so, systems that are little ""mini-hubs""so if you are not willing to go and buy something just for your own use.. buy 5-10 times what you need and resell the leftovers in your mission / pvp systemmost of my sales happen in systems close to low sec."
4/30/2010,"interesting idea, but i dont see how that can be implementedif i am the buyer, and i buy from you ""with shipping""i want my stuff delivered, and i want it guaranteed within xx hourswhat if the seler isnt online to deliver it? what if he just dosent want to deliver it, what happens thenit could be solved, similar to contracts... with some form of colateral, where the seller guarantees delivery or has to pay a large penalty to the buyer if the items are not deliveredbut with that it just makes it too complicated, and i'm shure with more thought more problems and/or exploits would pop up"
4/30/2010,"so you can't be bothered travelling for 30 mins to pick stuff up, but you can be bothered waiting days? o_o"
4/30/2010,want better lowsec? support this: outlaw
4/30/2010,"no.let's start with that ""it would revitalize low-security space"". low security space is fine; large parts of it (fw areas) are way over-populated for any purpose except pure pew pew. lowsec can't support 500 people per system, ok?and really, if you want to make a proposal you need to list what problem it fixes. as it is, i don't see any local-related problem with lowsec. my personal wishlist would involve adding another non-fw lowsec region or two (with low sec status)."
4/30/2010,"this thread again?though, this thread does have better ideas than the mass of ""no more local in null-sec derp derp derp"" threads. still, i fail to see why people don't like having local in low/null-sec? right now, having instant local in a system is perfectly balanced. everybody, pirate or not, knows everybody that is in the system. it seems like most people against having local in low/null-sec are people that aren't pirates and/or do not have sovereignty. do you not realize that things will be made better for pirates if you eliminate local? the pirates are typically the ones that have intel and control of the system where you're about to be killed. they are camping a gate or waiting at a planet. you jump in, their cloaked watchman knows who you are, what you're in, and where you go, and they meet you there. you have no idea that anybody is in the system. need to ship something through low-sec? use a scout that checks systems ahead, and use a combat escort, right? well what good is your scout when there's no local, and what are you supposed to do when the pirates that knew about you from 3 systems away are ready to give you an ass-raping?sorry. no, local doesn't make a whole lot of sense from an rp standpoint, but sane mechanics are far more important than that... this is a game. if being in line with rp is really that important to you people, new eve news:there's your rp. now stop complaining."
4/30/2010,pve'er with big ideas for breaking pvp.this has got to be a troll otherwise you are just totally clueless.
4/30/2010,"all your ideas are terrible. lowsec is not even dangerous 90% of the time, provided you don't fly through 'pipe between two trade hubs' systems. (amamake, rancer, etc). even amamake is uncamped 9/10 times these days. through less populated lowsec? you'd -probably- get through on autopilot. not worth the risk, but flying manually with a clue, you'll do just fine. the problem is the carebear mentality/doctrine. from day one (make a new alt and see for yourself, if you haven't ) any mention of going to lowsec in the rookie help/noobcorp chat is met with ""oh god you'll die!"" not ""maybe"" not ""if you mess up"" not ""if you fly a big ship""... just ""lowsec=death"". ""no fights on gates/stations"" means the only ships that will ever die will be 1) consensual pvp ships 2) mission boats and miners. haulers, freighters, etc. will be 100% safe, because they never have a reason to go anywhere other than gates and stations. how is this an advantage? it's way too easy as it is. when i was in an alliance, i was never once threatened by a gang, because i knew it was coming five jumps before they got to my system... i'd either pos'd up or docked/jump bridged to get a pvp ship by the time they arrived. and you want it to be.. easier?"
4/30/2010,"i access the forums from much more varied locations/machines than the game, so this would be beneficial."
4/30/2010,+1 got to make some use out of all the corpses in eve
4/30/2010,+1 got to make some use out of all the corpses in eve
4/30/2010,"so, basically, you have zero knowledge of pvp, haven't used several common classes of ships, have seen someone else moon mine but no reactions yourself. you've been to 0.0 and lowsec, but only to mission just like in highsec, never experiencing the difference between the regions. how do you expect then to provide meaningful insight in those areas? i have indeed when it was introduced. minmatar, don't remember what rank (2nd or 3rd one, not high). i however regularly kill fw people ( recent encounter with galente militia ["
4/30/2010,you have my votes
4/30/2010,"as to how i can pass judgement, two things:1) i'm not on the csm to represent my own agenda, i'm here to represent the players, and through take care, players of all playstyles participate and provide feedback. if a lowsec pvper wants me to raise an issue, and can explain his viewpoints and the importance of the issue, i'll raise it. people from all playstyles are part of take care, from which i have learned a lot. i can rely on them to fill up any gaps in my knowledge and often did this in preparation for issues raised by others. i fully admit i don't know everything, but as proven in the past, i will always do my darned best to learn as much as i can about issues. what counts more, mere personal experience and opinions, or the experience and opinions of dozens of others? that is what take care stands for, a platform where every player can be heard, share his viewpoints about issues, and have direct influence into the csm process.2) just because i don't find a certain part of the game fun, doesn't mean i don't know how to make it fun for others. some of you find missions boring, i find pvp utterly boring (i have actually tried it, flying with gangs as tackler and remote repairer). as game designer i often design games or game mechanics that i personally would never want to play. but the act of designing those mechanics is fun, and it is fun for others to play. insight can compensate for playing experience to a large degree."
4/30/2010,"it's not that you don't like it, it's... ""i do not enjoy it"" and ""i find it morally wrong"" are two entirely different things. one of them is a stance of neutral disinterest; for example, i don't like mining. i don't do it. i don't care if other people do. the other, and the one you've displayed, is a stance of contempt. you feel you are morally superior to those who do shoot other players, and seek to intentionally spite those who partake in pvp. evidence: this is, in essence, an attempt at griefing. the act itself (cloaking or escaping) is not. but, as evidenced by the bolded portions, you take pleasure in intentionally spiting people who do not play as you deem 'moral'. it's all about your intentions. whether or not it is successful, you admit to taking pleasure in making the game less fun for pvpers. you absolutely cannot spin that quote to mean anything else. you intentionally go out of your way to (passive aggressively) grief people who don't play like you, and then take enough pleasure in it to brag about it. now, that brings us to this point: how can you say you fairly represent the entire playerbase, given these facts? it's not a simple matter of you not being a pvper and, perhaps, lacking a bit of knowledge.. you have, flat out, said that you consider us pvpers immoral and that you take pleasure in frustrating us and denying us our enjoyment of the game. and you would like to call yourself a 'fair' representative of the entire eve community? face it. from a political standpoint, you've more or less said ""i think <population demographic> is inferior, immoral, and i take pride in making life difficult for them."" and you still don't understand why you've alienated the entire pvp playerbase? no one who thinks an entire portion of the eve population is immoral (and thus inferior) should be a representative. there is no reason to believe you will not attempt to damage the pvp aspects of the game, simply to spite those you disagree with. you haven't even made a half decent attempt to hide your intense bias. which brings us back to... apparently, the 'silent majority' is 'the glorious opinions of ankhesentapemkah'."
4/30/2010,do you still endorse defacing and vandalising other peoples property? in previous csms you were forced into admitting that you used your alts to bump your threads. are any of the people in this thread your alts?
4/30/2010,"trolls and people that quote out of context will not be replied to as they don't have any interest in what i have to say, but only want to twist my statements further.ponder this: if i was so opposed to pvp, then why was my ultima online freeshard, one which i had absolute and total control over to the tiniest detail, a full pvp server? as for alts, none of the people posting here are my alts. a lot of the trolls are undoubtedly someone else's alts though."
4/30/2010,"there was no context. ""i think shooting people is immoral"" was the only line. you said it. you have said it several times. you're, unfortunately, backed into a corner and unable to reconcile with your alienation of a good portion of eve. personal attacks, however, will not change that fact. if you honestly believe me to be incorrect, explain to me how ""i think shooting people is immoral"", and the bit about trying to grief pvpers, is false in context. tell me why i, a pvper, should trust you to represent me, despite the things you've said. my vote will be counted too, afterall. alternatively, you can call me a troll. again, a political standpoint: would a politician reaching out to a demographic try to tell them 'this is how i, if elected, will help you?' ..or would they say 'you all disagree with me, you must be idiots and trolls'. which one are you doing? you still don't get it, do you? you're so biased towards the ""no-pvp"" side that you don't even realize that you're telling off any potential voters who are not carebears, ie, anyone who disagrees with you. so, a simple request: explain to me, and everyone else you've called immoral, why we should feel that you will represent us? or, show some dignity, and at least admit that you do not intend to fairly represent any pvp player."
4/30/2010,"as a low sec pvper who has participated in suicide ganking i fully endorse this proposal, bounty hunting has long been a glaring omission from this game."
4/30/2010,"ank,you're running on a very impressive platform and seems like it's where i'd like to see the game head. i'll continue reviewing the rest of the candidates' platforms as well, but so far yours seems like it's headed in the 'right' direction. my own opinion, of course.also,some of you are taking this way out of context. my character, exlegion, happens to *never* initiate a shooting in-game. in other words, i role-play the ""good guy"", who also happens to think shooting others is immoral. yet, i also can manage to understand the importance of pvp. these trains of thoughts are not mutually exclusive."
4/30/2010,"i 'understand the importance' of the economy. does that qualify me to be minister for finance? no.anyway, ankh's statements and general attitude clearly demonstrate that this goes beyond some bit of roleplaying. similar to you, i won't shoot anyone but valid war targets on this character - but i have pirated on an alt. would ankh pirate on an alt i wonder?"
4/30/2010,"i didn't get the memo where campaigning for the csm was supposed to be rp even though we are running under our real names. this isn't an ic forum section so ""i"" will be assumed to refer to the player and not the character."
4/30/2010,"i can understand your point of view. and admittedly, i don't know much of any of the candidates running other than the platforms they present, as i have never taken an active interest in the csm process before. but i cannot dismiss ankh's platform based on whether she's ever pirated on an alt before or not, as i have never had an interest in playing a pirate either. *my truth* is i would very much like to see my style of play well-represented. with that said, i understand there needs to be balance between the different play styles.that is because there was no such memo sent out. and there was also no memo sent out excluding csm participation for having personal beliefs different from other players. you are free to not vote for her.if what she is representing isn't what you like by all means find a cadidate you feel will represent your interests. my point is you do not need to be a pirate to do good work as a csm in general. as you do not need to be a carebear to represent the interests of carebears. it certainly helps. but it does not need to be that way. at least, i don't believe so. in fact, find me a pirate candidate that understands the importance of my play style and i will heavily consider his/her candidacy as well."
4/30/2010,"that's the thing though. no one is calling ankh out just because she doesn't pvp. there is a big difference in not pvping and being very heavily against any pvp elements. for example, i don't like missions, so i don't do them. i do not, however, say that mission runners are inferior characters. i don't say they should have their characters deleted for running too many missions. i don't say they should be jailed. i don't say they're immoral, implying myself to be their superior by some sort of arbitrary e-bushido. ankh has done all of these things, and then simply denies them as if they havn't happened. she says they're out of context, but fails (and refuses) to provide context with which to justify them. basically, the platform seems to be 'vote for me, and get revenge on evil pirates through my support of changes that hurt pvpers.'. with, of course, lip service towards being fair and balanced. there is nothing fair and balanced about ""i am a carebear at heart"" and ""shooting people is immoral"". the former, by itself, is harmless. coupled with an accusation of immorality, and an idea about jailing/deleting 'criminals'... trying to play oneself as a candidate without an agenda is silly. just because the demographic you pander to prefers tax free one-man-corps doesn't mean they don't exist. it just means it's harder to point them out. it'd be like a pvp candidate saying that mission pockets should become 0.0, because they want carebear tears. absolutely inappropriate for a representative."
4/30/2010,"which was exactly my point because this is an ooc forum. however when the comment about morality of shooting another player's character in a spaceship game was raised you quickly defended ank using the roleplayer defence.having different personal beliefs is fine, but calling people trolls when they question areas of expertise which are polar opposite to those beliefs doesn't give a good impression (that isn't to say some people haven't been trolling - they are being well fed in the process).i agree it is possible to represent the views of players who have areas of interest outside your own, i have done so myself during my candidacy.however as i said it is perfectly valid for potential voters to call into question somebody's campaign platform and ask questions about areas they might not cover very well (giving them a chance to respond, bump the thread and show how well they deal with opposing views).you'll notice i haven't attacked ank or her platform, i have simply stated that this is an ooc forum and if somebody states ""i think x is morally reprehensible"" then that is seen as their opinion not that of the role played character."
4/30/2010,there's a difference between having no interest and being unwilling due to some misapplied moral context. she shows distaste for one of the most fundamental aspects of eve.
4/30/2010,"a few questions. 1) do you have any hard data on how profitable suicide ganking is, or the average loss for a gank ship? what about the average time it takes to find a target, and the chance loot drops, etc etc... basically, do you have any information as to how profitable ganking actually is? or is it all just rumors and third-hand info? 2) assume ganking is no different from any other profession, in terms of morals. do you feel it makes too much money for too little effort, counting the grind for security status and the hours spent seeking a viable target? if miners were making the same isk/hour as suicide gankers are now, would miners need a nerf? 3) in all honesty, can you say that your stance on crime is based on game balance, rather than your own personal moral code? 4) why should suicide ganking be more 'risky' than any other profession? mission runners rarely lose ships, miners rarely lose ships, and both generate huge pools of isk. why should one profession have a high chance of losing time and money, while most others operate without this? is it because someone is 'harmed' by the gankers? isn't that just arbitrary morals bleeding into game design, at that point? everyone says the risk should be high, but no one says -why- it should be high. why shouldn't someone who chooses piracy as a profession be allowed to profit from it just the same as a mission runner profits from his missions?"
4/30/2010,"i whole-heartedly agree with your post. and if in fact this is the case with ankh then it is a turn-off (for me), since i believe that, as much a carebear as i am, pvp is the flowing living blood of eve and without it it will simply die. i'll re-read some of her older posts to see where she stands on this."
4/30/2010,"that's the misconception. i'm not against pvp at all, quite the contrary. that's why i keep repeating, that my very own ultima online server was a full pvp server. that's why i proposed so many fw issues, that's why i contributed to a major 0.0 issue, and that's why i have been expressing myself heavily in favor for small gang warfare and lowsec improvements.as csm i'll approach the game from the perspective of a game designer, which is a neutral one. like i said, in my daily work i frequently design games i personally don't like, but there are plenty of people that do enjoy those games.i don't want to turn the game into a safe hello kitty online game, or a hand-held rollercoaster experience such as world of warcraft. i actually played both of those games for a while, and i didn't like either.don't worry, that's not something i said either. as already explained three times before. all i said that suicide ganking currently has no serious consequences, and that there should be more player-driven justice which enables the victim to get revenge and allows lawful characters to hunt down criminals. tradable killrights and bounty hunting have been proposed as solutions. read the suicide ganking issue documents. i clearly wrote in there that i dont want to make suicide ganking impossible through rulesets. this will only lead to more opportunities for pvp, not less."
4/30/2010,"you keep bringing up your uo shard, that's great and everything but this is not uo and you have consistently displayed an aversion to pvp in every shape and form despite claiming to be a champion of some pressing issues.how can you even talk about improving small gang/lowsec/0.0 warfare without ever having taken part in them? i am reminded of a parable. a young boy lives next to a lake and every day over the summer watches people swimming in it. one day he plunges into the water and promptly drowns. you may be well read on the subject but until you've actually done it and involved yourself in the processes you can't comment on it at all.approaching with the view of a game designer is great in some ways, but if you want to do that then apply for a game designer position. it's my firm belief that what makes the csm great is that the delegates aren't game designers and are able to approach problems and deal with them with a slightly different mindset. that's not to say that delegates aren't neutral but players have a different mindset to devs and i think this is where you fall flat on your face."
4/30/2010,the csm are supposed to represent the players. ccp provide the game designers. both of these quotes from you posted today though in reverse order. you blame previous csm failure on acting like game designers but then commit to acting as a game designer if elected?contradiction much?
4/30/2010,the above questions have already been answered several times and i don't feel like repeating myself for the fourth time.
4/30/2010,[citation needed]
4/30/2010,one two three four
4/30/2010,"you really have no idea what you're talking about.after being in eve for several years you still make the mistakes and missasumptions most new eve player tend to make.you fail to realize that the pvp mechanics and the harsh nature of the game are at the very heart of eve's game design and philosophy.you have not experienced how the ships are balanced against eachother, how certain ship types are weak or strong in certain roles and against certain other ship types, how the dynamics are in group battles, how they are in large scale fleet battles etc. maybe you<U+FFFD>ve read about these things but you have not experienced and experimented with it.you claim that you, being a game designer in rl, will be able to address issues consering pvp despite not liking it. this statement shows your naivite and inexperience. i<U+FFFD>ve seen your credentials. you not only claim to be a designer, you even say you<U+FFFD>re a programmer. i very much doubt that.in all honesty, you really are not helping here. you will probably be able to get enough votes because you have enough energy to mobilize the newer highsec dwelling community (an achievement in it's own right, i'll give you that). but your presence in the csm will only have an overall negative effect. both on how constructive disccusions will be and how serious ccp will be taking the csm."
4/30/2010,"excellent candidate, lovely person. i've always found that mynxee listens and gives full consideration to opinion that doesn't always match her own."
4/30/2010,you have my vote. good luck. i love following you're adventures in life in low sec. and you have me and a fellow miner making alts to start in on our own piracy. you are an inspiration to us all. you have my vote!
4/30/2010,bump!
4/30/2010,"you will get one of my votes, as you have ably, articulately and accurately represented my interests and viewpoints.my last vote for you was well spent."
4/30/2010,"ok that was 1 bil well spent, thanks, come again"
4/30/2010,"there seems to be a clear disparity between the csms . lets be honest  votes are certainly going to come in large blocks based on your alliance and faction supporters . but im talking about another difference between the csm candidates which id call, those willing to participate, and those that arent. active participation isnt as easy as it sounds, for it requires the ability to see which actions have what effects, which proposals are timely and worthy, and which, no matter their value, must be pruned. the other side of the coin isnt so easy to label, but no matter how virtuous the proponents of that method sound, they are nothing but useless in the long run. they like the sound of their own voice, the rhythm and cadence, and the csm vote gives them the opportunity to lecture a captive audience. see, thats really the pivotal point. do you want to elect someone so you can give them the opportunity to make a speech, give a lecture? a lecture is a static, immobile object. a real csm member should be willing to make concessions, spot good ideas, be flexible, join with other csms to push something through. i get the feeling that some of the other csm candidates are so blinded by their brilliance that they feel cooperation is a kind of failure. that kind of mentality is going to waste time and waste the position they sit in.much as most people wont like to hear it, mazzilliu is actually a conservative part of eve online. in the good sense. much as some people might not like to hear it. she is, and her people certainly are, playing the game as intended, in the spirit it was intended to be played. as a darwinian, small to mid sized game of pvp. so much of what they do is an essential basis for the theme and theory of the game. and those self same people have made every possible effort to preserve that integrity, and shape it, not to distort it into an image of another game, or an internal ideal of society. of course some csms want to fix the societal ills of eve  because its their life. they certainly have the crypto-fascist vote covered. but they want to remake the game, not keep it true to its spirit of freedom, nor to show much interest in your opinion. you should vote for mazzilliu because she is having fun. where the game is not fun, it bothers her."
4/30/2010,"yes, and chaos would reign on the battlefield, as you desperately tried to sort out friend from foe. unless, of course, we had ui addons that would let you organize the overview in new ways. in any case, my point is made - there are clearly game mechanic changes that would limit fleet sizes. i just picked one for the purposes of example; the fact that it has unintended consequences is irrelevant. actually implementing it in such a simple form would be be like using a running chainsaw to cut your fingernails.the art of game design lies in finding a more elegant solution that has fewer unintended consequences. instead of a chainsaw, something more refined -- a blunt axe, perhaps."
4/30/2010,"like with an ""alliance"" column on the fc's overview, and the calling of targets? and my point is also made - attempts to nerf large fleets are doomed to failure, because the game doesn't know what a large fleet is. the game only knows what you tell it your fleet is. if the game starts telling you to bring smaller fleets, you're going to start lying to the game. you're doomed to failure on this."
4/30/2010,bumping for someone that actually plays the game and ~cares~
4/30/2010,"elise as u know all great ideas, except fw which imo is totally flawed and needs to diaf 'til ccp cares to put some effort into it. you are defo one of the best pvp candidate running atm, preferring smaller scale where other candidates might see no issue in numbers always winning (scramblers preventing docking for instance is a ******ed idea that only promotes blobs and i'm honestly shocked it was even considered) so will ofc be throwing a vote your way."
4/30/2010,"as a serious post, i think cat would be an incredibly important balancing figure on the csm 5 team. while his forum persona is admittedly zany, he is quite intelligent and knowledgeable of the issues. if there is truly a single candidate who can claim to be ""unbiased"", cat can.his platform is a more general one, which i feel would be an important balance to the narrow-minded zeal other candidates display. cat would be an important figure in giving the meeting perspective, allowing the team to get away from the nitty-gritty and focusing on getting the players' wishes across. while some would focus on pvp, others on industry, and others on yet some obscure thing that favors their demographic (read: 0.0 alliances or super-carebears), he would be looking out for the community as a whole.contrary to what many people say, cat is not a joke candidate. he seriously cares about the community, and the game in its entirety. i think that there should at least be one member of the csm who wants to focus on eve's true strength: it's playerbase and awesome sense of community. the entire point of the csm is to bring the community close to the developers, a point i think many prospective candidates have forgotten.in summary: a vote for cat is not a vote wasted. i think he is an ideal candidate for the average player who, more than anything specific, wishes to see greater ccp involvement with the players, and for improving the game for everyone, not just those who have armies of special interest groups behind them.best of luck on the campaign trail, cat."
4/30/2010,no one else expects private convo's for campaign information.
4/30/2010,"bah, you don't even have the guts to campaign with your main. yet another reason not to vote bad and vote for the alt known as cat. oh, and i recall last time, you where putting some important clues on your website explaining why we should vote for you. as i remember the election went and that page never got updated.and lookie what we have now here:i challenge you to put something worthwhile to read there, before may the 5th.somehow i doubt you have anything interesting to put there or even anything csm worthy to put up there, but, i've been wrong before.surprise me."
4/30/2010,"good highsec mission runner earns about 30-40m isk/h. it's not as much as sanctums in nullsec offer, but there is almost none risk involved in highsec mission running. yes, sometimes suicide ganks happen, but that's all. i wouldn't call this a serious threat to a mission running. on other side, nullsec ratters/explorers/mission runners need constantly check local, scan for probes from time to time and be ready to gtfo, when something unexpected happens.i believe in risk vs reward concept. only endeavours, which are risky, should bring profit to opportunists. if something isn't dangerous and has no risk whatsoever, but brings good amount of money, then it is broken and needs fixing."
4/30/2010,"i like your platform. the only thing i'm not completely sold on is completely removing insurance, but i don't hate that idea either. on the other hand, i completely agree about high-sec (and i've spent most of my career in high-sec) and the teen rating.i like how your platform is based on a coherent philosophy instead of just ""boost my playstyle of choice!"".i haven't decided yet, but you're up there on my candidates i'm considering voting for."
4/30/2010,"even without a campaign centurax will be an amazing csm. no not saying that because he is in my alliance. i can say that because he is in my alliance and i know him. he listens, understands, and can make rational decisions about anything. not just about eve either. he is a good leader and has a skill at being a excellent subordinate. i truly believe he does not wish to be a csm to push any agenda for one group or another. but just to make eve a better place for the players and pilots that have so much fun at playing it. he is truly a well rounded person and pilot. and has my fullest support on the upcoming elections. vote for centurax!"
4/30/2010,"my major concerns are in line with maxsim goratiev's, that these proposals are just too far out of reach for this coming csm, or they have gross balance issues.i do feel that poss are long overdue for improvements, but i feel that for the most part your proposed ideas to fix it are over the top.you should set reasonable goals, and include what you don't think you could pull off this csm as long term goals. having lofty goals is good, but i think you should clarify what you are going to really try for. there is far too much to do on your current list. personally, your platform would be much easier to vote for without any mention of how to balance it, and leaving that up to debate.good luck!"
4/30/2010,"i hope people making accusations at goons once again having 3 candidates running are going to throw those same accusations at it alliance (3 candidates), systematic-chaos (3 candidates) and morsus mihi (2 candidates) as well.helen was a very active member of csm4 and even voted against the other goon delegates on some issues"
4/30/2010,"hello, i have to say that i'm very impressed with your reasoned and practical presentation; that sort of approach is something that influences me a great deal. i do have a question for you though.an idea that's been pitched around some is that of transferable kill rights, generally tied into the idea of fixing the bounty system to create a viable player profession as a bounty hunter. i know it's controversial, but to me it seems like an interesting way to increase the pvp opportunities in low/hi-sec. i'll admit to being fairly new to eve and maybe not understanding the complexities of the issue; i may be operating from nostalgia from the days of being a bounty hunter in swg.what do you think about a revamp of the kill rights or bounty system? and with your experience on the csm, do you feel that this would be a change that the csm could successfully advocate for or is it beyond the scope of reasonable issues?thanks in advance for your feedback!"
4/30/2010,"i'm in favour of player driven content so an overhaul to the bounty system would fit in with that.lets look at kill rights. you are awarded the right to kill the ship of a player (not his pod) if the following conditions are met (from the eve wiki)somebody destroys your ship (though bizarrely pod kills are not counted)you were not at war with them, criminally flagged or otherwise a valid targetyou have taken no action to defend yourself.these rules apply in both empire and lowsec but not in 0.0 (which is to be expected).firstly i wonder what the reason is for not including pods in this (other than the fact that a pod can never aggress so rights would always be granted). secondly if you want to be granted a kill right you have to sit there and do nothing thus giving a kill away for free.it would be interesting if kill rights were granted even if you (unsuccessfully) attempted to defend yourself but without more investigation and discussion i'm not sure if that would unbalance things. the concern is that pvp in lowsec (for example) frequently ends up in a stalemate when nobody wants to shoot first (because they will get the 15 min criminal flagging, sec loss and sentry fire). add getting kill rights against you to that list and lowsec pvp becomes even worse (unless ""flashy"" pirates are involved because they don't care about sec hits and killrights ). lowsec needs buffs not nerfs!assuming you have a kill right, what about a better bounty system. you currently get paid the bounty for pod killing the player, but the usual engagement rules apply so it is totally possibly to get yourself flagged and have concord come to visit when trying to collect the bounty (this depends on the target's sec status). of course as soon as the bounty becomes significantly large enough to justify sec hits etc to try and kill the player then that player will easily get an alt to pod them and collect their own bounty! large bounties end up as bragging rights rather than an incentive to hunt a target.so what can we do here?we have a contract system so how about adding assassination contracts? this would allow a player to take out a contract on another player and assign a bounty/reward. they could also have the option to assign a kill right (if one exists). if not a new contract type then some way to create a ""dossier"" object which contains all the information for the ""hit"" and can be contracted via the item exchange or auction system. auctions could be fun if people really wanted the kill rights on a player (possibly bidding more than the reward!). it would also be amusing if the target bought their own killrights back .to control griefing there may need to be some limits on how many contracts a month against the same player or maybe restrict it so you can only take out a contract when you have a killright against them.would csm be able to get systems like this implemented? i can't promise it but i would be happy to discuss and raise something. however if incarna is supposed to open up shady ""off the network"" dealings then it might fit right in!"
4/30/2010,"first: thank you for your answer. it is clear to me that you take the time to think about what to write and do not just give a political answer, but a thought-through and in-dept answer. this is how i like it.grinding structures unopposed or nearly so is nearly as boring as grinding standing in my opinion, but if it serves a purpose (such as the restructuring of providence) it is tolerable for a while. but i can clearly see why a smaller alliance would find settling in 0.0 hard under the current sov system.now my follow-up: do you have any ideas that might make it easier for smallish alliances - such as agony fx. - to take and maintain sov?"
4/30/2010,"i disagree with that pov. it's like in it if the software doesn't do its job (proper resource handling/usage), throw more hardware at it. you don't cure the cause that way, only the symptom. or at a music gig: turn up the volume of one instrument instead of turning down the rest: you'll end up either with a giant feedback or messy sound that way.there's of course always the exception to that rule, but it should be an exception: if you can't hear the guitar at all right from the start, put it's volume on par with the rest of the band.that said, i have no issues with your candidacy at all. i personally just feel you tackle this issue from the wrong side. good luck to you (and most of the other candidates)."
4/30/2010,"i did qualify that statement with ""where possible"" of course there will always be specific examples such as the types you list.but i think balance in eve is more like your counter argument (everything else is too quiet) than the main one (one thing is too loud). in general there are ship classes where one or two ships are fine but the others are not. in your it example if the cause is known to be a weakness in one area of code then by removing that weakness you can get it to use the resources more effectively.specific eve example: the thrasher is acknowledged to be the best destroyer for pvp whilst the others have various issues with fittings, slots etc. do you upgrade the other destroyers to better match the thrasher's capabilities (maintaining some racial differences of course) or do you simply nerf the thrasher?again it is situational as it depends on the changes but as a general principle (and where possible) i prefer things to become better not worse"

4/30/2010,"you have a good approach to this, not made my mind up who to vote for yet but do have a couple of questions.-> if ccp agreed to provide dev time to fix three things how would you prioritize from your list of issues?-> do you have an interest in pushing the issues of fleet warfare, rockets or 4th af bonus?"
4/30/2010,"thank you, i hope to earn your support by merit of my potential to represent the players.i wouldn't prioritize them by what i think are the most important, that's for sure, because how does that actually represent the players who i'm trying to help? that's been problematic with past csms also, that they push ideas that they've been thinking about, items for their own personal game improvement, or to push their alliance's agenda.i think to decide which 3 would be most prioritized, i would run a set of polls or opinion searches, both on my own website, and via other media that i'm employing to connect with players atm. i'd take the results of that and see what ""little things"" the players would like to see accomplished most.however, one extra point that i would like to illustrate: my sister and i used to get $100 to buy a pair of shoes. whereas she would buy (1) pair of new-model $100 shoes that were really cool but she only wore a couple of times then they were out-of-style, i bought (3) pairs of last-model $30 shoes that were on sale, and had $10 leftover for extra laces or whatever. now i had way more shoes to wear for different purposes, and actually wore my shoes out less quickly. i got more use out of my $100.this translates into the same way the csm works. they're essentially given a ""budget of willingness"" from ccp. while (3) things like you suggest might be considerable for larger suggestions that csms/players have, it's paltry when it comes to implementing little things. they could use that same development time to implement (10-20+) little things. the truth is, if you give them (3) big things, ccp might maybe implement one, but probably not as we've seen result from past csms in all honesty. however, if given (10-20) little things, they could probably get almost all of them done, with time to spare. utilize the opportunity/resource you have effectively.absolutely. balance is definitely important in my opinion, and i'm working on compiling a separate list of balance issues that could be addressed relatively painlessly. rockets and afs are pretty much the top of the list, as well as drone functionality, but also on the list: huginn & destroyers. my list of ideas grows daily as i work hard to network with players in game, and ask them what they would like to see fixed. just about everyone i talk to has something they'd like to see improved, and most of their ideas are relatively simple. i encourage you to visit my website to see what little things i'm supporting. i keep track of all assembly hall threads i support on my forum, as well as have discussion with players about ideas they would like to see."

4/30/2010,"i confirm the tools ease the formatting of the minutes a great deal. i'm not sure about the 3-4 times less effort part (maybe i'm just too slow at editing ) but then again if not for meissa kindly passing the tools to me i would have had to spend many hours writing something from scratch.it is true that alternates are not required to show up to meetings. being first and second alternates helen and t'amber turned up to almost every meeting and whilst they were unable to vote some of the time they certainly got their say on the issues anyway.because i have the figures to hand, these are the meetings where a full quorum was not met.meeting 32 items had only 7 votesmeeting 41 item had 8 votesmeeting 56 items had only 7 votersmeeting 7 meissa was present for this8 items had 8 votersmeeting 81 item had 8 voters (due to dc)this shows there were many times when any of the other alternates could have participated in votes but were unavailable."
4/30/2010,"hi, is interesting your ideas for low sec and all what about adding new station components that can only go into low sec?also what ideas do you have to improve the market, atm it seems that is very linear and is populated by the 0.01 isk spammers."
4/30/2010,"i have lived in low sec for most of my time in eve until recent travels as a merc which take me all over the place. it is my favorite place to be but i agree with issler that low sec is underused to a great extent... or more accurately, is occupied and used primarily for a very narrow range of activities. there are also some stretches of low sec that are essentially unoccupied most of the time. it would be nice to see some content changes that would drive more folks to those empty systems. maybe distribution of goodies for planetary interaction will affect that. but as ive said before, i favor new content that is strongly tied to the outlaw nature of low sec. i'm not at all keen on ideas that seek to make it the next carebear paradise."
4/30/2010,"when i just started to play eve, i dremt to be a pirate. things went differently, but despite this, i still like lowsec and the general idea of pirates. as everyone can see in my csm topic, the boost of lowsec is one of the subjects i care about. i would like lowsec to be unique. i would like it to be more populated. i would like to see the possibility for outlaws to earn money and still keep their outlaw status. so if you will vote me, you can be sure that i'll advocate those things and we will hopefully see there more targets to blow up."
4/30/2010,"i guess the question would be then, is there any way to give miners/industrialists a reasonable chance in low sec?heh. they could always allow people to anchor guns, or maybe even cover entire belts with a pos. turn the belts into a land grab (yay something worth fighting over) and miners could survive an attack."
4/30/2010,"i think making low sec interesting to miners and industrialists is key to making low sec active again. there needs to be rewards to industrialists that make it worth their while to face the folks that would blow them up if they can. there was a time when the ore in low sec made it worth the risk. no longer the case. so the solution might not be some super complicate new game mechanism, maybe just an ore rebalance. i definitely think getting low sec fixed is my number one issue.issler dainze"
4/30/2010,"in order to increase the number of predators, you need to increase the number of prey...probably the easiest single improvement for lowsec is increasing the number of 0.0 entrances. it would result in more through traffic and more overall activity in lowsec- but this change only really helps 0.0ers and lowsec pirates, it doesn't much help lowsec carebears.i think that introducing abc ores to lowsec is a reasonable change to make. you increase the income of lowsec mining to match 0.0, and with the increased risk comes the fact that logistics is much easier. i think that there needs to be more study about the impact of this change, but if it were introduced(even on a limited basis with a small amount of ore per belt), it would be a boon to newbies trying to get a leg up, as well as the pirates that hunt them.i think that solutions should be focused on re balancing rather than new feature requests, just so it's more likely that ccp implements it and does so quickly. i think that fixing lowsec can be done with relatively simple changes such as ore and rat re balancing."

4/30/2010,"correct me if i'm wrong, but doesn't applying for the csm require a character/account relatively free of warnings/bans? if this still the case, then why was darius accepted as a candidate at all, given that he can't even post his own plug thread?/ben"
4/30/2010,"your forum account and your eve account have two separate restriction structures. i'm assuming this has much to do with the relative looseness with which forum bans are applied. in any case the standing of your forum account has no impact whatsoever on your standing as a csm candidate. darius's in-game account has never been actioned against. darius was actually banned from the forums for a time during his first stint in the csm.i think the problem lies more with the ridiculous applications of the rules by the moderation team. darius's forum bans have been applied for rather silly things and unfortunately the forum ""rules"" in place mean that each one scales up. the latest 6 month ban was for a single posting of the phrase ""solodrakban"" in a thread celebrating the creation of the alliance. certainly not a contributing post, but also certainly not worthy of a 6 month ban."
4/30/2010,"do you have any ideas on how to fix lowsec, and i hear a lot of people screaming gallente (and amarr) are broke (surprise surprise), what's your opinion on the status of balance between all the factions."
4/30/2010,"dj - ""this is an interesting two part question. i'm usually loathe to put myself in a game designer position. a little known fact about the csm that many still don't seem to grasp (including those running for csm) is that you are not a game designer. you are an advocate for players in a representative democracy. thankfully lowsec has been an issue for some time and there are quite a few ideas for me to borrow from.an idea i've always found extremely attractive insofar as lowsec is concerned was presented as a quick idea at eve vegas last year by the mittani. at a high level what he presented, which is something i agree with implicitly, is that something needs to be done to make lowsec unique and not just in ruleset. he proposed a giant drug production capability culminating in the creation of a capital class ship termed ""the methnaught"". while taken as a whole this may sound someone fanciful, the core concept, and one i believe we can achieve buy-in for will revolve around the creation of some aspect of gameplay unique to lowsec that gives it an additional reason for being. one such idea is that of the methnaught but i would go so far as to combine some additional ideas. one is an idea that went through csm 1 which was presented by ankh, related to a different class of deployables. not so much pos, though they could be used with unique modules, but smaller deployables for smaller groups of people to use for a specific purpose. i also have a problem with the fact that there's rarely a financial advantage to killing a pos in lowsec. i'd like to see some more variety in structures and perhaps something similar to the salvaging concept. the ability to gain some form of salvage or revenue from a structure when you destroy it serves a multitude of purposes not the least of which is garbage cleanup. i believe this would also serve to shake things up in lowsec as it gives people a reason other than ""i don't like those guys"" to start and engage in protracted struggle.the main aspect of attracting people to perform in any area of space in my opinion is incentivization and i believe the above, taken in part with what i'm sure will be many other good ideas to be discussed, will go a long way in spicing things up in lowsec.as regards your balance question i have to say that specific balance issues have tended to not get much leverage within the csm. what we can do is state that we believe there's not parity and ask the balance team to look long and hard at the issue and justify their response. that's the route i'd take. i fly every race and i use them all for different things but i won't profess to be the be all and end all in knowledge. i'd probably go the route of opening a thread for balance changes and let the matter percolate among the masses, creating a checklist, then asking ccp to respond to the items as noted."":edit: to add to the above, i believe lowsec should serve as a different ground for smaller groups to grow and profit without the need for the gigantic numbers required to engage in sov warfare. a niche needs to be carved out there and i believe all that's missing is the tools for the players to do so."

4/30/2010,"word of advice - ccp owns the game. the csm gets the right to yell occasionally. ccp takes that yelling seriously, but it's not exactly going to move heaven and earth. unless csm members commit to a hostile takeover of the company(irl, spending tens of millions on the stock market, and all that fun stuff), they're going to continue to be an advisory body. any candidate who promises to wield the kind of power you ask for is either clueless about the position or a simple liar."
4/30/2010,"this. touche, herschel. why people think the csm are empowered to this degree is something i don't understand, after all the discussion that has gone on in this forum about the csm's role."
4/30/2010,"i tend toward herschel's comment that csm is a voice (strong or weak you decide) to ccp on behalf of the players. any candidate who makes sweeping claims of ccp pwnge, or ""i'll fix the lag, i'll fix the forums and get your petitions answered in 30sec max!"" obviously doesn't truly understand the position they're running for. at the end of the day, csm doesn't own the company, but now have been given a little more power with which to improve your eve experience.that said, you are indeed absolutely correct, and represent a large section of players, when you say that past csms have been less than effective, and are considered by many as a joke or meaningless.i encourage you to read my comments here, where i discuss this specific issue in depth, and further, explain why i deserve your vote for the best hope at accomplishing something:"
4/30/2010,"this is one of my main focus points.the problem basically is, that the csm mostly approached issues from a game design perspective. ccps devs may have been convinced by our presentation and discussions, but those devs aren't actually making the calls. that's why they always say ""yeah this will go into the backlog"", and the issues never being worked on.back when i was on the csm, in csm1 and csm2, i didn't have intimite knowledge about scrum yet. but now that i have, i have looked back and know why we failed. it is the product owner who decides what is taken from the backlog, and worked on during a sprint. most of these product owners were not present during csm-ccp meetings, and if they were, they often hid in a corner and waited for it to be over. why? because product owners are looking at issues from a business perspective, and we approached it from a design perspective. the csm almost never marketed their issues in a business way to appeal to these product owners.the problem is, that we have to convince two entities. the dev team, to get the issue approved (does this issue make sense, what is the best way to implement this?), and the product owners (does this issue make money?). during our iceland presentations, we must focus much more on the marketing perspective to convince the product owners of the necessity to assign people and implement an issue, instead of working on more shiny expansion content."
4/30/2010,"+1 to ankh and cinori.to the other csm candidates, please remember that you represent 300,000 paying accounts worth roughly <U+FFFD>4.5 million per month. according to the wiki this is what the csm have achieved and most of the issues from scm 3 are still"
4/30/2010,"firstly whilst i would love to represent the 300k paying accounts, in reality for csm4 only 21,158 accounts voted (and of those only 12,996 voted for the top 14 who made up the final council of 9 delegates and 5 alternates).secondly there is always going to be a delay between csm requesting something and it being put into game. even a ""simple"" change to tweak a couple of numbers in the database has to go through game design for balancing and then to qa etc. anything involving programming changes can take months of development time and that is only once it has been scheduled in the first place.do i like having to wait? of course not. will jumping up and down and shouting at ccp employees get it done any faster? not a chance. being professional, providing research and putting together a decent case will get items looked at faster.this is why anyone running on a campaign of ""i promise to get x fixed"" is either clueless on what the csm can do or are just flat out lying to get your votes.ccp do listen to the csm and they get real value out of the process (at least that is what they tell us ). but ccp have their own development priorities and whilst the csm will have more influence as a stakeholder we still will not have a guaranteed development resource. the stakeholder offer puts the csm at the same level as internal ccp departments and even they cannot get guaranteed development time each release cycle.the csm process is evolving. csm4 got a significant commitment from ccp which is a step in the right direction. but what is really needed is for more of the players to participate in the csm process (voting for candidates such as myself who take the role seriously), raising issues in the assembly hall and supporting those issues.i understand the frustration when there still isn't a tangible list of things that the csm got ccp to implement on behalf of the players and the list of things to fix grows by the day..."
4/30/2010,"^^ thisall csm candidates have some personal reason to want to be on the council (some issue they want to push, some perceived prestige from being on the council, whatever). but a failing seems to be that they are approaching the csm from their own point of view. reality is that, to be effective, you have to think of the csm as exactly what it is: 50% pr for ccp as a ""we're listening"" venue and 50% ""hey - they want this - it might help"" thing. as such, to move anything successfully through csm to ccp and to get it implemented requires you provide a benefit analysis to ccp of why any proposal will help them. not the individual pilot. i know it sounds bad. but it is realistic.like any other real-world business meeting, if you don't effectively explain how your proposal is going to help the person you are ""pitching"" then you are just burning your time. and theirs. and burn enough of their time, and soon they won't be listening at all. even to the best idea ever.it isn't about bullying ccp. fact is they hold the cards. that approach doesnt work. i've been in enough real life board meetings to know that it is about 1) having an issue 2) figuring out why they should want it 3) pitching it effectively . . . 5) profit!if elected to this next csm, that is the approach i intend on bringing to the table. on issues you care about (and  btw  i do read the ideas in the assembly hall, the complaints about hack x in crime and punishment, and will listen to what you have to say in-game via chat or mail). and i will get it done!"
4/30/2010,"yes.although i haven't posted my agenda anywhere specific atm due to me waiting to release my social experiment (which is really getting me itchy), the gui and gfx is a large part of of my agenda (like last time), which includes but not limited to: the font, gui upgrades, existing menu and icon enhancements and relocations, multiscreen support and functions, client optimisation and controls (including antialiasing, anisotropic filtering, verticle refresh), legacy effects, particles... blah blah blah.i _really_ want to post my agenda on my forum page and website, but my social experiment will work better if i havent when its released. feel free to convo me ingame though if you want the lo down x)-t'amber"

4/30/2010,"i am not asking for more grafics, i am asking for antialising so that i can see the graphics we already have in game properly. if you take your care, you will see that every single eve trailer has antialiasing. that probably means that ccp has solved this internally. however the current game release not only does not have the anti aliasing option, but is incompatible with vast majority of drivers and programs that force it. it should be a rather minor change, as it does not involve designing anything new. please clarify where does it state that csm can only represent concerns regarding game balance?"
4/30/2010,"i had to search google to see what anti aliasing even was first. but from what i can tell, so long as you can get a csm member to pick up the issue it would be pretty simple to pass along to ccp and get it implemented. from what i picked up in iceland last time around, there shouldn't be any big barriers to getting this passed. i know if i get elected i'd raise this issue, or at least vote yes if someone else got to raise it first."
4/30/2010,"aa has already been raised before as a csm issue and shot down for technical reasons. it could be revisited with the rest of your issues but hard technical stops tend to be just that. all the csms in the world won't get around a technical ""no""."

4/30/2010,"darius johnson - ""i'd love to be able to pander to you here like some people and say that i flat-out disagree with everything ankh says, but that would be stupid and false. the quote above is one i find both hilarious and ignorant in many ways. i mean... if that's your opinion you're clearly playing the wrong game. don't try to make eve what you want it to be, that's not your job. the job should be extending what's there and improving it, not turning it into some other game you want to play. the reality is though that i've agreed with proposals of hers in the past such as the one from csm1 regarding additional deployable structures. really at the end of the day while you do have beliefs you'll stick to in the csm, taking a hard line against an individual just to be a jerk isn't going to get much done. taking a hard line against ridiculous ideas such as the one quoted above though should be a no brainer."""
4/30/2010,"a comprehensive response would be far to long to post here. the short version is the the cure needs to be better then the disease and any real fixes would lead to other greater issues.boring is your opinion. some people enjoy it, strange but true. some people like to log in and grind though a few missions just to relax. i have done that myself before.making pve more like pvp is always a good thing but is rarely possible. having the ability to defend yourself form a pvp perspective while doing pve is great but it never works. you give your pve to be gimpped at pvp. sleeper ai is no answer here, it can be manipulated easily enough and puts greater restrictions on what kind if setup's and ships you can use. fewer but tougher npc's is a goal ccp has, you get less server load that way.(i use to run missions in dodixie in a pvp fit ship just waiting for loot ninja's so show. i would shoot them and they would come back and then i'd kill their pirate ship. ninja spawn rate is about 1 every 10 hours of missioning so was less then fun with the waiting part... lots of fun with the killing part though. )your last point here at missions being a mindless grind is true. as i said some people like it that way. if someone wants to think while playing eve then they will go elsewhere. anyone who bothers to think about making isk in eve see that you can make more isk with less effort doing many other things. missions are there for the people that need isk and don't want to think.i have a mission running alt that does missions semi-afk in a domi. i have to admit that it can be too easy sometimes. even so there is a price to pay for doing it. slow completion times means less isk. i do disagree with your evaluation of risk/reward. there are many other activities that produce better results then running missions with little risk. i always see missions as a baseline of the minimum isk value for my time.missions are a sticky problem and there are no good fixes for them. tyranis does bring a much needed change, the removal of meta 1 tech 0 loot from npc drops. this will benefit the game as a whole. after the patch we can see how much the dynamics change and see what the next step could be."
4/30/2010,"that is where i run missions when i can muster the patience for it. i have 10.0 standings with that agent--check my standings in-game if you don't believe me. i've only had ninjas show up in my missions a few times--i'd say less than ten. it's not that bad. i honestly don't mind ninja salvagers anyway--i've done it myself. i'm usually too lazy to spend 30 minutes salvaging after spending 30-60 minutes doing the mission anyway. also, as i said earlier, salvage is not a part of missions per se--it's just a possible side source of income.you left out the important part--""with virtually no risk""."
4/30/2010,this is the issue that is discussed in my csm thread. you can check it and see if you agree with my position.
4/30/2010,"i happen to like doing missions, but i also agree that missions do need to be looked at.mission ai needs to be looked at most of all, not simply by adding similar ai to that used by the sleepers, to the npcs attacking you that needs to be done at least on lv4 missions, but that won't solve the problem entirely. the improved combat would be better but the mission will still be predictable. like most mission runners i use mission guides to get trough missions, to save time and the absolute scripting of the missions makes this possible there are rarely any surprises. better ai on how the mission spawns the npcs so the better your skills or standing the harder the mission will be or some days the npcs just won't try as hard to kill you is something that would make the missions less predictable.more dynamic missions would be better, so missions like worlds collide which gives multiple paths to the end of the mission are always more interesting to. that is something i would like to see at least with any new missions that may be added.mission loot is probably another area that needs to be looked at, perhaps dropping less or no meta level 1 - 3 items and maybe just having say one or 2 meta lv4 item drop from the better npc's at the end of the mission, and on rare occasions a faction mod could drop. this would probably put more value t1 items on the market as they would no longer be dropped and the meta 2 and 3 items would most likely be sourced from belt rats.selecting a mission could be changed allowing a pilot more choice and help them get the missions they like to do. most agents will currently provide 2 or 3 types of mission, being able to chose which one of those types of mission you get would be helpful, for when you have time to just fit in a courier mission and you end up worlds collide, it is usually a choice of turn it down, leave it for next time or go find another agent. it would be good to have just a few more options to help the risk reward element, so you can choose to do a combat, courier or mining mission for example, then you can choose if you want it in high or low sec, that could influence the pay out as there is more risk in low sec you get a better reward. this way you always get the type of mission you want to do and where you want to do it.competition in missions, if you have ever run a cosmos agent there is an element of completion there as probably 5 or 6 people will be doing the same mission in the same plex going after the same tags. having said there could be a new types of missions added that have you compete against several other players to compete for a better mission or a good reward by having to do a set of missions and whoever gets to the end gets the reward everyone else gets nothing. kind of like bidding for a contract you have prove you are up to the task and then the winner gets the contract."
4/30/2010,"missions do need desperately to be reworked.anyone who has grinded them enough knows after a while that ""okay - mission x. aggress group 1 first, then blow past group 2, oh yeah - the gate is unlocked without touching group 3 . . . "" and so on.more randomization of npc aggression and the staging points of npcs on warp-in is needed within missions to keep them fresh and exciting.i do like the idea of implementing the ai that the sleepers use, but if you do that, i would be for upping the rewards to match the new risks (and for any of you who have not gone up against sleepers yet . . . oh boy! they can be tough)the last bit (and i know i'm going to get flamed on this one): nothing more frustrating then killing that npc that drops mission item y only to watch some random pilot fly in and pick it up (at which point you have to 1) try to get it back from him or her 2) start looking on contracts for a similar mission item or 3) consider dropping the mission). i would suggest putting in a mechanic where the item is locked to all save the person who accepted the mission."
4/30/2010,"level 4 missions could use sleepers ai, but they don't need the rewards to be upped. at least not the highsec ones.and i'm against such change. you are playing not the single player game. i would like things like this to happen more often. players should compete with each other or find a way to work together. if you can't kill the thief, then you can pay for item he stole. anyway, it just makes the game more interesting."
4/30/2010,"agreed. but some of the best level ivs and all level vs aren't in highsec. those could use some improvement of the risk / reward equation.depends. lots of people play this game for different reasons. some start playing it as a single-player game, and some of those later find their way into the multi-player aspects of the game.would go so far as to suggest level 1 & 2 missions have the ""lock"" and levels 3 and above no. it would give newer players a slightly happier introduction to the game. as they progress, the lack of any such ""lock"" would offer them a taste of some of the other possibilities of game-play. (also at a point where they know a little more about game mechanics and are a littel better able to defend themselves against seasoned players who may just like ganking newbies)."
4/30/2010,"imo, what makes eve great is that other people can infringe upon someone's ""single-player"" game. in other words, no one is sheltered like in most mmos where you get to choose exactly how much you want to interact with the other players.if you want to pretend it's a single-player game and try to ignore everyone else, fine, but the game mechanics shouldn't shelter you from the rest of the universe."
4/30/2010,"i think that the best way to introduce a random element in missions is to allow other players to influence the result. this assembly hall proposal is a more detailed description of my idea, but it is basically: create missions where you compete against or cooperate with other randomly matched players, and the variability in interacting with someone else will in itself ensure that every single mission is different."
4/30/2010,"in regards to mission ai, how about one that didn't just make it harder, just harder to win at. what if the ai knew when they were overclassed and started to warp out? this would force pve players to learn to fit ships closer to pvp as they would (at the very least) need to have warp disruption happening.afk missioning would be next to impossible to be successful at as at a critical point all the targets would turn tail and run.m"
